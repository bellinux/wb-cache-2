5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium <b>is</b> <b>element</b> 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it would probably be the most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
2500|$|IUPAC has {{established}} international standards for naming elements. The first scientist or laboratory to isolate an element {{has the right}} to propose a name; after a review process, a final decision is made by the IUPAC Council. In keeping with tradition, names can be based on a mythological concept or character, astronomical object, mineral, place, property of the element or scientist. For those elements that have not yet been [...] "discovered", IUPAC {{has established}} a systematic name system. The names combine syllables that represent the digits of the atomic number, followed by [...] "-ium". For example, [...] "unununium" [...] <b>is</b> <b>element</b> 111 ("un" [...] being the syllable for 1). However, once the element has been found, the systematic name is replaced by a trivial one, in this case roentgenium.|$|E

In many applied disciplines like computer science, coding theory, sequential machines and formal languages, the use of fuzzified algebraic structures especially ordered semigroups play a remarkable role. A theory of fuzzy sets in terms of fuzzy points on ordered semigroups can be developed.
