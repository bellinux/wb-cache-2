The analogous conclusions resulted from an analysis of the relative positions of selected types of regions in the overall allocation of capital expenditure, because the metropolitan regions, national parks and protected landscape areas obtained relatively higher <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> support and, vice versa, the structurally and environmentally affected regions obtained lower <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> support.

Undergraduate female students were screened by BDI, and divided into two (high-depressive and low-depressive) groups. The measures were response ratio and response latency. The results of this experiment were as follows: 1) In the recognition of happy and angry faces, depressive subjects {{did not differ from}} non-depressive-subjects, and could recognize accurately expression on female faces in proportion to the <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> expression, and judged subtly expressive male faces as happy or angry. 2) In the recognition of sad faces, depressive subjects could recognize accurately expression on female faces in proportion to the <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> expression, but judged subtle expressive male faces as sad much more than non-depressive subjects. 3) Irrespective of depressive tendency, female subjects recognized accurately expression on female faces in proportion to the <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> expression, but judged subtly expressive male faces as happy，angry or sad. The result suggests that depressive subjects in non-clinical group do not show significant evidence of attentional biases for facial stimuli displaying different <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> expression. 本研究では、怒り、喜び、悲しみの顔刺激の表出強度を数段階にした写真刺激を用いて、非臨床群をBDIによりスクリーニングし、高うつ群と低うつ群に分け、顔の表情判断について以下の仮説を検討した。 1) 高うつ群で表情判断の正確さが損なわれるのであれば、 3 感情のどの表出強度の判断も抑うつ傾向の 低い被験者よりも劣っている。 2) もし高うつ群にcontent-specificな注意のバイアスがあるならば、悲しい顔の表情判断では高うつ群の方が表出強度がわずかな表的でも敏感に悲しいと認知をするが、怒りと喜びではどの表出強度でも表情判断において低うつ群と差はなく表出強度に応じて判断の正確さを増す。実験の結果から以下の点が明らかになった。 1) 怒った顔と笑った顔では、高うつ群はどの表出強度でも低うつ群と差はなく、女性顔については表出強度に比例した判断の正確さが示され、男性顔については真顔に比べて他の全ての表出強度で表情ありと判断した。 2) 悲しい顔では、女性顔では高うつ群と低うつ群に差はなく表出強度に応じて判断の正確さが増したが、男性顔では微妙な表情判断では高うつ群の方が高い比率で表情ありと判断する傾向にあったが、高うつ群も低うつ群も真顔に比べて他の表出強度で表情ありと判断した。 3) 抑うつ傾向に関わらず 3 表情すべてについて、女性顔では表出強度に応じて判断の正確さを増したが、男性顔では真顔とそれ以外の表出強度で判断比率の差が認められた。以上の結果から、仮説 1 は支持されない結果となった。仮説 2 については、怒った顔や笑った顔では両群間に差はなく、表出強度に応じて判断の正確さを増すという点は支持されたが、悲しい顔の表情判断では、高うつ群の方が微妙な表情つまり表出強度がわずかでも敏感に悲しいと認知をするという点は、女性顔については支持されず男性顔については明確な結果は得られなかった。したがって、本研究の結果から非臨床群については上記の仮説は支持されなかった...|$|R
