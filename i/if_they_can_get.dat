5|$|Adam Williams (James Nesbitt) {{breaks up}} with another {{in a long line}} of girlfriends and spends the evening at the pub with his friend Pete Gifford (John Thomson). Pete arrives home late, which annoys his wife Jenny (Fay Ripley), who {{calculated}} that night to be the best time for them to conceive a child. She becomes even more frustrated when she sees Pete has brought Adam back; he missed his last bus home. Rachel Bradley's (Helen Baxendale) boyfriend Simon Atkinson (Stephen Mapes) breaks up with her over dinner after taking a job in Hong Kong. Rachel angrily leaves the restaurant and telephones her friend Karen Marsden (Hermione Norris), who has just asked her husband David (Robert Bathurst) <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a nanny to take care of their son Josh.|$|E
5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek {{in the parking lot of}} the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E
25|$|A second {{explanation}} {{issued by}} Janssen and Vanhamme {{is that of}} reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little {{in return for their}} investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.|$|E

50|$|Bugbears are {{carnivores}} {{who survive}} primarily by hunting. They will eat anything <b>they</b> <b>can</b> kill, including sentient beings. Intruders {{are considered a}} valuable source of food, so bugbears rarely bother to negotiate with them. They have a fondness for glittery, shiny objects and weapons, however, so they will sometimes parley <b>if</b> <b>they</b> think <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> something exceptional. Bugbears also enjoy strong wine and ale, sometimes to excess. Rarely, they will take slaves.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, a new New Year's special was {{produced}} and was broadcast on 4 January 2014. The story features Nan {{as she is}} accompanied by a school girl named Alice, who has volunteered to visit Nan as part of the 'Young and Old Buddy-Up Foundation' while her grandson, Jamie is in Africa helping to build a school for orphans and keeps in contact with Nan regularly via Skype. As Nan's tap is broken, she and Alice head to the council to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> someone to fix and there Nan land herself in trouble for 'disturbing the peace and simulating a heart attack' at the local community centre. Returning guest stars include Mathew Horne and Niky Wardley and with Ami Metcalf as Alice.|$|E
500|$|Battle for Naboos {{controls}} {{were described as}} tight and responsive. Reviewers praised the addition of ground vehicles, which were completely absent from Rogue Squadron. Both Davis and Mirabella remarked that this addition keeps the game from getting stale or redundant. Nintendo Power thought that the game is at its best when the action isn't grounded, however, describing some of the ground missions as [...] "tedious" [...] and [...] "uninspired". Some reviewers believed that the game's EpisodeI setting is less engaging than Rogue Squadrons original trilogy setting. Mirabella stated that [...] "any fan of Rogue Squadron should enjoy Battle for Naboo just as much <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> past the EpisodeI barrier", and Davis wrote that the game's setting [...] "does not carry the same impact as {{the story of the}} original [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The dog once {{replaced}} Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer in {{the episode}} [...] "Old Yeller Belly" [...] (season 14, 2003), {{after he was}} seen drinking from a can of beer by balancing it on his nose. He becomes known as Suds McDuff and boosts sales of Duff Beer, making the family's fortunes explode. However, this prompts his original sleazy owner and racing trainer to visit the Simpsons and prove that he's {{the owner of the}} dog. The family later figures that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> Duffman to replace Suds as the Duff mascot, they can get their dog back. They plan to turn Duffman into a hero at a Duff Beer-sponsored beach volleyball event; however, their plan fails and a drunk shark that's discovered at the event becomes the new mascot instead. Santa's Little Helper gladly returns to the Simpson family.|$|E

The owner, Jimmy, agrees, {{but he does not}} wish to pay them with money; instead he gives them a free pop and {{a sandwich}} each day. Miranda, Annemarie, and Colin discover a Fred Flintstone bank in the back of sandwich shop. Colin, wanting {{to see more of the}} bank, is pulled way by Annemarie insisting that Jimmy could find them. The next day, Jimmy fires the three workers, thinking that one of them stole the Flintstone bank, when it was actually the laughing man who stole it. The workers write a card, give it to Jimmy and insist that they did not steal the bank. Jimmy believes them and let them work at the sandwich shop. He then tells them that he figured out who stole the bank. He thinks that it is Julia, a classmate in their class, and a best friend to Annemarie. He [...] thinks she did it because she is African American. This upsets Annemarie greatly and she immediately quits her job.|$|E

[...] Henrietta goes offstage to get some tea to calm Gerda's frazzled nerves. [...] Gerda, thinking she is unobserved, takes a vial of poison from her purse, and pours some into Henrietta's drink. [...] Henrietta returned more quickly than Gerda expected, and witnesses this silently from just outside the room. [...] She enters, more noisily this time. [...] Vocalizing her decision to have tea with Gerda, rather than the sherry she had poured for herself, she leaves to get another teacup.

5000|$|Cannons - Under Taiwanese rules, {{the cannon}} has devastating {{potential}} {{if it is}} well placed behind a shield of strong allied pieces. Given such position, a cannon can be stronger than either general or advisor, especially if the opposing general and/or advisors have limited lateral mobility—that is, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> can’t sidestep a cannon attack. On the other hand, the opponent has plenty of pieces that can capture the cannon <b>if</b> only <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> next to it, so a poorly placed Cannon is usually short-lived.

The team Shimizu strongly demanded a retraction and complained that the bout between Tepparith and Kameda should be taken place as an intern championship or a title eliminator. Kaneko Boxing Gym submitted a questionnaire with the December 5 deadline to the JBC.

The WBA's decision to make Shimizu a champion in recess has been controversial in Japan, and it has been continuously reported in the major media such as three major newspapers.
