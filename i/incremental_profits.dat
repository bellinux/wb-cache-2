5000|$|However, setting {{incentives}} {{as intense}} as possible is not necessarily optimal {{from the point of}} view of the employer. The Incentive-Intensity Principle states that the optimal intensity of incentives depends on four factors: the <b>incremental</b> <b>profits</b> created by additional effort, the precision with which the desired activities are assessed, the agent’s risk tolerance, and the agent’s responsiveness to incentives. According to Prendergast (1999, 8), [...] "the primary constraint on pay is that its provision imposes additional risk on workers ..." [...] A typical result of the early principal-agent literature was that piece rates tend to 100% (of the compensation package) as the worker becomes more able to handle risk, as this ensures that workers fully internalize the consequences of their costly actions. In incentive terms, where we conceive of workers as self-interested rational individuals who provide costly effort (in the most general sense of the worker's input to the firm's production function), the more compensation varies with effort, the better the incentives for the worker to produce.|$|E

50|$|<b>Incremental</b> <b>profit</b> is {{the profit}} gain or loss {{associated}} with a given managerial decision. Total profit increases so long as <b>incremental</b> <b>profit</b> is positive. When <b>incremental</b> <b>profit</b> is negative, total <b>profit</b> declines. Similarly, <b>incremental</b> <b>profit</b> is positive (and total profit increases) if the incremental revenue {{associated with a}} decision exceeds the incremental cost. The incremental concept is so intuitively obvious that {{it is easy to}} overlook both its significance in managerial decision making and the potential for difficulty in correctly applying it.For this reason, the incremental concept is sometimes violated in practice. For example, a firm may refuse to sublet excess warehouse space for $5000 per month because it figures its cost as $7500 per month -a price paid for a long-term lease on the facility. However, if the warehouse space represents excess capacity with no current value to the company, its historical cost of $7500 per month is irrelevant and should be disregarded. The firm would forego $5000 in profits by turning down the offer to sublet the excess warehouse space. Similarly, any firm that adds a standard allocated charge for fixed costs and overhead to the true incremental cost of production runs the risk of turning down profitable business.|$|R

40|$|Ultimately, patents {{have value}} {{to the extent to}} which the product {{features}} enabled by the patents have economic value in the marketplace. Products that are enhanced by inclusion of patented features should generate <b>incremental</b> <b>profits.</b> <b>Incremental</b> <b>profits</b> can be assessed by considering demand for products with patented features and contrasting that demand with demand for the same product without the patented features. Profit calculations must be based on valid estimates of demand as well as assumptions about how competitive forces affect demand via computation of market equilibria. A conjoint survey can be used to estimate demand. Recently, conjoint methods have been applied in the patent setting, but the measures of value used are purely demand based and do not involve equilibrium profit calculations.

This paper studies the inventory control in the system and presents a quantity discount pricing model for inventory coordination based on the standard container, a transport tool from the supplier to the retailer with a fixed size.

Before inventory coordination, the supplier and the retailer my-opically choose their lot sizes, which is not the optimal decision for the whole system.

It also discusses the solution and the distribution of the <b>incremental</b> <b>profits</b> after the incentive scheme is adopted by both the supplier and the retailer. A con-stant in the model, which affects the distribution of the <b>incremental</b> <b>profits,</b> is optimized for the supplier by using numerical analysis.

By this policy, a producer charges, for each product unit sold, only the addition to total cost resulting from materials and direct labor. Businesses often set prices close to marginal cost during periods of poor sales. If, for example, an item has a marginal cost of $1.00 and a normal selling price is $2.00, the firm selling the item might wish to lower the price to $1.10 if demand has waned. The business would choose this approach because the <b>incremental</b> <b>profit</b> of 10 cents from the transaction is better than no sale at all.|$|R

[...] Rather, a patent claiming an invention with market demand would likely have economic value because the patent holder can exclude others from making, importing, using, and offering for sale, or selling that invention throughout the jurisdiction (the U.S.A. for example [...] ) and sell the product at a monopoly price. Without alternative suppliers for the patented good or technology, the price the patentee is able to charge would likely be greater than the competitive price (the price in a competitive equilibrium).

40|$|There {{are many}} {{decision}} making problems {{in which one}} seeks to choose the optimal package from {{a large number of}} indivisible independent proposals. For instance, jobbing firms have often to choose the most profitable package of orders from hundreds of potential ones under a great many restrictions on available resources, such as working time of different facilities, number of specialists, materials, etc. This article is intended to present a simple approach to obtaining approximate solutions for such problems. The fundamental concept is to make some ordinal scales among proposals. Steps of calculation are illustrated by examples of choosing the optimal mix of orders, one of which involves 60 candidate proposals with 30 restricting conditions. This method may be of great help when (1) the number of candidates and restricting conditions are large; (2) the estimated or raw data on required resources for proposals and their <b>incremental</b> <b>profits</b> contain some errors; and (3) the distribution of <b>incremental</b> <b>profits</b> and required resources of candidates differs greatly, say, week by week, and the limits on resources can be extended in a practical manner by carrying over an inventory of profitable backlog orders, reducing, in effect, the remaining capacity in the future week. ...|$|E

40|$|Gasoline (GA) and {{kerosene}} (KO) are {{extracted from}} crude oil (CO), {{such that the}} three fuel commodities share a chemical link. On the other hand, GA also shares an industrial link with natural rubber (NR) and palladium (PA) as complementary commodities that are heavily consumed by the automobile industry. We contrast the information content embedded in the two economic linkages. Focusing on TOCOM futures contracts written on the five commodities and centering on GA, we confirm that incremental information provided by either CO, KO or NR, PA over a buy-and-hold strategy and a naive forecast, are both statistically and economically significant. While the chemical link forecast is more profitable, a double-link forecast generated from a VECM with two cointegrating vectors (KO-GA and GANR prices) outperforms both single-link forecasts based on risk-adjusted profit net of transaction costs. Further comparisons against the profitability of commodity-based momentum strategies documented in Erb and Harvey (2006) and Miffre and Rallis (2007) show that the double-link forecast holds its own against the most profitable of the 75 momentum strategies considered. This strongly suggests that not only are there <b>incremental</b> <b>profits</b> {{to be gained from}} harnessing and combining economic links among commodity futures, the resultant <b>incremental</b> <b>profits</b> are economically significant against other proven commodity-based trading strategies in the existing literature. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{empirical}} movements of stock prices can be explained directly by fundamentals. The real stock market rate of return is shown to closely track the real <b>incremental</b> rate of <b>profit</b> of the corporate sector, with the two rates displaying similar means and standard deviations. It is argued that the two are linked by capital flows between the sectors through a process we call "turbulent arbitrage". Actual equity prices closely track the prices closely track the prices warranted by this model, and unlike the standard results, are less volatile than the warranted ones. The theoretical approach taken in this paper implies that the <b>incremental</b> <b>profit</b> rate is the required rate of return {{for the stock market}} return. The observed volatility on stock market returns and prices arises {{from the fact that the}} required rate is itself highly volatile, driven by cyclical and other short term fluctuations in aggregate demand. It is then easy to see why conventional theoretical models, which typically assume constant required rates of return (discount rates) and constant dividend growth rates, are largely unable to explain the movements in stock prices. On the other hand, since the <b>incremental</b> rate of <b>profit</b> (net of interest) is essentially the change in earnings normalized by investment, the findings of this paper accord well the experience "on the street" that stock price movements are driven by interest rates and changes in earnings. ...|$|R

The goal is investigating the coupling efficiency on profit increment considering various intensities of power plant’s fuel constraint.

We employ a bargaining framework and find that the presence of larger and more powerful buyers increases a supplier’s incentives to reduce marginal costs. We identify two main forces. First, we show that while the supplier’s total profits decrease in the presence of larger buyers, the supplier can extract a larger fraction of any <b>incremental</b> <b>profits.</b> Second, we find that by lowering its own marginal costs a supplier can reduce the value of buyers ’ outside options and that this effect is also stronger if there are fewer but larger buyers...|$|E

40|$|When {{asked about}} the impact of unit {{manufacturing}} cost reductions on gross profit, many managers and academics assume that returns will be diminishing, i. e., that the first cent of unit cost reduction will generate more <b>incremental</b> gross <b>profit</b> than the last cent of unit cost savings, consistent with the economic intuition about diminishing returns. (The product's appeal to the market is assumed to remain constant.) The present paper shows why gross profits actually increase in a convex fashion under typical demand assumptions, providing increasing returns with each additional cent of reduction in unit manufacturing cost. The intuition is that if q units are sold at the current price, the first cent of unit cost reduction increases the gross profits by q cents (keeping the price at the current level). But further cost reductions bring about greater pricing flexibility so that the optimal price decreases, thereby increasing the quantity to q'. Thus, the last cent of cost reduction produces an <b>incremental</b> <b>profit</b> of q' cents, where q' > q. The convex returns are captured graphically in the "profit saddle," a simple plot of gross profit as a function of unit cost and unit price. Decreasing unit costs produce additional returns from learning curve effects, reduced per unit channel costs, quality improvements, and strategic considerations. Of course, the fixed investment entailed in reducing unit-manufacturing costs must be weighed against the returns from doing so, suggesting some optimal level of unit cost reduction efforts. Cost reduction has traditionally been the purview of the manufacturing function within the firm, and has been emphasized in the later phases of the product-process life cycle. Marketing managers, on the other hand, have focused on generating sales revenues through pricing, product positioning, promotion, and channel placement. The present paper suggests that the traditional view be questioned. The marketing function, and new product planning in particular, may want to consider unit manufacturing cost reduction a potent tool in pricing new products for marketing success. ...|$|R

Following Katz (1987), we model buyer power as buyers' ability to substitute away from a given supplier and isolate several effects that support the opposite view, namely that the presence of powerful buyers induces a supplier to invest more in cost reduction. In contrast to negotiations with smaller buyers, the outcome of negotiations with large buyers is fully determined by their more valuable alternative supply option. This increases the supplier. s incentives to reduce marginal costs, both as the supplier receives a larger fraction of the thereby generated <b>incremental</b> <b>profits</b> and as this makes buyers' alternative supply option less valuable.

40|$|In-store product {{sampling}} is {{a commonly}} used promotional technique {{designed to give}} prospective consumers an opportunity to experience a product prior to purchase. While prior research has documented {{a positive relationship between}} short-term sales and perceptual measures of the customer shopping experience, {{little is known about the}} long-term impact of sampling or factors that moderate its success. In this paper, we develop an empirical approach that allows us to study the short-term and long-term effects of in-store sampling on both own and competitive products. We apply our approach to six store-level scanner data sets across four different product categories and show that in-store sampling has both an immediate (short-term) and sustained (long-term) impact on sales. We also show that the impact of sampling on sales is moderated by the characteristics of the store conducting the event, and that repeated sampling for a single product leads to a multiplicative increase in its long-term sales performance. We find that, unlike many types of in-store promotion, sampling results in a category expansion effect as opposed to a pure substitution effect. We contrast the immediate and long-term sales patterns for in-store sampling to those of product displays and discuss managerially relevant differences. Finally, we demonstrate <b>incremental</b> <b>profit</b> implications and store selection scenarios for different incremental costs of conducting the in-store events using constrained optimizations...|$|R
40|$|Agents {{are often}} better {{informed}} than the clients who hire them and may exploit this informational advantage. Real-estate agents, who {{know much more}} about the housing market than the typical homeowner, are one example. Because real estate agents receive only a small share of the <b>incremental</b> <b>profit</b> when a house sells for a higher value, there is an incentive for them to convince their clients to sell their houses too cheaply and too quickly. We test these predictions by comparing home sales in which real estate agents are hired by others to sell a home to instances in which {{a real estate agent}} sells his or her own home. In the former case, the agent has distorted incentives; in the latter case, the agent wants to pursue the first-best.

Situations in which the agent’s informational advantage is larger lead to even greater distortions.
