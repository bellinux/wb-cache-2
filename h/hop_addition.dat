During the boil, hops are added, which contribute {{aroma and flavour}} compounds to the beer, especially their characteristic bitterness. Along with {{the heat of the}} boil, they cause proteins in the wort to coagulate and the pH of the wort to fall, and they inhibit the later growth of certain bacteria. Finally, the vapours produced during the boil volatilize off-flavours, including dimethyl sulfide precursors. The boil must be conducted so that it is even and intense.

40|$|The {{time point}} of <b>hop</b> <b>addition</b> is decisive for hop-derived flavour {{characteristic}} in lager beer. Whereas {{the impact of}} ‘late/whirlpool’ hopping technologies and the resulting ‘floral’ note are scientifically quite understood, insights into ‘early’ hopping and the resulting ‘spicy/herbal’ aspect of ‘kettle hop’ flavour appear {{to be far more}} elusive. Therefore, in our previous work, we conducted lab scale boiling experiments with total hop essential oil and sesquiterpene hydrocarbon fractions, proving de novo formation of various sesquiterpene oxidation products (SOPs). Several of these constituents appeared to be flavour-active and were also detected in beer. In our current work we aim at verifying our results in real brewing practice. Four lager beers, (prepared at our 4 hL pilotscale brewery) were aromatised by addition of Saaz pellets, thereby varying the time point of <b>hop</b> <b>addition</b> (E=’early’,L=‘late’, W=‘whirlpool’, EL=combination ’early’ and ‘late’ hopping). Samples were taken along the wort boiling and whirlpool process of beer E and beer W resp. and analysed via HS-SPME-GC-MS, proving for the first time de novo formation of SOPs during kettle boiling upon ‘early’ <b>hop</b> <b>addition.</b> In addition, we prepared a non-aromatised iso-α-acid bittered brew which was split post-fermentation in five equal parts. Thereof, one remained non-aromatised (reference) and the others were ‘dry’ hopped (during lagering) with resp. pellets, unboiled hop essential oil, boiled hop essential oil and a SOP fraction cv. Saaz (resulting in resp. beer D-ISO, D-pellets, D-U, D-B and D-SOP). Sensory characteristics of the beers were evaluated by our trained taste panel, showing clear flavour differences between all beers. The flavour of beer E was dominated by ‘spicy/herbal’ notes, confirming the general view that vigorous boiling of aroma hops is required to impart this typical flavour characteristic to beer. Beer EL, highly appreciated by our panellists, showed a fine balance between a ‘spicy/herbal’ and ‘floral/citrus’ bouquet and received the highest score for ‘kettle hop’ aroma. Remarkably, the flavour profile of beer D-SOP approximated the profile of beer EL. GCxGC-TOFMS analysis of beer D-SOP revealed the presence of humulene epoxide III, humulenol II, caryophylla- 4 (12), 8 (13) -diene- 5 -ol, 3 Z-caryophylla- 3, 8 (13) -diene- 5 α-ol, 14 -hydroxy-β-caryophyllene and 3 Z-caryophylla- 3, 8 (13) -diene- 5 β-ol. These compounds were previously indicated as candidate key impact odorants for the ‘spicy/herbal’ notes of ‘kettle hop aroma’. Also beer D-B received a relatively high score for ‘spicy/herbal’ and was even scored higher for general ‘kettle hop’ aroma. In conclusion, post-fermentation addition of boiled hop oil or SOPs, prepared off-line by oxidation of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, imparts typical ‘kettle hop’ flavour characteristics to lager beer and therefore shows high potential for application in brewing practice. status: publishe...|$|E

No. CV- 28, PI 558864) was developed by the USDA-ARS as a unique, nonbittering, high beta-acids hop and was released on 26 June 2006. The defining characteristics of Teamaker are its near-zero percent alpha acids levels—a distinctive condition in the Humulus species (Haunold et al., 1977) —good cone production, and relatively high levels of beta acids. Due to its low level of alpha acids, the primary bittering flavor agent of hop, and high levels of beta acids, which are the primary antimicrobial active compounds in hop, the potential uses of this variety lie principally as a natural-product antimicrobial additive, replacing antibiotics in poultry feed (Cornelison et al., 2006); a bacteriostatic agent in sugar processing, replacing formaldehyde (Pollach et al., 1996); as an herbal tea; and as a “late-hopping” aroma <b>hop</b> <b>addition</b> to the brew kettle where bittering potential is of no consequence...|$|E
50|$|For brewers with {{equipment}} and {{knowledge about the}} brewing process, all-grain kits include all the ingredients necessary to create homebrew from beginning to end. Most kits include grain and hops, some kits may also include yeast. A full set of instructions is generally included. What sets these kits apart from others is the inclusion of milled malted grain which must first undergo a mash to extract the sugars, this combination of liquid and sugars is known as wort and is necessary for fermentation. A full boil of the wort is then required, {{with one or more}} <b>hop</b> <b>additions</b> at different times depending on style.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} wort is then boiled, {{usually for}} 60-90 minutes. Hops are added {{at different times}} during the boil, depending on the desired result. Hops added {{at the beginning of}} the boil contribute bitterness, hops added in the last thirty minutes contribute flavor. Hops added in the last few minutes or even after the end of the boil contribute both flavor and hop aroma. These <b>hop</b> <b>additions</b> are generally referred to as bittering, flavor, and aroma additions respectively. Finings such as Irish moss, a form of seaweed, and others can be added in the final 15-30 minutes of the boil to help prevent haze in the resulting beer.|$|R
50|$|IBU {{can not be}} {{determined}} by perceived bitterness. For example, the bittering effect of hops is less noticeable in beers with a high quantity of malt, so a higher bitterness is needed in heavier beers to balance the flavour and achieve the same perceived bitterness as compared to a lighter beer. For example, an Imperial Stout may have an IBU of 50, but will taste less bitter than an English Bitter with an IBU of 30, because the latter beer uses much less malt than the former. After around 100 IBU, hop utilization is so poor that the number ceases to be meaningful in regard to taste, although continued <b>hop</b> <b>additions</b> will increase bitterness. Light lagers without much bitterness will generally have 8-20 IBU, while an India Pale Ale may have 60-100 IBU or more.|$|R
40|$|Also with {{conventional}} hopping {{in compliance with}} the purity law it is possible to produce beers with a mild bitterness and distinct hop aroma. Here the examinations were made with three types of hopping each with 2 hop varieties in bottom-fermenting beers: - addition 20 minutes before end of boil and a late addition split between end of boil and in the whirlpool - <b>hop</b> <b>addition</b> split only between end of boil and in the whirlpool - dry hopping exclusively There was no first addition at begin of boil. The 6 beers were examined for bitter substances, polyphenols and selected aromatic substances. The spread of the analysis values was enormous: - EBC bitterness units 12 - 28 IBU - iso-alpha-acids 1 - 17 mg/L - hop polyphenols 71 - 126 mg/L - monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes 32 - 300 µg/L - linalool + geraniol 198 - 838 µg/L - esters 72 - 793 µg/L By adjusting the time of hopping between middle of boil, end of boil and dry hopping you can achieve almost any beer bitterness.

40|$|The {{bitterness}} of beer {{remains one of}} its most important flavour attribute. However, complexity surrounding bitterness perception alone represents a significant challenge in its understanding, in addition to other factors relating to production processes and raw materials used in making beer. The aim of this research was to better understand beer bitterness in terms of its intensity and quality, and how hopping technology (e. g. quantity and time of <b>hop</b> <b>addition</b> during the brewing process), hop aroma and variety may effect perceived bitterness intensity and quality. This project combined both analytical and sensorial analysis, and used statistical techniques to identify the key compounds driving bitterness perception. Analytical techniques were employed to quantify bitterness-contributing compounds and analytical bitterness units in beers alongside descriptive analysis of perceived sensory bitterness. Perceived sensory bitterness (both qualitative and quantitative) was assessed using a purpose developed list of well-defined bitterness attributes, to aid the characterisation of bitterness quality in beers. The impact of cross-modal flavour interactions on the perception of beer bitterness intensity and qualities was also investigated at varying analytical bitterness levels. Lastly, the effect of hop variety, and how this significant raw material affects perceived bitterness quality was also investigated using three distinctively different hop varieties (Hersbrucker, East Kent Goldings and Zeus). Results revealed a significant impact of the analytical profiles of beers, derived from the type of hop products and hopping technology adopted in beer production, on the perceived bitterness quality of beer. In general, beers high in hop acid compounds and polyphenols were, as expected, perceived to be higher in bitterness intensity. The results further showed that bitterness intensity also {{played a role in the}} perception of bitterness quality i. e. whether the beer was ‘harsh’, ‘lingering’ or ‘round’. However, beers high in these compounds were not always of ‘negative’ bitterness quality, and correspondingly lower amounts of these compounds did not always result in ‘positive’ bitterness qualities in beer. Results on the impact of cross-modal flavour interactions showed that hop aroma plays a crucial role in beer bitterness perception, and can modify the perception of bitterness intensity and quality as well as temporal profiles of bitterness in beer depending on analytical bitterness levels. The investigation into the impact of hop variety on perceived bitterness quality revealed hop-derived bitterness profiles relating to individual hop varieties, and further suggests that careful selection of the hop variety used for brewing is important for controlling perceived bitterness quality. This research provides a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach to understanding perceived beer bitterness and its associated qualities, with findings suggesting that besides bitterness intensity, the quality and overall impression of bitterness as perceived by consumers are significantly influenced by raw materials, production processes and other factors such as aroma which might be overlooked by brewers - but are likely to be significant for consumer preference and the success of a brand...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from September 22, 2016 - March 22, 2017 Hop aroma in beer {{is related to the}} unique compositional chemistry of the hops used in the brewing process. While the range of these compositions is quite diverse and primarily dependent on hop cultivar¹, other studies have also shown that cultivation, seasonality, harvesting², processing³⁴, and storage practices⁵⁶ contribute to differences in hop composition. However, {{it should be noted that}} the aroma and composition of fresh and processed hops⁷ is different than the subsequent finished beer. This irreconcilable difference that exists between hops and the finished product has been a confounding variable for brewing scientists, in large part due to the complexity and diversity of the compounds that are transferred from hops to beer, but also due to an incomplete understanding of the interactions between these compounds and the aromas they elicit. Of the many compounds found in hops, those belonging to the class known as monoterpene alcohols have consistently been useful indicators of changes in hop aroma due to different brewing practices. Notable differences exist between American and European hops in terms of the types of flavor they contribute to beer. Brewers tend to describe the former as contributing citrusy, fruity and in some instances floral aromas to beer, while the latter are often described as contributing herbal, tobacco, woody, and spicy notes. Single-hop brewing trials were carried out using either American hops (Cascade, Chinook, Centennial, Citra, or Simcoe) or European hops (East Kent Goldings, Hallertau Mittlefrueh HHA or Saaz) to identify hop-derived volatiles that contribute to American hop aroma in beer. The eight resultant beers were evaluated using both sensory and instrumental analyses. The sensory analysis identified Centennial as having the highest piney and green hop aromas, while Citra and Simcoe were characterized as being very fruity, citrusy, and tropical (especially Citra). The Hallertau Mittlefrueh (HHA) beers were similar to the East Kent Goldings, and these two were more floral and rose-like than the Saaz sample with more melon character than the American cultivars. Volatile analysis of the beer samples was performed using a stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) of the beer samples followed by quantification by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In general, the beers brewed with the American hop varieties were higher in aroma and in monoterpene alcohols. In addition to hop oil-derived aroma, previous studies have demonstrated that non-volatile hop-derived precursors, specifically glycosides, survive the boil process and can be hydrolyzed to release volatile aglycones capable of contributing to aroma. To investigate this, twelve single hopped pilot scale beers were brewed using pellet, supercritical extract, and spent hop fractions of Citra, Simcoe, Centennial, or Cascade cultivars in order to investigate the contribution of these different hop fractions to the aroma of kettle hopped beers. The spent hop treatments produced beers that had noticeable, albeit low, hop aroma which suggest that the water-soluble components left behind in the spent hops may contribute to hop aroma. The intensity and nature of the hop aroma in the Spent treatments was hop variety. However, contributions of water soluble components from spent hops to hop aroma in beer was very subtle, especially compared to the pellet and extract treatments. Aqueous extracts of the spent material from pilot scale supercritical CO₂ fluid extraction (SFE) of hop pellets were treated to investigate the impact of different hydrolysis treatments and on the aroma and volatile profile. Aroma profiles were evaluated using descriptive analysis by a trained panel. Volatiles arising from hydrolysis treatments of aqueous extracts of the spent materials were measured using SBSE and GC-MS. The intensity and nature of the hop aroma was treatment specific. Acidic hydrolysis of water soluble extracts produced the most intense Overall and Pine aroma. Differences in the aroma intensities due to the hydrolysis from the addition of different enzyme preparations were present but subtle. Aromas liberated by ale yeast produced different profiles than the lager yeast. All treatments showed increases in aglycone content and changes in aroma profile when treated with hydrolytic enzymes preparations. However, fundamental studies that examine the extraction of glycosides during brewing and their subsequent hydrolysis by yeast have not been fully investigated. Furthermore, extraction of other hop-derived compounds into beer show a strong dependency on the hop cultivar being used and the point at which it is added. Therefore, the extent of glycoside extraction due to hopping regime, cultivar, and their hydrolysis due to yeast β-glucosidase activity was investigated. The glycoside concentration of worts made with three different hopping regimes and three cultivars was measured. Additionally, β-glucosidase activities for 80 different yeast strains and their effect on aglycone concentration in wort was determined. Glycoside content was measured by the difference in volatile aglycone concentrations between samples treated with purified β-glucosidase and untreated samples. Aglycone concentration was measured by SPME GC-MS. Results showed that yeast have a wide range of abilities to hydrolyze glycosides with a maximum hydrolysis occurring after three days of fermentation regardless of yeast activity. Although it was shown that yeast are capable of glycoside hydrolysis, glycoside concentrations in wort are low and have small contributions to hop aroma. These results help explain the extent to which different brewing yeasts and hopping regimes contribute to hoppy beer aroma through the hydrolysis of non-volatile hop-derived compounds. Finally, in order to investigate the effect of hopping regime on the monoterpene alcohol content and sensory attributes of beer, 6 single hop beers were made using different hop additions and evaluated by sensory and instrumental analysis. Beers were brewed while varying two factors: hop cultivar (Simcoe and HHA) and timing of <b>hop</b> <b>addition</b> (60 min. boil, 25 min. whirlpool, or 48 -hour dryhopping). Additionally, the impact of yeast strain on treatment was investigated. Each treatment was compared to an unhopped control using SBSE GC-MS and descriptive sensory analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis were used to described the between relationships between instrumental and sensory results. Whirlpool additions produced beers with the highest concentrations of geraniol, linalool, and β-citronellol; beers brewed with highly aromatic Simcoe hops produced more intense and individually distinct aromas for each hopping regime compared to the HHA hopped beers. Conversely, beers brewed with HHA hops showed less intense aromas with less distinction between hopping regimes, except for the dry-hopped treatment, which was characterized by a more floral type aroma than the other HHA. This research shows that despite the popularity of dry-hopping as an aroma hopping method, whirlpool additions can also produce intensely aromatic beers...|$|E
50|$|IBU isn't {{determined}} by the perceived bitterness of {{the taste of the}} beer. For example, the bittering effect of hops is less noticeable in beers with roasted malts or strong flavours, so a higher proportion of hops would be required in strong flavoured beers to achieve the same perceived bitterness in moderately flavoured beers. For example, an imperial stout may have an IBU of 50, but will taste less bitter than a pale lager with an IBU of 30, because the pale lager has a lower flavour intensity. After around 100 IBU, hop utilization is so poor that the number ceases to be meaningful in regard to taste, although continued <b>hop</b> <b>additions</b> will increase bitterness.

Unlike the simplest FKM case, it contains odd parity terms (resulting from the correlated <b>hopping)</b> in <b>addition</b> to even parity ones. The ground-state phase diagram of the effective Hamiltonian is examined in the (a/t, h) plane, where a/t is a parameter characterizing strength of the correlated hopping and h is a difference of chemical potentials of two sorts of particles present in the system. It appears to be asymmetric with respect to the change h→ -h and a new ordered phase is found for a certain interval of a/t.

40|$|Graph pattern {{matching}} is typically {{defined in terms}} of sub-graph isomorphism, which makes it an np-complete prob-lem. Moreover, it requires bijective functions, which are often too restrictive to characterize patterns in emerging ap-plications. We propose a class of graph patterns, in which an edge denotes the connectivity in a data graph within a predefined number of <b>hops.</b> In <b>addition,</b> we define matching based on a notion of bounded simulation, an extension of graph simulation. We show that with this revision, graph {{pattern matching}} can be performed in cubic-time, by pro-viding such an algorithm. We also develop algorithms for in-crementally finding matches when data graphs are updated, with performance guarantees for dag patterns. We experi-mentally verify that these algorithms scale well, and that the revised notion of graph pattern matching allows us to iden-tify communities commonly found in real-world networks. 1...|$|R
40|$|Different beers with {{intensive}} <b>hop</b> <b>additions</b> {{to achieve}} a hop bouquet were aged for up to 700 days at 20 °C and 30 °C and {{the behavior of the}} hop aroma substances was examined, based on low oxygen bottling and the use of scavenger crown corks. Special attention was paid to the linalool, which produced the following results in summary: - the stereoisomers R-linalool and S-linalool are observed separately, because R-linalool is much more sensorily active than S-linalool - R-linalool as %-rel. of total linalool decreases about 30 % per year at 20 °C, S-linalool increases about 150 % per year - The R-linalool decreases from 90 % in fresh beer to 75 % within one year at 20 °C - Influences from the type of hopping (for example in the wort or dry hopping) or the type of beer (for example bottom fermenting or top fermenting) were not noticeable - Since R-linalool is sensorily much more active than S-linalool, the decrease in R-linalool plays a decisive role. Just the analysis of total linalool is not sufficient to describe sensory effects. The behavior of other aroma substances during storage at 20 °C can be defined as follows: - Monoterpenes were surprisingly stable; the sesquiterpenes too suffered only slight losses - Some carboxylic esters are relatively stable, the majority decreased by 12 and 20 % per 100 days at 20 °C - Of the monoterpene alcohols R-linalool decreased significantly, nerol and geraniol behaved differently, whereas alpha-terpineol and 1 -terpinen- 4 -ol increased - The oxidized sesquiterpenes decreased slightly - Beta-damascenone and 2 terpene ethers increased significantly The examinations did not include sensory assesment. Obviously the decrease in R-linalool leads to less hoppy-floral notes and the loss of some esters means less fruity notes. Overall the hop aroma substances proved to be more stable than presumed. A hop aroma in the beer will change during beer aging but will not completely disappear depending on the original impact. status: publishe...|$|R
