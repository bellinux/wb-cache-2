5|$|Two Franco-Greek Regiments {{attempted}} to storm Zborsko but were pushed {{back in the}} ensuing counterattack, as powerful pockets of resistance between the Sousnitsa and Bigrut streams facilitated its defense. Greek units then focused on Sousnitsa the fall of which created {{an opening in the}} Bulgarian rear and put the surrounding units to flight. Using dispersed bluffs as cover, soldiers of the Shumadia Division took over Veternik, Kamene and the western part of a nearby mountain range with considerable difficulty. Elements of the same unit successfully flanked Kravitski Kamene while the 17th Division was engaging in a frontal assault. At 16:00p.m., the Serbian 1st Army's thrust on Sokol failed to produce <b>intended</b> <b>results.</b> An attack later that night did secure the peak. The two French divisions were then ordered to remain in position while the Serbian Timok and Yugoslav Divisions moved forward. By the end of the day, Bulgaria lost approximately 40–50 percent of the 12,000 soldiers involved in the battle, including 3,000 prisoners of war, 2,689 dead and 50 out of the initial 158 artillery pieces. Entente casualties amounted to 1,700 Frenchmen and 200 Serbians killed in action.|$|E

50|$|From February 1992 until March 1993, Colombia {{suffered}} rolling blackouts {{of up to}} 10 hours a day due to {{a particularly}} strong El Niño season, which dried the reservoirs in hydroelectric plants in a country deriving 70% of its energy output from hydroelectric sources; consequently, the government decided to use DST to help save electricity. The experiment failed to deliver the <b>intended</b> <b>results,</b> possibly due to Colombia's low latitude, and the DST experiment was discontinued.|$|E
