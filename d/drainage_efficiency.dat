Managed realignment (MR) is an increasingly popular method to artificially recreate these habitats by reinstating tidal regimes to reclaimed land. However, to improve MR design, better knowledge of the processes that control morphological evolution in natural saltmarshes is needed.

Using lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) datasets, we combined a semi-automated creek extraction algorithm, based on elevation and slope thresholds, with a novel algorithm for morphometric creek analysis.

40|$|Precipitation totals at annual and monthly {{scale are}} key {{elements}} affecting water availability {{for a number}} of human activities. Thus, the multi-year variability and probability distribution of precipitation form the basis information for water management and damage risk assessment (caused by drought and heavy rains). The main goal {{of this paper is to}} analyse the precipitation patterns and to determine the non-exceedance probability (p, %) of extreme monthly precipitation in the region influenced by lignite mining and dominated by traditional agricultural production. Monthly precipitation totals recorded in 1961 – 2010 at four weather stations close to the analysed region were examined, including comparative analysis of precipitation patterns between the stations. Different non-exceedance probability (p, %) was determined with focus on extreme precipitation. Annual and monthly precipitation was characterised by a large variation of values. Temporal variability was larger than the spatial variability. The highest average sums were registered in July and the lowest in February. Minimum monthly precipitation (< 10 mm) were recorded between January and April, and in October at all four weather stations. Maximum totals, amounting to more than 200 mm, were noted in July. The largest share of absolute minimum and maximum monthly precipitation was recorded at the turn of 20 th and 21 st centuries. Temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation for very dry, abnormally dry and extremely dry months (p ≤ 20 %) were characterised by lower dispersion of values compared with wet months (p ≥ 80 %). The precipitation probability distribution at p ≤ 20 % may be useful to determine agricultural drought risk assessment in the region.

40|$|Gas {{drainage}} is {{the most}} commonly used and reliable technique for underground coal mine gas management. However, due to the suction pressure applied, air may migrate into the drainage boreholes through the fractures in the coal seam and dilute the drained gas. The low concentration gas may lead to risks such as spontaneous combustion and gas explosion. For these reasons, various types of sealants are used to prevent the interaction between the mine environment and the coal seam. As a surface support tool, thin spray-on liners (TSLs) offer promising potential in terms of a reduction of mining operating costs. In addition to ground support, there is potential for TSLs to be used for coal mine gas management, due to their relatively low permeability characteristics. This paper includes a numerical study to investigate TSL applications to improve the gas <b>drainage</b> <b>efficiency</b> in underground coal mines. A coupled simulation method was adopted in this study. The permeability variations due to mining disturbance were estimated by geomechanical modelling, while the gas flow within the coal seam was modelled with a commercial reservoir simulator. The model was first calibrated by history matching the gas production and gas concentration data in the study area to determine the unknown reservoir properties. Sensitivity analysis was then carried out on the calibrated model to predict the drainage borehole performance with different TSL application scenarios. Parameters studied in this study include TSL application length, application time, TSL permeability and coal permeability. The results from this study can be used to understand the effect of TSL applications on gas <b>drainage</b> <b>efficiency</b> and to assist the future operational capability of TSL applications in underground coal mines...|$|E
40|$|Video {{monitoring}} of beaches {{is becoming the}} preferred method for observing changes to nearshore morphology. Consequently this work investigates a new technique for predicting the probability of inundation {{that is based on}} measuring runup variation using video. Runup is defined as the water-level elevation maxima on the foreshore relative to the still water level and the waterline is defined as the position where the MWL intersects the beach face. Tairua, and Pauanui Beaches, on the north east coast of the North Island of New Zealand, were used as the field site in this study and represent two very different beaches with the same incoming wave and meteorological conditions. Tairua is most frequently in an intermediate beach state, whereas Pauanui is usually flatter in nature. In order to rectify runup observations, an estimate of the runup elevation was needed (Z). This was estimated by measuring the variation of the waterline over a tidal cycle from time-averaged video images during a storm event and provided beach morphology statistics (i. e. beach slope (α) and beach intercept (b)) used in the rectification process where Z=aX+b. The maximum swash excursions were digitized from time-stacks, and rectified to provide run-up timeseries with duration 20 minutes. Field calibrations revealed a videoed waterline that was seaward of the surveyed waterline. Quantification of this error gave a vertical offset of 0. 33 m at Tairua and 0. 25 m at Pauanui. At Tairua, incident wave energy was dominant in the swash zone, and the runup distributions followed a Rayleigh distribution. At Pauanui, the flatter beach, the runup distributions were approximately bimodal due to the dominance of infragravity energy in the swash signal. The slope of the beach was a major control on the runup elevation; runup at Pauanui was directly affected by the deepwater wave height and the tide, while at Tairua there was no correlation. Overall, {{the results of the study}} indicate realistic runup measurements, over a wide range of time scales and, importantly, during storm events. However, comparisons of videoed runup and empirical runup formulae revealed larger deviations as the beach steepness increased. Furthur tests need to be carried out to see if this is a limitation of this technique, used to measure runup. The runup statistics are consistently higher at Tairua and suggests that swash runs up higher on steeper beaches. However, because of the characteristics of flatter beaches (such as high water tables and low <b>drainage</b> <b>efficiencies)</b> the impact of extreme runup elevations on such beaches are more critical in regards to erosion and/ or inundation. The coastal environment is of great importance to Māori. Damage to the coast and coastal waahi tapu (places of spiritual importance) caused by erosion and inundation, adversely affects the spiritual and cultural well-being of Māori. For this reason, a chapter was dedicated to investigating the practices used by Māori to protect and preserve the coasts in accordance with tikanga Māori (Māori protocols). Mimicking nature was and still is a practice used by Māori to restore the beaches after erosive events, and includes replanting native dune plants and using natural materials on the beaches to stabilize the dunes. Tapu and rahui (the power and influence of the gods) were imposed on communities to prohibit and prevent people from free access to either food resources or to a particular place, in order to protect people and/ or resources. Interpretations of Māori oral histories provide insights into past local hazards and inform about the safety and viability of certain activities within an area. Environmental indicators were used to identify and forecast extreme weather conditions locally. Māori knowledge of past hazards, and the coastal environment as a whole, is a valuable resource and provides a unique source of expertise that can contribute to current coastal hazards management plans in New Zealand and provide insights about the areas that may again be impacted by natural hazards...|$|R

Methods: After sternotomy, pericardiotomy, and left pleurotomy, pigs were fitted with separate chest drains (n= 10) or a split tube prototype (n= 9) with internal openings positioned in the mediastinum {{and in the}} costodiaphragmatic recess. Separate series of experiments were conducted to test drainage of D 5 W or 0. 58 M sucrose, an aqueous solution with viscosity approximating that of plasma. One litre of fluid was infused into the thorax, and suction was applied at - 20 cm H 2 O for 30 min. Results: When D 5 W was infused, the split drain left a residual volume of 53 ± 99 ml (mean value ± SD) vs. 148 ± 120 for the separate drain (P = 0. 007), representing a <b>drainage</b> <b>efficiency</b> (i. e. drained vol/[drained + residual vol]) of 95 ± 10 % vs. 86 ± 12 % for the separate drains (P = 0. 011). In the second series, the split drain evacuated more 0. 58 M sucrose in the first minute (967 ± 129 ml) than the separate drains (680 ± 192 ml, P< 0. 001). By 30 min, the split drain evacuated a similar volume of sucrose vs. the conventional drain (1089 ± 72 vs. 1056 ± 78 ml; P = 0. 5).

40|$|Transients {{in water}} content are {{well-known}} to mobilize microorganisms that are {{retained in the}} vadose zone. However, {{there is no consensus}} on the relative importance of drainage and imbibition events on microorganism release. To overcome this limitation, we have systematically studied the release of Escherichia coli D 21 g during cycles of drainage and imbibition under various solution chemistry and initial conditions. Results from these column studies revealed the influence of imbibition and drainage on D 21 g release. In particular, imbibition efficiently released cells from the air-water interface (AWI) that were initially retained under steady-state unsaturated conditions by expansion of water films and destruction of the AWI. Conversely, significant release and transport of cells during drainage only occurred below a critical water saturation (water film thickness). In this case, a fraction of the cells that were initially retained on the solid-water interface (SWI) partitioned into the mobile aqueous phase and the AWI as the receding water film thickness decreased during <b>drainage.</b> The <b>efficiency</b> of cell release from the SWI during drainage was much less than for the AWI during imbibition. Cycles of drainage and imbibition removed cells from the SWI and the AWI, respectively. However, the peak concentration and amount of cells that were released increased with the number of retained cells and the amount of drainage and imbibition, and decreased with the number of drainage and imbibition cycles. Release of cells during drainage and imbibition was found to be more pronounced {{in the presence of a}} weak secondary minimum when the ionic strength (IS) was 5 mM NaCl. Increases in the solution IS decreased the influence of water transients on release, especially during drainage. Complete recovery of the retained cells could be achieved using both IS reduction and cycles of drainage and imbibition, even when the cells were retained under favorable attachment conditions. In general, cell release was more pronounced with transients in water content than transients in IS when the IS ≥ 5 mM. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

The pressure of CO 2 gas injection was close to the MMP of the oil, which was measured 1740 psia. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous types of fractures were simulated by creating maps of permeability and porosity. The results showed that homogeneous fractures had the highest value of efficiency, namely 40 %; however, in heterogeneous fractures, the efficiency depended on the value of fracture density and the maximum efficiency was around 37 %. Also, the effect of injection rate on two different intensities of fracture was studied and the results demonstrated that the model having higher fracture intensity had less limitation in increasing the CO 2 injection rate; furthermore, its BHP did not increase intensively at higher injection rates either.

The volume and salinity of the main water inputs (irrigation and precipitation) and outputs (crop evapotranspiration and drainage) were measured or estimated in each district. Soil salinity (ECe) maps were obtained through electromagnetic induction surveys (ECa readings) and district-specific ECa-ECe calibrations. Gravimetric soil water content (WC) and soil saturation percentage (SP) were also measured in the soil calibration samples. The ECa-ECe calibration equations were highly significant (PÂ  Â  0. 1) with WC, and was only significantly correlated (PÂ  Â Morocco (2. 2 Â dSÂ m- 1) Â >Â Spain (1. 4 Â dSÂ m- 1) Â >Â Turkey (0. 45 Â dSÂ m- 1). Soil salinity was mainly affected by irrigation water salinity and irrigation <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Drainage</b> water salinity at the exit of each district was mostly affected by soil salinity and irrigation efficiency, with values very high in Tunisia (9. 0 Â dSÂ m- 1), high in Spain (4. 6 Â dSÂ m- 1), moderate in Morocco (estimated at 2. 6 Â dSÂ m- 1), and low in Turkey (1. 4 Â dSÂ m- 1). Salt loads in drainage waters, calculated from their salinity (ECdw) and volume (Q), were highest in Tunisia (very high Q and very high ECdw), intermediate in Turkey (extremely high Q and low ECdw) and lowest in Spain (very low Q and high ECdw) (there were no Q data for Morocco). Reduction of these high drainage volumes through sound irrigation management {{would be the most}} efficient way to control the off-site salt-pollution caused by these Mediterranean irrigation districts.

The published article is copyrighted by Wiley-Blackwell and can be found at: [URL] key challenge for resource and land managers is predicting the consequences of climate warming on streamflow and water resources. During the last century in the western United States, significant reductions in snowpack and earlier snowmelt have led to an increase in the fraction of annual streamflow during winter and a decline in the summer. Previous work has identified elevation as it relates to snowpack dynamics as the primary control on streamflow sensitivity to warming. But along with changes in the timing of snowpack accumulation and melt, summer streamflows are also sensitive to intrinsic, geologically mediated differences in the efficiency of landscapes in transforming recharge (either as rain or snow) into discharge; we term this latter factor <b>drainage</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Here we explore the conjunction of <b>drainage</b> <b>efficiency</b> and snowpack dynamics in interpreting retrospective trends in summer streamflow during 1950 – 2010 using daily streamflow from 81 watersheds across the western United States. The recession constant (k) and fraction of precipitation falling as snow (S[subscript f]) were used as metrics of deep groundwater and overall precipitation regime (rain and/or snow), respectively. This conjunctive analysis indicates that summer streamflows in watersheds that drain slowly from deep groundwater and receive precipitation as snow are most sensitive to climate warming. During the spring, however, watersheds that drain rapidly and receive precipitation as snow are most sensitive to climate warming. Our results indicate that not all trends in western United States are associated with changes in snowpack dynamics; we observe declining streamflow in late fall and winter in rain-dominated watersheds as well. These empirical findings support both theory and hydrologic modelling and have implications for how streamflow sensitivity to warming is interpreted across broad regions.

40|$|Medium {{consumption}} {{is a significant}} component {{of the cost of}} operating a dense medium plant. This study aimed to identify and quantify many of the factors contributing to overall consumption, through extensive surveys of four widely differing dense medium mineral separation plants, and associated laboratory experiments. Particular attention was given to the effect of operating density on medium loss. It was concluded that quite modest increases in operating density significantly increased loss from all sources. Density should therefore be minimised, commensurate with process requirements. There is also unequivocal evidence that consumption increases significantly with plant downtime, probably due to housekeeping wastage and overloading of regeneration circuits during the return of dumped medium to circuit. Other conclusions related to the effects of feedrate, ore porosity, medium viscosity, screen washing configuration, screen <b>drainage</b> <b>efficiency</b> and medium size on medium loss.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{fundamentally}} {{important to make}} sure that compliance for mining is not issued on the basis of gas content tests that are inadequately located, deficient in frequency or in error. This paper covers some of the issues in relation to location and frequency of cores and validation of gas content test results. Core locations are discussed in the context of recent findings on the reduction of gas <b>drainage</b> <b>efficiency</b> towards the end of in-seam, cross panel boreholes. Some guidelines for sample frequency are given, with increased frequency being required in circumstances involving departure from “normal ” conditions as defined through analysis of past data. The gas content validation methodology is set up to provide rulings on gas content test results at the time of reporting, and is intended to aid mine staff in better evaluating test data as {{part of the process of}} issuing management plan conformance notices...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Multi-Lateral technology is defined as the drilling and completion of more than one wellbore from a single "mother" hole. The benefits of having multiple boreholes in a single well include increased flow rates, increased reserves, lower production costs, and improved <b>drainage</b> patterns or <b>efficiencies.</b> Candidate selection for multi-lateral technology has not been standardized and few literature references exist that can help individuals plan a multi-lateral well. Multilateral well candidate selection is usually tied to the results of a detailed and complex reservoir analysis. In many cases, small and independent companies are reluctant to apply multi-lateral technology without conducting a detailed economic analysis. In this research, we have developed a new easy, simple and fast, yet technically sound, method to screen candidate wells for possible application of multi-lateral technology. The new screening method is based on the simulation of human thinking by using a fuzzy logic model. This fuzzy logic model was built based on the personal experiences of industry experts in multi-lateral technology, as well as existing case histories of applications of multi-lateral technology found in the literature. The new model determines the best type of primary well configuration, choosing from a vertical well, horizontal well or a multi-lateral well. If the model suggests a multi-lateral well as the most appropriate option, the model then determ-nines the best multi-lateral configuration, choosing from a dual-opposed completion, a planar completion or a stacked completion. The output from the model is the level of confidence that the selected well configuration will be a technical success, based on the knowledge and experience used to build the model. The model was validated with four successful cases of application of multi-lateral technology published in the literature. The multi-lateral fuzzy logic model can be used to analyze the possibilities of applying multi-lateral technology for specific reservoir situations, limited to oil, onshore reservoirs composed of a single type of matrix. The model, however, should not be relied upon as the only screening tool. Numerical reservoir and economic models must also be used to determine expected well performance and to compute detailed economic analysis of all possible options...|$|R
40|$|Water is the {{principal}} limiting resource in Australian broadacre farming, and the efficiency with which farmers use water to produce various products is a major determinant both of farm profit and {{of a range of}} natural resource management (NRM) outcomes. We propose a conceptual framework based on multiple water use efficiencies (WUEs) {{that can be used to}} gain insight into high-level comparisons of the productivity and sustainability of alternative farming practices across temporal and spatial scales. The framework is intended as a data aggregation and presentation device. It treats flows of water, biomass and money in a mixed farming system; economic inefficiencies in these flows are tracked as they are associated with a range of NRM indicators. We illustrate the use of the framework, and its place in a larger research programme, by employing it to synthesise the results from a set of modelling analyses of the effect of land use choices on long-term productivity and a range of NRM indicators (frequency of low ground cover, deep drainage, N leaching rates and rate of change in surface soil organic carbon). The analyses span scales from single paddocks and years to whole farms and have been carried out with the APSIM and GRAZPLAN biophysical simulation models and the MIDAS whole-farm economic model. In single wheat crops in one study, different land uses in preceding years affect grain yield primarily by affecting the harvest index. When the scale changes to cropping rotations, the critical factor affecting overall water use efficiency is found to be the proportion of stored soil water that is transpired by crops. When ordinated in terms of their water use efficiencies, a set of 45 modelled rotation sequences at another location are differentiated mainly by the proportion of pasture in the rotation; when rotations are ordinated using key NRM indicators, the proportion of lucerne pasture is the main distinguishing factor. Finally, we show that for whole crop-livestock farms at three different locations across southern Australia, the pattern of water use efficiencies in the most profitable farming systems changes in similar ways as cropping proportion is altered. At this scale, land use choices affect multiple water use efficiency indices simultaneously and commodity prices determine the balance of the resulting economic tradeoffs. Limitations to the use of the WUE framework arising from its relative simplicity are discussed, as are other areas of farming systems research and development to which it can be applied.

40|$|The {{potential}} of proximal soil sensing methods for high resolution investigation of soils {{in the landscape}} has been investigated. This addresses the need for improved environmental monitoring and management of soils within their environs. On-the-go electromagnetic (EM) mapping {{has been used to}} map soils, providing a high resolution (< 10 m) spatially defined soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) datalayer. Vis-NIR field spectroscopy has been trialled for in situ analysis of soil carbon, nitrogen and moisture. The portable spectroradiometer has been used at 6 sites in the Taupo-Rotorua region for rapid, field analysis of soil carbon (R 2 calibration = 0. 95, R 2 prediction = 0. 75,) soil nitrogen (R 2 calibration = 0. 95, R 2 prediction = 0. 86) and moisture (R 2 calibration = 0. 96, R 2 prediction = 0. 70) by collecting reflectance spectra from the flat surface of a soil core; and at one Manawatu site for soil moisture (R 2 calibration = 0. 79, R 2 prediction = 0. 71), where the reflectance spectra were collected directly from a freshly cut in situ soil surface. EM mapping and Vis-NIR field spectroscopy were used in combination to spatially characterize soil moisture patterns at the Manawatu site. Soil available water-holding capacity (AWC) of ECa-defined zones has been assessed at six irrigated production farming sites. Two methods (predicted AWC v ECa; estimated AWC v ECa) have been used to relate soil ECa to soil AWC to predict spatial AWC (R 2 = 0. 8 at 5 sites). Site-specific soil water balance models have been developed at all sites; and a wireless real-time soil moisture monitoring network has been trialled at two sites, to be used with the ECa-AWC prediction model for the development of daily soil water status maps, for variable rate irrigation (VRI) scheduling. This digital, spatially defined soil water status information is available for upload to a sprinkler system modified for variable rate application. The calculated water savings with VRI were 926 % with equivalent energy savings and improved irrigation water use <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Drainage</b> and runoff were reduced by 055 % during the period of irrigation, with the accompanying reduced risk of nitrogen leaching. The reduction in virtual water content of product has also been assessed for VRI and compared with uniform rate irrigation (URI) at three study sites. This study suggests that these proximal sensing methods provide a new improved way of monitoring and mapping soils. This facilitates soil inventory mapping, for example soil moisture and carbon mapping. In addition, these high resolution environmental monitoring and mapping techniques provide the information required for optimizing site-specific management of natural resources at the farm scale. On-the-go electromagnetic (EM) mapping has enabled a step change in the pedological investigation of New Zealand soils. Resulting soil ECa maps provide a tool for improving traditional soil map boundaries because they delineate soil zones primarily on a basis of soil texture and moisture in non-saline soils. In this study the maps have been used for site-specific irrigation management at the farm-scale, aiming to increase the energy efficiency of this land management operation. The study has developed a method for improved use of freshwaters by more accurate irrigation scheduling, based on high resolution characterization of spatial and temporal soil differences...|$|R
