40|$|Parliamentary party groups {{typically}} comprise MPs {{with diverse}} preferences and different personal issue <b>emphases.</b> At the same time, speaking in plenary debates is a scarce resource controlled and allocated by parliamentary party group leaders. This has led recent research to investigate how speakers for plenary debates are selected. This contribution connects with this literature by asking whether MPs’ personal issue <b>emphases</b> deviate from their parliamentary party groups’ issue <b>emphases.</b> In order {{to answer this}} question, I measure the issue <b>emphases</b> which individual MPs devote {{to a set of}} issues in an open access parliamentary instrument and compare them to the <b>emphases</b> MPs devote to these issues in speeches. The results for the 2005 – 2009 legislative period of the Norwegian Storting indicate that MPs differ in how closely aligned their issue <b>emphases</b> are in these two instruments and that these differences vary in a way consistent with theories on candidate selection and individualized MP behavior...|$|R

5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its <b>emphasis</b> on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its <b>emphasis</b> on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual <b>emphasis</b> as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong <b>emphasis</b> on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the <b>emphasis</b> on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E
