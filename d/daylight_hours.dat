5|$|Adult Bahá'ís should {{observe a}} fast each year during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours</b> for 19 days in March, with certain exemptions.|$|E
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{adverse effect}} of {{daylight saving time}} {{may lie in the}} fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2011, it was {{reported}} that N.rajah has a similar mutualistic relationship with the summit rat (Rattus baluensis). Whereas the mountain treeshrew visits pitchers during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours,</b> the summit rat is primarily active at night; this may be an example of resource partitioning. Daily scat deposition rates were found to be similar for both mammalian species.|$|E
30|$|We also {{analyzed}} the daylight-hour data. The <b>daylight</b> <b>hour</b> is a quantity defined in meteorology {{as the hours}} of a day with sunlight greater than 120 watts/m 2. Looking in the solar direction during the daytime with a pyrheliometer and integrating the amount, the <b>daylight</b> <b>hour</b> of a day was determined. When the sunlight was weaker than 120 watts/m 2, we could not identify the shadow on the ground induced by the sun.|$|R
60|$|The fair {{summer evening}} was tending towards twilight; the sun stood fiery {{and low in}} a {{cloudless}} horizon; the last loveliness of the last quietest <b>daylight</b> <b>hour</b> was fading on the violet sky, as I entered the square.|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} four captive bobcats (Felis rufus), two males and two females, was {{observed}} for 102. 67 hours over the period of one year. A pilot study was conducted consisting of {{a minimum of three}} separate observations for each <b>daylight</b> <b>hour.</b> The remaining observations were concentrated during the early morning hours immediately after feeding, the time of maximum activity and social interaction...|$|R
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours,</b> thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of <b>daylight</b> <b>hours</b> varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.|$|E
5000|$|Highway 6 {{continues}} north, {{passing through}} communities such as Manitowaning, Sheguiandah, and Little Current. At Little Current, Highway 6 crosses the North Channel by the Little Current Swing Bridge, which swings open for 15 minutes of each <b>daylight</b> <b>hour</b> {{in the summer}} to allow boats {{to pass through the}} channel. [...] This crossing is the only permanent 2-way one-lane bottleneck of the Ontario King's Highways.|$|R
30|$|Weather data as {{radiation}} (MJ m− 2), <b>daylight</b> (<b>hour),</b> rainfall (mm), evaporation (mm), {{average temperature}} (°C), vapor pressure (kPa), relative humidity (%) and wind speed (m s− 1) {{were collected from}} the IRRI meteorological station. Average daily air temperature throughout crop cycle was 25.6 [*]±[*] 1.5  °C. The average daily PAR for the whole crop cycle was 31.0 [*]±[*] 11.3  mol m− 2 d− 1, and the average relative humidity was 84.2 [*]±[*] 4.8  %.|$|R
50|$|Kizukuri Station has {{a single}} {{ground-level}} side platform serving a single bi-directional line. The station building is attended during normal <b>daylight</b> operating <b>hours.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours.</b> They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a {{dominant}} male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28January, the 4thDestroyer Flotilla resumed its journey south and put into Bergen. Z31 entered one of the town's docks to be {{repaired}} while Z34 and Z38 departed on the evening of 28January. The two ships were attacked from the air the next day, but did not suffer any damage and sheltered in a fjord south of Stavanger during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours.</b> They put to sea again on the evening of 29January and eventually reached Kiel in Germany on 1February.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied {{supplies}} and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours,</b> while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand the several Japanese drives to retake the islands.|$|E
50|$|The Labor Party was {{defending}} a seat {{that they had}} held continuously since 1924. The by-election was held {{in conjunction with the}} state referendum on <b>daylight</b> saving <b>hours.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mutsu-Morita Station has a dual opposed side {{platform}}s, but one {{platform is}} not in use, and the other serves bi-directional traffic. The station building is attended during normal <b>daylight</b> operating <b>hours.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing <b>daylight</b> into twelve <b>hours</b> regardless of daytime, so that each <b>daylight</b> <b>hour</b> was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|R
5|$|India and Pakistan jointly {{hosted the}} 1987 tournament, {{the first time}} that the {{competition}} was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter <b>daylight</b> <b>hours</b> in the Indian subcontinent compared with England's summer. Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in World Cup final history.|$|E
5|$|The University Parks are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland {{area in the}} {{northeast}} of the city. It {{is open to the}} public during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours.</b> As well as providing gardens and exotic plants, the Parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures, and also contains sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>daylight</b> <b>hours</b> of 28 July saw {{continuous}} {{fire from the}} Pashtun sharpshooters established in the hills surrounding Malakand South. The garrison surgeon, Lieutenant J.H. Hugo, treated a number of British casualties including an officer from the Guides. Despite further attacks during the night of July 28/29, the British recorded only two killed from the sepoy ranks, and the severe wounding of a Lieutenant Ford. Churchill records that Ford's bleeding artery was clamped shut by Hugo despite being under fire.|$|E
5|$|Manipulating growing {{conditions}} on plants in cultivation showed that longer <b>daylight</b> (16 <b>hours</b> vs 8 hours) led to {{development of more}} flower spikes, indicating that flower initiation was related to day length.|$|R
5000|$|In {{nature and}} climate, bigger systems often display more {{pronounced}} lag effects. The Arctic Sea Ice minimum is on September 17, {{three months after}} the peak in <b>daylight</b> (sunshine) <b>hours</b> in the northern hemisphere, according to NASA.|$|R
5000|$|The service still {{continues}} {{to carry out}} non-emergency hospital transfers during both <b>daylight</b> and darkness <b>hours.</b>|$|R
5|$|With {{the bowl}} game, Maryland {{finished}} {{the season with}} an 8–5 record. The win was Maryland's 600thin school history. Ralph Friedgen's postseason record improved to 4–2, which gave him twice as many bowl wins as any other head coach in school history. For the 2008 season, Maryland stood 5–1in games decided by seven points or less and 8–0in games kicked off during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours</b> by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the heavier}} {{concentration}} of Japanese surface combat vessels and their well-positioned logistical base at Simpson Harbor, Rabaul, and their {{victory at the}} Battle of Savo Island in early August, the Japanese had established operational control over the waters around Guadalcanal at night. However, any Japanese ship remaining within range—about —of American aircraft at Henderson Field, during the <b>daylight</b> <b>hours,</b> {{was in danger of}} damaging air attacks. This persisted for the months of August and September, 1942. The presence of Admiral Scott's task force at Cape Esperance represented the U.S. Navy's first major attempt to wrest night time operational control of waters around Guadalcanal away from the Japanese.|$|E
6000|$|Pluck the others, {{but still}} {{remember}} [...] Their herald out of dim December,-- [...] The morning star {{of all the}} flowers, [...] The pledge of <b>daylight's</b> lengthened <b>hours,</b> [...] Nor, midst the roses, e'er forget [...] The virgin, virgin violet."[4] ...|$|R
30|$|We {{analyzed}} {{trees that}} have survived on Yaku island (Yakushima) for 2, 000 years. Quite surprisingly, the Fourier and wavelet {{analyses of the}} annual growth rate identified 2 cycles of periodicities of 11 and (24 ± 4) years during the Oort, Wolf, Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton minima. The 11 -year periodicity originated from solar activity, while the (24 ± 4)-year periodicity {{may be related to}} the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). In particular, we have discovered an 11 -year periodicity in the meteorological daylight-hour data from Yakushima in the month of June during 1938 to 2013 and a 24 -year periodicity in July. The growth rate of the tree rings may be affected by the variation of the <b>daylight</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Indian-head pattern could {{variously}} be seen: after sign-off {{but while}} the station was still transmitting; while transmitting prior to a typical 6 AM formal sign-on; or even during the <b>daylight</b> morning <b>hours</b> on newer low budget stations, which typically began their broadcast day with midday local programming around 10 or 11 AM.|$|R
5|$|During the <b>daylight</b> <b>hours,</b> Jericho's {{powers are}} gone, {{so he has}} to fight as a normal human, using a wide variety of weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a {{crossbow}} firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of <b>daylight</b> <b>hours</b> and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Naked eye {{observations}} of Venus during <b>daylight</b> <b>hours</b> exist in several anecdotes and records. Astronomer Edmund Halley calculated its maximum naked eye brightness in 1716, when many Londoners were alarmed by its {{appearance in the}} daytime. French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once witnessed a daytime apparition of the planet while at a reception in Luxembourg. Another historical daytime observation of the planet {{took place during the}} inauguration of the American president Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., on 4 March 1865. Although naked eye visibility of Venus phases is disputed, records exist of {{observations of}} its crescent.|$|E
50|$|Although Sauðárkrókur doesn't {{experience}} polar night, {{the shortest}} length of <b>daylight</b> is 3 <b>hours</b> 1 minute, from 11:46 UTC until 14:47 UTC on the winter solstice.|$|R
50|$|The Chief Mountain {{crossing}} {{is typically}} open only from {{mid to late}} May to late September or October, during <b>daylight</b> and evening <b>hours,</b> based on weather conditions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} corporal, with a curious {{certainty}} that jarred on Ingleby's nerves, [...] "Probyn's back yonder, {{and it will}} be <b>daylight</b> in an <b>hour.</b> We'd better look for him." ...|$|R
