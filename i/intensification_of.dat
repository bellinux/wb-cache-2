30|$|It {{seems that}} the EAWM was active since {{as long ago as}} 20  Ma, but was likely very weak until 13 – 12  Ma when it began to intensify. The second phase <b>of</b> EAWM <b>intensification</b> {{occurred}} at ca. 2.6  Ma alongside the reorganization of atmospheric circulation. The third phase <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> occurred at 1.2  Ma, when EAWM intensity further increased during glacial periods (Sun et al. 2010 a). Superimposed on these stepwise <b>intensifications</b> <b>of</b> the EAWM are short-lived decreases in its intensity during ca. 12 to 10 and 5 to 3  Ma; the latter roughly corresponds to the time of mid-Pliocene warmth (Raymo et al. 1996).|$|R

This will however require a precise description of the auroral source, which is extremely variable both in space and time, and connected with this, a more local approach involving {{a different set of}} basis functions.|$|R
40|$|Forest as {{a natural}} {{resource}} is an unlimited value gift from God the Almighty for all of human beings in this world. It does not only give life for society surround it but also it gives benefits for general public. However, philosophycal value of the forest is getting more decrease and decrease. The cause is the forest management which doesn`t care of the philisophycal essence of the forest. So biological environment of the forest is unbalance. Instead of forest region in Indonesia is getting more decrease and decrease, most of them has already become susceptible region of natural disasters such as flood, dryness and landslide. The special effort is needed to solve this problem. That reason attracts the researcher`s motivation to do the research about effort <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> and rehabilitation <b>of</b> environment in Bumiaji, Batu, forest condition in Batu, 60 % is in Bumiaji region level of forest damage in Bumiaji is 5900 ha. And it cause the decrease of the rate of spring for about 50 %. The researcher realizes that Bumiaji region is threatened so he has a fresh and relevant idea to recover the critical condition of the environment, namely effort <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> and rehabilitation <b>of</b> environment in Bumiaji, Batu. Statement of problem, (1) what are the efforts <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> and rehabilitation <b>of</b> environment in Bumiaji, Batu? And (2) what are the obstacles in the efforts <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> and rehabilitation <b>of</b> environment in Bumiaji, Batu? Purpose of the study are (1) to know the efforts <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> and rehabilitation <b>of</b> environment in Bumiaji, Batu (2) to know the abstacle in efforts <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> and rehabilitation <b>of</b> environment in Bumiaji, Batu. Research metodology used here is qualitative descriptive. In this research, taken sample are 20 people by ignoring the gender and it used sampling purposive technique. In determining of an analysis, the researcher chooses descriptive data analysis with interactive model which consists of 4 step: collecting data, reducting data (processing data), presentation of data, and determining of conclusing (verification). Then in related literatur, the researcher tends to the action theory of Hinkle in Mac Iver Work collective attitude of Horton and Hunt, Korblum, Light, Keller, and Calhoum. In the action theory shows unsatisfaktions feeling so it causes an action, in collective theory how the unsatisfaktions in society do cooperative with another to reach the goal. From the data collection throrough data presentation, the researcher finds that effort <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> and rehabilitation <b>of</b> environment in Bumiaji, Batu, specifically reforestation in forest area, reforestation in out of forest area surrounds the road, river bank, springs, garden, natural tourism object, home yard, school yard, office yard, and house of worship, voluntary labor service in the cleaness of environment and healty gathering place, developing of friendly agriculture environment and natural sports. The obstacle is the low rate of public awarnees. The taken action is by giving information and quidline for {{them so that they}} have awarness to keep the environment conservation together in Bumiaji to make Bumiaji Ecotourism, to creak Bumiaji be agriculture environment and agrictourism, come true...|$|R

30|$|To summarize, we {{have reached}} the {{following}} conclusions on the proton auroral variations during the TSSO. The proton auroras during the TSSO can be either above or below their mean late growth phase values, but the relative variation is mostly within ~[*] 10 %. Since such a variation level is also common during the late growth phase, {{we do not see}} much evidence that the TSSO activity adds special and appreciable contributions to the proton auroral variation. Substantial <b>intensifications</b> <b>of</b> proton auroras occur after the auroral poleward expansion.|$|R

On September 10, a poorly organized band of stronger winds developed around the center, and Gustav was designated a fully tropical storm shortly before turning toward the north and brushing Cape Hatteras, then accelerating toward the northeast and away from the coast. On September 11, while under the influence of a non-tropical system over New England, Gustav quickly strengthened into a hurricane, in a process similar to the <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane Michael in 2000. Gustav reached its peak intensity of 100mph (160km/h) later that day.|$|E

Just {{before the onset of}} rapid intensification, the agency was unable to utilize the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme rapid intensification guidance due to technical errors. This likely contributed to even greater errors in the agency's forecast. Initial forecasts were consistently conservative with intensity and dramatic strengthening was not explicitly shown until rapid intensification was already underway.|$|E

Also, anomalous <b>intensifications</b> <b>of</b> the ionospheric density (determined from the fbEs) that exceeded the normal ambient background values for local time and location could be seen {{for a few days}} after the main phase of {{the magnetic}} storm (identified in the middle panel of Fig.  1 by the arrow labeled with the letters B and C).|$|R
30|$|Electric fields induced in the {{conducting}} Earth by geomagnetic disturbances drive {{currents in}} power transmission grids, telecommunication lines or buried pipelines.

The effect is maximal at high latitudes due {{to the presence of}} strong polar electrojet currents (e.g. Pulkkinen et al. [2012]; Viljanen and Pirjola [1994]). However, both observations and models show that massive GIC caused by <b>intensifications</b> <b>of</b> the magnetospheric ring current also pose a risk at low- and mid-latitudes, where the majority of systems vulnerable to GIC are located (e.g. Kappenman [2005]).|$|R
50|$|The {{view that}} {{technology}} {{is unlikely to}} lead to long term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included Ricardo himself.
