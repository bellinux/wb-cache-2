50|$|The name 'Bisley' {{was first}} {{recorded}} in the 10th century as 'Busseleghe'. Its manor was from earliest written records under the feudal lordship of Chertsey Abbey as part of Godley Hundred. It {{is derived from the}} old English words 'Bysc', meaning bushes, and 'Leah', a clearing. Therefore, it means clearing <b>where</b> <b>bushes</b> <b>grow</b> or in the bushes. The versions {{recorded in the}} 13th century were Busheley and Bussley, from such Westminster and Lambeth Palace rolls as the Assize Rolls.|$|R

60|$|The canoe was paddled {{to a spot}} <b>where</b> the <b>bushes</b> <b>grew</b> thickly by the bank. It {{was pushed}} among these, and the three, after eating some cooked deer's flesh which they had brought with them, {{prepared}} to pass the day.|$|R
60|$|Instantly I {{understood}} {{that we were}} ambushed and began to think very hard indeed. As it chanced we were passing across a large flat space upon the ridge, say seven or eight acres in extent, <b>where</b> the <b>bush</b> <b>grew</b> lightly, though owing to the soil being better, the trees were tall.|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't {{be easy to}} find a {{suitable}} place to camp on," [...] remarked Nigel, glancing at the bank, <b>where</b> the <b>bushes</b> <b>grew</b> so thick that they overhung the water, brushing the faces of our travellers and rendering the darkness so intense that they had literally to feel their way as they glided along.|$|R
60|$|Very {{slowly across}} the orchard and under the fence {{on the other side}} crept Peter Rabbit, his leg so stiff and sore that he could hardly touch it to the snow, and all the time {{dragging}} that piece of stake, which seemed to grow heavier and harder to drag every minute. Peter did not dare to go out across the open fields, for fear some danger might happen along, and he would have no place to hide. So he crept along close to the fences <b>where</b> <b>bushes</b> <b>grow,</b> and this made it very, very hard, for the dragging stake was forever catching in the bushes with a yank at the sore leg which brought Peter up short with a squeal of pain.|$|R
60|$|Hiding the canoe, I {{sat down}} in the sand on a little point, <b>where</b> dense <b>bushes</b> <b>grew</b> down to within a few feet of the water's edge. Head and {{shoulders}} were in plain sight above the water-grass. My intentions were wholly peaceable, notwithstanding the rifle that lay across my knees. It was near the mating season, when Mooween's temper is often dangerous; and one felt much more comfortable with the chill of the cold iron in his hands.|$|R
5000|$|In 1797, Francis Bailey wrote, [...] "...about {{five o'clock}} {{we arrived at}} Crab Orchard. Here we found a large plain or natural meadow, {{containing}} many hundred acres covered throughout its whole extent with a tall, rich grass." [...] Two years later, in 1799, Martin Steiner wrote, [...] "...then we crossed barren hills <b>where</b> only <b>bushes</b> <b>grew.</b> Now and then one saw a little tree." [...] There were many other such accounts indicating the open nature of the terrain {{and the presence of}} great herds of elk, deer, and bison.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked the}} length of the orchard's middle avenue between long, sinuous boughs picked out with delicate, rose-hearted bloom. When he reached its {{southern}} boundary he flung himself down in a grassy corner of the fence <b>where</b> another lilac <b>bush</b> <b>grew,</b> with ferns and wild blue violets at its roots. From where he now was he got a glimpse of a house {{about a quarter of a}} mile away, its gray gable peering out from a dark spruce wood. It seemed a dull, gloomy, remote place, and he did not know who lived there.|$|R
50|$|The Bomvana people, also called AmaBomvana, are a Southern African ethnic group. Their {{traditional}} homeland {{has been}} in Elliotdale, in the Transkei region of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The name AmaBomvana translates to “the red ones” so named after the red and orange ochre they cover their faces in. Large portions of the Bomvana people currently reside {{in the district of}} Elliotdale in the Transkei region between the Umtata and Mabse Rivers, in a region that has rolling hills, meadows, rivulets and rivers <b>where</b> <b>bushes</b> and trees <b>grow.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} at an angle of the house. Three windows looked out on to the lawn in front; that at the side into a large shrubbery, <b>where</b> the <b>bushes</b> <b>grew</b> up close to it; and Charlie decided that here, if anywhere, the man would take up his post. As soon, then, as {{he knew that the}} {{servants}} were clearing away the supper, he took a heavy cudgel and went out. He walked straight away from the house, and then, when he knew that his figure could no longer be seen in the twilight, he made a circuit, and, entering the shrubbery, crept along close to the wall of the Muse, until within two or three yards of the window. Having made sure that at present, at any rate, no one was near, he moved out a step or two to look at the window.|$|R
60|$|Now Eric {{walked to}} within two bowshots of the house, {{then sat down}} in a dell by the river, from the edge of which he could see those who passed in and out. Presently his heart gave a leap, for there came out from the woman's door a lady tall and {{beautiful}} to see, and with golden hair that flowed about her breast. It was Gudruda, and he saw that she bore a napkin in her hand. Then Eric knew, according to her custom on the warm mornings, that she came alone to bathe in the river, as she had always done from a child. It was her habit to bathe here in this place: for {{at the bottom of the}} dell was a spot <b>where</b> reeds and <b>bushes</b> <b>grew</b> thick, and the water lay in a basin of rock and was clear and still. For at this spot a hot spring ran into the river.|$|R
6000|$|... "Every summer during {{fifteen years}} has been a bloody one on the border. The sieges of Fort Henry, and Crawford's defeat, the biggest things we ever knew out here, are matters of history; {{of course you are}} {{familiar}} with them. But the numberless Indian forays and attacks, the women who have been carried into captivity by renegades, the murdered farmers, in fact, ceaseless war never long directed at any point, but carried on {{the entire length of the}} river, are matters known only to the pioneers. Within five miles of Fort Henry I can show you <b>where</b> the laurel <b>bushes</b> <b>grow</b> three feet high over the ashes of two settlements, and many a clearing where some unfortunate pioneer had staked his claim and thrown up a log cabin, only to die fighting for his wife and children. Between here and Fort Pitt there is only one settlement, Yellow Creek, and most of its inhabitants are survivors of abandoned villages farther up the river. Last summer we had the Moravian Massacre, the blackest, most inhuman deed ever committed. Since then Simon Girty and his bloody redskins have lain low." ...|$|R
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the <b>bush</b> <b>where</b> they <b>grow</b> within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} an angry yell {{rose from the}} distant village. At a long, steady pace, which taxed to the utmost Harold's powers as a walker, they kept {{their way through the}} woods, not {{pursuing}} a straight course, but turning, winding, and zigzagging every few minutes. Harold could not but feel impatient at what seemed to him such a loss of time, especially when a yell {{from the edge of the}} wood told that the Indians had traced them thus far--showed, too, that they were far nearer than before. But, as Peter, afterward explained to him, all this turning and winding made it necessary for the Indians to follow every step, as they would an animal, to guess the direction they had taken. The weather had been dry and the ground was hard; therefore the most experienced trapper would be obliged to proceed very slowly on the trail and would frequently be for a time at fault; whereas, had they continued in a straight line, the Indians could have followed at a run, contenting themselves with seeing the trail here and there. They came across two or three little streams running down toward the lake. These they followed, in some cases up, in others down, for a considerable distance, leaving the bed <b>where</b> the <b>bushes</b> <b>grew</b> thick and hid the marks of their feet as they stepped out from the water. Harold would gladly have gone at a run, but Peter never quickened his pace. He knew that the Indians could not pick up the trail at a rate faster than that at which they were going, and that great delay would be caused at each of the little streams, as it would be uncertain whether they had passed up or down.|$|R

6000|$|... "Now Umslopogaas, son of Mopo, hear! I {{had passed}} the forest, and had come, as it were, to {{the legs of the}} old stone Witch who sits up aloft there forever waiting for the world to die. Here the sun shone merrily, here lizards ran and birds flew to and fro, and though it grew towards the evening--for I had wandered long in the forest--I was afraid no more. So I climbed up the steep rock, <b>where</b> little <b>bushes</b> <b>grow</b> like hair on the arms of a man, till at last I came to the knees of the stone Witch, which are the space before the cave. I lifted by head over the brink of the rock and looked, and I tell you, Umslopogaas, my blood ran cold and my heart turned to water, for there, before the cave, rolled wolves, many and great. Some slept and growled in their sleep, some gnawed at the skulls of dead game, some sat up like dogs and their tongues hung from their {{grinning}} jaws. I looked, I saw, and beyond I discovered the mouth of the cave, where the bones of the boy should be. But I had no wish to come there, being afraid of the wolves, for now I knew that these were the ghosts who live upon the mountain. So I bethought me that I would fly, and turned to go. And, Umslopogaas, even as I turned, the great club Watcher of the Fords swung round and smote me on the back with such a blow as a man smites upon a coward. Now whether this was by chance or whether the Watcher would shame him who bore it, say you, for I do not know. At the least, shame entered into me. Should I go back to be mocked by the people of the kraal and by the old woman? And if I wished to go, should I not be killed by the ghosts at night in the forest? Nay, it was better to die in the jaws of the wolves, and at once.|$|R

40|$|Combining {{intimate}} storytelling with investigative journalism, City of Thorns {{takes us}} inside Dadaab, the world 2 ̆ 7 s {{biggest and most}} notorious refugee camp, through {{the stories of the}} people who live there. For readers of Behind the Beautiful Forevers and What Is the What. To charity workers, Dadaab refugee camp is a humanitarian crisis; to the Kenyan government, it 2 ̆ 7 s a 2 ̆ 2 nursery for terrorists 2 ̆ 2; to the western media, it 2 ̆ 7 s a dangerous no-go area; but to its half a million residents, it is their last resort. Situated hundreds of miles from any other settlement, in the midst of the inhospitable desert of northern Kenya <b>where</b> only thorn <b>bushes</b> <b>grow,</b> Dadaab is a city like no other. Its buildings are made from mud and its citizens survive on rations and luck. Over the course of four years, Ben Rawlence became a first-hand witness to a strange and desperate limbo-land, getting to know many of the individuals who have sought sanctuary in the camp. Among them are Guled, a former child soldier who lives for soccer; Nisho, who scrapes together an existence by pushing a wheelbarrow and dreaming of riches; Tawane, the indomitable youth leader; and schoolgirl Kheyro, whose future hangs upon her education. With deep compassion and rare eloquence, Rawlence interweaves the stories of nine individuals to show what life is like in the camp and to sketch the wider political forces that keep the refugees trapped there. Lucid, vivid and illuminating, City of Thorns is an urgent human story with profound international repercussions, brought to life through the people who call Dadaab home. [URL]...|$|R
