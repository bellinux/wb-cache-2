The morphology of basilar dendrites and spines of Golgi–Cox-stained neurons in the left and right hemispheres was digitally reconstructed and analyzed. We observed the following: (i) there was an inherent hemispheric asymmetry in control rats <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> period: <b>the</b> number of spines on proximal dendrites was higher in the left than in the right hemisphere; (ii) basal dendrites in controls displayed a diurnal variation: there was more dendritic material <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> period than in the activity period; (iii) chronic stress reduced the length of basal dendrites in only the right prelimbic cortex; (iv) chronic stress reduced spine density on proximal basal dendrites; (v) restraint stress <b>during</b> <b>the</b> activity period had more pronounced effects on the physiological stress parameters than restraint stress <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> period.

40|$|Background: Prior {{research}} has shown that the amygdala of carriers of the short allele (s) of the serotonin transporter (5 -HTT) gene (5 -HTTLPR) have a larger response to negative emotional stimuli and higher spontaneous activity <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> state than non-carriers. However, recent studies have suggested that the effects of 5 -HTTLPR may be specific to different ethnic groups. Few studies have been conducted to address this issue. Methodology/Principal Findings: Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted on thirty-eight healthy Han Chinese subjects (l/l group, n = 19; s/s group, n = 19) <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> state and <b>during</b> an emotional processing task.

However, most research was conducted in laboratory rodents subjected to standardized environmental conditions. Therefore, seasonal regulations of estrogen pathways remain poorly understood under natural conditions. Using immunohistochemistry, the expression of several molecules involved in the functioning of testis (i. e. 17 -β estradiol [E 2], P 450 aromatase, estrogen receptors ESR 1, ESR 2, and GPER 1 [also known as GPR 30]) were investigated in free-ranging fat sand rats, Psammomys obesus, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> breeding and <b>resting</b> seasons. Leydig cells showed a strong immunoreactivity for aromatase in <b>the</b> testis sampled <b>during</b> <b>the</b> breeding season only; however, E 2, ESR 1, ESR 2 and GPER 1 were present during both seasons. Sertoli cells showed a positive signal for E 2 and ESR 2 <b>during</b> <b>the</b> breeding season; though, all molecules, except GPER 1, were present <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> season. Spermatogonia were reactive for E 2, ESR 2 and GPER 1 <b>during</b> <b>the</b> breeding season and for ESR 1 and GPER 1 <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> season. During both seasons, spermatocytes-I presented a moderate reactivity for E 2, ESR 1, ESR 2 and a strong reactivity for GPER 1; aromatase was detected <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> season only. Spermatids and spermatozoa were present exclusively during breeding season and were reactive for all molecules; except round spermatids that were negative for aromatase. The functioning of the testis depends on finely tuned stimulation and inhibition systems.
