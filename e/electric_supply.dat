5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, an {{increasing}} number of areas were being provided with electricity, and train and tram lines were being electrified. In the area around Newcastle upon Tyne, this required the opening of power stations at Wallsend, Forth Banks and The Close.

In 1927, English Electric delivered 20 {{electric motor}} cars for Warsaw's Warszawska Kolej Dojazdowa. During the 1930s, equipment was supplied for the electrification of the Southern Railway system, reinforcing EE's {{position in the}} traction market, and it continued to provide traction motors to them for many years. In 1936, production of diesel locomotives began in the former tramworks in Preston. Between the late 1930s and the 1950s, English <b>Electric</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>electric</b> multiple unit trains for the electrified network in and around Wellington, New Zealand. Between 1951 and 1959, English <b>Electric</b> <b>supplied</b> the National Coal Board with five 51-ton, 400 hp electric shunting locomotives for use on the former Harton Coal Company System at South Shields (which had been electrified by Siemens in 1908) to supplement the existing fleet of ten ageing Siemens and AEG locomotives.

5|$|With the {{expansion}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>supply</b> industry in the early 1900s, power stations were built to supply homes with electric lighting. Around Newcastle upon Tyne this led to the construction of power stations at Lemington, The Close and Carville. Two supply companies built the stations, the Newcastle-upon-Tyne <b>Electric</b> <b>Supply</b> Company (NESCo) to the east of Newcastle, and the Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company (DisCo) to the west. To meet an increasing demand for electricity, NESCo commissioned Dunston Power Station (later Dunston A Power Station) on the Derwent Haugh, a large flood plain to the west of Gateshead, to balance the supply of the Newcastle area with the Carville station. Construction of the new station began in 1908, the work undertaken by the company of Sir Robert McAlpine. They completed the construction in the short time of 20months, and this was to be their first in a large number of power station constructions, following the decline of the railway industry. In 1910, the station was opened and began generating electricity.|$|E
