60|$|Tho. Nay, I don't know, {{but in a}} fright <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do.|$|E
60|$|I nodded my head again. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to {{keep myself}} {{standing}} upright.|$|E
60|$|So I wilted {{right down}} {{on to the}} planks then, and give up; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from crying.|$|E
60|$|L. Perhaps not. If {{you have}} heard them, and {{anything}} like them, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> want.|$|R
5000|$|Here <b>is</b> my music. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have to {{tell you}} how I feel. Know that your love keeps my love strong. Stevie ...|$|R
60|$|VERA. Will you {{let these}} men sit down if I give you this? (Takes off her peasant's necklace.) <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my mother's.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do to keep}} a {{straight}} face. I'd {{a pretty good idea}} where she 'ad gorn; and it wasn't Dalston.|$|E
60|$|But now {{my voice}} was fainter. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to get my breath. The room swam round and round before my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Every day I gazed on {{the lovely}} fruit, which became {{gradually}} {{more and more}} tempting-looking, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do not to break the magician's commands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} time for it,' said Elizabeth, 'nor {{patience}} if <b>I</b> had time. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can persuade {{myself to do}} to keep my clothes from being absolute rags.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They tell me I {{can have}} no other fate; that my malady is fatal; but I still hope and fight for my life; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have to give my country now." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{cared to}} know. There was naught {{to keep me}} from that balcony now, and with a long, running leap I sprang far aloft until my hands grasped its lowest sill.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do to keep}} awake, but I {{managed to}} do so {{with the aid of}} an early morning paper I bought on the train.|$|E
60|$|It {{was strange}} {{to be reduced}} to such {{indirect}} evidence on such a point as that; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get, and I had to be content with it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My sweetheart, when I saw {{you doing}} that Dream of What's-the-girl's-bally-name dance just now, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from rushing out on {{to the floor and}} hugging you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Such was my purpose. After {{three days}} more of recovery, I {{went down to}} the old place to put it in execution. And how <b>I</b> sped in <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have left to tell.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will go on," [...] he said; adding hesitatingly,--"Since you are {{not very}} well off, perhaps you would accept this trifle from me. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> only a shilling, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have to spare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{horse is}} worth five hundred francs," [...] he said. [...] "The cart {{is an old}} one--two hundred and fifty would pay for <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not much, you see, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} from him with a little shudder, {{and for the first time}} during the {{interview}} she hid her face in her hands. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to avoid speech.|$|E
6000|$|... "Was in {{the bushes}} by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn't let you know before at the pace you were going. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to hang on. Now then, you girls, get out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Resigned! What of that? I held my tongue! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do! I {{never knew}} {{things could be}} worse till I saw it was killing him, and then all I could do was still to keep silence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{hit it off}} {{rather well}} together," [...] said Comus, and added with {{deliberate}} bluntness, [...] "I suppose she got rather sick at my borrowing money from her. She thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> after." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Saturn is lovely; Jupiter {{is simply}} sublime; I can see double {{stars in the}} Lion and in the Virgin, where I had seen only a single one before. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{required}} to set me going!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is good. I {{came the}} same way. I have lost my wallet. There wasn't much in it, {{but a very}} little is much to me, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> had. I suppose you haven't seen {{anything}} of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aw, I served my {{apprenticeship}} in the jacket," [...] Al Hutchins sneered. [...] "And I've made you unlace me, Captain, {{when you thought}} I was croaking, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from snickering in your face." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carloman {{crept up}} to them--"Here I am at last!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Here, Richard, I have brought you some bread, as {{you had no}} dinner: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bring. I saved it under the table lest Lothaire should see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did so {{want to do}} {{something}} for you. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do--that little money. And then you were angry. I thought you didn't love me any more because I did not understand your work.... And that Miss Heydinger--Oh! it was hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|Deringham stood up, {{and thrust}} aside the bottle Hallam passed him. [...] "Before we {{go any further}} I want you to {{understand}} that if Alton is held up there until December <b>is</b> over <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> ask," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{brought you}} {{something}} to eat, Granny," [...] he panted, as he laid the fish at her feet. He was quite out of breath with running. [...] "It isn't much, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> something. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could find for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank God I am not able--if {{those are}} the signs. But yet I am an earl's son and heir. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can say. I wish you would believe me, but you will not. I know no way to persuade you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't so easy, {{by a long}} chalk! The {{rain had}} made the boughs mighty slippery, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to keep a foothold, but bit by bit I managed it, until at last there I was level with the window.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens, madam!" [...] ejaculated her husband. [...] "Ravenswood to give {{place to}} Craigengelt, a common gambler and an informer! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to forbear {{desiring}} the fellow {{to get out}} of my house, and I was much surprised to see him in your ladyship's train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I daren't. It {{will only}} take me half-way again, and I shan't {{be able to}} get away this time. Do you know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to come out just now? Generally I am as quick as lightning; but you had clogged my feet. I was nearly caught.' ...|$|E
60|$|EDSTASTON [continuing recklessly]. This isn't severity: it's tomfoolery. And if {{you think}} it's {{reforming}} my character or teaching me anything, you're mistaken. <b>It</b> may <b>be</b> a satisfaction to you; but if <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can say <b>is</b> that <b>it's</b> not an amiable satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{good luck}} to <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> say," [...] responded Mrs. Wilkins, [...] "and if it makes all the gals {{contented}} with their places, and all the mistresses satisfied with what they've got and 'appy in their minds, why, God bless it, say I." ...|$|R
6000|$|He smiled his old {{smile of}} fondness, but dimmed by pain and languor; {{and the heavy}} lids sank over his eyes, but to be at once raised. 'Lucy! Home, Honor! <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> wanted,' he said; 'you will be good to me, such as I am.' ...|$|R
