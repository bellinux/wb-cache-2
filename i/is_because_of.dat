5|$|The Circles of Sustainability {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable {{impression of the}} ecological sustainability of the city only because {{it is based on}} a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. Part of the reason that the city remains assessed at basic sustainability <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the low resource-use and carbon emissions of its poorer neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|Today, shetland sheep {{are mainly}} {{kept in the}} Shetland isles {{and a handful of}} other locales. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their ability to survive on {{infertile}} land that would otherwise be agriculturally useless. Their good-natured temperament is also a major attraction in keeping Shetland sheep. They are most commonly farmed for their prized wool, but they also may be kept for their meat.|$|E

5|$|While health {{insurance}} premium costs have moderated, {{some of this}} <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> insurance policies that have a higher deductible, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums that shift costs from insurers to patients.

5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{what happened in the}} aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E
5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. Therefore, it is not advisable to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E

5|$|Female hippos reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{five to six}} years and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed that female hippopotamuses may begin puberty as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. A study of hippopotamus reproductive behaviour in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during {{the end of the}} wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus spermatozoa is active year-round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring {{at the start of the}} wet season. After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.|$|E
5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived close {{together}} in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures.

The interns make a mistake in the surgery, and Harris is seriously endangered, but is rescued by the residents. The interns are put on probation and rebuked by Meredith Grey, although Harris tells Lexie Grey that she is not apologetic. Following the surgery fiasco, Harris approaches the hospital's chief of surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), and claims responsibility for the incident. He informs her that the reason she has not been fired <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his personal friendship with her father.|$|E

5|$|Here the key {{difference}} to notice {{is that there}} is no surface tension between the solid and the vapor for the second surface tension component. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the assumption that the surface of air that is exposed is under the droplet and is the only other substrate in the system. Subsequently, the equation is then expressed as (1 – f). Therefore, the Cassie equation can be easily derived from the Cassie–Baxter equation. Experimental results regarding the surface properties of Wenzel versus Cassie–Baxter systems showed the effect of pinning for a Young angle of 180 to 90°, a region classified under the Cassie–Baxter model. This liquid/air composite system is largely hydrophobic. After that point, a sharp transition to the Wenzel regime was found where the drop wets the surface, but no further than edges of the drop.|$|E

Jenna fears that Tracy will begin to overshadow her, but Tracy is quite pleased with his new job on the show. Liz and Jenna become more aggravated when Jack decides to {{change the name of}} The Girlie Show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, without consulting either of them. Jack has Tracy and Jenna appear in a promotion for the show, in which Tracy angers Jenna by forgetting her name and by not letting her speak. After the promotion, Liz tries to re-assure Jenna by telling her that nobody on the show likes Tracy and that the only reason that he is on the show <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Jack. Liz finds out that Jenna's microphone was still on, and everyone in the studio heard her say terrible things about Jack and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|Outsourcing {{is among}} some of the many reasons for {{increased}} competition within developing countries. Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, as an opportunity for increased income. As a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the outsourced services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic developing countries can decrease. It <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E

5|$|The element hydrogen, {{with one}} {{electron}} per neutral atom, is usually {{placed at the}} top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal; when it is considered to be an alkali metal, it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its atomic properties and not its chemical properties. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule (H2); however, the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules (such as dilithium, Li2) at high temperatures, when they are in the gaseous state.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, {{only some of the}} valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E
5|$|Leslie takes {{possession}} of the jinniyah and asks for his brother {{to be returned to}} life. Anson is returned, but in a decaying state, complete with injuries from the crash. Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson screaming {{at the top of his}} lungs and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson blows the house up trying to light the stove in an attempt to warm up. Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder wishes for peace on earth and she wipes out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to force people to be good, and so he ultimately wishes for Jenn to be free.|$|E
