500|$|A {{child of}} the Jim Crow South, Stengel has {{sometimes}} {{been accused of being}} a racist, for example by Roy Campanella Jr., who stated that Stengel made racist remarks from the dugout during the World Series towards his father Roy Campanella, Jackie Robinson and other black stars of the Dodgers. Bak noted, though, that Stengel was a [...] "viscous and inventive" [...] bench jockey, hazing the other team with whatever might throw off their performance. Stengel had poor relations with Robinson; each disliked the other and was a vocal critic. One widely quoted Stengel comment was about catcher [...] Elston Howard, who became the first black Yankee in 1955, eight years after Robinson had broken the color barrier, [...] "they finally <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> nigger, I get the only one who can't run".|$|E
500|$|... 1984 saw {{the release}} of the album's third single [...] "Panama", which {{features}} a heavy guitar riff reminiscent of Van Halen's earlier work. The engine noise was from Eddie revving up his Lamborghini, with microphones used near the tailpipes. Later, a video of [...] "Hot for Teacher" [...] was released and played regularly on MTV, giving the band a fourth hit which sustained sales of the album. Other songs on 1984 included [...] "Girl Gone Bad", parts of which previously had been played during the 1982 Tour amidst performances of [...] "Somebody <b>Get</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Doctor" [...] (most famously at the US Festival show), the hard rock [...] "Drop Dead Legs" [...] and [...] "Top Jimmy", a tribute to James Paul Koncek of the band Top Jimmy & The Rhythm Pigs. The album concludes with [...] "House of Pain", a fiery, heavy metal song that dates back to the band's early club days of the mid-1970s.|$|E

500|$|With Varsity a success, the 6th Airborne Division {{was ordered}} by Major General Matthew Ridgway, {{commander}} of U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, to advance eastwards. It {{was supported by}} the 6th Guards Tank Brigade, and many of the airborne troops used unconventional transport during the advance, including captured German staff cars, prams and even horses. Hill requisitioned a motorcycle for his batman and travelled alongside the 3rd Parachute Brigade as it advanced; at one point his batman stopped the motorcycle and relieved a captured German colonel of his binoculars before driving off again. Hill disapproved of battlefield looting and admonished his batman, although eventually relented by stating [...] "If you can <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> pair , you can keep them!" [...] At midnight, 27/28 March the division came under the control of British VIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Evelyn Barker, and became part of the general Allied advance through Germany towards the Baltic Sea, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade as the division's leading unit. German resistance continued to be heavy, but the division managed to advance at a rapid pace despite this, with the brigade at one point advancing fifteen miles in twenty-four hours, with eighteen of those being spent in combat. By early April the 6th Airborne reached the River Weser, with the brigade approaching it near the town of Minden, accompanied by armoured support; as it did so, the brigade found itself moving parallel to several German tanks, with Hill sitting on the rear of one of the British tanks. Both sides opened fire, but did little damage, the two German tanks managing to outpace the brigade.|$|E
500|$|Hank Williams, {{who heard}} both the Miller and Griffin versions, started {{performing}} the {{song on the}} Louisiana Hayride shortly after joining in August 1948. Horace Logan, the show's producer and programming director for KWKH, reported that the audience [...] "went crazy" [...] the first time Williams performed the song on the show. [...] In light of the live audience's strong positive reaction, Williams decided to record the song. His decision was questioned by his musicians and also his producer, Fred Rose, who felt that the song did not merit a recording. Williams, mindful of the reaction he received live, [...] persisted, and the recording {{took place during the}} final half-hour of a session recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 22, 1948. For this recording, Williams replaced the jazz musicians with a modern country music band, using a rhythm guitar, mandolin, string bass, drums and a steel guitar. [...] Williams' session band was composed of Clyde Baum (mandolin), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Louis Innis (rhythm guitar), Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Willie Thawl (bass). With little time left, Byrd and Turner replicated the musical arrangement they previously used on an Ernest Tubb session for a cover of Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "Waiting for a Train". [...] In the episode of American Masters about Williams, Drifting Cowboy Don Helms recalls, [...] "When they recorded 'Lovesick Blues,' Fred told Hank, 'That song's out of meter! [...] Got too many bars in it. [...] And you hold that note too long.' [...] And Hank said, 'Well, when I find a note I like, I wanna hold on to it as long as I can,' you know, just tryin' to be funny. [...] And Fred said, 'Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. [...] That thing is so much out of meter, I'm gonna <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> cup of coffee and when I get back maybe ya'll have that thing cut.' [...] And they did, but it was still out of meter. [...] So Fred lived with that the rest of his life." [...] Williams combined Griffin's lyrical arrangement with a two-beat honky-tonk track, borrowing the yodeling and beat drops from Miller's recording. [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] was recorded in two takes.|$|E

2500|$|Following MLS's {{contraction}} of the Fusion, Hudson {{was hired to}} replace Thomas Rongen as head coach of D.C. United on 8 January 2002. He continued to regale fans and journalists with his wit, stories, and quotes. He said, [...] "There's {{a lot of talent}} on this team, and I'm talking Anna Nicole Smith type of talent!" [...] upon taking control of the team in 2002. D.C. United finished {{at the bottom of the}} table in the East in 2002 with a record of 9-5-14, and were ousted in the first round by Chicago Fire by a 4-0 aggregate score in the two-game series in 2003. [...] "Someone <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> blindfold and a cigarette!" [...] he said during the post-game news conference. He was replaced by Piotr Nowak in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Georgiou {{began to}} perform his songs in London coffee houses and pubs. At first he tried forming a band, but soon {{realised}} he preferred performing solo. Thinking that his given name {{might not be}} memorable to prospective fans, he chose the stage name Cat Stevens, in part because a girlfriend said he had eyes like a cat, but mainly because he said, [...] "I couldn't imagine anyone going to the record store and asking for 'that Steven Demetre Georgiou album'. And in England, and I was sure in America, they loved animals." [...] In 1966, at age 18, he impressed manager/producer Mike Hurst, formerly of British vocal group the Springfields, with his songs and Hurst arranged for him to record a demo and then helped him get a record deal. The first singles were hits. [...] "I Love My Dog", charting on the UK Singles Chart at number 28, and [...] "Matthew and Son", the title song from his debut album, went to number 2 in the UK. [...] "I'm Gonna <b>Get</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Gun" [...] was his second UK top 10, reaching number 6, and the album Matthew and Son reached number 7 on the UK Albums Chart. The original version of the Tremeloes' hit [...] "Here Comes My Baby" [...] was written and recorded by Stevens.|$|E
