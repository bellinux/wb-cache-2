40|$|Objectives: To explore {{changes in}} {{indicators}} of the coagulation and fibrinolytic system in the serum of rats with renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. Methods: The study was carried out at the Nephrology Laboratory of the Second Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China between September and October 2012. A rat renal IR model was established, and serum samples of each group (8 each) were collected to detect the amounts of fibrinogen (FIB), antithrombin III (AT-III), tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen-antiplasmin complex (PAP), and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1). Results: After the start of reperfusion, the changes of FIB exhibited a “double-peak” appearance. The AT-III began to decline at 2 hours {{to the lowest level}} at 12 <b>hours,</b> <b>and</b> then gradually recovered. The tPA declined to the lowest level at 12 <b>hours,</b> <b>and</b> then increased to the highest level at 24 hours. The PAI- 1 began to increase at 6 <b>hours,</b> <b>and</b> peaked at 24 <b>hours,</b> <b>and</b> then recovered gradually. The PAP peaked at 6 <b>hours,</b> <b>and</b> declined to the lowest level at 12 <b>hours,</b> <b>and</b> began to recover at 24 <b>hours,</b> <b>and</b> was normal at 36 hours. All the above indexes were completely restored at 48 hours. Conclusion: At 2 hours after reperfusion, the coagulation system were activated, reaching a peak at 12 <b>hours.</b> Fibrinolytic <b>and</b> antifibrinolytic substances were activated at 2 <b>hours,</b> <b>and</b> the fibrinolytic system was inhibited at 6 hours, reaching a peak at 24 <b>hours.</b> Coagulation <b>and</b> fibrinolytic substances were restored to normal at 48 hours.  </p...|$|R
