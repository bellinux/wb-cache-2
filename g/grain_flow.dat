However, is the current pattern of regional <b>grain</b> <b>flows</b> consistent with regional comparative advantage in grain production in China? This paper examines this question by using a binomial logit model with a discrete dependent variable of provincial net <b>grain</b> <b>flows,</b> and the independent variables of regional comparative advantage indicators and other factors affecting the supply and demand in grain markets. The study reveals that the current pattern of China’s regional <b>grain</b> <b>flows</b> is consistent with the regional comparative advantage in grain production, measured by the comparative advantage indicators of Domestic Resource Costs Coefficient (DRCC) and Net Social Profitability (NSP). However, the Efficiency Advantage Indices (EAI), measured by relative grain yield, and the Scale Advantage Indices (SAI), measured by relative grain sown area, are not statistically significant determinants of the observed pattern of regional <b>grain</b> <b>flows</b> in China. This implies that government intervention in grain production is still an obstacle for the Chinese farmers to optimise their grain production mix...|$|R

50|$|In an aeolian environment, cross beds often exhibit inverse grading due {{to their}} {{deposition}} by <b>grain</b> <b>flows.</b> Winds blow sediment along the ground until they start to accumulate.

To examine the effect of their actions on the informal maize market in Ghana, a spatial equilibrium model was estimated under three scenarios: (1) Perfect competition, (2) Cournot-Narsh conjectures, and (3) Collusion. The results indicate that imperfect competition distorts <b>grain</b> <b>flows,</b> reduces consumer welfare and depresses traders’ sales revenue.

40|$|Journal articleSediment {{transport}} {{on the lee}} {{sides of}} aeolian dunes involves a combination of grain-fall deposition on the upper portion of the slip face until a critical angle is exceeded, transport of a portion of those sediments down the slip face by <b>grain</b> <b>flows</b> and, finally, deposition at an angle of repose. We measured the mean critical and repose angles {{and the rate of}} slip-face avalanching using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) on two barchans of different size in Jericoacoara, Brazil. Wind speeds and sand fluxes were measured simultaneously at the dune crests. We found that the mean critical decreased with increasing wind speed. We attribute this effect to turbulent shear stresses, the magnitude of which we quantified using 3 -D large eddy simulation modeling, that randomly act down the slip face (i. e., in the direction of gravity) to trigger <b>grain</b> <b>flows</b> at lower angles than would be possible with gravity stresses alone. We developed and tested a new predictive model for the frequency of avalanching that depends on both the sediment flux delivered to the slip face and changes in the critical angle with time. In this model, increasing turbulent shear stresses drive avalanching {{even in the absence of}} sand flux delivered to the slip face if the critical angle decreases below the slope angle. We also document that the mean critical angle decreases slightly with increasing slip-face height. These results have important implications for aeolian dune evolution, interpretations of aeolian stratigraphy, and granular mechanics. NS...|$|R
