40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{utilization of}} heat from waste water in sewage. During the year, temperature {{of water in}} sewage ranges between 10 °C and 20 °C and the heat from sewage {{could be used for}} heating, cooling and hot water preparation in building. The heat is extracted through a transfer surface area of the heat exchanger into the heat pump, which is able to utilize the low–potential energy. Different design and types of the heat exchangers in sewage are dealt with: heat exchangers embedded in sewage pipe, heat exchanger integrated in concrete wall of a sewage pipe, sewer pipe with special <b>double</b> <b>jacket</b> as well as double pipe heat exchanger.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Single pot mixer–{{granulator}}–dryer (high-shear granulator with in situ <b>double</b> <b>jacket</b> vacuum drying) and multiphase equipments (high-shear granulator {{associated with}} fluid bed dryer) are classically used for wet granulation. At present time, industrial production imperatives may require to switch one formulation from one equipment to another. Method: To {{compare the two}} processes and to define, for each of them, the optimal formulation domain, experiments were organized according to Doehlert experimental designs. Response surfaces were used to identify the levels of each factor (binder and filler ratios) inducing the more satisfying responses. The contribution of binder and filler ratios to granule properties was highlighted according to the process. Then the desirability function {{was used to determine}} and compare the optimal formulation domain for each process. Results and conclusion: In the studied formulation domain and for the considered equipments, the transposition from a single pot to a multiphase highshear granulation process did not seem to raise difficulties; the same formulations were out of specification for both processes and other trials, the technological properties were maintained or improved in the Fielder®/Niro® equipment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{photocatalytic}} {{properties of}} commercialized self-cleaning glasses {{have been evaluated}} by the degradation of stearic acid C 17 H 35 COOH (SA), selected as a model molecule representative of fatty dirt. The relative amount of SA has been determined by measuring the FTIR peak area in the range 2752 and 2992 cm− 1 corresponding to the C–H stretching bands. In order to estimate the thickness of one layer, the deposit of SA has been performed using the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) method, which allows obtaining organized monomolecular layers of amphiphilic organics on a substrate. The thickness of one SA layer, obtained by Langmuir–Blodgett deposition, has been correlated to the FTIR signal. The photocatalytic degradation of a SA layer of a controlled thickness {{was carried out in}} a <b>double</b> <b>jacket</b> Pyrex reactor equipped with a UV Philips HPK 125 lamp. The photocatalytic degradation rate of the SA layer with different thicknesses was determined. The SA degradation rate was investigated under UV-A and UV-B irradiations to determine the influence of the photon wavelength range on efficiency...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{specific}} mechanical energy (SME) and dough temperature {{at the end}} of mixing (Tf) on semisweet biscuit dough characteristics and biscuit quality were studied using an experimental mixer fitted with monitoring devices. The fluid circulating in the <b>double</b> <b>jacket</b> of the mixing bowl was regulated at variable temperatures and mixed dough samples were prepared at Tf of 23, 30, and 37 °C for three levels of SME input (20, 60 and 120 kJ/kg). Correlation analysis showed that semisweet biscuit length and thickness were independent quality parameters, influenced respectively by the Tf of dough and SME. Biscuit thickness and volume increased with SME input, but SME had no significant influence on the physicochemical characteristics of the dough. Biscuit length was related to the density and stickiness of the dough and to rheological behavior as assessed by fundamental and empirical measurements. A rise in dough temperature > 35 °C induced a dramatic increase in viscoelastic properties, leading to biscuit shrinkage. The increase of dough density with Tf seemed {{to be related to the}} melting of solid fat in the dough recipe. Melting of fat during mixing could also be a source of viscoelastic changes in the dough at Tf...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAt present time, {{industrial}} production imperatives can require the transposition of a formulation from one equipment to another. In order {{to evaluate the}} impact of such a switch on the properties of granules and tablets, investigations were undertaken on formulations manufactured both in a single pot mixer-granulator-dryer (high shear granulator with in situ <b>double</b> <b>jacket</b> vacuum drying) and in a multiphase equipment (high shear granulator/fluid bed dryer). Principal component analysis highlighted the major contribution of the binder ratio on granule size distribution, flow and packing ability whereas the relative ratio of mannitol and lactose, used as fillers, mainly impacted on compressibility and tablet cohesion. In the studied domain, the lubricant ratio did not explain the considered responses. Statistical analysis (comparison of means, analysis of variance and PCA) showed that both processes led to products with similar characteristics which demonstrated {{the ability of the}} processes to produce granules with close quality. However, Fielder 1 /Niro 1 granule characteristic data were found to be more dispersed, thus demonstrating a higher sensitivity of the multiphase process to formulation changes. Technological properties of granules and tablets were found to be maintained or improved therefore securing the switch from single pot to multiphase equipment...|$|E

50|$|Ieluzzi {{has a very}} {{distinctive}} personal style, {{which is}} one of the reasons he has become very well known among menswear aficionados. He tends to wear a <b>double</b> breasted <b>jacket</b> in a bold colour and/or pattern, often with a different pair of pants underneath. The jacket is rather different to a 'normal' double-breasted jacket, in that Lino has reworked his jackets to also look good with denim and a polo neck. He couples this with a cutaway collar shirt and a tie with the number seven on it. To top it all off he wears a western-style belt, a silver keychain, either a Patek Philippe or Audemars Piguet watch and a pair of double monkstrap shoes with the second buckle unbuckled (one of his signature style moves). The distinctive number seven tie started as a bit of a joke to celebrate his birthday on October 7 but the ties caught on with his fans and they are now his bestseller product. He is a big fan of the colours blue, grey and cream, thus these often feature in his outfits.|$|R
