40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon (TFEU) {{significantly}} {{changes the}} {{theory and practice of}} the delegation of executive powers to the European Commission, powers which resulted in 14, 522 legally binding implementing measures during the sixth legislature under the Barroso I Commission (2004 - 2009) (in comparison to only 454 legislative acts). The Treaty of Lisbon fundamentally alters the way this system works, and in turn the way everyone works with it, especially European and national public administrations. From obscure and informal beginnings in the field of purely technical agricultural markets in the 1960 s, the Lisbon Treaty has in fact made the so-called ‘comitology’ system (and the name) partially redundant. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, there are now two new legal bases; <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> (Article 290) and Implementing Acts (Article 291). This means that the ‘comitology’ world has been split into two. The new system makes a clear separation between tasks delegated to the Commission that only require pure implementation, Implementing Acts, and those that allow the Commission to amend, supplement or delete non-essential elements of the legislative <b>act,</b> <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts.</b> The main changes in the Lisbon system are related to this new category of <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts,</b> where committees cease to exist and the legislators have equal rights to object to individual <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> or even to revoke the delegation to the Commission altogether. Under this new situation the Parliament thus stands on an equal footing with the Council. The implications of these changes are considerable, in both practical and political terms, and therefore require serious attention from the EU institutions, Member States, and outside stakeholders. This short article attempts to address the key changes and questions. Based on the institutions’ Common Understanding on <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> and the new ‘Comitology’ Regulation 182 / 2011 /EU, which entered into force on 1 March 2011, we present the two new avenues and highlight all the important changes. We conclude with our considerations of the practical implications of the new Lisbon system for European and national public administrations...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{comitology}} – {{the system of}} implementation committees that control the Commission in the execution of delegated powers – has been characterised by institutional tensions. The crux of these tensions has often been {{the role of the}} European Parliament and its quest to be granted powers equal to those of the Council. Over time this tension has been resolved through a series of inter-institutional agreements and Comitology Decisions, essentially giving the Parliament incremental increases in power. This process came to a head with the 2006 Comitology reform and the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS). After just over three years of experience with the RPS procedure, and having revised the entire acquis communautaire, the Treaty of Lisbon made has made it redundant through the creation of <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> (Article 290 TFEU), which gives the Parliament equal rights of oversight. This article aims to evaluate the practical implications that <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> will entail for the Parliament, principally by using the four years of experience with the RPS to better understand the challenges ahead. This analysis will be of interest to those following the study of comitology, formal and informal interinstitutional relations, and also to practitioners who will have to work with <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> in the future.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{power of}} the Commission, the Parliament and the Council in the adoption of <b>delegated</b> and implementing <b>acts,</b> including {{the debate on the}} delimitation of the scope of these acts, has dominated the debate on the scheme of non-legislative acts introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. This chapter argues that approaching decision-making procedures of <b>delegated</b> and implementing <b>acts</b> only from an institutional lens is normatively insufficient, in two respects. First, it is incongruous with the Treaty provisions on democracy: not only an inter-institutional perspective is insufficient to ensure the democratic legitimacy of <b>delegated</b> and implementing <b>acts,</b> but also it ignores the relationships between the makers of legal acts and the outer sphere composed of citizens and legally affected persons. Secondly, it also overlooks core functions of procedures that are relevant to ensure the legitimacy of public acts. Procedures are a means to rationalise public action, by channeling information, weighing competing interests, and allowing scrutiny of the choices made. If designed accordingly, procedures could concretise democracy as a Union founding principle also in the making of <b>delegated</b> and implementing <b>acts...</b>|$|R
