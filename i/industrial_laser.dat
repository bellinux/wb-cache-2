500|$|Bond sneaks into Goldfinger's {{plant and}} discovers Goldfinger smuggles gold by melting {{it down and}} {{incorporating}} it into the bodywork of his car, which he takes with him whenever he travels. Bond also overhears Goldfinger talking to Chinese agent Mr. Ling about [...] "Operation Grand Slam." [...] Leaving, Bond encounters Tilly {{as she tries to}} kill Goldfinger again, but trips an alarm in the process; Oddjob kills Tilly with his hat. Captured, Bond is tied to a cutting table underneath an <b>industrial</b> <b>laser,</b> which begins to slice a sheet of gold in half, with Bond lying over it. Bond lies to Goldfinger that MI6 knows about Grand Slam, causing Goldfinger to spare Bond's life to mislead MI6 into believing Bond has things in hand.|$|E

50|$|Laser cutting for metals has the {{advantages}} over plasma cutting of being more precise and using less energy when cutting sheet metal; however, most <b>industrial</b> <b>lasers</b> cannot {{cut through the}} greater metal thickness that plasma can.

40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out with a Nd-YAG laser as a future dismantling cutting tool. At the beginning, <b>industrial</b> <b>lasers</b> could cut only small thicknesses due their small power (1 kW) but now, with the rise in industrial power (8 kW), it is possible to cut plates up to 100 mm thickness. This technique is practical with the use of optical fibers which allow to maintain the laser generator in a non-radioactive zone. This paper provides a synthesis of the measurements of aerosols and gases produced in different configurations (cutting in air and underwater) and some comparisons with other cutting tools...|$|R
50|$|Photonic curing {{is used as}} {{a thermal}} {{processing}} technique in the manufacturing of printed electronics as it allows the substitution of glass or ceramic substrate materials with inexpensive and flexible substrate materials such as polymers or paper. The effect can be demonstrated with an ordinary camera flash. Industrial photonic curing systems are typically water cooled and have controls and features similar to <b>industrial</b> <b>lasers.</b> The pulse rate can be fast enough to allow curing on the fly at speeds beyond 100 m/min making it suitable as a curing process for roll-to-roll processing. Material processing rates can exceed 1 m2/s.|$|R
50|$|There are {{generally}} three different configurations of <b>industrial</b> <b>laser</b> cutting machines: moving material, hybrid, and flying optics systems.

40|$|A non-lithographic {{process of}} rapidly {{fabricating}} metallic micromold masters for {{the manufacture of}} disposable polymer microfluidic devices is presented in this paper.

The machined micropatterns are then laser welded onto a metal substrate to form the final functional mold master. Multiple versions of the functional device are replicated from the assembled master by either soft molding polydimethylsiloxane or hot embossing polymethyl methacrylate. Several metallic micromold masters and polymer replicas are tested for dimensional accuracy and surface roughness to verify the developed microfabrication process.

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of laser cutting {{is the high}} power consumption. <b>Industrial</b> <b>laser</b> efficiency may range from 5% to 45%. The power consumption and efficiency of any particular laser will vary depending on output power and operating parameters. This will depend on type of laser and how well the laser is matched to the work at hand.

50|$|Commercial {{laser diodes}} emit at {{wavelengths}} from 375 nm to 3500 nm. Low to medium power laser diodes {{are used in}} laser pointers, laser printers and CD/DVD players. Laser diodes are also frequently used to optically pump other lasers with high efficiency. The highest power <b>industrial</b> <b>laser</b> diodes, with power up to 10 kW (70 dBm), are used in industry for cutting and welding. External-cavity semiconductor lasers have a semiconductor active medium in a larger cavity. These devices can generate high power outputs with good beam quality, wavelength-tunable narrow-linewidth radiation, or ultrashort laser pulses.|$|E
