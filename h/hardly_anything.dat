5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. <b>Hardly</b> <b>anything</b> is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E

25|$|Transforming Dacia into a {{province}} {{was a very}} resource-intensive process. Traditional Roman methods were employed, including the creation of urban infrastructure such as Roman baths, forums and temples, the establishment of Roman roads, {{and the creation of}} colonies composed of retired soldiers. However, excluding Trajan's attempts to encourage colonists to move into the new province, the imperial government did <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> to promote resettlement from existing provinces into Dacia.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Purge {{focuses on}} two main females, {{both of whom}} reviewers have commented on as complex and are {{integral}} to understanding the themes of the book. The novel begins with Aliide Truu, an elderly woman who has survived many of {{the horrors of the}} Soviet occupation of Estonia. The Aliide who the reader first meets has alienated herself from the local people, though strongly self-reliant. Though cloaked in a rough exterior, she represents a woman who has weathered considerable hardship. She has <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> in the way of motherly instinct, especially in regards to the other main character, Zara.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to receiving compensation, farmers whose land {{was used to}} build the structures were paid after the war to fill in ditches and trenches and to demolish pillboxes. Today, <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> remains of the anti-tank ditches, {{but at the time}} they must have been the most conspicuous of all the fortifications. A few remain, much humbled, as field drains or field boundaries, whereas others can be seen only as crop marks. In the case of pillboxes, the sum of £5 is sometimes mentioned to pay for demolition, but the challenge of demolishing such structures is considerable and it seems that most farmers pocketed the cash, treating it as compensation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hardly</b> <b>anything</b> {{is known}} for sure of Cnut's life until the year {{he was part of}} a Scandinavian force under his father, King Sweyn, in his {{invasion}} of England in summer 1013. It was the climax to a succession of Viking raids spread over a number of decades. Following their landing in the Humber the kingdom fell to the Vikings quickly, and {{near the end of the}} year King Æthelred fled to Normandy, leaving Sweyn Forkbeard in possession of England. In the winter, Forkbeard was in the process of consolidating his kingship, with Cnut left in charge of the fleet and the base of the army at Gainsborough.|$|E
25|$|Ashur-nadin-ahhe II, {{whose name}} is a {{personal}} Assyrian name meaning “Ashur has given a brother” (c. 1387 BC – c. 1378 BC), also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from the Egyptian Empire, probably {{in an attempt to}} gain Assyrian military support against the Egyptian Empire's rivals in West Asia: the Hittite Empire and the Mitanni. However, the Assyrian king appears to have been in a strong enough position to challenge neither the Mitanni nor the Hittites. Two Assyrian kings ruling between c. 1430 BC – c. 1379 BC were called Ashur-nadin-ahhe. <b>Hardly</b> <b>anything</b> is known about these kings, but one of them is mentioned in one of the Amarna letters. In the letter from king Ashur-uballit I of Assyria to the pharaoh of the Egyptian Empire, numbered EA 16, Ashur-nadin-ahhe II is referred to as his ancestor who wrote to Egypt and received gold in return. This would imply an earlier diplomatic marriage and alliance between Assyria and Egypt during his reign. The name Ashur-nadin-ahhe II mentioned in EA 16 has been contested as a faulty writing of Ashur-nadin-apli, another Assyrian king. He was succeeded by his brother, Eriba-Adad I, the first king of the Middle Assyrian Empire.|$|E

500|$|Kafka {{grew up in}} Prague as a German-speaking Jew. He {{was deeply}} fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who he thought possessed an {{intensity}} of spiritual life that was absent from Jews in the West. His diary is full of references to Yiddish writers. Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life: [...] "What have I in common with Jews? I have <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> in common with myself and should stand very quietly in a corner, content that I can breathe". In his adolescent years, Kafka had declared himself an atheist.|$|E
500|$|Mandodari's role {{is short}} in the Ramayana but very important. She is {{described}} as a pious and righteous royal lady. Compared {{to the rest of the}} panchakanya, Mukherjee considers Mandodari's life as [...] "less colourful and eventful". He adds: [...] "Mandodari seldom got prominence ... Her image lacks substance and fades quickly", though he lays stress on her love and loyalty towards her husband. Pradip Bhattacharya, author of the book Panchkanya: Women of Substance notes that [...] "there is <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> special that Valmiki (Ramayana) has written about her (Mandodari) except that she warns her husband to return Sita and has enough influence to prevent his raping her." ...|$|E
500|$|The American {{zoologist}} and ornithologist Joel Asaph Allen reviewed Animal Coloration in The Auk in 1893. Allen notes Beddard's {{remark that}} the book contains <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> novel, {{so that it is}} mainly a review of previous theories, but welcomes it as a review of the state of knowledge together with Beddard's critical commentary. Allen notes that Beddard could have gone further in criticising Weismann and Poulton on colour changes, but is [...] "glad to see [...] is willing to grant that the influence of an animal's surroundings may exercise a direct influence upon its coloration without the intervention of the agency of 'natural selection.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Approaches to the {{historical}} reconstruction {{of the life of}} Jesus have varied from the [...] "maximalist" [...] approaches of the 19th century, in which the gospel accounts were accepted as reliable evidence wherever it is possible, to the [...] "minimalist" [...] approaches of the early 20th century, where <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> about Jesus was accepted as historical. In the 1950s, as the second quest for {{the historical}} Jesus gathered pace, the minimalist approaches faded away, and in the 21st century, minimalists such as Price are a very small minority. Although a belief in the inerrancy of the gospels cannot be supported historically, many scholars since the 1980s have held that, beyond the few facts considered to be historically certain, certain other elements of Jesus' life are [...] "historically probable". Modern scholarly research on the historical Jesus thus focuses on identifying the most probable elements.|$|E
500|$|Beddard {{explains}} in his preface {{that the book}} grew from his 1890 Davis Lectures given for the public at London Zoo. The book [...] "contains <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> novel, but professes to give some account of the principal phenomena of coloration exhibited by animals." [...] He also notes that since Poulton's recent book [...] "deal with colour almost entirely {{from the point of}} view of natural selection, I have attempted to lay some stress upon other aspects of the question." [...] Similarly, because Poulton treated insects in some detail, Beddard chooses to give more attention to other groups, though [...] "it is impossible not to devote a good deal of space to insects". The examples are mainly from Beddard's own observation of [...] "animals that may be usually seen in the Zoological Society's Gardens", though he also introduces and quotes the work of other scientists, including Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace.|$|E
500|$|Levin {{was born}} in London, the second child and only son of Philip Levin, a tailor of Jewish Bessarabian descent, and his wife, Rose, née Racklin. Philip Levin {{abandoned}} the family and moved to South Africa when Levin was three. The two children were brought up {{with the help of}} their maternal grandparents, who had emigrated from Lithuania {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. Levin wrote of his childhood, [...] "My home was not a religious one; my grandfather read the scriptures to himself silently and struggled through a little English; my grandmother, who could read no language at all, lit a candle on the appropriate days, as did my mother, though for her it was not really a religious sign. My uncles were quite secular ... and had <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> to do with the religion of their father and grandfathers". In The Guardian after Levin's death, Quentin Crewe wrote, [...] "His illiterate grandparents' stories about life in Russia must have instilled in him the passionate belief in the freedom of the individual that lasted his whole life. In return, as he grew older, he used to read to them. Bernard could not read Hebrew, but he could get by in Yiddish".|$|E

500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E
500|$|When Liszt {{started writing}} symphonic poems, [...] "he {{had very little}} {{experience}} in handling an orchestra ... {{his knowledge of the}} technique of instrumentation was defective and he had as yet composed <b>hardly</b> <b>anything</b> for the orchestra." [...] For these reasons he relied first on his assistants August Conradi and Joachim Raff to fill the gaps in his knowledge and find his [...] "orchestral voice". Raff, [...] "a gifted composer with an imaginative grasp of the orchestra", offered close assistance to Liszt. Also helpful were the virtuosi present at that time in the Weimarian Court orchestra, such as trombonist Moritz Nabich, harpist Jeanne Pohl, concertmaster Joseph Joachim and violinist Edmund Singer. [...] " [...] mixed daily with these musicians, and their discussions must have been filled with 'shop talk.'" [...] Both Singer and cellist Bernhard Cossmann were widely experienced orchestral players who probably knew the different instrumental effects a string section could produceknowledge that Liszt would have found invaluable, and about which he might have had many discussions with the two men. With such a range of talent from which to learn, Liszt may have actually mastered orchestration reasonably quickly. By 1853, he felt he no longer needed Raff's assistance and their professional association ended in 1856. Also, in 1854 Liszt received a specially designed instrument called a [...] "piano-organ" [...] from the firm of Alexandre and fils in Paris. This huge instrument, a combination of piano and organ, was basically a one-piece orchestra that contained three keyboards, eight registers, a pedal board and a set of pipes that reproduced the sounds of all the wind instruments. With it, Liszt could try out various instrumental combinations at his leisure as a further aid for his orchestration.|$|E
