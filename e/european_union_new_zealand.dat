Each country study provides an overview of its agricultural sector; explains government policy objectives; outlines public sector approaches to the various environmental and health-related issues confronting agriculture; details a comprehensive inventory of environmental and health-related regulations; and draws out key economic implications of complying with both current and prospective environmental and health-related policies, particularly as they impact on the international competitiveness.

40|$|Web 2. 0 technologies, {{denoted by}} their {{formation}} of social networks and the co-production of web content by users, have rapidly entered {{social and economic}} activities. Internationally, governments are racing to identify ways to utilize Web 2. 0 in government. In addition to government reports and taskforces, there is a proliferation of business advice and academic papers variously conceptualizing what so-called ‘Gov 2. 0 ’ might look like. Such deliberations seek to mobilize a range of different political and economic agendas, and as such view government 2 ̆ 7 s use of Web 2. 0 and associated objectives differently. This paper utilizes a Foucaultian-inspired governmentality analysis to identify the main political discourses and rationalities embedded within government reports, as evidenced in Australia, Canada, the <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>New</b> <b>Zealand,</b> the UK and the United States.

40|$|Agriculture is {{critical}} to feeding the world’s ever-increasing population but in doing so it uses the planet’s natural resources. Therefore, to remain viable and safeguard our natural resources, agriculture needs to be environmentally sustainable. Governments worldwide have introduced various methods {{to protect the environment}} under farming regimes, ranging from voluntary approaches to regulation. This thesis firstly compares two methods of legislation, that of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> and of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand.</b> Secondly it explores the views on environmental legislation of six farmers from the lower South Island of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand.</b> The literature review covers the subjects of the natural environment with respect to agriculture, environmental legislation in the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand,</b> the decision making process of farmers, and the impacts the legislation has on farmers. The legislation comparison was embedded in a study by the European Commission Directorate for Agriculture and Rural Development to which the author contributed. The results showed that there were limited differences between the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> with respect to dairy and sheep environmental compliance costs with no country studied being disadvantaged. The research for understanding the views of six farmers used a multi-case embedded exploratory method of research with qualitative data obtained from semi-structured interviews. The impact of environmental legislation on the farmers resulted in a number of outcomes including financial, environmental, risk to property rights, the influence of environmental groups and the public, and different interpretations and enforcement by those who administer the RMA. These outcomes affected the farmers by causing satisfaction, uncertainty and stress...|$|R

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines adaptation as “an adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. Adaptation activities can be technological (such as increased sea defenses), policy-based (such as improved risk management), behavioral (such as the sparing use of water in times of drought) or managerial (such as improved forest management) ”.
