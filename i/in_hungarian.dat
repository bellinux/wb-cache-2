40|$|Abstract Background The {{association}} between socioeconomic status and health-related behaviours has been clarified in several epidemiological studies. The {{aim of this}} study was to reveal the socioeconomic differences in health-related behaviours and in nutritional status of Hungarian and Romanian citizens living on both sides of the border. Methods A cross-sectional study based on interviewer-administered questionnaires was conducted on both sides of the Hungarian-Romanian border. The survey was completed by 1, 099 Hungarians (Hu) and 852 Romanians (Ro) aged 18 years and over; the overall participation rate was 92. 9 %. Demographic and socioeconomic factors, health-related behaviours (smoking, dietary habits and physical activity), body weight and height were recorded. All analyses were performed separately for Hungarians and Romanians. Simple descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to measure the associations between socioeconomic status and behaviour, as well as obesity. Results The prevalence of smoking was similar <b>in</b> <b>Hungarians</b> and Romanians (33. 2 % and 36. 4 %). The frequency of "unhealthy diet" was 70. 6 % <b>in</b> <b>Hungarians</b> and 75. 2 % in Romanians. Physical inactivity was more prevalent in Romanians (73. 2 %) than <b>in</b> <b>Hungarians</b> (32. 0 %), while the prevalence of obesity was higher <b>in</b> <b>Hungarians</b> (22. 0 %) than in Romanians (16. 5 %). Based on the univariate logistic regression models the risk of smoking was higher among those with medium educational level (ORHu = 1. 66) and poor financial conditions (ORHu = 3. 13) <b>in</b> <b>Hungarians.</b> The risk of unhealthy diet was higher among the low educated (ORHu = 1. 77; ORRo = 7. 91) and among those with poor financial conditions (ORHu = 2. 05; ORRo = 4. 25). None of the socioeconomic factors was associated with leisure time physical inactivity. In the multivariate models obesity was associated with medium level of education <b>in</b> <b>Hungarians,</b> and with unhealthy diet in Romanians (ORRo = 2. 10). Physically inactive Hungarians were more (ORHu = 1. 74), whereas inactive Romanians were less (ORRo = 0. 64) likely to be obese than physically active people from the same country. Conclusions The present study shows that socioeconomic status is associated with health-related behaviours in a small area of Hungary and Romania. The results highlight the need for developing interventional strategies, focusing more on people in lower socioeconomic status, in order to reduce the existing inequalities in health and health-related behaviours. </p...|$|R
5|$|In 1427, Stefan's {{successor}} Đurađ Branković had {{to return}} Belgrade to the Hungarian king, and Smederevo became the new capital. Although the Ottomans captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as Nándorfehérvár <b>in</b> <b>Hungarian,</b> was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456. As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Hungarian</b> historiography, the Battle of Arcadiopolis is {{considered}} {{as the final}} chapter of the Hungarian invasions of Europe, a series of plundering raids both westward and southward {{since the end of}} the 9th century. Following that the new Grand Prince, Géza consolidated his authority and also supported Christian missionaries from Western Europe (experiencing the fate of the Bulgarian patriarchate after John Tzimiskes's campaign against Bulgaria, when lost its independence), which led to the Christianization of the Magyars and the establishment of the Christian Kingdom of Hungary by the beginning of the new millennium.|$|E
5|$|King St Stephen {{has been}} a popular theme <b>in</b> <b>Hungarian</b> poetry {{since the end of}} the 13th century. The {{earliest}} poems were religious hymns which portrayed the holy king as the apostle of the Hungarians.

Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of the ability of the Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the Communist regime between 1949 and 1989.|$|E

5|$|The {{beginning}} of Szabó’s career {{coincided with the}} {{beginning of}} a “new wave” <b>in</b> <b>Hungarian</b> cinema, one of several new wave cinemas that occurred around this time throughout Western and Eastern Europe. The Eastern European new waves were caused by political liberalization, the decentralization of film industries, and the emergence of films as valuable commodities for export to Western European markets. The resulting films were more formally experimental, politically anti-establishment, and, {{especially in the case of}} Szabó, psychologically probing than the films of the previous generation. Hungarian filmmakers in particular experienced a significant increase in freedom of expression due to the reforms of the Kádár government.|$|E
5|$|The city {{started to}} lose its {{importance}} under the reign of Maria Theresa's son Joseph II, especially after the crown jewels were taken to Vienna in 1783 {{in an attempt to}} strengthen the union between Austria and Hungary.

The first newspapers <b>in</b> <b>Hungarian</b> and Slovak were published here: Magyar hírmondó in 1780, and Presspurske Nowiny in 1783. In the course of the 18th century, the city became a centre for the Slovak national movement.|$|E
5|$|Szabó’s {{next three}} films {{constituted}} {{a new phase}} in his career—moving away from Hungarian productions, <b>in</b> <b>Hungarian,</b> written by Szabó alone, and featuring Bálint, and moving toward international co-productions, in German, written by Szabó in collaboration with others, and featuring Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer. The informal trilogy—Mephisto (1981), Colonel Redl (1985) and Hanussen (1988)—features Brandauer {{in a series of}} roles based on historical figures who, as represented in the films, compromised their morals in order to climb the ladder of success within a context of authoritarian political power. In Mephisto, based on a novel by Klaus Mann, Brandauer plays an actor and theater director in Nazi Germany, a role based on Mann’s former brother-in-law Gustaf Gründgens. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and the award for Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival, and greatly increased Szabó’s international prestige.|$|E
