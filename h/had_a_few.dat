5|$|The Preserved County of Clwyd {{came into}} {{effect on the}} same day that Clwyd County Council was abolished. The {{preserved}} county was almost identical to the 1974–96 county, but <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minor changes in line with changes to local government boundaries, the communities of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, Llansilin and Llangedwyn being transferred from Clwyd to Powys.|$|E

5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E
5|$|Corbulo {{was given}} control over two provinces, Cappadocia and Galatia (modern-day central Turkey), with propraetorial and later proconsular {{authority}} or imperium.

He <b>had,</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland—the first had been Pope John Paul II).

The torpedo boat Mazur (412 tons) was sunk at Oksywie; the gunboat General Haller (441 tons) was sunk in Hel Harbour on 6 September—during the Battle of Hel—along with the minesweeper Mewa (183 tons) and its sister ships Czapla and Jaskolka with several auxiliaries. The Polish naval units trapped in the Baltic were destroyed by Ju 87 operations.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} college, Dickinson was {{selected}} by the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 183rd overall pick in the seventh round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Buccaneers' head coach John McKay said that Dickinson was considered the second best prospect on his draft board behind Richard Todd. Steve Spurrier had the starting job wrapped up when he was signed to the team, {{and as a result}} Dickinson spent the offseason competing for a backup quarterback spot alongside Bill Cappleman and James Foote. Dickinson started off training camp by throwing the hardest passes of the four quarterbacks, and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> accuracy issues in the process. Dickinson served as the second-string quarterback throughout the preseason. In a game against the Green Bay Packers, he led the Buccaneers to their first touchdown as a team. By the end of preseason, his place was on the roster was solidified behind Spurrier, as Cappleman and Foote were cut and replaced by Gary Valbuena and Larry Lawrence.|$|E

5|$|Freshman Sam Richardson {{came into}} the game the starter at quarterback, a role he held since the Cyclones' 53–21 win against the Kansas Jayhawks, which made them bowl eligible. Iowa State's leading rusher coming into the game was junior running back James White, who amassed 505 rushing yards during the season. One yard behind White with 504 rushing yards was Shontrelle Johnson, another junior running back. In the {{receiving}} game, Iowa State was led by a trio of senior wide receivers, Aaron Horne, Chris Young, and Josh Lenz, who totaled 39, 38, and 31 receptions respectively. Iowa State's offensive line <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> question marks coming into the game, including at right tackle where sophomore Jacob Gannon had made his first career start in the previous game.

5|$|From the 12th century on, the {{crossbow}} (called , tzangra in Greek) {{became increasingly}} important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon available until {{the advent of}} fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery. The Byzantines made infrequent use of the weapon, chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles. Cannons were introduced {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> artillery pieces for the defence of the land walls of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there is no indication that the Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E

5|$|Kaksparsh {{was shot}} in the real {{locations}} than sets and was mainly shot in Paalshet, a village near Guhagar in Konkan. As the film's story-line was set around 1930–1950, Manjrekar was concerned about the authentic production design for the film. He appointed two production designers, Prashant Rane and Abhishek Vijaykar, who had challenges of depicting pre and post Indian independence era. Rane had worked with Manjrekar earlier for De Dhakka (2008). Kaksparsh shooting was completed in 26 days; starting from 5 December 2011 till 30 December 2011. The initial shooting scheduled started at Ranade Wada in Pune. The film also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> scenes in and surrounding the temple but as most of the temples in Konkan region have been restored from their damages over the period of time, Manjrekar feared that the plastering done to repair the damages would not give the desired authentic feel to the film. Thus, the next schedule was shifted to Krishna Ghat, Wai, Maharashtra.|$|E

5|$|Near {{midnight on}} 20 May, Eichmann was sedated by an Israeli doctor on the Mossad team and {{dressed as a}} flight attendant.

After a tense delay at the airport getting the flight plan approved, the plane took off for Israel, stopping over in Dakar, Senegal, to refuel. They arrived in Israel on 22 May, and Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann's capture to the Knesset—Israel's parliament—the following afternoon. In Argentina, the abduction was met with a violent wave of antisemitism carried out by far-right elements, including the Tacuara Nationalist Movement.|$|E

5|$|President James A. Garfield died {{four days}} before they arrived back in the United States, and Kalākaua paid a {{courtesy}} call to newly inaugurated President Chester A. Arthur at the White House in Washington, D.C. There were no public or private appearances for the King in New York, only a day at Coney Island. Before leaving the eastern US, the King met with Thomas Edison to have a demonstration of electric lights, and visited Virginia's Fort Monroe. He toured Hampton Normal and Agricultural School, and shopped for horses in Kentucky. The royal party boarded a train to California, where they were house guests of Claus Spreckels at his estate in Aptos (near Santa Cruz), and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days of seeing the sights in the area before sailing back to Hawaii. Kalākaua was successful in jump-starting new immigration, with the first transplants arriving in Hawaii {{less than a year}} later. In the years that followed, he began emulating the lifestyles of European royalty with expensive furnishings in Iolani Palace, a public coronation of himself, and a two-week public celebration of his birthday.|$|E
5|$|Stiller <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minor {{roles in}} the early 1990s, in films such as Stella, Highway to Hell and in a cameo, The Nutt House.

Stiller devoted {{the next year and}} a half to rewriting the script with Childress, fundraising and recruiting cast members for the film. It was eventually released in early 1994, directed by Stiller and featuring him as a co-star. The film was produced by Danny DeVito, who would later direct Stiller's 2003 film Duplex and produce his 2004 film Along Came Polly.

Midway {{was running out}} of room and in any case could not handle the 707 and DC-8 jets that appeared in 1959; every Chicago jet flight had to use O'Hare, which had opened to the airlines in 1955. Electras and Viscounts could have continued to fly out of Midway, but O'Hare's capacious new terminal opened in 1962, allowing airlines to consolidate their flights. From July 1962 until United returned in July 1964, Midway's only scheduled airline was Chicago Helicopter. In August 1966 a total of four fixed-wing arrivals were scheduled, all United 727s (United was alone at Midway until early 1968).|$|E
