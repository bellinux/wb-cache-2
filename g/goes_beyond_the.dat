He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> concepts of spirituality and God.|$|E

25|$|Teaching that Christ is {{risen from}} the dead and is alive, the Catholic Church holds that when the bread is changed into his body, not only his body is present, but Christ {{as a whole is}} present (i.e. body and blood, soul and divinity.)

25|$|Reswitching {{implies the}} {{possibility}} of capital reversing, an association between high interest rates (or rates of profit) and more capital-intensive techniques. Thus, reswitching implies the rejection of a simple (monotonic) non-increasing relationship between capital intensity and either the rate of profit, sometimes confusingly {{referred to as the}} rate of interest. As rates fall, for example, profit-seeking businesses can switch from using one set of techniques (A) to another (B) and then back to A.

25|$|The best-known {{commentary}} on the Arba'ah Turim is the Beit Yosef by rabbi Joseph ben Ephraim Karo: this <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> normal functions of a commentary, in that it attempts to review all the relevant authorities and come to a final decision on every point, so as to constitute a comprehensive resource on Jewish law. Other commentaries are Bayit Chadash by rabbi Joel Sirkis, Darkhei Moshe by Moses Isserles, Beit Yisrael (Perishah u-Derishah) by rabbi Joshua Falk, as well as works {{by a number of}} other Acharonim. These often defend the views of the Tur against the Beit Yosef.|$|E

25|$|One unique view, {{which does}} not neatly fall into either of the cultural- or connectivity-gap categories, centers on the {{organizational}} differences {{between the military and}} civilian societies.

This view <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> simpler cultural-gap approach and emphasizes the ability of the military society to control the behavior and attitudes of its members in ways not possible in the more open civilian society, as evidenced by such phenomena as desegregation of the military and inclusion of women in the military.|$|E

It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|E
