Over {{the past few}} years it has become clear that reliably processing spatial data is necessarily accompanied by strict management of errors and uncertainties inherent to the data used. This paper presents a conceptual framework for reliable <b>digital</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>modelling.</b> Reliable <b>digital</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>models</b> emphasise both geometric and semantic aspects of terrain representation and provide information concerning their quality. Reliable <b>terrain</b> <b>modelling</b> involves producer as well as user of <b>digital</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>models</b> (DTMs) by presuming that the former is able to specify requirements for the DTM, and that the latter makes available a quality report of his / her products.

Sedimentology, 56 (7), 2024 - 2043. Sponsorship: NERCThe grain-scale topography of a sediment surface {{is a key}} component of a fluvial system, affecting aspects including sediment transport, flow resistance and ecology. However, its effect is hard to quantify because of the need for grain-scale elevation data from in situ fluvial gravel surfaces which are difficult to collect. The sediment surface properties are, therefore, commonly estimated {{as a function of the}} sediment grain-size distribution; however, because of additional factors, such as grain packing and shape, there is not necessarily a unique relationship between the two. A new methodology has been developed that uses terrestrial laser scanning to collect grain-scale topographic data from in situ fluvial gravel surfaces, from which <b>digital</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>models</b> are created. This paper investigates methods of analysing such <b>digital</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>models,</b> and possible sedimentological interpretations that can be drawn from the analysis. Eleven <b>digital</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>models</b> from exposed gravel surfaces in two contrasting rivers (the River Feshie and Bury Green Brook) were analysed by calculating: the distribution of surface elevations, semivariograms, surface inclinations, surface slopes and aspects and grain orientation.

40|$|A {{number of}} image {{analysis}} tasks {{can benefit from}} registration of the image with {{a model of the}} surface being imaged. Automatic navigation using visible light or radar images requires exact alignment of such images with <b>digital</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>models.</b> In addition, automatic classification of terrain, using satellite imagery, requires such alignment to deal correctly with the effects of varying sun angle and surface slope. Even inspection techniques for certain industrial parts may be improved by this means. We achieve the required alignment by matching the real image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources. The synthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection as a function of surface gradient.
