5|$|In May 2002, Payá {{presented}} NAPP with 11,020 signatures {{calling for}} a referendum on safeguarding {{freedom of speech and}} assembly, allowing private business ownership, and ending one-party rule. On 3 October 2003, he delivered an additional 14,000 signatures. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter endorsed the petition when granted a chance to speak on Cuban television, bringing Payá's efforts to the attention of a wide Cuban audience. Cuban President Fidel Castro described the petition <b>drive</b> <b>as</b> a U.S.-backed conspiracy to overthrow his government.|$|E
5|$|Louisville {{received}} the post-field goal kickoff, but again went three and out, punting {{the ball back}} to Virginia Tech. Louisville did not pick up a first down in the third quarter, and Tech began yet another <b>drive</b> <b>as</b> time ran out in the quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, Tech narrowed the Louisville lead to 17–13.|$|E
5|$|On April1, 2003, NY31C was {{effectively}} renumbered to NY317 and rerouted {{south of the}} intersection of Valley Drive and Elbridge Street in Jordan to follow the former CR105 to Elbridge. The washed-out section of Valley Drive was never repaired, leaving Valley <b>Drive</b> <b>as</b> two separate dead end streets. The New York State Department of Transportation has made plans to remove the bridge carrying Valley Drive (former NY31C) over Skaneateles Creek {{in the town of}} Elbridge. Demolition of the structure is scheduled to begin in mid-2014 and cost $300,000. Once removed, the bridge, built in 1921, will not be replaced.|$|E

5|$|There were {{tensions}} between Bute {{and the new}} industrialists around the region, including ironmasters such as John Guest, {{the master of the}} Dowlais Ironworks. Bute was a financial competitor or landlord with many of these men, and keen to <b>drive</b> <b>as</b> good a deal as possible in his negotiations with them. He also had political differences, seeing himself as a benevolent feudal lord in South Wales, and perceiving the local iron-masters as arrogant, power-hungry individuals, abusing their economic power towards communities and workers.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} {{building}} up a new newspaper, Kringen had a certain personal <b>drive,</b> <b>as</b> he ran for parliament in 1909.

5|$|An early road {{following}} the current path {{was established in}} the late 19th century for miners and loggers. As floods ravaged the road along Bear Creek through the early 20th century, measures were taken to prevent further damage. Other sites along Bear Creek, such as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in Red Rocks Park and the Bear Creek Canyon Scenic Mountain <b>Drive,</b> <b>as</b> the section between Idledale and Morrison is called, have given the route a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. An early designation of the route number went further west than its current-day designation; that section was truncated by the late 1930s. Another eastern segment was added from Morrison east toward Denver in the 1940s, but that section too was removed. Newer improvements to the road include widening the Evergreen Parkway segment to four lanes and constructing an interchange with I-70.|$|E
5|$|Before its September 2011 release, Drive {{was shown}} {{at a number}} of film festivals, {{including}} the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it was praised and received a standing ovation. Refn won the festival's Best Director Award. The film received widespread praise, with critics highlighting Refn's direction, performances by the ensemble cast, visuals and action sequences, and the film score composed by Cliff Martinez. However, some critics were appalled by its graphic violence and found it potentially detrimental to the film's box office success. Several critics listed <b>Drive</b> <b>as</b> one of the best films of 2011; it received various accolades, including Best Sound Editing nomination at the 84th Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside <b>Drive.</b> <b>As</b> proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the parkway began in 1935.|$|E

5|$|However, Bo's {{campaign}} {{was criticized for}} running roughshod over judicial due process and eroding the rule of law. Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labor. Lawyers for the accused were intimidated and harassed, and {{in at least one}} case, sentenced to 18 months in prison. Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, assets seized during the campaign were allegedly redirected to help pay for Bo's popular social housing programs. The Wall Street Journal reported that $11 billion went into government coffers through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, asserted that he became a target of Bo anti-corruption <b>drive</b> <b>as</b> a result of a land dispute with the government. When he refused government demands to give up the land, he claims that he was abducted and tortured, and that $700 million worth of assets in his business were seized.|$|E
5|$|M-119 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US31 about four miles (6.4km) northeast of Petoskey near {{the community of}} Bay View in Bear Creek Township. The highway runs north between Petoskey State Park on the west and Round Lake on the east as it rounds {{the east end of}} Little Traverse Bay. The trunkline passes the eastern and northern edges of the Harbor Springs Municipal Airport as it turns westward near the junction with C-81 (Pleasantview Road). Through this area, M-119 runs through the community of Wequetonsing and forests just inland from the bay's northern shore. As it passes into the city limits of Harbor Springs, the highway follows Main Street into downtown. It turns north and then westward along State Street in the middle of town, intersecting the southern end of C-77 in the central business district. M-119 continues westward, passing through a residential area on Bluff <b>Drive</b> <b>as</b> it leaves the city.|$|E

The Tar Heels traversed the court and Bob Young managed to score a basket to give Carolina the edge. However, North Carolina was unable to stop Kansas during the ensuing <b>drive</b> <b>as</b> Chamberlain scored a basket to bring the score to 4848. After Kansas score the tying basket, North Carolina {{proceeded}} to hold the ball for one final shot before time ran out. Carolina's Kearns drove and put up a shot that was blocked by Chamberlain as time ran out.|$|E

5|$|The breed {{remains very}} popular in the UK, with {{multiple}} winner at Cruft's, {{and is in the}} top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and Scottish whisky Black & White. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. The breed can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey <b>drive,</b> <b>as</b> they were once used to hunt rodents.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Emerald Drive interchange was scheduled for the year 1971. While the El Camino Real interchange was already a diamond interchange, the state planned to add traffic signals to the ramps to accommodate more congestion from the nearby mall. The Emerald Drive interchange was completed in September, {{and the rest of}} the project was to be completed by the end of the year, leaving Jefferson <b>Drive</b> <b>as</b> the only remaining traffic signal. Construction on the Jefferson Street interchange began in early 1972; the section from I-5 east to Melrose Drive (along the routing of the Vista Way Freeway) had been upgraded to full freeway standards as of 1973.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins to}} curve north, interchanging with Bridgeport Road. The highway crosses the Conestoga Creek as it {{interchanges}} with University Avenue, then gradually curves to the west. After an interchange with King Street, once the original routing of Highway85, the route curves {{back to the}} north and interchanges with Northfield <b>Drive.</b> <b>As</b> it approaches the rural–urban fringe of the tri-city area, the freeway interchanges with King Street a second time. Highway85 ends {{at the north end of}} the ramps from King Street, as does the Conestoga Parkway. The divided freeway ends and the route become Waterloo Regional Road85, which continues north to St. Jacobs and Elmira.|$|E

5|$|Donning their throwback uniforms, the Steelers {{played the}} Baltimore Ravens {{in their first}} Monday Night game of the season. Multiple Steelers {{starters}} did not play in the game, due to various injuries. After a 3–3 first quarter, Baltimore took a ten-point lead into half time with a field goal and touchdown pass in the second quarter. Rashard Mendenhall—in his first NFL start—left {{the game in the}} third quarter with a season-ending shoulder injury. On Pittsburgh's third drive of the half, Roethlisberger connected with Santonio Holmes for a 38-yard touchdown pass. On the first play of Baltimore's ensuing drive, James Harrison's forced fumble was picked up by LaMarr Woodley and returned 7yards for a touchdown. The two touchdowns within 15seconds took the Steelers from ten points behind to four points ahead. In the final quarter, the Steelers' offense was stopped on the one yard line and Reed kicked his second field goal of the night. Baltimore drove 76yards and tied the game with a touchdown. Neither team was able to score on their final <b>drive</b> <b>as</b> the regulation clock expired.|$|E
5|$|To {{connect the}} {{proposed}} parkway with downtown Los Angeles, that city improved and extended North Figueroa Street as a four-lane {{road to the}} Los Angeles River, allowing drivers to bypass the congested North Broadway Bridge on the existing but underutilized Riverside Drive Bridge. A {{large part of the}} project lay within Elysian Park, and four Art Deco tunnels were built through the hills. The first three, between Solano Avenue and the river, opened in late 1931, and the fourth opened in mid-1936, completing the extension of Figueroa Street to Riverside <b>Drive.</b> <b>As</b> with the contemporary Ramona Boulevard east from downtown, grade separations were mostly built only where terrain dictated. For Figueroa Street, this meant that all crossings except College Street (built several years after the extension was completed), where a hill was cut through, were at grade. The Figueroa Street Viaduct, connecting the Riverside Drive intersection with North Figueroa Street (then Dayton Avenue) across the Los Angeles River, opened in mid-1937. Closer to downtown, an interchange was built at Temple Street in 1939.|$|E
