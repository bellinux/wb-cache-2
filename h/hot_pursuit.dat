Abstract. – We calculate analytically the phase boundary for a nonequilibrium phase transition in a one-dimensional array of coupled, overdamped parametric harmonic oscillators in {{the limit of}} strong and weak spatial coupling. Our results show that the transition is reentrant with respect to the spatial coupling in agreement with the prediction of the mean field theory. Since the landmark paper of Onsager on the solution of the 2 -dimensional Ising model [1], the search for exactly solvable models displaying equilibrium phase transitions {{has become one of the}} <b>hot</b> <b>pursuits</b> in statistical physics. Over the last two decades, the interest has shifted from equilibrium to nonequilibrium phase transitions [2]. In many respects, the latter transitions are richer and more difficult to analyse. In particular, the analogue of the equilibrium distribution is typically not known. On the other hand, the arguments ruling out phase transitions in one dimension for a large class of equilibrium models no longer apply, and a number of exact solutions for nonequilibrium phase transitions in one dimension have been found [3]. Our focus here is on a nonequilibrium phase transition in a one-dimensional array of couple...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Syringolides 1 (1) and 2 (2) in {{optically}} pure {{forms were}} prepared from the chiral butenolide 9, {{which in turn}} was obtained from tri-n-butylstannylfuran (8). Attempts are also being made towards the synthesis of sesquiterpenoid lactones making use of 3 -methyl- 4 -trimethylsilylfuran (17) as a pivotal precursor. Syringolide 1 (1) and syringolide 2 (2) are microbial elicitors produced through the action of a avirulence gene (avrD) of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. These unusual metabolites function as speci®c molecular signal molecules {{that are able to}} induce hypersensitive defence response in soybean plants. [1] Scheme 1 indicates the biogenetic association between the syringolides and their relevant metabolites, namely secosyrin 1 (3), secosyrin 2 (4), syributin 1 (5) and syributin 2 (6). It is certain now that the syringolides would experience a retro-Claisen cleavage reaction to furnish the secosyrins, which in turn would lead to the syributins by way of a retro-Michael reaction and a subsequent 1, 3 -acyl migration. The intriguing tricyclic frameworks of 1 and 2 have made them target molecules in <b>hot</b> <b>pursuits,</b> as can be shown {{by the fact that the}} total synthesis of 1 and 2 have been recorded in the literature for no less than seven times since 1995 [2 ± 8].
