5|$|Hanuman Chalisa (हनुमान चालीसा), literally, Forty Verses to Hanuman, is an Awadhi work of 40 Chaupais and two Dohas in obeisance to Hanuman. Popular belief {{holds the}} work to be {{authored}} by Tulsidas, and it contains his signature, though some authors <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> work was written by him. It {{is one of the}} most read short religious texts in northern India, and is recited by millions of Hindus on Tuesdays and Saturdays. It is believed to have been uttered by Tulsidas in a state of Samadhi at the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar.|$|E
25|$|As for the Hellenes, {{it seems}} {{obvious to me that}} ever since they came into {{existence}} they have always used the same language. They were weak at first, when they were separated from the Pelasgians, but they grew from a small group into a multitude, especially when many peoples, including other barbarians in great numbers, had joined them. Moreover, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Pelasgian, who remained barbarians, ever grew appreciably in number or power.|$|E

The police <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> attacks were targeted at the event. Other suspicious vehicles in Park Lane and Fleet Street were investigated by police, as well as reports of suspicious cars {{in other areas of}} the UK, such as Warrington, which suffered a 1993 bomb attack by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.|$|E

500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest {{into the}} death of the Princess, on 13 February 2008, {{speaking}} by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he [...] "could not remember specifically" [...] whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it [...] "would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, but... I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> fact that they did not manage to find a file rules out anything either". He said he believed MI6 had an informant at the Paris Ritz but he could not be certain that this person was necessarily Henri Paul.|$|E
500|$|On 15 July 2015, he {{was found}} guilty of being an {{accessory}} to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews. Reacting to the sentence, Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor said that she was [...] "disappointed" [...] adding: [...] "They are trying to teach a lesson that if you commit such a crime, you will be punished. But I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> court has acted properly in sentencing him to four years in jail. It is too late for that kind of sentence... My preference would have been to sentence him to community service by speaking out against neo-Nazis. I would like the court to prove to me, a survivor, how four years in jail will benefit anybody." [...] Gröning's defence lawyer, Hans Holtermann, was quoted as saying that he would review the verdict before deciding whether to appeal. On 28 November 2016, the appeal was declined by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH). In August 2017 Oskar Gröning was considered to be fit for prison.|$|E

It must be shown that the defendant has done something which he recognised, or judged by the standards appropriate at the relevant place and time, he ought reasonably to have recognised, as giving rise to an exceptionally high risk of danger or mischief if {{there should be an}} escape, however unlikely an escape may have been thought to be." ...|$|E

My position for many years has been that just as a motorist must have a license, a gun owner should be required to have one as well. Anyone wanting to own a gun should have to pass a written exam that shows that they know how to use a gun, that they’re intelligent enough and responsible enough to handle a gun." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, I stubbornly named the turtle as ‘neither fish nor fowl,’ and praised this animal as a unique, land-and-sea-lover who lives to very old ages, whose meat has an {{excellent}} taste, and who cuts through oceans from continent to continent. I said, [...] "Just as I do not find the turtle inferior, although he is neither fish nor fowl, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Indo inferior." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jaron Lanier refutes {{the idea}} that the Singularity is inevitable. He states: [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{technology}} is creating itself. It's not an autonomous process." [...] He goes on to assert: [...] "The reason to believe in human agency over technological determinism is that you can then have an economy where people earn their own way and invent their own lives. If you structure a society on not emphasizing individual human agency, it's the same thing operationally as denying people clout, dignity, and self-determination ... to embrace [...] would be a celebration of bad data and bad politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|First, the {{contract}} specified {{that it was}} governed by the 1934 Act and any future amendments to it. While that could be read to suggest that any controversies under the 1933 Act were outside {{the contract}} and thus inarbitrable, [...] "we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius is here applicable," [...] Swan wrote. It was possible that the 1934 Act could be read as including the 1933 Act, but that was immaterial since {{the sale of the}} Air stock to Wilko necessarily came under the 1933 Act as a primary-market transaction.|$|E

2500|$|Young Harris did {{not talk}} about his {{charitable}} contributions {{because he was too}} modest. Even his close friends were not aware of the extent of his generosity. It was said [...] "that little children delighted to crowd around him and hear from him the wondrous story of our Lord". The author of Harris' obituary in the Athens Weekly Banner quoted Harris just before he died: [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> deeds of a man are near as important in a religious sense as those things he omits to do; and yet a man ought to feel thankful if it can be said of him after death, 'Here lies a blameless man'." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Christopher had {{performed}} this service for some time, {{a little child}} asked him to take him across the river. During the crossing, the river became swollen and the child seemed as heavy as lead, so much that Christopher could scarcely carry him and found himself in great difficulty. When he finally reached the other side, {{he said to the}} child: [...] "You have put me in the greatest danger. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> whole world could have been as heavy on my shoulders as you were." [...] The child replied: [...] "You had on your shoulders not only the whole world but Him who made it. I am Christ your king, whom you are serving by this work." [...] The child then vanished.|$|E
2500|$|Out of Europe's {{five major}} {{football}} leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A [...] ), the Bundesliga {{has the lowest}} ticket prices and the highest average attendance. Many club stadia have large terraced areas for standing fans (by comparison, stadia in the English Premier League are all-seaters due to the Taylor Report). Teams {{limit the number of}} season tickets to ensure everyone has a chance to see the games live, and the away club has the right to 10% of the available capacity. Match tickets often double as free rail passes which encourages supporters to travel and celebrate in a relaxed atmosphere. According to Bundesliga chief executive Christian Seifert, tickets are inexpensive (especially for standing room) as [...] "It is not in the clubs' culture so much [...] They are very fan orientated". Uli Hoeneß, former president of Bayern Munich, was quoted as saying [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> fans are like cows to be milked. Football has got to be for everybody." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{investigators}} {{had in the}} past cracked some of the most publicized and difficult cases in Texas, Captain Gonzaullas said that the murders were among the most puzzling cases he had encountered in his 30 years of criminal investigation. He also stated that [...] "We have certain information which we cannot disclose and we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> public should expect us to give out any information which would be injurious to our investigation." [...] The Texarkana Gazette and Daily News cooperated with Gonzaullas by withholding such sensitive information. Sheriff Presley and the Rangers stated that, out of the many suspects questioned during the past two days and nights of ceaseless work, very little valuable information had been obtained. Presley stated, [...] "We are required to follow all leads, regardless of how thin they might be, in the hope that they will lead to something tangible in the eventual solution of the mystery." [...] The officers started to work in relays on Tuesday after many of them had become exhausted in their investigations. Gonzaullas stated that they were dealing with a shrewd criminal who had left no stones unturned in concealing his identity and activities. A voluntary midnight curfew was agreed upon Tuesday night by the Texarkana, Texas city council and the Bowie county commissioners court for all places of amusement.|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Adam Sedgwick, the Woodwardian Professor of Geology at Cambridge, {{was popular}} and well regarded, having {{recently}} strongly defended the new geology against the Reverend Sir William Cockburn, a Scriptural geologist. He turned down several invitations to review Vestiges, pleading lack of time, but in March read it closely and on 6 April discussed with other leading clergymen the [...] "rank materialism" [...] {{of the book}} [...] "against which work he & all other scientific men are indignant". He thought the [...] "hasty jumping to conclusions" [...] indicated a female author. In a letter to Charles Lyell about [...] "the foul book", he expressed his disgust: [...] "If the book be true, the labours of sober induction are in vain; religion is a lie; human law is a mass of folly, and a base injustice; morality is moonshine; our labours for the black people of Africa were works of madmen; and man and woman are only better beasts!.... I cannot but think the work is from a woman's pen, it is so well dressed and so graceful in its externals. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> 'beast man' {{could have done this}} part so well." [...] On 10 April he contacted Macvey Napier, editor of the Edinburgh Review, who quickly accepted the offer. Sedgwick was rather disorganised and had not written a review before. To save time batches of his writing were typeset on arrival, so one part was being printed [...] "while the other part was still uncoiling from my brain in Cambridge." [...] Napier did not insist on the usual concise review, but as it was still arriving in mid May stopped it at what became 85 pages, one of the longest reviews the quarterly ever published.|$|E
