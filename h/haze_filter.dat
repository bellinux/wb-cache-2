50|$|The Lilliputian violet was {{collected}} from an extensive intermontane plateau {{of the high}} Andes of Peru. This species is known only from its type locality from collection of the specimen during the research team expedition from November 1962 to January 1963. Originally Hugh Iltis and his student Don Ugent, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, had a project to study potato of Peru. On 15 December 1962 they were driving through a vast stretch of treeless puna in {{the centre of the}} western slope of the Andes. They were amazed by the extraordinary landscape where everything was in a Lilliputian scale. In the afternoon the made a halt at the base of Cerra Palla Palla to enjoy the view of vicuñas roaming in the wilderness. Iltis crouched on the ground to take a close snapshot of two vicuñas but dropped his <b>haze</b> <b>filter</b> off the camera. By a pure stroke of luck he looked down the ground to spot an extraordinarily minute violet which would in due course make its name aptly as Lilliputian violet. After collecting the specimen and maintaining the voucher for half a century, no other specimens have been recovered from anywhere. Therefore, the full description and formal naming was published only in December 2012.|$|E
5000|$|UV-Zero <b>haze</b> <b>filters</b> reduce [...] "purple fringing" [...] {{caused by}} {{ultraviolet}} light, especially in digital situations. They are also recommended by some professional photographers as {{protection for the}} vulnerable lens, especially when outdoors or in dynamic situations.|$|R
5000|$|Red dot sights {{generally}} {{fall into}} two categories, [...] "tube" [...] or [...] "open" [...] designs. [...] "Tube sights" [...] look similar to a standard telescopic sight, with a cylindrical tube containing the optics. Tube sights offer the option of fitted dust covers {{and the ability to}} add filters, such as polarizing or <b>haze</b> <b>filters,</b> and glare reducing sunshades. Since a reflector sight only really needs a single optical surface, the [...] "reflector", the tube is not needed. This allows for non-tubed [...] "open sights" [...] that consist of a flat base, with a single loop of material to support the reflective optics.|$|R
30|$|This {{group of}} methods model the {{atmospheric}} phenomenon in real outdoor scenes. Using scattering models, several works {{were able to}} restore captured images at different weather conditions. Gao et al. [21] presented an aerial perspective model for <b>haze</b> <b>filtering</b> based on a parameter called maximum visibility. Zhu et al. [15] developed a linear color attenuation prior for image de-hazing based on a parameter called scattering coefficient. The synthesized results from these works successfully corrected and restored at some extent the color of images under hazy conditions. However, these methods are not automatic and the results depend on manual tuning of either the maximum visibility in [21] or the scattering coefficient in [15], which control the amount of de-hazing.|$|R
50|$|Most sextants {{also have}} filters for use when viewing {{the sun and}} {{reducing}} the effects of <b>haze.</b> The <b>filters</b> usually consist {{of a series of}} progressively darker glasses that can be used singly or in combination to reduce haze and the sun's brightness. However, sextants with adjustable polarizing filters have also been manufactured, where the degree of darkness is adjusted by twisting the frame of the filter.|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, US Army Air Corps Colonel John A. Macready {{worked with}} Bausch & Lomb, a Rochester, New York-based medical {{equipment}} manufacturer, to create aviation sunglasses {{that would reduce}} the distraction for pilots caused by the intense blue and white hues of the sky. Specifically, MacCready was concerned about how pilots' goggles would fog up, greatly reducing visibility at high altitude. The prototype, created in 1936 and known as ‘Anti-Glare’, had plastic frames and green lenses that could cut out the glare without obscuring vision. They also added impact-resistant lenses in 1938. The sunglasses were redesigned with a metal frame the following year and patented as the Ray-Ban Aviator. According to the BBC, the glasses used “Kalichrome lenses designed to sharpen details and minimise <b>haze</b> by <b>filtering</b> out blue light, making them ideal for misty conditions.” ...|$|R
