25|$|Additional ATGMs can be {{operated}} by the BMD-4. This is {{made possible by the}} 9P135M launcher post that fires the wire guided <b>Fagot</b> (NATO reporting name: AT-4 Spigot) and Konkurs (NATO reporting name: AT-5 Spandrel) missiles. The <b>Fagot</b> missile is a short range ATGM with an effective range of 2km. While flying at an average speed of 186m/s, it penetrates 480mm of RHA. The Fagot-M is an improved variant that has an increased effective range of 2.5km and a penetration of 550mm of RHA. The Konkurs missile has an effective range of 4000 m and flies at an average speed of 206m/s. The original Konkurs missile penetrates 750–800mm of RHA while the improved Konkurs-M penetrates 750–800mm of RHA after ERA due to an additional tandem warhead. The firing range is reduced to 2500 m during night time.|$|E
25|$|Anti-tank guided weapons (ATGMs) can be {{operated}} by the BMD-3. This is {{made possible by the}} 9P135M launcher post that fires the wire guided <b>Fagot</b> (NATO reporting name: AT-4 Spigot) and Konkurs (NATO reporting name: AT-5 Spandrel) missiles. The 9P135M launcher is located on the top center of the BMD-3 turret and is dismountable. The crew can engage targets from the vehicle or a distance away from the system. The ATGM launcher has three ready-to-use rounds and two stowed in the vehicle. The <b>Fagot</b> missile is a short range ATGM with an effective range of 2km. While flying at an average speed of 186m/s, it penetrates 480mm of RHA. The Fagot-M is an improved variant that has an increased effective range of 2.5km and a penetration of 550mm of RHA. The Konkurs missile has an effective range of 4000 m and flies at an average speed of 206m/s. The original Konkurs missile penetrates 750–800mm of RHA while the improved Konkurs-M penetrates 750–800mm of RHA after ERA due to an additional tandem warhead. The firing range is reduced to 2500 m during night time. A French-German Flame-V adapter kit allows the BMD-3 to launch MILAN ATGMs.|$|E

25|$|During the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, {{intensive}} combat {{highlighted the}} lack of sufficient firepower provided by the BMD-1 and its variants. This {{led to the development}} of a new vehicle in the 1980s, fitted with a new main armament. The new vehicle, designated as the BMD-2, entered service in 1985 with the airborne troops. The sole difference between the BMD-2 and BMD-1 was the armament. The new armament for the BMD-2 was the 30mm 2A42 autocannon capable of a higher elevation. In addition, the BMD-2 was fitted with a 9P135M launcher rail for 9M111 <b>Fagot</b> and 9M113 Konkurs anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM).|$|E

2500|$|At this juncture, the {{battalion}} commanding officer, Lt Col Joshi personally fired two <b>Fagot</b> missiles {{in quick succession}} from the fire base and neutralized the enemy position. Brigadier Kakkar watched the firing of the missiles through his binoculars. [...] "Bull's eye! You've got them," [...] he said to Joshi over the wireless. The bunker received a direct hit and the enemy soldiers were seen fleeing from it. They then promptly began advancing again. Soon, Company C with two sections, led by Major Gurpreet Singh assaulted the enemy position. By 1300 hours, these troops had captured Point 4875. Subsequently, both 'A' and 'C' Companies linked up. They then consolidated their hold on Point 4875, but the Indian troops continued to receive enemy artillery and machine-gun fire from Pimple 2 and area North of Point 4875.|$|E

60|$|The Indians {{were now}} quiet. Their songs and dances would break out soon enough. They piled <b>fagot</b> after <b>fagot</b> round Isaac's feet.

60|$|It {{was about}} two hours after they had left the castle, when a heavy cart filled with <b>fagots</b> was seen {{approaching}} its gates. The garrison, who had not the least fear of any attack, {{paid no attention to}} it until it reached the edge of the moat. Then the warder, seeing that it contained <b>fagots,</b> lowered the drawbridge without question, raised the portcullis, and opened the gates.|$|R

50|$|In 1532, Thomas Harding, {{who with}} his wife, {{had been accused of}} heresy, was brought before the Bishop of Lincoln, and {{condemned}} for denying the real presence in the Sacrament. He was then chained to a stake, erected for the purpose, at Chesham in the Dell, near Botely; and when they had set fire to the <b>fagots,</b> one of the spectators dashed out his brains with a billet. The priests told the people that whoever brought <b>fagots</b> to burn heretics would have an indulgence to commit sins for forty days.|$|R

Bracing his elbows against each side of the chimney, he {{straightened}} his legs so that he might fall clear His motions loosened little shower of soot that fell rattling upon the <b>fagots</b> that were now beginning to blaze brightly, whereupon the boy raised his face and looked up. Hans loosened his hold upon the chimney; crash! he fell, lighting upon his feet {{in the midst of the}} burning <b>fagots.</b> The scullion boy tumbled backward upon the floor, where he lay upon the broad of his back with a face as white as dough and eyes and mouth agape, staring speechlessly at the frightful inky-black figure standing in the midst of the flames and smoke. Then his scattered wits came back to him. [...] "It is the evil one," [...] he roared. And thereupon, turning upon his side, he half rolled, half scrambled to the door. Then out he leaped and, banging it to behind him, flew down the passageway, yelling with fright and never daring once to look behind him.|$|R
