25|$|Much Cold War espionage and {{counter-espionage}} {{took place}} in Berlin, {{against a backdrop of}} potential superpower confrontation in which both sides had nuclear weapons set for a range that could hit Germany. In 1971, the <b>Four-Power</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Berlin was signed. While the Soviet Union applied the oversight of the four powers only to West Berlin, the Western Allies emphasized in a 1975 note to the United Nations their position that four-power oversight apply to Berlin as a whole. The agreement guaranteed access across East Germany to West Berlin and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes.|$|E
25|$|In the 1969 election, the SPD—headed by Willy Brandt—gained {{enough votes}} to form a {{coalition}} government with the FDP. Although Chancellor for only just over four years, Brandt {{was one of the}} most popular politicians in the whole period. Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality. Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik, a policy opposed by the CDU. The issue of improving relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister, Walther Scheel (FDP) negotiated agreements with all three countries (Moscow Agreement, August 1970, Warsaw Agreement, December 1970, <b>Four-Power</b> <b>Agreement</b> over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany, signed in December 1972). These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led, in the long term, to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union's control over East-Central Europe. During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970, Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time. Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974, after Günter Guillaume, a senior member of his staff, was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the Stasi. Brandt's contributions to world peace led to his winning the Nobel Peace Prize for 1971.|$|E
50|$|After the <b>Four-Powers</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1971, {{amounts of}} some items were reduced and the {{consumer}} items such as bicycles, clothes and shoes were sold.|$|R
50|$|However, in June 1961 Premier Khrushchev {{created a}} new crisis over the status of West Berlin when he again {{threatened}} to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany, which he said, would end existing <b>four-power</b> <b>agreements</b> guaranteeing American, British, and French access rights to West Berlin. The three powers replied that no unilateral treaty could abrogate their responsibilities and rights in West Berlin, including the right of unobstructed access to the city.|$|R
50|$|At the Vienna {{summit on}} 4 June 1961, {{tensions}} rose. Meeting with US President John F. Kennedy, Premier Khrushchev reissued the Soviet ultimatum {{to sign a}} separate peace treaty with East Germany and thus end the existing <b>four-power</b> <b>agreements</b> guaranteeing American, British, and French rights to access West Berlin and the occupation of East Berlin by Soviet forces. However, this time he did so by issuing a deadline of 31 December 1961. The three powers responded that any unilateral treaty could not affect their responsibilities and rights in West Berlin.|$|R
2500|$|The {{founding}} of the two German states increased Cold War tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move that was not recognised by the western powers. East Berlin included most of the historic centre of the city. The West German government established itself in Bonn. In 1961 East Germany began {{the building of the}} Berlin Wall between East and West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. John F. Kennedy gave his [...] "Ich bin ein Berliner" [...] speech in 1963 underlining the US support for the Western part of the city. Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass {{from one to the other}} side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a <b>Four-Power</b> <b>agreement</b> guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.|$|E

5000|$|When Kennedy {{pointed out}} that such a treaty {{required}} unilateral action {{on the part of}} the Soviet Union, thereby ignoring the <b>four-power</b> <b>agreement</b> signed at the end of World War II, Khrushchev stated that such a peace treaty nullified the <b>four-power</b> <b>agreement.</b> He insisted that the city of Berlin should belong solely to the German Democratic Republic. West Germany, Khrushchev told Kennedy, would remain under American influence. Kennedy countered by saying that the U.S. could not accept such an agreement due to the prestige it would lose as a result of the decision. In light of this remark, Khrushchev suggested that an “interim arrangement” be considered. [...] Khrushchev remained firm in the fact that “the Soviet Union would sign peace treaty in December if the U.S. refused an interim agreement.” ...|$|E
50|$|In 1955 the Republic was {{declared}} by the Soviet Union {{to be fully}} sovereign; however, Soviet troops remained, based on the <b>four-power</b> Potsdam <b>agreement.</b> As NATO troops remained in West Berlin and West Germany, the GDR and Berlin in particular became focal points of Cold War tensions.|$|R
50|$|Hitler and Chamberlain {{signed an}} {{additional}} resolution determining to resolve all future disputes between Germany and the United Kingdom through peaceful means. This is often {{confused with the}} <b>Four-Power</b> Munich <b>Agreement</b> itself, not least because most photographs of Chamberlain's return show him waving the paper containing the resolution, not the Munich Agreement itself.|$|R
2500|$|Due to the <b>Four-Power</b> Occupation <b>Agreements</b> for Berlin, {{in which}} the {{long-term}} division of Germany and Berlin (the partition of Germany into two German states; and Berlin partitioned into two principal zones of occupation, West Berlin and East Berlin) was not foreseen, the DR operated the long-haul railway service (Fernverkehr) and barge canals in both East and West Berlin throughout {{the years of the}} Cold War (and also after the reunification of Germany) until the merger of the DR and DB in January 1994. [...] This led to unique situations due to the occupied status of West Berlin and the presence of the DR there. [...] For example, there were Bahnpolizei (railway police) employed by the DR in their West Berlin railway stations who were controlled by the GDR Interior Ministry, although the three Western Allies (the United States, Great Britain and France) never officially recognized the authority of the GDR government in the Soviet (Eastern) sector of Berlin, let alone in West Berlin. [...] For this reason, the West Berlin Polizei had separate patrols who were empowered to maintain law and order in the West Berlin railway stations.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} seventies, as Assistant Secretary and Assistant Secretary in the Foreign Office, {{he was in}} the {{development}} of rapprochement with the GDR, as well as the <b>four-power</b> <b>agreement.</b> As Acting Secretary of State, he was appointed by then-foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, as his personal representative for disaster prevention.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, {{the area}} {{was taken over by}} the US Army. Since a <b>four-power</b> <b>agreement</b> enacted Austria's {{neutrality}} in 1955 US listening devices that were situated there had to be abandoned. They were relocated to Bad Aibling and during Cold War the field station 81 was converted by the United States Army Security Agency ("ASA") to a central communications monitoring station for American intelligence.|$|E
50|$|After {{the entry}} into force of the <b>Four-Power</b> <b>Agreement</b> from 1971, the two German states began {{negotiations}} over a Basic Treaty. As for the Transit Agreement of 1972, the discussions were led by the Under-Secretaries of State Egon Bahr (for the Federal Republic of Germany) and Michael Kohl (for the German Democratic Republic). As part of the Ostpolitik of Chancellor Willy Brandt, the treaty was signed on 21 December 1972 in East Berlin. It was ratified the next year in West Germany, despite opposition from hardline right-wingers. It came into effect in June 1973.|$|E

50|$|The two Maybach bunkers {{were largely}} {{destroyed}} by the Soviet Armed Forces (abbr. GSSD) in late 1946, according to the stipulations of the <b>four-power</b> <b>agreement</b> on the occupation of Germany and an Allied Control Council order, although some buildings survived, including the almost entirely intact separate communications bunker Zeppelin. The Zeppelin bunker later formed part of the Soviet Cold war era installations in Wünsdorf under the name Ranet. Further bunker installations were subsequently added to house the central command and communications functions of the Soviet army in the GDR. The bunker grounds were demilitarised following {{the closing of the}} army base in 1994, when the last Russian troops left Germany.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1962 he {{returned}} to his ambassadorial career, appointed to head up the Soviet Union's important diplomatic mission in the German Democratic Republic in succession to Mikhail Pervukhin, taking up his appointment at the start of 1963. [...] Building on an approach he had developed during his time in Warsaw, he proved a new kind of post-Stalin Soviet ambassador. [...] He took a relatively high-profile approach, visiting factories and exhibitions, and appearing on television. [...] Media reports appeared in the west suggesting that he was a consummate actor, and his involvement in negotiating the <b>four-power</b> <b>agreement</b> over the future of Berlin which he personally signed on behalf of the Soviet Union 3 September 1971 left him far better known in West Germany than the Soviet ambassador to West Germany. Abrassimov proved highly quotable, and attracted attention with protests against Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik ("No rose without the thorns" [...] / [...] "Keine Rose ohne Dornen").|$|E
5000|$|The first {{exchange}} {{was part}} of the <b>Four-Power</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Berlin and took place on 20 December 1971. The agreement specified at part II C and Annex III 3 that [...] "The problems of the small enclaves, including Steinstücken, and of other small areas may be solved by exchange of territory." [...] On the 3 June 1972 East Germany gave a total of 15.6 hectares of land, while West Berlin got a total of 17.1 hectares. Exclaves numbered above 1-3, 6, 8, 10 were ceded to West Berlin and exclave 11 was connected to West Berlin. The most important piece of property was the 2.3 hectares that connected Steinstücken to the Zehlendorf borough. The Senate paid the East German government DM 4 million in compensation for the extra land. In a second supplementary arrangement signed on 21 July 1972, the Senate and the East German government sold for DM 31 million the 8.5 hectares plot of Berlin's former Potsdam Railway Station previously belonging to East Berlin's Mitte borouogh.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} <b>Four-Power</b> <b>agreement</b> and the {{establishment}} of occupation zones in Austria, the Soviets occupied the base until 26 July 1945. The Americans took command of the Base on the 27th. Under United States control, the facility was called Tulln Air Base and was under the command of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE)'s XII Tactical Air Command. Upon the arrival of American troops at Tulln, the cadre found Russian troops billeted on the Base. The field was a mess. The German demolition crews had done their job well. One hangar was in pretty good shape except for the windows and other minor damage. All others were demolished. Bomber and fighter planes were scattered all over the field and all salvageable parts were removed. The major portion of the Base was blown to rubble, but one barracks, the headquarters building, the vehicle garages and repair shop and a few other buildings were intact. The usable buildings were a mess with rats, vermin, excrement, and bullet holes everywhere. POW SS troops, guarded by the Rainbow Division, were brought in to do the cleaning up of rubble and house keeping duties. The first occupation troops at Tulln were assigned to the 10th and 81st Airdrome Squadrons.|$|E
