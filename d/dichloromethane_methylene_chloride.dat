Evaluation and documentation of employee exposure to <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> is required to comply with OSHA regulations. In addition to OSHA compliance, {{it is also important}} to evaluate employee exposure levels to determine if respiratory protection, regulation of the work area, and medical monitoring are necessary. This industrial hygiene report describes an investigation into the risks of exposure to <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride.</b> This report includes evaluation of employee exposure to <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> during the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients. During the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients, employees transfer <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> from small containers to a large reactor. After the desired reaction has taken place and allowed to separate, different layers of the solution which contains <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> are drained from the reactor into small containers. Employees have the potential for exposure to <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> during the transfer and collection processes. The results of the occupational exposure sampling indicate employees are exposed to levels of <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> above the permissible exposure limit (PEL) and the action limit (AL). The regulatory standard requires medical monitoring when employees are exposure above the AL. Regulation of the work area and respiratory protection is required at the PEL. Recommendations to reduce exposure include identifying a substitute solvent that is less hazardous. To control exposure through an engineering control, an evaluation of the current localized ventilation system would be valuable in determining existing capabilities for reducing exposure to <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> vapors.

The high concentration of methylene chloride in the product, the tank configuration, the inadequate ventilation, and the inadequate training and implementation of confined space procedures were contributing factors in this incident. The CA/FACE investigator determined that in order to prevent exposure to methylene chloride while cleaning paint tanks, employers should ensure that: • Policies and procedures are developed and implemented to clean paint tanks more frequently with water-based materials before the paint is cured. If this is not possible, the cured paint should be stripped with abrasive removal methods. • If toxic chemicals must be used inside a tank, employees must be provided with worker training in chemical hazard communication and confined space entry procedures...|$|E

Measurement of replicative DNA synthesis done after 13, 26, 52 and 78 weeks of exposure showed a significant decrease in the hepatocyte labeling index at 13 weeks. Replicative DNA synthesis in pulmonary airways after 1, 2, 3, 4, 13 and 26 weeks of exposure to <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> was significantly lower than in air-exposed controls. Likewise, the increase in tumor induction in treated mice was not associated with increased replicative DNA synthesis in liver foci or in alveolar parenchyma.

Similarly, the frequency and pattern of K-ras activation in lung neoplasms were not altered by exposure to <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride.</b> Early exposure to <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> for only 26 weeks was sufficient to cause an increase in lung tumors by 2 years, suggesting that <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> may cause early and persistent loss of growth control in lung cells.

Urine is incubated with 3 -glucuronidase, which hy-drolyzes all j 3 -glucuronides except aldosterone- 18 -glu-curonide. The contaminants (the aglycones released and other methylene chloride-soluble substances) are ex-tracted with <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride.</b> Solvolysis of the aqueous phase liberates aldosterone from aldosterone- 18 -glucu-ronide, which then is extracted with <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> and oxidized by use of periodic acid. The resulting lactone can be easily separated by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and determined by gas-liquid chroma-tography. The principal metabolites of aldosterone in urine are tetrahydroaldosterone glucuronide and aldosterone- 18 -glu-curonide. Urine also contains small amounts of free aldoste-rone (1, 2). For diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism the sum of aldosterone- 18 -glucuronide and free aldosterone is usually assayed by hydrolyzing the urine at pH 1 and extracting it with <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride.</b> Aldosterone is isolated from the <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> extract by thin-layer chromatography or paper chromatography and then oxidized to aldosterone-y-lactone, which can be determined by gas-liquid chromatog-raphy. However, this extract contains large amounts of con-taminants, which cause difficulties in separating aldosterone by thin-layer or paper chromatography. We describe here a procedure for removing these contam-inants. Urinary fl-glucuronides (but not aldosterone- 18 -glu-curonide) are hydrolyzed by fl-glucuronidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 31), and methylene chloride-soluble contaminants, including the aglycones released, can be removed by extraction with <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> before solvolysis of aldosterone- 18 -glu-curonide...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{fluorocarbons}} and chlorinated solvents on the cardiopulmonary system are reviewed. The new information, not hitherto reported, {{relates to the}} antagonistic action of inosine, a naturally occurring nucleoside formed in the body by deamination of adenosine. The effect of inosine on <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> toxicity was investigated in open chest dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. <b>Methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> (5 % in air or 50, 000 ppm) elicited a decrease of ventricular contractility represented by the dhninished left ventricular (dpldt) ^a, and myocardial contractile force measured directly with a Walton-Brodie strain gauge arch. Coronary blood flow decreased slightly after exposure to <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride.</b> Arterial blood pressure and heart rate did not change. The negative inotropic effect of <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> was reversed or prevented to a substantial extent by intravenous infusion of inosine (5 mg/kg-min). The effect of the latter compound was also characterized by signiffcant coronary vasodilation. It was shown by the experi-ments that the cardiostimulatory action of inosine was associated with improved hypoxic adaptability of the coronary blood vessels. In contrast, the effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and isoproterenol) was not accompanied by such a beneffcial coronary vascular effect. On {{the basis of these}} results, the conclu-sion has been arrived at that inosine might be recommended as a useful antidote in <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> poisoning in particular, and of poisoning by chlorinated solvents and fluorocarbons in general...|$|R
40|$|A case is {{described}} of {{a middle-aged man}} who developed serious cerebral deterioration after using <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> as a solvent for three years. It is concluded that the endogenous production of carbon monoxide formed from <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> stored in the body {{was the cause of}} his cerebral damage. Reasons are given for distinguishing two separate hazards, the long-term risks and the immediate risks of using methy-lene chloride in confined spaces. It is suggested that industrial workers, particularly if suffering from any impairment of alveolar gaseous exchange and if working at ground level or bench level, are at risk from chronic carbon monoxide toxicity. A person suffering from vascular degeneration and using <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> perhaps as a paint stripper in a smal...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{sorption}} kinetics and equilibrium isotherms of water, <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride,</b> n-heptane and <b>methylene</b> chloride/n-heptane mixtures in glassy amorphous poly(aryl-ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK) {{have been}} investigated. Ideal Fickian diffusion, anomalous non-ideal Fickian diffusion, "Case II " sorption mechanism, and diffusion con-trolled swelling were observed depending on temperature, solvent type, and external sol-vent activity. Gas-chromatographic {{analysis performed on}} PEEK samples contacted with methylene chloride/- eptane mixtures indicated {{that the presence of}} <b>methylene</b> <b>chloride</b> enhances-heptane mobility and equilibrium sorbed amount...|$|R
