5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in an increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in an increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E

5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{is among}} the most common complications of prematurely born infants and its incidence has grown as the survival of extremely premature infants has increased. Nevertheless, the severity has decreased as better management of supplemental oxygen <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in the disease now being related mainly to factors other than hyperoxia.|$|E

5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Despite harsh conditions, the {{vegetation}} {{on the island}} is fairly diverse. Following the island's grazing ban, vegetation has become very thick and <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in it becoming {{a breeding ground for}} waterfowl. There is large reed bed in the small lagoon area.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{deforestation}} <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in loss {{of trees}} such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural habitat for wild animals; {{one of the}} main reasons for this is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, taro-production {{shortages}} (resulting from {{pests and}} labor shortages) <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in {{higher prices for}} poi in Hawaii. At the same time, innovations in poi production <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in poi that stays fresh longer and tastes sweeter. However, such products generally sell at a premium price and require refrigeration.|$|R
5|$|Geothermal {{activity}} and the emission of volcanic gases are ongoing, and the volcano has been prospected {{for the possibility of}} obtaining geothermal energy. The geothermal activity <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in widespread rock alteration and the formation of sulfur deposits, which were mentioned in a 1909 report and later mined. Koh-i-Sultan also has deposits of other minerals.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{inception}} of the Terrible Towel, numerous opposing teams, mascots, and players have shown disrespect or have defaced the Terrible Towel, and every such instance <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in some form of a negative consequence to the team or player or both.|$|E
5|$|Taftan {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} arc in Iran, together with Bazman, also in Iran, and Koh-i-Sultan in Pakistan. This volcanic arc has formed on Cretaceous-Eocene sedimentary layers and <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> from the subduction of the oceanic Arabian plate beneath Iran at the Makran trench.|$|E

5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the head has long been debated, and <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in several scientific analyses. The most notable and detailed of these was Karl Pearson and Geoffrey Morant's study conducted in the 1930s, which concluded that the Wilkinson head was that of Cromwell. Rumours and conspiracy theories have circulated since Cromwell's head fell from Westminster Hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the diversion channel <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in marsh fields drying on the Niigata plain which allows for greater production. Likewise, drier land has also allowed for the {{construction of}} infrastructure such as expressways and the Shinkansen express-train network, to support a greater population in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} of the workers' village of Deir el-Madinah <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> {{in one of}} the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years.

5|$|The {{revival of}} {{interest}} in inland waterways {{following the end of}} the Second World War <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in the tow path alongside the canal becoming part of the Itchen Way long-distance footpath, and is a popular route for walkers. The Itchen Navigation Preservation Society was formed in the 1970s, but progress was slow. A joint venture between the Environment Agency and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust in 2005 {{led to the formation of}} the Itchen Navigation Trust, and two years later, they obtained a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, funding the creation of the Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail Project, which has sought to conserve and interpret the remains. The route provides habitat for a diverse flora and fauna, which <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in it being designated as a European Special Area of Conservation and a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
5|$|Thoroughbred {{racehorses}} {{perform with}} maximum exertion, which <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in high accident rates and health {{problems such as}} bleeding from the lungs. Other health concerns include low fertility, abnormally small hearts and a small hoof-to-body-mass ratio. There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed, and research is ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Whitefish and vendace are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. Lake trout can be caught in creeks. Other fish found in the park include Arctic char, grayling, pike, perch, burbot, three-spined stickleback, ninespine stickleback and minnow. Stocking with fish <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in the {{introduction}} of Atlantic salmon, vendace and lake trout.|$|E

5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and creative director Neil Druckmann {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, simultaneously performing the motion capture work for their characters. Various characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different from the initial vision. The relationship of the characters received praise from several gaming publications, and the acting <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in multiple awards, including two BAFTAs and a DICE Award.|$|E
5|$|AML {{is treated}} {{initially}} with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission; people may {{go on to}} receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into the genetics of AML <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in the availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person, {{as well as how}} long that person is likely to survive. The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E
5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers vary greatly per year. The amount of Pilot Whales killed each year is not {{believed to be a}} threat to the sustainability of the population, but the brutal appearance of the hunt <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> in international criticism especially from animal welfare organisations.|$|E
