40|$|AbstractConsidering {{potential}} {{explosion hazard}} {{of oil and}} gas pipeline, the technological solutions have been proposed, within certain transportation distance to fill non-metallic explosion suppression material with good chemical stability and high pressure resistance to prevent flame and explosion wave propagation in pipeline. Detonated in the high voltage ignition and chemical ignition head two types of gasoline vapor explosion conditions, spherical explosion suppression material <b>filling</b> <b>stop</b> explosion pressure propagation and realize the explosion suppression function. The results of horizontal shock tube experiment shows that there are obvious laws of blasting pressure increase drop before and after filling explosion suppression materials. The transport resistance form 150 mm diameter steel pipeline filled with explosion suppression material has also been investigated in different length and different air velocity conditions. The experimental results show that filling spherical explosion suppression material have had a limited effect in transportation capacity of pipeline...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} determination of atomic levels {{and the first}} ionization potential of the heaviest elements (Z >= 100) is key to challenge theoretical predictions and to reveal changes in the atomic shell structure. These elements are only artificially produced in complete-fusion evaporation reactions at on-line facilities such as the GSI in Darmstadt at a rate of, at most, a few atoms per second. Hence, highly sensitive spectroscopic methods are required. Laser spectroscopy {{is one of the}} most powerful and valuable tools to investigate atomic properties. In combination with a buffer-gas <b>filled</b> <b>stopping</b> cell, the Radiation Detected Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy (RADRIS) technique provides the highest sensitivity for laser spectroscopy on the heaviest elements. The RADRIS setup, as well as the measurement procedure, have been optimized and characterized using the a-emitter 155 Yb in on-line conditions, resulting in an overall efficiency well above 1 %. This paves the way for a successful search of excited atomic levels in nobelium and heavier elements. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|To {{start the}} bagging process, a {{horizontal}} sealing bar creates the [...] "Bottom Seal" [...] by clamping {{across the bottom}} edge of the tube, bonding the film together, and cutting off any film below. This sealing bar can be on a fixed height, which is called an intermittent sealing process. Faster systems include a sealing bar that moves down with the bag while sealing. This is called a continuous process. The product is either pre-measured by a multi-head weighing system or the sealed tube end is then lowered onto a precision weighing table and the product to be bagged is dispensed through the long conical tube {{in the center of}} the bag. When the gross weight of the product-filled bag is reached, <b>filling</b> <b>stops,</b> and the horizontal sealing bar seals the top of the bag, simultaneously forming the bottom of the next bag above.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveAlthough {{multiple}} noncost factors likely {{influence a}} patient's propensity to forego {{treatment in the}} face of cost pressures, little is known about how patients' sociodemographic characteristics, physical and behavioral health comorbidities, and prescription regimens influence cost-related nonadherence (CRN) to medications. We sought to determine both financial and nonfinancial factors associated with CRN in a nationally representative sample of older adults. MethodsWe used a conceptual model developed by Piette and colleagues that describes financial and nonfinancial factors that could increase someone's risk of CRN, including income, comorbidities, and medication regimen complexity. We used data from the 2004 wave of the Health and Retirement Study and the 2005 HRS Prescription Drug Study to examine the influence of factors within each of these domains on measures of CRN (including not <b>filling,</b> <b>stopping,</b> or skipping doses) in a nationally representative sample of Americans age 65 + in 2005. ResultsOf the 3071 respondents who met study criteria, 20 % reported some form of CRN in 2005. As in prior studies, indicators of financial stress such as higher out-of-pocket payments for medications and lower net worth were significantly associated with CRN in multivariable analyses. Controlling for these economic pressures, relatively younger respondents (ages 65 â 74) and depressive symptoms were consistent independent risk factors for CRN. ConclusionsNoncost factors influenced patients' propensity to forego treatment even in the context of cost concerns. Future research encompassing clinician and health system factors should identify additional determinants of CRN beyond patients' cost pressures...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of shafts to mine safety, the feasibility of conducting a three dimensional, finite element analysis was investigated. Experience gained from three dimensional analyses of undercut and <b>fill</b> <b>stopping</b> at the Lucky Friday Mine and of vertical crater retreat mining at the Homestake Mine were useful in addressing the issues associated with shaft pillar mining. Borehole extensometers and other instruments were installed to provide data for model verification and to monitor shaft displacement. Results of a calibrated two dimensional model (UTAH 2) confirmed the premining stability evaluation. After mining began, however, concern developed because of cracks and other regions of ground motion that appeared at considerable distances from the areas of active pillar mining. The computer modeling program UTAH 3 was initiated for an intense three dimensional modeling effort. The results of that analysis indicated that the observed defects were within expectations and that the shaft would remain safe. Three dimensional analyses of alternate pillar mining scenarios indicated that more of the shaft pillar ore reserve could be recovered than previously thought on the basis of two dimensional analyses. The study demonstrated that through an integrated program of laboratory testing, stress analysis, and mine measurements, the three dimensional, finite element analysis is an engineering tool for mine stability analyses and design where the cost is justified by {{the importance}} of the mining objective, in this case, the safe and profitable recovery of ore in shaft pillars.
