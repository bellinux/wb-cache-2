50|$|Legal tender is {{a medium}} of payment {{recognized}} by a legal {{system to be}} valid for meeting a financial obligation. Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries. Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment <b>extinguishes</b> the <b>debt.</b> Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{process of}} payment is {{fundamental}} to exchange in a decentralized economy. In production economies, payments often {{take the form of}} transfers of inside money, i. e., specialized forms of debt. Associated with each type of inside money is a set of rules that governs both the legitimacy of such transfers as means of <b>extinguishing</b> other <b>debts,</b> and the allocation of the ensuing risks. In this paper the authors develop a model of debt as inside money. They focus on an historically important form of payment: “negotiable instruments ” such as the bill of exchange. In a simple mechanism design framework the authors show the advantages of transferable debt over simple chains of credit. The model is then extended to encompass other aspects of negotiability, including “endorsement ” and the rights of a “holder in due course. ” JEL classification: E 400, G 200, K 20...|$|R

60|$|May 20.--Mr. Cadell breakfasted with us, with {{a youngster}} {{for whom he}} wants {{a letter to the}} Commander or Governor of Bombay. After breakfast C. and I had some talk of business. His tidings, like those of ancient Pistol, are of Africa and golden joys. He is sure of selling at the {{starting}} 8000 copies of the Magnum, at a profit of £70 per 1000--that is, per month. This seems certain. But he thinks the sale will rise to 12,000, which will be £280 more, or £840 in all. This will tell out a gross divisible profit of upwards of £25,000. This is not unlikely, but after this comes a series of twenty volumes at least, which produce only half that quantity indeed; but then the whole profits, save commissions, are the author's. That will come to as much as the former, say £50,000 in all. This supposes I carry on the works of fiction for two or three novels more. But besides all this, Cadell entertains a plan of selling a cheaper edition by numbers and numbermen, on which he gives half the selling price. One man, Mr. Ireland, offers to take 10,000 copies of the Magnum and talks of 25,000. This allows a profit of £50 per thousand copies, not much worse than the larger copy, and Cadell thinks to carry on both. I doubt this. I have great apprehension that these interlopers would disgust the regular trade, with whom we are already deeply engaged. I also foresee selling the worst copies at the higher price. All this must be thought and cared for. In the meantime, I see a fund, from which large payments may be made to the Trustees, capable of <b>extinguishing</b> the <b>debt,</b> large as it is, in ten years or earlier, and leaving a reversion to my family of the copyrights. Sweet bodements[316]--good--but we must not reckon our chickens before they are hatched, though they are chipping the shell now. We will see how the stream takes.|$|R
40|$|The Migration Act {{requires}} that a non-citizen who is detained {{is liable to}} pay the Australian government the costs {{of his or her}} detention. This liability includes costs for the transportation of the person to and from an immigration detention centre and the daily maintenance amount for each day the person spends in detention. In certain circumstances, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) may write off a person’s debt where it has been determined uneconomical to pursue. Additionally, a person may apply to the Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance) to request a waiver of their debt. A write off does not <b>extinguish</b> the <b>debt</b> owing to the Australian government: it is merely an accounting entry and the recovery of the debt may be pursued at a later date. By contrast, a debt that is waived cannot be reinstated and is extinguished for all time. A non-citizen who has a debt owing to the Australian government may be refused a visa and/or be prevented from entering Australia at a later date if the debt has not been paid or if appropriate arrangements have not been made to repay the debt. Complaints to the Ombudsman’s office highlighted some inconsistencies with DIAC’s administration of debts. Some people complained about significant delay in processing a waiver request. In other cases {{there was a lack of}} comprehensive and timely information provided by DIAC about the debt waiver and write-off process.

2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, negotiable instruments, uncalled shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not <b>extinguish</b> the <b>debt</b> itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|R
60|$|This {{leads to}} the vexed {{question}} to which Dr. Chalmers has very particularly adverted: whether the funds required by a government for extraordinary unproductive expenditure are best raised by loans, the interest only being provided by taxes, or whether taxes should be at once laid on to the whole amount; which is called, in the financial vocabulary, raising {{the whole of the}} supplies within the year. Dr. Chalmers is strongly for the latter method. He says the common notion is that, in calling for the whole amount in one year, you require what is either impossible, or very inconvenient; that the people can not, without great hardship, pay the whole at once out of their yearly income; and that it is much better to require of them a small payment every year in the shape of interest, than so great a sacrifice once for all. To which his answer is, that the sacrifice is made equally in either case. Whatever is spent can not but be drawn from yearly income. The whole and every part of the wealth produced in the country forms, or helps to form, the yearly income of somebody. The privation which it is supposed must result from taking the amount in the shape of taxes is not avoided by taking it in a loan. The suffering is not averted, but only thrown upon the laboring-classes, the least able, and who least ought, to bear it: while all the inconveniences, physical, moral, and political, produced by maintaining taxes for the perpetual payment of the interest, are incurred in pure loss. Whenever capital is withdrawn from production, or from the fund destined for production, to be lent to the state and expended unproductively, that whole sum is withheld from the laboring-classes: the loan, therefore, is in truth paid off the same year; the whole of the sacrifice necessary for paying it off is actually made: only it is paid to the wrong persons, and therefore does not extinguish the claim; and paid by the very worst of taxes, a tax exclusively on the laboring-class. And, after having, in this most painful and unjust of ways, gone through the whole effort necessary for <b>extinguishing</b> the <b>debt,</b> the country remains charged with it, and with the payment of its interest in perpetuity.|$|R

5000|$|Archdeacon Bérard de Got {{had been}} elected Archbishop of Bordeaux in a double election, {{which had to be}} {{referred}} to the Pope for judgment; on 23 July 1289, to resolve the impasse, the Pope appointed neither Archbishop-elect, but instead named a third person to the See of Bordeaux, Henri de Genies. [...] When Archbishop Henri died in 1297, his successor was Bertrand de Got, the brother of Berard de Got. [...] It would perhaps seem that Bérard had been passed over, but this was far from the case. Instead, Pope Nicholas IV in Consistory on 23 July 1289 (the same day on which his candidacy for Archbishop of Bordeaux was rejected), named him Archbishop of Lyon. Thus, Bérard became Primate of All Gaul, Duke of Lyon, and Peer of France. Lyon was a serious problem for Archbishop Bérard. The diocese was saddled with considerable debt, due to the imprudent fiscal habits of several of his predecessors. Pope Nicholas was aware of the problem when he appointed Bérard, and he granted Bérard special license to appropriate the income of the first year of each of the benefices of his diocese for a period of five years in order to apply the money received to settle the debts. The Pope also wanted Archbishop Bérard to attack the abuse of a single person holding several benefices, out of greed and without papal dispensation. The Pope also demanded that those persons who held benefices should take up residence and be properly ordained. He granted the Archbishop the privilege of removing any person who had received benefices since the Council of Lyon (1274) who had not proceeded to the priesthood within a year of the Archbishop's arrival. Pope Nicholas also granted Archbishop Bérard the right to make his own Testament. [...] Later in the same year, when the Pope was sending as Legates to France Cardinals Gerard Bianchi and Benedetto Caetani, he instructed them to settle the longstanding differences that existed at Lyon between the Archbishop and the Cathedral Chapter. [...] But, having heard that royal officials were molesting ecclesiastical persons in the diocese of Lyon, and that some members of the Cathedral Chapter were threatening canonical censures against the Archbishop, the Pope granted the Archbishop immunity from such interferences. [...] Two years later, the debts of the diocese of Lyon were such that Pope Nicholas allowed him to keep 3,000 livres tournois out of the annual collection of some 7,000 livres tournois which were earmarked to be sent to Rome, provided that the money be used to <b>extinguish</b> the <b>debts.</b> [...] Politically, the situation in Lyon was improving. In March, 1292, the Archbishop finally came to an agreement with the Chapter and Provost over the exercise of judicial powers in the city of Lyon.|$|R
6000|$|The next {{question}} that presented itself was of far less interest, exciting no great attention. To understand it, however, {{it will be}} necessary to refer a little to history. The government of Leapthrough had, about sixty-three years before, caused one hundred and twenty-six Leaplow ships to be burned on the high seas, or otherwise destroyed. The pretence was, that they incommoded Leapthrough. Leaplow was much too great a nation to submit to so heinous an outrage, while, at the same time, she was much too magnanimous and wise a nation to resent it in an every-day and vulgar manner. Instead of getting in a passion and loading her cannon, she summoned all her logic and began to reason. After reasoning the matter with Leapthrough for fifty-two years, or until all the parties who had been wronged were dead, and could no longer be benefited by her logic, she determined to abate two-thirds of her pretensions in a pecuniary sense, and all her pretensions in an honorary sense, and to compromise the affair by accepting a certain insignificant sum of money as a salve to the whole wrong. Leapthrough conditioned to pay this money, in the most solemn and satisfactory manner; and everybody was delighted with the amicable termination of a very vexatious and a seemingly interminable discussion. Leapthrough was quite as glad to get rid of the matter as Leaplow, and very naturally, under all the circumstances, thought the whole thing at length done with, when she conditioned to pay the money. The Great Sachem of Leaplow, most unfortunately, however, had a [...] "will of iron," [...] or, in other words, he thought the money ought to be paid as well as conditioned to be paid. This despotic construction of the bargain had given rise to unheard-of dissatisfaction in Leapthrough, as indeed might have been expected; but it was, oddly enough, condemned with some heat even in Leaplow itself, where it was stoutly maintained by certain ingenious logicians, that the only true way to settle a bargain to pay money, was to make a new one for a less sum whenever the amount fell due; a plan that, with a proper moderation and patience would be certain, in time, to <b>extinguish</b> the whole <b>debt.</b>|$|R
