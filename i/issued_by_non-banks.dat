40|$|Buoyed by {{a growing}} belief that poor people need a full array of {{financial}} services, financial inclusion advocates are now focusing on how to responsibly provide low-income individuals with financial services beyond microcredit—services such as savings, payments and insurance. A primary obstacle to the provision of such services, particularly low-value payments and savings, has historically been high transaction costs. It has been too expensive to develop the infrastructure required to profitably reach underserved population segments. Branchless banking, however, is changing the economics of providing financial services by leveraging existing and widespread retail outlets and technology, particularly mobile telephones, to provide more services to more people at lower cost. When using branchless banking to provide savings services, regulation is often the key obstacle, {{particularly in the case}} of e‑money <b>issued</b> <b>by</b> <b>non-banks</b> such as mobile network operators. 1 In an effort to distinguish such products from savings accounts, regulators around the world have regulated them as “payments ” services, denying e‑money accounts the benefit of interest payments and deposit insurance. In some cases, these prohibitions extend to e‑money issued by banks, particularly in countries such as the Philippines and Malaysia where e‑money is regulated as a product regardless of whether the issuer is a bank or non-bank. In regulating e‑money as a payments product, regulators may be missing an opportunity to make great progress in financial inclusion. E‑money can safely and efficiently be used as a savings vehicle. Regulators should allow e‑money to offer the full benefit of savings accounts—interest and deposit insurance—to the millions of low-income e‑money users...|$|E

That limited availability is itself a creature of regulation. By examining the recent deregulation of commercial paper <b>issues</b> <b>by</b> financial intermediaries, we explore {{the dynamics of the}} regulatory process that originally contributed to [...] if not caused [...] the current distress. We also use this case study to explore the dynamics of the Japanese legislative and regulatory process more generally. We characterize deregulation as a bargain between banks and the newer non-bank intermediaries: the banks acquiesced to commercial paper <b>issues</b> <b>by</b> <b>non-banks,</b> while the non-banks agreed to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. The non-banks obtained a cost-effective way to raise additional funds; the banks brought their new competitors within their regulatorily enforced cartel. At a specific level, the dynamics illustrate the classic Stiglerian theory of regulation; at a more general level, they illustrate the trans-national economic logic to the Japanese legislative and regulatory process. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{monetary}} DSGE model by Gertler and Karadi (2011) with a non-bank financial intermediary {{to investigate the}} impact of monetary policy shocks on aggregate loan supply. We distinguish between bank and non-bank intermediaries based on the liquidity of their credit claims. While banks can endogenously create deposits to fund rm loans, non-banks have to raise deposits on the funding market to function as intermediaries. The funding market is modeled via search and matching <b>by</b> <b>non-banks</b> for available deposits of households. Because deposit creation responds to economy-wide productivity automatically, bank reaction to shocks corresponds to the balance sheet channel. <b>Non-banks</b> are constrained <b>by</b> the available deposits and their behavior is better explained by the lending channel. The two credit channels are affcted differently following a monetary policy shock. As {{a result of these}} counteracting effects, an increasing non-bank sector leads to a reduced reaction of aggregate loan supply following a monetary policy shock, which is consistent with the data.

At present the main concern of NBFIs of Bangladesh is collecting fund for investment at a lower cost.

Other issues stem from severe competition from banks, volatile stock market, and lack of trained human resource and absence of secondary market for loan products.

External bank liabilities held <b>by</b> <b>non-banks</b> are found to increase after the introduction of explicit deposit insurance.

This suggests that international competition in the area of deposit insurance design - as possible under the EU deposit insurance directive of 1994 - would be fruitless. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.
