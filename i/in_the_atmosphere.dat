5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W.

Previous detections of water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose that}} Ar- 40 {{measured}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lunar <b>atmosphere</b> {{and that in}} Mercury's atmosphere is due to current diffusion into connected pore space within the crust. Higher temperatures at Mercury, along with more rapid loss from <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> {{will lead to a}} smaller column abundance of argon at Mercury than at the Moon, given the same crustal abundance of potassium. Because the noble gas abundance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hermean <b>atmosphere</b> represents current effusion, it is a direct measure of the crustal potassium abundance. Ar- 40 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of <b>the</b> planets is a measure of potassium abundance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interiors, since Ar- 40 is a product of radiogenic decay of K- 40 by electron capture with the subsequent emission of a 1. 46 eV gamma-ray. Although <b>the</b> Ar- 40 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earth's <b>atmosphere</b> is expected to have accumulated since the late bombardment, Ar- 40 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of Mercury and the Moon is eroded quickly by photoionization and electron impact ionization. Thus, <b>the</b> argon content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exospheres of the Moon and Mercury is representative of current effusion rather than accumulation over the lifetime of the planet...|$|R
40|$|The close-in extrasolar giant planets (CEGPs) {{reside in}} {{irradiated}} environments much {{more intense than}} that of <b>the</b> giant planets <b>in</b> our solar system. The high UV irradiance strongly influences their photochemistry and the general current view believed that this high UV flux will greatly enhance photochemical production of hydrocarbon aerosols. In this letter, we investigate hydrocarbon aerosol formation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of CEGPs. We find that the abundances of hydrocarbons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of CEGPs are significantly {{less than that of}} Jupiter except for models <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> CH 4 abundance is unreasonably high (as high as CO) for the hot (effective temperatures � 1000 K) <b>atmospheres.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> hydrocarbons will be condensed out to form aerosols only when the temperature-pressure profiles of the species intersect with the saturation profiles—a case almost certainly not realized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hot CEGPs <b>atmospheres.</b> Hence our models show that photochemical hydrocarbon aerosols are insignificant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of CEGPs. <b>In</b> contrast, Jupiter and Saturn have a much higher abundance of hydrocarbon aerosols in their atmospheres which are responsible for strong absorption shortward of 600 nm.
