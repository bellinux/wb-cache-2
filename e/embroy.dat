40|$|In {{the course}} of this study no {{significant}} differences in the length of pollen-tubes of ecological types collected from natural stations (Trifolium pratense L. var. spontaneum Willk., T. hybridum L. and T. repens L,) were found as compared with their polyploid forms obtained in the experimental way. Disorders in fertilization, decay of unfertilized embryo sacs, and degeneration of <b>embroys</b> were observed more frequently on a percentage basis in the polyploid forms. Embryo and endosperm development were similar in the initial species and in the experimentally obtained polyploids...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The zona pellucida (ZP) and cumulus-corona cells (CC cells) {{surrounding}} human oocytes, polypronuclear ova and <b>embroys</b> {{derived from}} IVF eggs were studied by SEM/TEM {{to evaluate whether}} their possible alteration may influence oocyte fertilizability and early embryonic development. The outer surface of the ZP surrounding preovulatory oocytes showed a spongy structure, with numerous penetrations. In immature and atretic oocytes, the external aspect of the ZP had a compact, smooth architecture. Numerous penetrating sperm were present on the spongy ZP, whereas only a few, flattened spermatozoa were attached to the compact, smooth-surfaced zona. Condensation of the outer aspect of the ZP may cause disruption and/or reduction of its sperm-binding sites, thereby impeding sperm attachment. This, in turn, may reduce oocyte fertilizability. The CC cells were packed loosely and projected many microvilli and blebs into the wide intercellular spaces. Most CC cells possessed large cytoplasma containing mitochondria with tubular cristae; well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum membranes, and lipid droplets. This arrangement typical of steroidogenic cells, is {{comparable to that of}} parietal granulosa cells, just prior to and following ovulation, and subsequent luteinization. The presence of numerous enlarged, luteinized CC cells about oocytes, polypronuclear ova and <b>embroys</b> did not seem to exert a negative effect on fertilization. Indeed, these elements may promote fertilization by modifying, selecting and helping to orient the sperm present around the oocyte and cotribute toward early embryonic development by secreting small amounts of progesterone...|$|R
40|$|Mutations of the {{segmentation}} gene Krüppel (Kr) cause deletions of contiguous sets of body segments {{from the}} middle region of the Drosophila embryo. We have monitored expression in situ of three other genes implicated {{in the establishment of}} the body plan, namely hairy (h), fushi tarazu (ftz) and engrailed (en), in mutant Kr embryos. Our results show that the pattern of expression of all three genes depends upon Kr+ activity and are consistent with a hierarchical model of segmentation gene activity. In addition, we find that the initial expression of the homoeotic selector gene Ultrabithorax(Ubx) follows a novel pattern in Kr- <b>embroys</b> indicating a close integration of the spatial control of homoeotic and segmantation gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Glycoproteins {{released}} from carrot cells into culture media {{were analyzed by}} sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue or with the periodic-acid Schiff procedure. The appearance or disappearance of two glycoproteins of Mr 65, 000 (GP 65) and Mr 57, 000 (GP 57) was {{closely related to the}} formation of somatic <b>embroys.</b> GP 65 was released specifically from embryogenic cells cultured in a medium without 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, in which they can form somatic embryos. GP 57 was {{released from}} the same embryogenic cells, if they were cultured in a medium with 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, in which they cannot form somatic embryos. Nonembryogenic cells which cannot form somatic embryos, released only GP 57...|$|R
40|$|In {{parthenogenetic}} {{females of}} a clone of the aphid Megoura viciae (Homoptera, Aphididae), more than 50 % {{of the cells}} show heteromorphism between homologous NORs which are located on one telomeric region of the two X chromosomes. Using different techniques, such as staining with the CG-specific fluorochrome chromomycin A(3), silver staining and in-situ hybridization with an rDNA probe, we {{have shown that the}} observed heteromorphism is due to an unequal distribution of ribosomal genes between homologous NOR regions. The total number of rDNA genes per individual aphid remained constant. Moreover, the analysis of cells from single <b>embroys</b> has shown that the observed heteromorphism is not only intraclonal but also intraindividual. These data, together with the finding of X chromosomes connected by chromatin bridges between their NORs, allow us to suggest that mitotic unequal crossing over could be the main cause of NOR heteomorphism in this taxon...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:To {{identify}} the gene causing rod-cone dystrophy/amelogenesis imperfecta Methods:Homozygosity mapping was performed using the Affymetrix 50 K XbaI array in one family and candidate {{genes in the}} linked interval were sequenced with ABI Dye Terminator, vers. 1 in the index patient of 3 families. The identified mutations were screened in normal control individuals. Expression analyses were performed on RNA extracted from the brain, {{various parts of the}} eye and teeth; immunostaining was done on mouse eyes and jaw and knock-down experiments were carried out in zebrafish <b>embroys.</b> Results:Sequencing the coding regions of ancient conserved domain protein 4 (CNNM 4), a metal ions transporter, revealed a 1 -base pair duplication (p. L 438 fs) in family A, a p. R 236 Q mutation in family B and a p. L 324 P in family C. All these mutations were homozygous and involved very conserved amino acids in paralogs and orthologs. Immunostaining and RT-PCR confirmed that CNNM 4 was strongly expressed {{in various parts of the}} eye and in the teeth. Morpholino experiments in zebrafish showed a loss of ganglion cells at 5 days post fertilization. Conclusions:The rod-cone dystrophy/amelogenesis imperfecta syndrome is caused by mutation in CNNM 4 and is due to aberrant metal ion homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to find a good}} method to {{evaluate}} embryos we classified the in vitro embryos into freezable and non-freezable by subjective method. These embryos were compared with in vivo freezable embryos using Giemsa staining. The embryo development and viability was evaluated by fluorescent stain (PDA and Hoechst 33342) and compared with the result after Giemsa stain. That number of cells in freezable in vitro and in vivo embryos were not different (P > 0. 1), while in vitro fresszable and non-freezable embryos showed significantly differences (P < 0, 001) in number of cells. The agreement between Hoechst 33342 and Giemsa stain was quite high (63 %) in embryos with number of cells less than 20, and low agreement (25 - 34 %) in embryios with number of cells more than 20. There was a significantly correlation (0. 82) betwen the degree of fluorescent of FDA stain and the number of cells at Giemsa stain. The subjective classification of in vitro embryos can be used in the practical situation. PDA staining is a good tool to check this classification as well as to evaluate the development and viability of <b>embroys</b> in different step of experimental trials. Hoechst can be a valuabl...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the bialophos (bar) and phosphomannose isomerase (pmi) selectable markers in microprojectile mediated transformation of P 898012, a sorghum inbred line generally considered amenable to in vitro manipulation was investigated. Two plasmids containing bar gene, encoding bialaphos resistance and manA gene, for phosphomannose isomerase, both under the control maize ubiquitin promoter and nopaline synthase terminator were used to transform Immature Zygotic <b>Embroys</b> (IZE) of sorghum via particle bombardment using a particle infolw gun. Transgene integration in putatively trangenic plants was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. The expression of the bar gene in transgenic plants was demonstrated by the BASTA laef painting assay. Present results indicated a transformation {{efficiency of}} 0. 11 % and 75 % escapes in the apparent bialaphos resistant plants. A transformation efficiency of 0. 77 % was observed on manA selection and all plants recovered contained the manA gene. Besides an improved transformation efficiency, mannose selection offers a more environmentally sound system as sugar metabolism is considered ecologically neutral should it inadvertently be transformed to wil sorghum species.

40|$|Preimplantation genetic {{screening}} is being scrutinized, as recent randomized clinical trials failed {{to observe the}} expected significant increase in live birth rates following {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) -based screening. Although these randomized clinical trials are criticized on their design, skills or premature stop, it is generally believed that well-designed and well-executed randomized clinical trials would resolve the debate about the potential benefit of preimplantation {{genetic screening}}. Since FISH can analyze {{only a limited number of}} chromosomal loci, some of the embryos transferred might be diagnosed as ‘normal’ but in fact be aneuploid for one or more chromosomes not tested. Hence, genome-wide array comparative genome hybridization screening enabling aneuploidy detection of all chromosomes was thought to be a first step toward a better design. We recently showed array screening indeed enables accurate determination of the copy number state of all chromosomes in a single cell. Surprisingly, however, this genome-wide array screening revealed a much higher frequency and complexity of chromosomal aberrations in early embryos than anticipated, with imbalances in a staggering 90 % of all embryos. The mitotic error rate in cleavage stage embryos was proven to be higher than the meiotic aneuploidy rate and as a consequence, the genome of a single blastomere is not representative for the genome of the other cells of the embryo. Hence, potentially viable embryos will be discarded upon screening a single blastomere. This observation provides a biological basis for the failure of the randomized clinical trials to increase baby-take-home rates using FISH on cleavage stage <b>embroys...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the critical cell numbers needed to form blastocyst stage <b>embroys,</b> bisected mouse embryos of 8 -cell stage and compacted morula (approximately 16 cells) containing different numbers of blastomeres were cultured in vitro. The percentage of bisected compacted morulae with 7 - 9 blastomeres that developed to eu-blastocysts was 98. 8 %, while only 64. 2 % of the bisected 8 -cell embryos with 4 blastomeres developed to eu-blastocysts. The percentage of eu-blastocysts decreased, while that of pseudo-blastocysts and trophectodermal vesicles increased {{as the number}} of blastomeres decreased in the bisected embryos of the two stages. Inner cell masses were observed in all the eu-blastocysts and in 87. 3 % of the pseudo-blastocysts that developed from bisected embryos. The cell number of inner cell mass in the pseudo-blastocysts was significantly less than that of eu-blastocysts (P< 0. 01). The ratios of inner cell mass to total cell number of eu-blastocysts that developed from 4 blastomeres in 8 -cell embryos and from 7 - 9 blastomeres in compacted morulae were similar to those of control embryos, respectively. However, the ratios decreased in proportion to the {{decrease in the number of}} blastomeres in the two groups. Five sets of monozygotic twins and 4 singletons of live fetuses were obtained after transfer of the 20 twin sets of eu-blastocysts that developed from the bisected compacted morulae with 7 - 9 blastomeres. However, no implantation occurred when the pseudo-blastocysts that developed from bisected compacted morulae with 6 or fewer blastomeres were transferred. Weight of fetuses that developed from bisected embryos on Day 18 of pregnancy were significantly lower than those of the control...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} respond plastically to the {{environment}} has allowed amphibians to evolve a response to spatial and temporal variation in predation threat (Benard 2004). <b>Embroys</b> exposed to egg predation are expected to hatch out earlier than their conspecifics. Larval predation can induce a suite of phenotypic changes including growing a larger tail area. When presented with cues from both egg and larval predators, embryos are expected {{to respond to the}} egg predator by hatching out earlier because the egg predator presents an immediate threat. However, hatching early may be costly in the larval environment in terms of development, morphology, and/or behavior. We created a laboratory experiment in which we exposed clutches of spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) eggs to both egg (caddisfly larvae) and larval (A. opacum) predators to test this hypothesis. We recorded hatching time and stage and took developmental and morphological data of the animals a week after hatching. Larvae were entered into lethal predation trials with a larval predatory sunfish (Lepomis sp.) in order to study behavior. We found that animals exposed to the egg predator cues hatched out earlier and at earlier developmental stages than conspecifics regardless of whether there was a larval predator present. Animals exposed to larval predator cues grew relatively larger tails and survived longer in the lethal predation trials. However the group exposed to both predators showed a cost of early hatching in terms of lower tail area and shorter survival time in predation trials. The morphological and developmental effects measured of hatching plasticity were transient as there were no developmental or morphological differences between the treatment groups at metamorphosis. Hatching plasticity may be transient {{but it is important to}} the development and survival of many amphibians...|$|R
40|$|Genes in each {{somatic cell}} {{of the living}} body are usually {{expressed}} equally from both fathers 2 ̆ 7 and mothers 2 ̆ 7 alleles. As one exception of this in mammals, however, genomic imprinting phenomenon has been reported, in which the expression of either fathers 2 ̆ 7 or mothers 2 ̆ 7 allele is specifically repressed. Mouse parthengenetic and androgenetic embryos are unioarental <b>embroys</b> in which paternally derived genes and maternally derived genes cannot be expressed, respectively. Using these embryos, many imorinted genes have been identified. To identify novel imprinted genes, several technologies, such as cDNA subtraction and differential display method have been used. However, some drawbacks have been pointed out, suggesting that these methods lead to many false positive results caused by PCR-mediated amplification. Then, I have improved the RLCS-window separation method, which is baced on the visualization of cDNA spots without PCR-mediated amplification in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis images. on the other hand, the cDNA microarray method has recently been established for the purpose to extensively analyze the gene expression. In this mothod, two cDNA sampls labeled with different fluorescence dyes are subjected to competitive hudridazation on the cDNA microarray, onto which {{a huge number of}} cDBA are spotted. By determination of the fluorescence intensity of each spot, difference in expression between samples can be eluucidated simultaneously {{for tens of thousands of}} genes. In order to search for the novel imprinted genes effectively, mouse cDNA microarray was employed and the genes expressed differentially between two uniparental embryos were systematically analyzed. Twenty-seven genes, including 9 known imprinted genes, were found to be expressed differentially in uniparental embryos. To examine biallelically whether these 18 candidate imprinted genes are expressed biallelically or monoallelically in normal diploid embryos, expressed alleles of these were investigated. Three genes -Asb 4, Ata 3 and Dcn- were expressed only from one specific allele in day- 15. 5 normalembryos. Eight other genes, however, were expressed from both alleles. These results suggested that not only imprinted that not only imorinted genes but also certain non-impromted genes are expressed differentially in uniparental embryos and these genes may function under the control of imprinted genes. Four out of 18 genes were located very close to the known imprinted regions on the chromosome. Application of the cDNA microarray method to search for the defferentially expressed genes enabled us to identify effectively the novel imprinted genes, and this high-throughput analysis may also have the capability to identify the imprinting-related genes. In future, by applying this method further using the cDNA microarray which contains the complete set of mouse genes, novel imprinted genes will be comprehensively identofoed. Further identification of imprinted genes and genes under the control of imprinted genes should lead to elucidation of the mechanism of imprinting phenomenon and give clues for treatment of many imprinting-related human deseases.
