5|$|A Pakistani defence {{official}} reportedly {{admitted that}} {{soldiers in the}} Pakistani border post sitting there {{for the express purpose}} of stopping infiltration <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> few flares, a couple of mortar rounds and one or two bursts of machine-gun fire in that direction.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Sheaffe and {{his staff}} decided to entrust the funeral {{arrangements}} to Captain John Glegg, who had served with Brock for many years. On 16 October, a funeral procession for Brock and Colonel Macdonell went from Government House to Fort George, with soldiers from the British Army, the colonial militia, and First Nations warriors {{on either side of}} the route. The caskets were lowered into a freshly dug grave at the northeast corner of Fort George. The British <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> twenty-one gun salute in three salvos, in a gesture of respect. Later that day, the American garrison at Fort Niagara respectfully <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> similar salute. Over five thousand people attended the funeral, a remarkable number given the limited population of Upper Canada at that time.|$|E
5|$|By 04:00 on 1June, the German fleet had evaded the British {{fleet and}} reached Horns Reef; the Germans then {{returned}} to port. In {{the course of the}} battle, Stettin had suffered eight men killed and another 28 wounded. She had <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> total of 81 rounds of ammunition from her 10.5cm guns.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]500 S&W Magnum was {{designed}} to <b>fire</b> <b>a</b> bullet with a diameter of [...]500 inch mm unlike the [...]500 Linebaugh, which <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> [...]510 in (12.9 mm) bullet. This was done {{so as not to}} run afoul of the National Firearms Act and be considered a Destructive Device as had happened to Whildin’s [...]50 AE cartridge, which at first {{was designed}} to <b>fire</b> <b>a</b> [...]510 in (12.9 mm) but had to be redesigned to <b>fire</b> <b>a</b> [...]500 in instead.|$|R
50|$|<b>Firing</b> <b>a</b> cannon salute {{partially}} disarms the ship, so <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> cannon for no combat reason showed {{respect and}} trust. As the tradition evolved, {{the number of}} cannon <b>fired</b> became <b>an</b> indication of the rank of the official being saluted.|$|R

5|$|In September 1780, HMS Vulture <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> {{cannonball}} {{into the}} gravestone of Abraham Ladew, Jr., {{who died in}} 1774, {{at the age of}} 7 years. The Vulture was traveling south from Croton Point to pick up Major John André, a rendezvous that never occurred; Andre was captured in Tarrytown {{on his way to the}} vessel.|$|E
5|$|Marxuach <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> {{warning shot}} from a cannon {{located at the}} Santa Rosa battery of El Morro fort, in what is {{considered}} to be the first shot of World War I fired by the regular armed forces of the United States against a ship flying the colors of the Central Powers, forcing the Odenwald to stop and to return to port where its supplies were confiscated.|$|E
5|$|On 12 August, UB-8 <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> torpedoe at HMS Manica from 500 yards, {{which passed}} under Manica's shallow draught, the {{submarine}} was then sighted outside net, two torpedoes fired and missed Manica, which hit the net at an acute angle and burst. An attack {{two days later}} on similar vessels was also unsuccessful.|$|E

5000|$|... 12 True Blue Defenders. They were a United Nations type {{light blue}} plastic 70mm toy {{soldiers}} dressed in late World War II early Korean War U.S. Army uniform. They came in 6 poses of <b>a</b> Master Sergeant <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> pistol, a buck sergeant with M-1928A1 Thompson sub machine gun throwing a pineapple hand grenade, one <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> M-1928A1 Thompson, one <b>firing</b> <b>an</b> M-1 rifle, one charging with an M-1 with fixed Bayonet, and one kneeling <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> Bazooka. The Blue Defenders in this set {{do not have}} a slit perforation on the base like the other figures provided with the vehicles have.|$|R
5|$|Operating from a joint British-Dutch base at Ceylon, Telemachus sank the Japanese Kadai-class {{submarine}} I-166 in the Strait of Malacca on 17 July 1944. Telemachus tracked I-166 for 30 minutes, then <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> {{spread of}} six torpedoes. One torpedo hit, and sank the Japanese boat with 89 lives lost; five men on bridge watch survived {{to be rescued}} by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|U-255 sailed from Narvik on 22 February 1943 {{out into}} the {{northern}} seas once more. On 5 March she <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> spread of three torpedoes at Convoy RA-53, sailing from Murmansk to Scotland, and hit two American merchant ships; the 4,978 ton Hog Islander Executive, loaded with 1,500 tons of potassium chloride, and the 7,191 ton Liberty ship Richard Bland, carrying 4,000 tons of lumber.|$|E
5|$|U-43 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 13 May 1940 and {{out into}} the Atlantic. Her first attack took place on 28 May, {{south-west}} of Land's End, when she <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> torpedo at the British merchant ship Alca. She missed, and then opened fire with her deck gun. The armed ship returned fire, but neither vessel made any hits; the U-boat broke off the attack.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]400/360 Westley Richards <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> [...]358 in calibre, 314 gr g bullet at a {{velocity}} of 1900 ft/s. Westley Richards also produced a rimless {{version of this}} cartridge, also <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> 314 gr bullet.|$|R
50|$|This gun design {{originated}} in 1871 as an 11.6 inch mm gun <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> 700 lb projectile. Results were unsatisfactory, {{leading to the}} gun being bored out to 12 inch mm and <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> 706 lb shell.|$|R
50|$|Without {{sufficient}} oxygen, <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> cannot begin, and it cannot continue. With a decreased oxygen concentration, {{the combustion}} process slows. Oxygen can be denied to <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> using <b>a</b> carbon dioxide <b>fire</b> extinguisher, <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> blanket or water.|$|R
5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E
5|$|A shot rang out. It {{was likely}} a warning shot fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, {{and then the}} narrow group up front, possibly thinking the order to fire had been given, <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.|$|E
5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up the stairs, and then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side. Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E

5000|$|The [...]400/350 Nitro Express <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> [...]358" [...] {{diameter}} 310 grain projectile {{at either}} 2000 fps or 2150 fps, {{depending on the}} source. The later [...]350 Rigby No 2 uses the same cartridge case but <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> lighter projectile at higher velocities.|$|R
5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns. The film performed {{better in the}} French and West German markets, {{largely due to the}} presence of Trintignant and Kinski. It has been reported that during a screening of the film in Sicily, one audience member <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> gun at the screen in anger over the film's ending.|$|E
5|$|During the 1991 Gulf War, USS Missouri and USS Wisconsin used ABL {{launchers}} to fire Tomahawk {{missiles at}} Iraqi targets during Operation Desert Storm. Wisconsin {{served as the}} Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> total of 24 of her own TLAMs {{during the first two}} days of the campaign.|$|E
50|$|The Shock Blaster is the close-range {{weapon of}} the Ghostbusters arsenal. It <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> blast of {{stripped}} dark matter particles that diffuse quickly {{when they come}} in contact with the outside world. The Ghostbusters use the Shock Blaster for fighting close-proximity entities and inhabiting swarmers. The Shock Blaster also <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> Stasis Stream which <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> high-capacity stream that hypobond to ectoplasmic matter. If a Ghostbuster trains the stream on a ghost long enough, he can actually stop it entirely.|$|R

5000|$|In the Enter the Matrix video game, {{the player}} {{can find a}} [...] "Chloro-Bromo Methane Gun", which is used as <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> extinguisher. It <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> {{pressurized}} cartridge of CBM gas to put out fires. However, due to its chemical properties, <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> cartridge near people causes their lungs to fill with liquid, effectively drowning them.|$|R
5|$|During the conflict, several {{claims of}} Iraqi air-to-air successes were made, {{including}} an Iraqi pilot, Khudai Hijab, who allegedly <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> Vympel R-27R missile from his MIG-29 and damaged a B-52G {{on the opening}} night of the Gulf War. However, the U.S. Air Force disputes this claim, stating the bomber was actually hit by friendly fire, an AGM-88 High-speed, Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) that homed on the fire-control radar of the B-52's tail gun; the jet was subsequently renamed In HARM's Way. Shortly following this incident, General George Lee Butler announced that the gunner position on B-52 crews would be eliminated, and the gun turrets permanently deactivated, commencing on 1 October 1991.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann patiently {{waited for}} the right moment to escape, then, using the {{distraction}} of the Stukas attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann jumped {{out of the back of}} the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{weather in}} the form of monsoons in the {{northern}} half of South Vietnam reduced indigenous coastal traffic during October 1968 and the U.S. Navy's PCF support of Market Time was limited by heavy seas; however, Market Time units including Squadron One cutters <b>fired</b> <b>a</b> record number of naval gunfire missions for the sixth month in a row. The 1,027 missions conducted during October was 19 percent higher than the previous record.|$|E
50|$|On Memorial Day, {{batteries}} {{on military}} installations <b>fire</b> <b>a</b> 21-gun salute to the nation's fallen. As well, batteries at Naval stations and on ships, <b>fire</b> <b>a</b> salute of 21-minute guns and display the ensign at half-mast from 8 a.m. until {{completion of the}} salute.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the UMP: the UMP45, <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> [...]45 ACP cartridge; the UMP40, <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> [...]40 S&W cartridge; and the UMP9, <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. Apart from the different chambering, all versions feature the same basic design, the most noticeable difference being the curved magazine used on the UMP9 (whereas the UMP40 and UMP45 use a straight magazine). All three {{versions of the}} weapon {{can be converted to}} any of the available chamberings via replacement of the bolt, barrel, and magazine.|$|R
