5|$|A mid-table {{finish in}} 1970–71 meant {{that for the}} <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years Manchester City did not qualify for Europe. The {{following}} year, a fourth-placed league finish gave the club a berth in the UEFA Cup for the first time. The UEFA Cup had replaced the Fairs Cup in 1971, when control of the competition transferred to UEFA. City's debut in the competition was a short one. Drawn against a Valencia side managed by Alfredo Di Stéfano, City were bounced out in the 2nd leg at the Mestalla 3-2,despite producing a pulsating 2–2 draw at Maine Road in the 1st leg.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, both leagues {{were dealing}} with serious {{financial}} problems. The St. Louis Blues {{were on the verge}} of bankruptcy. Talk of a merger between the NHL and the WHA was growing. In 1976, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> decades, the NHL approved franchise relocations; the Scouts moved after just two years in Kansas City to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies, while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons. Two years later, after failed overtures about merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver, the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars, reducing the NHL to 17 teams for 1978–79.|$|E

5|$|Carlsen won the Vugar Gashimov Memorial in Şəmkir, Azerbaijan, played from 20–30 April. He {{played in}} the A group along with Caruana, Nakamura, Karjakin, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Radjabov. Carlsen started the tournament with 2/2, beating Mamedyarov and Nakamura. He then drew against Karjakin, only to lose two {{games in a row}} for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years, losing to Caruana with black and then with white to Radjabov. In {{the second half of the}} tournament, Carlsen scored 4/5, beating Mamedyarov and Nakamura again, and {{securing}} the tournament victory by beating Caruana in the final round, finishing with +5−2=3.|$|E
5|$|Question Time {{was held}} in BBC Television Centre in London, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years, to enable the police to keep order for Griffin's appearance. The {{audience}} was expected by The Times to number 200 people and to comprise {{a broad spectrum of}} political views, including BNP supporters and left-wing groups. The recording of the edition of 22 October was brought forward two hours from the usual 8.30pm start time to allow for any disruption, before being broadcast later the same night.|$|E
5|$|Ramón Calderón {{was elected}} as club {{president}} on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello {{as the new}} coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked {{at the end of}} the campaign. On 9 June 2007, Real played against Zaragoza at La Romareda. Zaragoza led Real 2–1 near the end of the match while Barcelona were also winning against Espanyol 2–1. A late Ruud van Nistelrooy equalizer followed by a last-minute Raúl Tamudo goal sprang Real Madrid's title hopes back into their favour.|$|E

5|$|Silver {{performed}} in {{public for the}} <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years in 2004, appearing with an octet at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York. He was not often seen in public after this. In 2005, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences awarded him its President's Merit Award. In 2006, Let's Get to the Nitty Gritty: The Autobiography of Horace Silver, was published by the University of California Press. A 2008 release, Live at Newport '58, from a Silver concert fifty years earlier, reached the top ten of Billboards jazz chart.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{negative}} impact on Bertuzzi's individual play, the media speculated that {{the fallout from the}} Moore incident had become a distraction to the organization as a whole. Compounding the situation in Vancouver, the Canucks had missed the playoffs for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years. As such, general manager Dave Nonis spent the off-season making significant changes to the Canucks lineup. On June 23, 2006, he traded Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). After seven-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks, Bertuzzi left the club ranked seventh all-time among franchise scoring leaders with 449 points.|$|E
5|$|For a franchise-record seventh {{consecutive}} season, {{he led the}} Canucks in scoring, with 32goals and 79points. Despite new NHL rules set {{in place}} after the lockout that sought to allow skilled players such as Näslund and his linemates to thrive, all {{three members of the}} Canucks' top line saw decreased offensive production in 2005–06. Furthermore, the Canucks failed to make the playoffs for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> seasons, finishing at ninth place in the Western Conference, despite early-season projections to be Stanley Cup contenders. Consequently, significant changes to the Canucks' personnel were made in the off-season. Of particular significance to Näslund, longtime linemate Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, while Alain Vigneault replaced Marc Crawford with a more defensive-minded coaching approach. Crawford later recalled the 2005–06 season as a turning point in Näslund's role as the offensive leader on the team, noting that Henrik and Daniel Sedin had surpassed him and Bertuzzi in that respect as the campaign progressed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{competition}} was held from 31 March to 3 April in Montreal. For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the <b>four</b> year {{existence of the}} women's Coupe Dodge, the women's tournament will be contested in a city different from the men's competition: 118 women's teams (1775 girls players [...] ) in 14 category.|$|R

5|$|In 1967, Windle retired, {{but made}} a {{comeback}} {{to compete in}} the shorter distances after being persuaded by Talbot. In 1968, Windle anchored Indiana's 880yd freestyle relay to victory at the National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, sealing what would be the first of six consecutive men's team titles for the university. He then competed in the Australian Championships for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years. Although he did not win any individual events, he was part of New South Wales' winning quartets in the 4×100m and 4×200m freestyle relays. Windle was appointed the captain of the men's Olympic swimming team, gaining selection for the 100m and 200m freestyle events and the respective freestyle relays. He was not selected for the 1500m freestyle, ending the defence of his Olympic title before the team had reached Mexico City.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State/Virginia Tech matchup was the 31st {{game between}} the two teams since they first met in 1955. At the time, Florida State held the {{advantage}} in wins, with a 19101 record against Virginia Tech. Heading into the 2002 Gator Bowl, however, spread bettors predicted a reversal of that trend as Virginia Tech was favored to win by two points on Dec. 10. This was reflective of an overall feeling of pessimism toward the Seminoles, who hadn't finished out of {{first place in the}} ACC since joining the league in 1992, and would not participate in the national championship game for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years. Because of this decline in stature, the fact that the game was a rematch of the 2000 national championship game received less coverage than it would have otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} West Ham and Millwall has {{involved}} considerable violence {{and is one}} of the most notorious within the world of football hooliganism. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the 2009–10 League Cup and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. Clashes between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium, with serious injuries, include the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game. In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.|$|E

50|$|Soon {{after being}} {{fired by the}} Raiders, Callahan was hired at Nebraska. This would mark the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> over <b>four</b> decades (since the hiring of Bob Devaney in 1962) that the Cornhuskers would be led by a head coach with no direct ties to the {{university}} either as a player or an assistant coach.|$|R
50|$|His next {{fight against}} former PRIDE veteran Mike Bourke on February 13, 2009 at The Selland Arena in Fresno, California—was {{a part of}} the Valentine's Eve Massacre Event.

5|$|With Montreal, Linden {{was often}} injured, and only {{appeared}} in 50 games {{during his first}} season with the Canadiens, scoring 30 points, while the next year he appeared in 57 games, scoring 33 points. While with the Canadiens, he signed a four-year contract worth $15 million; however, he was traded {{for the third time}} in his career, this time to the Washington Capitals, going with Dainius Zubrus, and New Jersey's 2nd round choice in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft (later traded to Tampa Bay who picked Andreas Holmqvist) in exchange for Richard Zednik, Jan Bulis, and Washington's 1st round choice in the 2001 Draft (Alexander Perezhogin). With Washington, Linden reached the playoffs for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years, in the 2000–01 season.|$|E
5|$|Australia progressed {{quickly at}} the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs, {{including}} three boundaries, from the opening over, bowled by Bedser, while Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. Yardley tried to stop the run-scoring by bringing on Young, but Morris hit him for four and the bowler was promptly taken off. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Bedser bowled Morris for nine; after bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch. Bradman came to the crease and batted for 12 minutes without getting off the mark. From the 10th ball he faced, the Australian skipper was out for a duck, again caught by Hutton at short fine leg in Bedser's leg trap. Bradman showed obvious displeasure at allowing himself to be dismissed by the same trap in consecutive innings, and his departure left Australia at 48/2. It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> tours to England that Bradman had made a duck in a Test.|$|E
5|$|Back, leg, {{and neck}} {{injuries}} {{began to take}} a toll on Van Buren in 1950, and his production dropped. He broke his toe in the 1950 off-season and suffered from bone spurs, which caused him to miss the team's four preseason exhibition games and regular season opener. He returned to lead the league in carries for the fourth straight season, but lost the rushing title for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years and had career-lows in touchdowns and yards per carry. The Eagles finished with a 6–6 regular season record. Greasy Neale was fired by the Eagles the following February and replaced by Bo McMillin. In 1951, Van Buren played alongside his brother, halfback and linebacker Ebert, whom the Eagles selected in that year's draft out of LSU. The elder Van Buren continued to play through injuries, taking several shots of Novocaine before each game. He had a career-low 327 rushing yards for the season, as the Eagles finished with a losing record {{for the first time}} since 1942.|$|E
50|$|The {{organization}} saw {{a significant}} increase in revenue during 2013 and was able to cover all expenses for the year for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> at least <b>four</b> years.|$|R
25|$|Brosque {{started the}} 09/10 season impressively forming a strong {{partnership}} with Mark Bridge {{in the forward}} line. These performances saw Brosque rewarded with a recall to the Socceroos for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> over <b>four</b> years. On 22 July 2010, Brosque signed a three-year contract extension with Sydney FC, keeping him at the club {{until the end of}} the 2013–14 season.|$|R
50|$|Colleges Ontario {{recognized}} The Hydro One-College Consortium {{with the}} 2008 Community/Corporate Partnership Award.

5|$|Despite the club's {{lack of any}} {{silverware}} for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years, Selwood's individual {{season was}} recognised and rewarded on various fronts. He was once again nominated by his peers for both the AFLPA Most Valuable Player Award and the AFLPA Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award, placing fifth and second overall respectively. During the 2010 Brownlow Medal count, Selwood polled 21votes to place fourth overall and second at Geelong behind Gary Ablett, Jr. (26votes). Selwood was selected in the All-Australian team for the second successive year, and also placed third in the AFL Coaches Association Champion Player of the Year Award. He also won his first Carji Greeves Medal, awarded for being the Geelong Football Club's best and fairest player during the 2010 season. Selwood finished the season ranked eighth in the league for total disposals (677), third for total handpasses (388)—also the 10th most in AFL history—second for total free kicks earned (53), and seventh for total inside 50s (110) Selwood highlighted his consistency by gathering over 20 disposals in 21 of 24 games—11 of which were games with 30 or more disposals—and compiling a six-game streak during which he gathered over 30 possessions from Round 13 to Round 18.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{straight}} {{after finishing}} Cold Feet, Bathurst went straight into filming My Dad's the Prime Minister, a series {{in which he}} portrays fictional British prime minister Michael Philips. The first series was broadcast in a Sunday afternoon CBBC slot in 2003. He watched debates in the House of Commons {{to prepare for the}} role but did not base his portrayal on Tony Blair. In 2003, he returned to theatre for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years to play Vershinin in The Three Sisters, opposite Kristin Scott Thomas and Eric Sykes. He had not seen The Three Sisters before starring in it. Director Michael Blakemore advised him to turn this to his advantage, as he would not feel he had to live up to previous portrayals. After its run concluded, a special edition of The Three Sisters was filmed with the same cast for television broadcast on BBC Four. In 2005, the second series of My Dad's the Prime Minister was broadcast, now moved to a Friday night time slot {{to take advantage of the}} adult humour. The same year, he starred in the ITV thriller The Stepfather playing Christopher Veazey, a man whose daughter goes missing. Bathurst was pleased that this white-collar worker had an emotional side, in comparison to David Marsden, whom he used as a yardstick when accepting those sorts of roles. Also in 2005, he played Mr Sesseman in an adaptation of Heidi and Dottore Massimo in The Thief Lord.|$|E
5|$|Neilson {{signed a}} three-year deal with League Two side Bradford City in August 2009, {{and was given}} {{a place on the}} substitutes' bench for the club's next game with Torquay United, which Bradford won 2–0 with Neilson coming on for Joe Colbeck. Colbeck was sold three days later and so Neilson made his full debut in a Football League Trophy game with Rochdale. Neilson capped his debut with the winning goal in a 2–1 victory to send City through to the second round for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years. At the end of his full first full month with the club, Neilson scored his first league goal in {{professional}} football during a 3–0 win against Chesterfield, which helped to extend Bradford's unbeaten run to seven games. The club's form did not last and following a run of poor results, manager Stuart McCall left in February 2010 to be replaced by Peter Taylor. Neilson played in Taylor's first game in charge as City lost 2–0 to Accrington Stanley.|$|E
