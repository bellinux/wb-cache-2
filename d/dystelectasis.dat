40|$|The aim of {{the study}} : to study general {{pathological}} processes in the lungs in different time after acute clozapine and combined clozapine+ethanol poisonings. Materials and methods. The experiments were performed on 25 outbreed male rats. The animals were divided into 5 groups: 1) reference (intact rats); 2) clozapine poisoning, 3 hours; 3) clozapine poisoning, 24 hours; 4) combined clozapine and ethanol poisoning, 3 hours; 5) combined clozapine and ethanol poisoning, 24 hours. Clozapine was administered orally at a dosage of 150 milligrams per kilogram of the animal weight under anesthesia (chlorolase); alcohol was administered with clozapine orally at a dosage of 5 milliliters per kilogram of the animal weight. Animals of all these groups sacrificed by decapitation. Lung tissue samples were examined by light microscopy using a microscope Nikon Eclipse E- 400 with a video system based on camera Watec 221 S (Japan) at a 400 X magnification. We evaluated {{the presence of the}} following signs: circulatory disturbances (hyperemia, hemorrhage), presence of atelectasis and <b>dystelectasis,</b> emphysema, cellular response (increased white blood cells count), desquamation of epithelium into the lumen of the bronchi, sludge. A morphometric analysis was performed using a grid developed by G. G. Avtandilov. The following signs were evaluated (volume percent, vol. %) : the area of the alveoli, intraalveolar septi, vessels, white blood cells, the percentage of white blood cells in the intraalveolar septi, the area of the edema and <b>dystelectasis.</b> Results. the following histologic signs were found 3 hours after clozapine poisoning: desquamation of epithelium into the lumen of the bronchi; cellular response (increased white blood cells count); presence of atelectasis and dystelectasis; thickening of intraaveolar septi due to edema; infiltration of intraalveolar septi by WBCs. Atelectasis and <b>dystelectasis</b> in pulmonary parenchyma and infiltration with WBC were observed 24 hours after clozapine poisoning. In the group of animals treated with ethanol and clozapine and decapitated 3 hours after the poisoning the following histological signs were detected: desquamation of epithelium into the lumen of the bronchi, the secret in the lumen of the bronchi, cellular response, atelectasis and <b>dystelectasis,</b> perivenular hemorrhages, hemorrhages into the alveoli, hemorrhages into intraalveolar septi, dilation of the lumen of the bronchi, the presence of sludge, thickening of intraalveolar septi (due to infiltration with WBCs, detachment of the endothelium in blood vessels. Arterial hyperemia, cellular response (increased of WBC count), atelectasis and <b>dystelectasis,</b> and thickening of intraalveolar septi were found 24 hours after combined ethanol and clozapine poisoning. In all study groups the lumen of the alveoli was significantly smaller as compared to the reference group, but the area of the intraalveolar tissue, on the contrary, was significantly greater. The total area of pulmonary microvessels did not differ significantly from the reference group 3 hours after clozapine poisoning. It became significantly higher 24 hours after the poisoning. A significant increase in this parameter vs. the reference group was found both 3 and 24 hours after the administration of the combination of clozapine with ethanol by animals. Conclusion. In clozapine and clozapine + ethanol poisoning, a certain complex of general pathological processes in lungs develops. There are alteration of bronchial epithelium and the vascular endothelium, circulatory disorder, increased vascular permeability, infiltration of intraaveolar septis. Morphological and immunoreactive changes can be used for valuation of severity of general pathological process in acute clozapine and clozapine + ethanol poisonings and determination of the exact time of the poisonings.  </p...|$|E
40|$|A 6 {{year old}} German girl, with {{no history of}} any chro-nic disease, fell ill with cough and otitis. Penicillin treat-ment was started. Because of fever, {{abdominal}} pain and worsening of the coughing during the next days, a chest X-ray was performed. It showed an extensive infiltra-tion of the right upper lobe. Under suspicion of pneu-monia, oral antibiotic treatment was extended to amoxycillin for 10 days. Meanwhile, fever had decreased. However, chest X-ray showed no improvement. The girl was referred to our department for further diagnostic proce-dures. Chest radiograph on admission (fig. 1) showed an infil-tration of the right upper lobe, in which a fluid contain-ing structure, with a round air bubble, attracted attention. In addition a <b>dystelectasis</b> of the middle lobe was noted...|$|E
40|$|Non-invasive end-points for interventional {{trials and}} {{tailored}} treatment regimes in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) for monitoring regionally different manifestations of lung disease instead of global assessment of lung function with spirometry would be valuable. Proton {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} imaging (1 H-MRI) allows for a radiation-free assessment of regional structure and function. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the short-term reproducibility of a comprehensive morpho-functional lung MRI protocol in COPD. 20 prospectively enrolled COPD patients (GOLD I-IV) underwent 1 H-MRI of the lung at 1. 5 T on two consecutive days, including sequences for morphology, 4 D contrast-enhanced perfusion, and respiratory mechanics. Image quality and COPD-related morphological and functional changes were evaluated in consensus by three chest radiologists using a dedicated MRI-based visual scoring system. Test-retest reliability was calculated per each individual lung lobe for the extent of large airway (bronchiectasis, wall thickening, mucus plugging) and small airway abnormalities (tree in bud, peripheral bronchiectasis, mucus plugging), consolidations, nodules, parenchymal defects and perfusion defects. The presence of tracheal narrowing, <b>dystelectasis,</b> pleural effusion, pulmonary trunk ectasia, right ventricular enlargement and, finally, motion patterns of diaphragma and chest wall were addressed. Median global scores [10 (Q 1 : 8. 00;Q 3 : 16. 00) vs. 11 (Q 1 : 6. 00;Q 3 : 15. 00) ] as well as category subscores were similar between both timepoints, and kappa statistics indicated "almost perfect" global agreement (ĸ = 0. 86, 95 %CI = 0. 81 - 0. 91). Most subscores showed at least "substantial" agreement of MRI 1 and MRI 2 (ĸ = 0. 64 - 1. 00), whereas the agreement for the diagnosis of dystelectasis/effusion (ĸ = 0. 42, 95 %CI = 0. 00 - 0. 93) was "moderate" and of tracheal abnormalities (ĸ = 0. 21, 95 %CI = 0. 00 - 0. 75) "fair". Most MRI acquisitions showed at least diagnostic quality at MRI 1 (276 of 278) and MRI 2 (259 of 264). Morpho-functional 1 H-MRI can be obtained with reproducible image quality and high short-term test-retest reliability for COPD-related morphological and functional changes of the lung. This underlines its potential value for the monitoring of regional lung characteristics in COPD trials...|$|E
