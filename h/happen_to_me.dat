500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what was going to <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for {{his version of}} [...] "Far East Man" [...] at Friar Park over August and September 1974, during {{sessions}} for his album Dark Horse. Having [...] "brushed up the lyrics a bit", {{as he puts it}} in I, Me, Mine, Harrison retained Newmark and Weeks from the sessions with Wood, and brought in keyboard player Billy Preston and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, both of whom would also be part of his all-American tour band. Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled to be asked to play on his record … It was the most exciting thing to <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I had to keep pinching myself to remember it was real." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{two months}} of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting. His fee was a {{guaranteed}} minimum of $10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes. He appeared {{with most of the}} leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities. Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary. At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat. Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, [...] "You know, this doesn't <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in Paris." [...] Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon. Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity. He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when they called him [...] "the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion".|$|E

500|$|In 1981, Love {{was granted}} a small trust fund {{that had been left}} by her adoptive grandparents, which she used to travel to Dublin, Ireland, where her {{biological}} father was living. While there, she enrolled in courses at Trinity College, studying theology for two semesters. She would later receive honorary patronage from Trinity's University Philosophical Society in 2010. In the United Kingdom, she became acquainted with musician Julian Cope and his band, The Teardrop Explodes, in Liverpool and briefly lived in his house. [...] "They kind of took me in", she recalled. [...] "I was sort of a mascot; I would get them coffee or tea during rehearsal." [...] In Cope's autobiography Head-On, Love is referred to as [...] "the adolescent." [...] After spending a year abroad, Love returned to Portland: [...] "I thought that [...] was my peak life experience," [...] she said in 2011. [...] "—that nothing else [...] <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again." [...] In 1983, she took short-lived jobs working as an erotic dancer in Japan and later Taiwan, but was deported after the club was shut down by the government.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{were always}} {{assisted}} by Evans on their American tours, {{and when they}} played two shows at the Hollywood Bowl {{in the summer of}} 1965 Epstein arranged for them all to have a four-day rest in a luxurious horseshoe-shaped house on stilts in Benedict Canyon off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. They spent their time there smoking cannabis joints. Evans and Lennon swam in the large outdoor swimming pool with cigarettes in their mouths, to see who could keep them alight the longest. After recording sessions in London, Lennon, Harrison, and Starr would be chauffeured back to their houses in the [...] "stockbroker belt" [...] of southern England, but Evans, Aspinall, and McCartney would drive to a late-night club to eat steak, chips, and mushy peas. The Bag O'Nails nightclub was one of their favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. In his memoirs Evans wrote: 19 January and 20: [...] "Ended up smashed in Bag O'Nails with Paul [...] and Neil [...] Quite a number of people attached themselves, oh that it would <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> freak out time baby for Mal." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} the acoustic album, Grohl {{decided that he}} would improve it with guest appearances, and made a list of musicians {{that he would like to}} work with, such as Warren Haynes and Grant Hart. The guests that appeared on the record included Norah Jones, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. John Paul Jones agreed to appear as he was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards, and Grohl described his appearance as the [...] "second-greatest thing to <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my life" [...] behind his marriage. Norah Jones was brought for the bossa nova [...] "Virginia Moon" [...] after Grohl heard her record and considered that his song was [...] "her vibe" [...] and Jones' voice [...] "was so smooth and warm that I figured it would work out great with mine." [...] The song features Grohl's guitar technician Joe Beebe on lead guitar as he was the only one in the crew with jazz experience. The Wallflowers' keyboard player Rami Jaffee and that dog.'s violinist Petra Haden also contributed to the album, and were later drafted for the Foo Fighters' touring band. After the album was finished, Grohl stated that he hoped that the Foo Fighters were most remembered for this record, describing it as [...] "just the most fucking kick-ass thing we've ever done", and saying that [...] "If someone asked me which Led Zeppelin album to buy, I would tell them Physical Graffiti, because it has such a wide dynamic and it shows the range that band had. And that's what we wanted to do with this album." ...|$|E

Through the black American oral tradition and drawing from the activist experiences of her generation, Mary Langston instilled in her grandson a lasting sense of racial pride.

2500|$|Theodora was {{followed}} by two failures. In 1885, in homage to Victor Hugo, who had died a few months earlier, she staged one of his older plays, Marion Delorme, written in 1831, but the play was outdated and her role did not {{give her a chance}} to show her talents. She next put on Hamlet, with her lover Philippe Garnier in the leading role and Bernhardt in the relatively minor role of Ophelia. The critics and audiences were not impressed, and the play was unsuccessful. Bernhardt had built up large expenses, which included a 10,000 francs a month allowance paid to her son Maurice, a passionate gambler. Bernhardt was forced to sell her chalet in Saint-Addresse and her mansion on rue Fortuny, and part of her collection of animals. Her impresario, Edouard Jarrett, immediately proposed she make another world tour, this time to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chili, Peru, Panama, Cuba, and Mexico, then on to Texas, New York, England, Ireland, and Scotland. She was on tour for 15 months, from early 1886 until late 1887. On the eve of departure, she told a French reporter: [...] "I passionately love this life of adventures. I detest knowing in advance {{what they are going to}} serve at my dinner, and I detest a hundred thousand times more knowing what will <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> for better or worse.

2500|$|Hilarie Burton portrays Peyton Sawyer, whose two {{greatest}} passions in {{life are}} music and art; she uses her art to express the issues that play out in her life. After Burton auditioned unsuccessfully for the part of Ed Harris's daughter in the film Radio, the casting department remembered her {{and asked her to}} audition for One Tree Hill. Schwahn said, [...] " [...] is an old soul. She's great. She's always just thrilled to do the job, even though she's kind of new to acting. She's just a joy to be around." [...] When talking about casting the role of Peyton, 'Mark Schwann (I)' said: [...] "They asked why I wanted Hilarie Burton, and my answer was, 'She has a lot of pain in her eyes. And I want that pain in Peyton's eyes'. We always laugh about it, because Hilarie is like, 'It's a good thing a lot of crummy things <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my life'." [...] Peyton's best friend is Brooke Davis, and she is close friends with Haley as well. In season 1, Peyton is a cheerleader and dates Nathan, the most popular basketball star in Tree Hill High. She becomes attracted to Lucas after meeting him and soon falls in love with him. Throughout the series, Peyton is met with one tragedy after another. She is deeply in love with Lucas, who always supports her, whether things are good or bad.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{hold that}} Ludwig {{was murdered by}} his enemies while {{attempting}} to escape from Berg. One account suggests that the king was shot. The King's personal fisherman, Jakob Lidl (1864–1933), stated, [...] "Three years after the king's death I was made {{to swear an oath}} that I would never say certain things — not to my wife, not on my deathbed, and not to any priest … The state has undertaken to look after my family if anything should <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in either peacetime or war." [...] Lidl kept his oath, at least orally, but left behind notes which were found after his death. According to Lidl, he had hidden behind bushes with his boat, waiting to meet the king, in order to row him out into the lake, where loyalists were waiting to help him escape. [...] "As the king stepped up to his boat and put one foot in it, a shot rang out from the bank, apparently killing him on the spot, for the king fell across the bow of the boat." [...] However, the autopsy report indicates no scars or wounds found on the body of the dead king; on the other hand, many years later Countess Josephine von Wrba-Kaunitz would show her afternoon tea guests a grey Loden coat with two bullet holes in the back, asserting it was the one Ludwig was wearing. Another theory suggests that Ludwig died of natural causes (such as a heart attack or stroke) brought on by the cool water (12°C) of the lake during an escape attempt.|$|E
