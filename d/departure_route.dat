40|$|There is a {{critical}} need for improved departure management during convective weather events in the highly congested airspace in the Northeast and upper Midwest. An early study (Allan, 2001) of the New York Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS) prototype suggested that small increases in New York airport departure rates during Severe Weather Avoidance Programs (SWAP) could result in significant delay reduction. More recently, the 2006 annual FAA System Review identified improved departure management in the New York area during SWAP as {{a critical}} need in the East and Midwest regions. Departure delays at New York airports can cascade across the entire National Airspace System (NAS), as surface gridlock and reduced gate availability necessitate a reduction of arrival traffic and increased airborne holding and ground delays.

Once airborne, the aircraft turned to the right on its <b>departure</b> <b>route.</b> Soon after the turn, at 6:27 pm, above the Gooimeer, a lake near Amsterdam, witnesses on the ground heard a sharp bang while the aircraft was climbing through 1950 meters (6500 feet).

The engine separated from the right wing of the aircraft, shot forward, damaged the wing flaps, then fell back and struck engine number four, tearing it from the wing. The two engines fell away from the aircraft, also ripping out a 9-meter (30-foot) stretch of the wing's leading edge. The loud noise attracted the attention of some pleasure boaters on Gooimeer.

Military readiness would improve as {{a result of}} increased training opportunities due to reduced transit time to the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) and additional <b>departure</b> <b>route</b> flexibility. The efficiency of air traffic management would improve {{as a result of}} increased separation between military and commercial aircraft.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to allow to {{increase}} the number of aircraft and airport operations while mitigating their negative impacts (e. g., noise and pollutant emission) on near-airport communities, the optimal design of new departure routes with less noise and fuel consumption becomes more important. In this paper, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), which recently emerged as a potential method for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), is developed for this kind of problem. First, to minimize aircraft noise for departure routes while taking into account the interests of various stakeholders, bi-objective optimization problems involving noise and fuel consumption are formulated where both the ground track and vertical profile of a <b>departure</b> <b>route</b> are optimized simultaneously. Second, in order to make the design space of vertical profiles feasible during the optimization process, a trajectory parameterization technique recently proposed is employed. Furthermore, some modifications to MOEA/D that are aimed at significantly reducing the computational cost are also introduced. Two different examples of departure routes at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands are shown to demonstrate the applicability and reliability of the proposed method. The simulation results reveal that the proposed method is an effective and efficient approach for solving this kind of problem. Aerospace Transport & Operation...|$|E

40|$|In the European {{research}} project, CREDOS (Crosswind-Reduced Separations for Departure Operations), {{the feasibility}} of a concept for reduced wake turbulence separations upon departure in crosswind conditions has been investigated. The safety assessment of this concept includes risk assessment with respect to wake vortex encounters. This paper describes the methodology developed for this assessment and its application during the project. The methodology employs two simulation tools, the Wake Vortex Scenarios Simulation Package for Departure (WakeScene-D) and the Vortex Encounter Severity Assessment for Departure (VESA-D), which are extensions of existing tools related to the departure flight phase. WakeScene-D primarily determines the frequency of wake encounters, whereas VESA-D estimates the severity of these encounters. Both can be combined to quantify and compare wake encounter risk for various departure scenarios. In the risk assessment, departures with variable aircraft separations and varying crosswind conditions were investigated to determine which crosswind level is necessary to suspend wake-turbulence-related separations during departure without degrading safety. Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted comparing medium and heavy aircraft type departures with 2 min. of separation to departures with a separation of 1 min. under varying crosswind strengths. The results not only give an indication of which crosswind magnitudes could be sufficient to safely suspend wake-turbulence-related separations upon takeoff, but they also reveal significant influences, such as the <b>departure</b> <b>route</b> layout and the change of wind direction with altitude, on wake encounter risk...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the challenge of}} building an automated decision support methodology to tackle the complex problem faced every day by runway controllers at London Heathrow Airport. Aircraft taxi from stands to holding areas {{at the end of}} the current take-off runway where they wait in queues for permission to take off. A runway controller attempts to find the best order for aircraft to take off. Sequence-dependent separation rules that depend upon aircraft size, <b>departure</b> <b>route</b> and speed group ensure that this is not a simple problem to solve. Take-off time slots on some aircraft and the need to avoid excessive delay for any aircraft make this an even more complicated problem. Making this decision at the holding area helps to avoid the problems of unpredictable push-back and taxi times, but introduces a number of complex spatial constraints that would not otherwise exist. The holding area allows some flexibility for interchange of aircraft between queues, but this is limited by the physical layout of the current holding area. These physical constraints are not usually included in academic models of the departure problem However, any decision support system for the takeoff runway controller must include them. We show, in this paper, that a decision support system could help the controllers to significantly improve the departure sequence at busy times of the day, by considering the taxiing aircraft in addition to those already at the holding area.

40|$|Air traffic {{systems have}} long relied on {{automated}} short-term conflict prediction algorithms to warn controllers of impending conflicts (losses of separation). The complexity of terminal airspace has proven difficult for such systems as it {{often leads to}} excessive false alerts. Thus, the legacy system, called Conflict Alert, which provides short-term alerts in both en-route and terminal airspace currently, is often inhibited or degraded in areas where frequent false alerts occur, even though the alerts are provided only when an aircraft is in dangerous proximity of other aircraft. This research investigates how a minimal level of flight intent information {{may be used to}} improve short-term conflict detection in terminal airspace such that it can be used by the controller to maintain legal aircraft separation. The flight intent information includes a site-specific nominal arrival route and inferred altitude clearances in addition to the flight plan that includes the RNAV (Area Navigation) <b>departure</b> <b>route.</b> A new tactical conflict detection algorithm is proposed, which uses a single analytic trajectory, determined by the flight intent and the current state information of the aircraft, and includes a complex set of current, dynamic separation standards for terminal airspace to define losses of separation.

The new algorithm yielded a false-alert rate of two per hour and an average alert lead time of 38 seconds. I...|$|E

40|$|In {{attempts}} to reduce population exposure to aircraft noise near large airports, current approach and <b>departure</b> <b>routes</b> {{have been developed}} based upon population analyses and static meteorological climatologies as implemented for example in the FAA Integrated Noise Model (INM). However, commercial aircraft have noise “footprints ” that are determined {{not only by the}} operational configuration of the aircraft but also by the highly variable atmospheric environment through which the sound is propagating. The existing approach and <b>departure</b> <b>routes</b> do not reflect these dynamically changing patterns of noise dispersion and propagation.

Both idealized meteorological profiles and actual profiles from soundings are used in the evaluation. For the cases examined, the acoustic footprint is usually smaller than that predicted by the INM, but can also be substantially larger in particular directions around the aircraft due to sound channeling by low level wind shears. With the combined use of a sound model and meteorological measurements and/or forecasts {{it may be possible to}} develop runway use strategies to minimize population exposure to aircraft noise while reducing the adverse effects of noise abatement procedures on airport operations...|$|R

This work was performed to build {{a deeper understanding of}} NY airspace and operations to determine the improvements possible through operational changes with tools currently available, and where new technology is required for additional improvement. The analysis was conducted using tool-based mathematical analyses, video inspection and evaluation using recorded arrival/departure/surface traffic captured by the Aerobahn tool (used by Kennedy Airport for surface metering), and aural data archives available publically through the web to inform the video segments. A discussion of impacts of trajectory and operational choices on capacity is presented, including runway configuration and usage (parallel, converging, crossing, shared, independent, staggered), arrival and <b>departure</b> <b>route</b> characteristics (fix sharing, merges, splits), and how compression of traffic is staged. The authorization in March of 2015 for New York to use reduced spacing under the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wake Turbulence Recategorization (RECAT) also offers significant capacity benefit for New York airports when fully transitioned to the new spacing requirements, and the impact of these changes for New York is discussed. Arrival and departure capacity results are presented for each of the current day Kennedy Airport configurations. While the tools allow many variations of user-selected conditions, the analysis for these studies used arrival-priority, no-winds, additional safety buffer of 5 % to the required minimum spacing, and a mix of traffic typical for Kennedy.

40|$|Frequent {{occurrences of}} hurricanes {{in the coastal}} areas of the United States in recent times have {{indicated}} the necessity of comprehensive evacuation planning. Failure to ensure efficient and timely evacuation causes devastating impacts including loss of lives and property damages.

Households 2 ̆ 7 decisions to evacuate/stay, time of <b>departure,</b> <b>route</b> choice and destination choice are four fundamental behavioral issues in the evacuation process. In this thesis, we develop a joint modeling approach for both household-level evacuation decision and departure time. Unlike many other previous works, the major contribution of the work is the inclusion of dynamic variables, such as strength or category of hurricane, direction of hurricane, height of coastal flooding etc [...] A random parameter binary logit model of the evacuate/stay decision at discrete time intervals has been developed considering not only several static factors, such as, socio-economic characteristics, mandatory/voluntary notice to evacuate, but also the dynamic nature of the hurricane itself. Data from a post storm assessment survey of Hurricane Ivan has been used to obtain the static variables in this study and dynamic variables have been collected from the published advisories of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website. These two datasets have been merged to produce an unbalanced panel data for analysis. The model results indicate that: (1) the rate of evacuating households increases as landfall approaches, (2) maximum number of households evacuate on the last day before landfall and (3) households prefer to evacuate in the morning and afternoon periods than night and late nights. Furthermore, the results show that receiving a mandatory notice or even a voluntary notice increases the probability to evacuate rather than receiving no notice. Moreover, the number of vehicles, number of children, post graduate degree, mobile house, and ownership of house are some other statistically significant variables. Using the insights of our model, the emergency officials can implement policy level decisions like imposing contra flow to ensure efficient evacuation. In addition, this model has been implemented in an agent based simulator (Repast Simphony) to obtain dynamic demand, which will eventually lead {{to a better understanding of}} the network clearance time. ...|$|E
