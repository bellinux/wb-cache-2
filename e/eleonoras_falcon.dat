40|$|Among birds, falcons are {{high-performance}} flyers, in {{many cases}} adapted for aerial hunting and hence suitable targets for investigating limits to flight performance. Using an optical range finder, we measured flight tracks of <b>Eleonoras</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco eleonorae), a species breeding in the Mediterranean region and specialised for hunting autumn passage bird migrants, when commuting between their nesting colony and offshore hunting areas (straight transportation flight) and when searching for prey (transecting and searching flight). Airspeed during searching flight was significantly slower than during straight transportation and transecting flight, {{but there was no}} significant difference in airspeed between the latter two flight modes. Straight transportation flight was significantly faster than predicted minimum power speed. Also, during straight transportation flight, the falcons responded to head- and tailwinds by increasing their airspeed when flying into the wind. However, they did not show any significant airspeed adjustments with respect to the angle between the track and the heading, as would be expected in birds trying to maintain a constant track direction. Mean sustainable climb rate (during (greater than or equal to) 240 s) was 1. 4 +/- 0. 31 m s- 1 (mean +/- s. d., N= 13), which is rather a high rate for a bird the size of an <b>Eleonoras</b> <b>falcon.</b> The climb rate was used to calculate maximum load-carrying capacity and maximum sustained horizontal flapping flight speed. The mean wingbeat frequency during powered climbing flight was 4. 68 Hz, which was used to estimate the mass-specific muscle work. When falcons were leaving the colony for offshore hunting, they gained altitude by slope-soaring when there was an onshore wind. We formulated a simple criterion for the required gliding-flight rate of climb during an initial slope-soaring episode when minimizing the energy cost of reaching a certain altitude far out over the sea (which is where the prey is to be found). This climb rate was 0. 36 m s- 1, and our observations indicated that the falcons experienced climb rates above this value when soaring in slope-lift...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} nocturnal hunting by <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcons</b> in their {{breeding}} {{range in the}} Mediterranean region and in their non-breeding range in Madagascar. Hunting activity of <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcons</b> near floodlights during the breeding season in western Morocco peaked 30 - 60 min after sunset, but continued into the early morning. Hunting activity and prey capture rates near floodlights were highest during nights with little moonlight or overcast conditions. Fifty-one percent of 73 group capture attempts were successful. Of the migratory prey species identified at the Moroccan study site (26 species), 73 % belonged to species mainly migrating at night, whereas 57 % of all migratory bird prey species of <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcon</b> reported to date (122 species) migrate predominantly at night; suggesting that hunting near artificial light may increase the proportion of nocturnal migrant species in the diet of falcons. Sylvia and Acrocephalus were the most commonly recorded genera among prey caught after dark. Our direct observations and analysis of satellite transmitter data indicated that <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcons</b> also hunted away from artificial light in Morocco, Italy, and frequently so in Madagascar. Flight activity was detected in 18 % of 342 night-time locations of seven satellitetagged <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcons</b> in Madagascar, at an average moon illumination of 60 %. We conclude that nocturnal hunting by <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcons</b> is more common than previously assumed and occurs preferably, but not exclusively, at above-average moon illumination on wintering grounds or near artificial lights during the breeding period...|$|R

40|$|Capsule]: <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcons</b> {{wintering}} in Madagascar selected degraded humid {{forests and}} cultivated areas close to pristine humid forest. [Aims]: To identify the habitat preferences of <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcon</b> Falco <b>eleonorae</b> on their wintering grounds in Madagascar, {{and to use}} this information to gain insights into the conservation priorities of this species. [Methods]: A total of 11 <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcons</b> were captured in Spain in 2007 and 2008 and equipped with solar-powered satellite transmitters. We obtained information on five complete wintering events for three birds, two of them tracked for two consecutive years. Data were analyzed using geographic information system-based cartography. [Results]: The analyses showed a preference for degraded humid forests and cultivated lands within areas where pristine humid forests were the most abundant habitat type. [Conclusions]: <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcons</b> could be taking advantage from a spill-over edge effect of their insect prey into cultivated and more open areas close to humid forests. However, the importance of humid forests for <b>Eleonora's</b> <b>Falcons</b> seems to be high. The current loss of this habitat in Madagascar is {{a cause for concern}} with respect to the conservation of this long-distance migratory falcon species.

40|$|The {{migration}} route of <b>Eleonora’s</b> <b>Falcon</b> Falco <b>eleonorae</b> {{has largely been}} a mystery.

40|$|Conservation of {{migratory species}} faces the {{challenge}} of understanding the ecological requirements of individuals living in two geographically separated regions. In some cases, {{the entire population of}} widely distributed species congregates at relatively small wintering areas and hence, these areas become a priority for the species’ conservation. Satellite telemetry allows fine tracking of animal movements and distribution in those less known, often remote areas. Through integrating satellite and GPS data from five separated populations comprising most of the breeding range, we created a wide habitat suitability model for the <b>Eleonora’s</b> <b>falcon</b> on its wintering grounds in Madagascar. On this basis, we further investigated, for the first time, the impact of climate change on the future suitability of the species’ wintering areas. <b>Eleonora’s</b> <b>falcons</b> are mainly distributed in the north and along the east of Madagascar, exhibiting strong site fidelity over years.

40|$|Background: The {{adaptive}} {{transition between}} behavioral strategies, {{such as the}} shift from migratoriness to sedentariness, remains an outstanding question in evolutionary ecology.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in bird tracking technologies are revealing that migratory birds use temporal staging sites other than breeding and wintering areas, and these areas deserve conservation efforts. <b>Eleonora’s</b> <b>Falcon</b> Falco <b>eleonorae</b> is a long-distance migratory raptor that breeds colonially on islands {{and is considered}} a priority species for conservation. Anecdotal observations indicate that during the pre-breeding period, <b>Eleonora’s</b> <b>Falcons</b> stay in inland areas {{far away from the}} colonies, but, to date there are no detailed data concerning the connectivity between these areas and breeding colonies. Using satellite telemetry, we analysed data from four summering events belonging to three individuals breeding in two colonies in the Western Mediterranean (Spain). All of them made inland movements in areas up to c. 400 km distant from the respective breeding colonies, visiting several habitats, from forests to arable lands, probably taking advantage of high densities of insects. Perturbations occurring in these areas could threaten <b>Eleonora’s</b> <b>Falcons</b> with serious consequences at the population level. We suggest that conservation measures implemented at breeding and wintering grounds may not suffice and that temporary staging areas should be identified at a larger scale and deserve protection as well.

The male falcon does the majority of hunting and usually sets off from the colony to hunting areas located at high altitude over the open sea to catch prey. To {{lower the cost of}} transport and maximize the energy gain from hunting, we show that the birds use vertical winds for soaring when available. The occurrence of rising air changes with wind direction. At north-northwesterly winds (on-shore), slope lift is available outside the nesting cliffs, and at south-southeasterly winds thermals that form over the island drift out over the sea.

40|$|In recent years, {{satellite}} tracking has enabled {{to get new}} important insights into several aspects of bird’s migration, {{one of the most}} unknown aspects of birds’ ecology. In the last years, we have studied the migration and wintering of satellite tracked <b>Eleonora’s</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco <b>eleonorae</b> Gené, 1839) tagged during the breeding season at Balearic and Columbretes Islands. In autumn, <b>Eleonora’s</b> <b>falcons</b> migrated following inland routes along Africa. Birds arrived into Africa flying over the Mediterranean Sea directly from the breeding colonies, and then crossed the Sahara Desert, the Sahel region, south-eastern African savannahs and the Channel of Mozambique to arrive into their wintering grounds in Madagascar. During winter, falcons used areas of pristine humid forests close to degraded forests and cultivations, where they can fulfil food requirements for this period. In spring, falcons travelled larger over-sea distances between Madagascar and continental Africa than in autumn. We observed inter-annual variations in the routes used in this season to cross to inland Africa, which were related to meteorological conditions at the time of leaving Madagascar. These results are very important to propose global conservation actions for the species, highlighting that these actions should embrace the whole lifecycle of the species...|$|R
