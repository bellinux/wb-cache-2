500|$|Returning to Australia, Lerew held various base {{commands}} including RAAF Station Townsville, RAAF Station Nowra in New South Wales, and Batchelor Airfield near Darwin, Northern Territory. He led No.7 Squadron, operating Bristol Beauforts out {{of first}} Nowra and then Townsville, from August to December 1942. He {{then returned to}} RAAF Station Laverton {{to take charge of}} No.1 Aircraft Depot (No.1 AD). Lerew's biographer, Lex McAulay, speculated of this quick succession of postings across the country: [...] "...it is easy to assume that this Wing Commander whose critical reports were seen by the War Cabinet, and who had twice escaped the enemy at close quarters, was not to be allowed personal contact with the media of the day until his experiences were no longer topical and were overtaken by more recent momentous events". Though degree-qualified in civil engineering, Lerew believed he was underused in the technical environment of No.1 AD, and sought another overseas posting. Nevertheless, his tenure at Laverton helped prepare him for his later flying safety work. In September 1943, he investigated the crash of a Vultee Vengeance flown by an experienced aviator, and found that when rolling the aircraft to the right it was possible for the pilot's movements to release his safety <b>harness,</b> <b>making</b> it impossible for him to remain in his seat and control the aircraft. Lerew designed and developed a clip to prevent a recurrence of this mishap, which was later adopted worldwide for all such harnesses.|$|E

50|$|Different {{types of}} {{climbing}} warrant particular features for harnesses. Sport climbers typically use minimalistic harnesses, some with sewn-on gear loops. Alpine climbers often choose lightweight harnesses, perhaps with detachable leg loops. Big Wall climbers generally prefer padded waist belts and leg loops. There are also full body harnesses for children, whose pelvises {{may be too}} narrow to support a standard harness safely. These harnesses prevent children from falling even when inverted, and are either manufactured for children or constructed out of webbing. Some climbers use full body harnesses {{when there is a}} chance of inverting, or when carrying a heavy bag. There are also chest harnesses, which are used only in combination with a sit harness; this combination provides the same advantages as a full body harness. However, test results from UIAA show that chest harnesses can put more impact on the neck than sit <b>harnesses,</b> <b>making</b> them slightly more dangerous to use.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} means {{of holding the}} dildo to the harness {{is to have an}} opening or ring in the harness through which a wide-based dildo is inserted. Inexpensive {{harnesses}} tend to just have a round hole in the fabric or leather, while more expensive ones will use a steel or rubber ring. The advantage of this method is that dildos which fit are widely available and inexpensive, and even many dildos not meant for harness use will work in one of these harnesses, such as most dildos with testicles. The major disadvantage is the dildo is often held loosely (especially on cheap harnesses) and tends to flop downwards, and the dildo often can rotate in the <b>harness,</b> <b>making</b> it difficult or impossible to use g-spot or other shaped dildos.|$|E
40|$|The current {{unprecedented}} rate of digitization of longitudinal health data — continuous device monitoring data, laboratory measurements, medication orders, treatment reports, {{reports of}} physician assessments — allows visibility into patient health at increasing levels of detail. A clearer lens into this data could help improve decision making both for individual physicians {{on the front}} lines of care, and for policy makers setting national direction. However, this type of data is high-dimensional (an infant with no prior clinical history can have more than 1000 different measurements in the ICU), highly unstructured (the measurements occur irregularly, and different numbers and types of measurements are taken for different patients) and heterogeneous (from ultrasound assessments to lab tests to continuous monitor data). Furthermore, the data is often sparse, systematically not present, and the underlying system is non-stationary. Extracting the full value of the existing data requires novel approaches. In this thesis, we develop novel methods to show how longitudinal health data contained in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can be <b>harnessed</b> for <b>making</b> novel clinical discoveries.

50|$|The Stop is for {{use with}} single ropes between 9 and 12 mm in {{diameter}} and is usually attached to the harness via a carabiner.

As the Stop is a self-braking descender, an unintentional release of the deadman's handle should stop the descent, due to the asymmetric lower cam crimping the rope. This functionality safeguards the user in the event of being knocked unconscious due to a rockfall or illness, though the fine control of rate of descent should be carried out by standard method of manually controlling friction with the hand on the rope below the descender.|$|E

40|$|An {{essential}} {{challenge of}} the regulatory state is that industry exerts influence that pulls policy in its direction. Observers have long pointed to “captured” regulation that harms the public interest and called for limiting industry influence. The underlying ideal in these calls is uninfluenced regulation that mirrors the public’s perspective. However, this aspiration neglects the public’s benefit from the information that an industry generates as it influences regulation, {{as well as the}} incentive that an industry’s benefit from influencing regulation provides it to incur the costs of producing such information. Thus, the standard strategy of insulating regulation against influence creates a tradeoff between closer conformity to the public’s perspective and better information. This Article introduces the general strategy of harnessing industry influence as an alternative to insulation that alleviates this tradeoff. <b>Harnessing</b> entails <b>making</b> regulation preliminarily biased against industry, with the aim of ultimately unbiased policy as industry influences policy to cancel out the initial bias. With this class of techniques, industry influence is used both to pull regulation in the public’s direction and to stimulate information production. Case studies involving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and hazardous waste legislation support the underlying logic of harnessing: moving the initial position of regulation away from industry in these cases yielded more industry information and final policy further from industry’s preferences. Further analysis of two specific remedies based on these examples—anti-industry executive appointments and statutory penalty default provisions—suggests that harnessing is workable and politically feasible. The value of harnessing warrants not only reorienting research toward solutions in this category, but also separating industry influence and social harm in the analysis of the problem, rather than conflating them in the concept of “capture. ...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2016. Anaerobic {{bacterial}} biosynthesis of toluene from phenylacetate was reported {{more than two}} decades ago, but the biochemistry underlying this novel metabolism has never been elucidated. Here we report results of in vitro characterization studies of a novel phenylacetate decarboxylase from an anaerobic, sewage-derived enrichment culture that quantitatively produces toluene from phenylacetate; complementary metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses are also presented. Among the noteworthy findings is that this enzyme is not the well-characterized clostridial p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase (CsdBC). However, the toluene synthase under study appears to be able to catalyze both phenylacetate and p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylation. Observations suggesting that phenylacetate and p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylation in complex cell-free extracts were catalyzed by the same enzyme include the following: (i) the specific activity for both substrates was comparable in cell-free extracts, (ii) the two activities displayed identical behavior during chromatographic separation of cell-free extract s, (iii) both activities were irreversibly inactivated upon exposure to O 2, and (iv) both activities were similarly inhibited by an amide analog of p-hydroxyphenylacetate. Based upon these and other data, we hypothesize that the toluene synthase reaction involves a glycyl radical decarboxylase. This first-time study of the phenylacetate decarboxylase reaction constitutes an important step in understanding and ultimately <b>harnessing</b> it for <b>making</b> bio-based toluene...|$|R
