5|$|An Atlantic {{hurricane}} or {{tropical storm}} is a tropical cyclone that forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> {{usually in the}} summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only {{on the basis of}} location. A hurricane is a storm that occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 33 {{recorded}} tropical cyclones have reached Category5 strength on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{north of the}} equator, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes of such intensity occur once every three years in this region on average.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> the {{greatest}} concentration of loggerheads is along the southeastern coast of North America {{and in the}} Gulf of Mexico. Very few loggerheads are found along the European and African coastlines. Florida {{is the most popular}} nesting site, with more than 67,000 nests built per year. Nesting extends as far north as Virginia, as far south as Brazil, and as far east as the Cape Verde Islands. The Cape Verde Islands are the only significant nesting site on {{the eastern side of the}} Atlantic. Loggerheads found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> feed from Canada to Brazil.|$|E

5|$|From April–August 1984, Iowa {{underwent}} {{refresher training}} and naval gunfire support qualifications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> She {{spent the rest}} of 1984 on a shakedown cruise in the area around Central America. During this cruise she aided in several humanitarian operations, including in Costa Rica and Honduras, before returning to the United States in April 1985 for a period of routine maintenance.|$|E

50|$|Synoicum pulmonaria, {{the tennis}} ball ascidian or sea-fig, is {{a species of}} colonial sea squirt, a {{tunicate}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Polyclinidae.

5|$|Pigeons and doves are {{distributed}} everywhere on Earth, {{except for the}} driest areas of the Sahara Desert, Antarctica and its surrounding islands, and the high Arctic. They have colonised most of the world's oceanic islands, reaching eastern Polynesia and the Chatham Islands in the Pacific, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Réunion in the Indian Ocean, and the Azores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1980 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was tied with}} 1932, 1969, and 1994 for most named storms in Atlantic Ocean {{during the month of}} November– only to be surpassed in 2001 and 2005. The season officially began on June1, 1980, and lasted until November30, 1980. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b>|$|E
5|$|The M-class cruisers were a {{class of}} light cruisers planned, but never built, by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine before World War II. The ships were {{designed}} for commerce raiding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The design {{for the first four}} ships suffered from a number of problems, and so the fifth and sixth ships were substantially redesigned.|$|E

5|$|USS Iowa (BB-61) is {{the lead}} ship of her class of {{battleship}} and the fourth in the United States Navy to be named after the state of Iowa.

5|$|Wisconsin {{spent the}} first part of 1989 {{conducting}} training exercises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and off the coast of Puerto Rico before returning to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a post recommissioning shakedown that lasted the rest of the year. In mid-1990 the battleship participated in a fleet exercise.|$|E
5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone originating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{that affects the}} state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E

5|$|After the {{beginning}} of World War I in August, the ship captured a German merchantman the following month. Essex {{spent most of the}} first half of the war <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> escorting convoys and searching for German commerce raiders. The ship captured another German merchantman in mid-1916 and was reduced to second-line roles such as depot ship and accommodation ship a few months later. She was paid off in 1919 and sold for scrap two years later.|$|E
5|$|Although {{shocked by}} Lily's betrayal, Denham decides to have Kilo and Merit keep Lily under {{surveillance}} {{because she is}} too valuable to eliminate. As they observe her in her apartment, Lily has an argument with a person named Kris before she is suddenly kidnapped by the syndicate Cayman-Global. Kilo fights off the Cayman-Global forces and follows Lily's abductors to their floating base <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Kilo kills a major Cayman-Global agent and rescues Lily, and they learn the syndicate is preparing a war against Eurocorp.|$|E
5|$|Blakeley {{spent most}} of the rest of the war on convoy escort duty in the Caribbean Sea Frontier, except for two short {{deployments}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> On 1 January to 23 February 1943 she was assigned to hunter-killer duty with Task Group 21.13 in the North Atlantic, and from 24 March to 11 May 1943, she escorted a convoy to Bizerte, Tunisia. From 18 March to 13 June 1945, she was stationed in New London, Connecticut, training U.S. submarines in Long Island Sound to avoid destroyers.|$|E

5|$|Cabo Blanco, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> is {{the largest}} {{surviving}} single population of the species, and the only remaining site that still seems to preserve a colony structure. In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds of its population) within two months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided, the most likely cause is a morbilivirus or a toxic algae bloom.|$|E
5|$|Corals {{that grow}} on reefs are called hermatypic, with those growing {{elsewhere}} {{are known as}} ahermatypic. Most of the latter are azooxanthellate and live in both shallow and deep sea habitats. In the deep sea they share the ecosystem with soft corals, polychaete worms, other worms, crustaceans, molluscs and sponges. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa forms extensive deep-water reefs which support many other species.|$|E
5|$|Humpback whales were hunted {{as early}} as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century {{introduction}} of the explosive harpoon allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the Antarctic Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.|$|E
50|$|Cownose rays appear {{naturally}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Within <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> <b>the</b> cownose ray {{can often}} be found in Mauritania, Senegal, and Guinea. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> they are located from Southern New England to Northern Florida <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, as well as throughout the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad, Venezuela, and Brazil.|$|R
