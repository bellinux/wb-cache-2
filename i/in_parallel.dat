40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{two possible}} ways of intensifying the electrocoagulation treatment of water contg. phosphate. The first one consists {{of controlling the}} chem. compn. of the water by continuous adjustment of the pH. The second aspect focuses on electrode connection modes, and the four different modes were tested monopolar <b>in</b> series, <b>in</b> <b>parallels</b> and independents, and finally bipolar. Expts. were conducted in a small batch reactor contg. water with 100 mg P​/L using electrodes of aluminum. Several elec. connections {{were used for the}} water treatment under favorable operating conditions detd. by a study and presented in a previous paper. The influence of pH adjustment was conducted using different adjustment step times (no adjustment, every 30, 10 and 5 min) ​. The kinetics of the treatment was found to be accelerated by continuous adjustment of the pH. The choice of the electrode connection modes was found to strongly affect the efficiency of the treatment, the Faradic yield, and the consumption of energy. The monopolar <b>in</b> <b>parallels</b> connection mode was found to be the most economic, whereas bipolar <b>in</b> <b>parallels</b> was found to favor a higher kinetic rate of treatment...|$|R
