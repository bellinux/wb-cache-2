Peter Berg was the next director to consider, but he too, eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons. A year later {{it was confirmed that}} Phillip Noyce would direct. Noyce was attracted to Salt for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography, as well as the tension of a character who tries to prove his innocence yet also <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was previously accused of.|$|E

Colonel Mayer disowns his son but later launches a more devious plot to kill Luke and {{get him out of}} Noah's life - a plot that is thwarted by Noah and Luke's parents. Noah and Luke come closer than ever as Luke uses physical therapy to recover the use of his legs, paralyzed in the Colonel's attempted murder.|$|E

After Amelia finally chooses Becky's friendship over his during their stay in Germany, Dobbin leaves in disgust. He returns when Amelia writes to him and admits her feelings for him, marries her (despite having lost much of his passion for her), and has a daughter whom he loves deeply.|$|E

25|$|Introduced {{in chapter}} six, {{he prefers to}} be called Joseph, and is known also as the Wandering Jew, or the “Magician of the Flow”, he is a mysterious being {{that looks like a}} young boy, but is much older. A long time ago, people said that “God’s Son” cast an immortal curse on him. Holding no clear intention, he’s just a monster that simply <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> feels like. He seems to travel around the world experimenting with the living and dead {{for the sake of his}} experiments, {{although}} he has apparently forgotten why he experiments. He has the appearance of a human but the body of a non-human – as seen in chapter eleven when he was struck with a magic bullet. He dislikes his “Cartaphilius” name.|$|E

500|$|In January 2005, Ferguson and Wenger were {{embroiled in}} a new row over what had {{happened}} in the tunnel after Pizzagate. Ferguson alleged that Wenger called his players [...] "cheats" [...] and never apologised for his team's behaviour: [...] "It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person." [...] Wenger then claimed Ferguson was guilty of bringing the game into disrepute; he told reporters that he [...] "will never answer any questions any more about this man," [...] but went further to question the motive of the press: [...] "What I don't understand is that he <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants and you are all at his feet." [...] Both managers came under pressure from the Metropolitan Police Service, then Sports Minister Richard Caborn and Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore {{to put an end to}} the bickering. Ferguson and Wenger agreed to tone down their words, in an attempt to defuse the rivalry. In later years, Ferguson said Arsenal's defeat [...] "scrambled Arsène’s brain" [...] and caused their relationship to breakdown for almost five years.|$|E

500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> needs to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Burr had a {{reputation}} in Hollywood as a thoughtful, generous man years before much of his more-visible philanthropic work. In 1960, Ray Collins, who portrayed Lt. Arthur Tragg on the original Perry Mason series, and who was by that time often ill and unable to remember all the lines {{he was supposed to}} speak, stated, [...] "There is nothing but kindness from our star, Ray Burr. Part of his life is dedicated to us, and that's no bull. If there's anything the matter with any of us, he comes around before anyone else and <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can to help.

When his oldest son, Gabriel joins up, and his second born son, Thomas is killed, he takes it upon himself to join and fight with the colonial militia.

2500|$|Akhtar {{has played}} for three English county cricket clubs: Somerset in 2001, Durham in 2003 and 2004 and Worcestershire in 2005. He did achieve his moments of success, such as taking 5 wickets for 35 runs for Durham against Somerset in the National League in 2003 and {{claiming}} 6 wickets for 16 {{runs in the}} same competition for Worcestershire against Glamorgan two years later, but he suffered from fitness problems, {{as well as a}} perception that he was less than interested in his task. This was particularly the case at Worcestershire: chairman John Elliott said [...] "Players like that are no good to our club. In fact, Akhtar has been no good for any club he's been at. He's a superstar and just <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{increased}} attention {{for the film}} has also led to some news outlets to reconsider the mixed original reception of the film; Joe Queenan of The Guardian argued that [...] "No, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not breathtakingly self-indulgent and just plain awful; it is actually jaw-droppingly great. Those of you who do not share this opinion are idiots." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club argued in his more recent review of the film that [...] "the film {{would have had a}} greater impact had it been produced at the time, when Brewster McCloud proved that anything was possible, but short of a time machine, Gilliam <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can to bring the era back to life.".|$|E

2500|$|Barrett L. McCormick of Marquette University {{reviewed}} {{the work for}} the Pacific Affairs journal. Believing it less of a [...] "reinterpretation" [...] than a revival of an interpretation common during the 1970s, he remarked that Feigon <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can to shift the blame from Mao for human rights abuses wherever possible. Stating {{that he did not}} [...] "systematically discuss environmental damage, famine in Tibet, [...] the fate of intellectuals", he summed up his review by commenting that contrary to Feigon's opinions, he found Mao no more attractive than Stalin. The American Historical Review published a review authored by Gregor Benton of the University of Wales. He argued that Feigon's presentation of Mao and Stalin's relationship was [...] "true in broad design" [...] but failed to take into account those examples where Mao ignored Moscow's commands. Critical that Feigon did not specify how he was defining [...] "Stalinism", Benton commented that Mao's regime could be seen as Stalinist in most definitions of the term. Opining that the book was bound to court controversy, he thought that had set an [...] "agenda for debate" [...] and would appear on student reading list in future years.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} 20 {{years of his}} {{photography}} Weston determined all of his exposure settings by estimation based on his previous experiences and the relatively narrow tolerances of the film at that time. He said, [...] "I dislike to figure out time, and find my exposures more accurate when only [...] "felt"." [...] In the late 1930s he acquired a Weston exposure meter and continued {{to use it as}} an aid to determine exposures throughout his career. Photo historian Nancy Newhall wrote that [...] "Young photographers are confused and amazed when they behold him measuring with his meter every value in the sphere where he intends to work, from the sky to the ground under his feet. He is [...] "feeling the light" [...] and checking his own observations. After which he puts the meter away and <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks. Often he adds up everything ‒ filters, extension, film, speed, and so on ‒ and doubles the computation." [...] Weston, Newhall noted, believed in [...] "massive exposure", which he then compensated for by hand-processing the film in a weak developer solution and individually inspecting each negative as it continued to develop to get the right balance of highlights and shadows.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{attacked}} by monsters, Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood and learns about the Labyrinth. Annabeth and Percy find an entrance into the Labyrinth in camp. Percy soon learns that Luke will use the entrance to lead his army through the Labyrinth straight {{into the heart of}} camp. Annabeth is chosen to lead a quest to prevent it, and chooses to bring Tyson, Percy, and Grover, even though it was traditional to bring only two companions on a quest, as explained by Chiron. While in the Labyrinth, Percy and Annabeth become separated from Grover and Tyson. They encounter Nico, who begins to forgive Percy. Percy and Annabeth arrive under Mount St. Helens. Percy accidentally causes St. Helens to erupt and washes ashore on Calypso's island, Ogygia. He returns to Camp Half-Blood, rather than staying with her, stating that [...] "she would always be his biggest 'what-if'". Then he and Annabeth recruit a mortal girl, Rachel Dare to be a guide in the Labyrinth, using her sight through the Mist, the magical veil that separates the mythological world from the mortal world, and her knowledge for the quest. Daedalus is shown to be alive and to have given Ariadne's string to Luke. They find Grover and Tyson and discover Pan, and Grover tells him that he must return to the world. But Pan says that he cannot come and before dying tells Grover to tell those who will listen that he has died. Grover <b>does</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is told. Percy also finds Luke's body in Kronos' coffin. A final demigod joins the Titans' cause, and Kronos fully rises, using Luke's body. They flee to camp, trying to stop the invasion. Kronos' forces attack the camp, but they are defeated. The book ends with Daedalus sacrificing himself after the battle to destroy the Labyrinth, as it is tied to his life force, and Nico Di Angelo fully forgiving Percy and proposing a dangerous plan for defeating the Titans.|$|E
