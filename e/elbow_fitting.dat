50|$|The Mark I cannon {{was made}} out {{of a set of}} valves, a hose, and a freon tank. Iron pipe {{fittings}} were affixed to the freon 22 tank, which provided the pressure that powered the gun. Small water valves were used to fill the tank, and to supply pressure to an O-ring spool valve. When the gun was not in the fire position, the O-ring separated the pressure source from the magazine hose; however, when the radio control unit was activated the servo moved the spool valve into position, allowing freon to flow from the pressurized tank to the magazine hose. As the magazine was pressurized, BBs flowed into the restrictor tube until the pressure built high enough to force the BBs through the restrictor and out of the barrel. The exit velocity of the BBs was high enough to punch holes in the model ship’s 1/32 inch balsa wood skin. However, this linear magazine and barrel assembly was too bulky to be fit to a small model ship’s gun turret. To improve scale appearance, a brass <b>elbow</b> <b>fitting</b> was added to reduce the above deck size of the gun. This enabled the magazine to exit the deck vertically, with the BBs running into the base leg of the elbow before entering the restrictor. This {{led to the development of}} the new Mk II breach/barrel assembly. The first Mk II was installed on Stan Watkins' model of the USS Arizona (l/144 scale). The BBs (about 100) were loaded into a clear hose which, when pressurised, would feed the BBs into a smaller clear plastic tubing behind the barrel brass tubing. The pressure would build until the force pushed the BBs through the restrictor tubing and out the barrel. The force of this design had adequate power to penetrate the 1/32 balsa hull skin. The design of the restrictor caused a number of BBs to “spurt” out each time the pressure was great enough, however to have sufficient pressure to get more than one spurt, the warship combatant had to rapidly close the spool valve after the start of the spurt. This was made possible as the freon feed hoses were very thin, and had low flow.|$|E
50|$|Rigid copper is {{a popular}} choice for water lines. It is joined using a sweat, {{compression}} or crimped/pressed connection. Rigid copper, rigid due to the work hardening of the drawing process, cannot be bent and must use <b>elbow</b> <b>fittings</b> to go around corners or around obstacles. If heated and allowed to slowly cool, called annealing, then rigid copper will become soft and can be bent/formed without cracking.|$|R

40|$|A {{software}} interface has been devised to facilitate optimization of {{the shapes of}} valves, <b>elbows,</b> <b>fittings,</b> and other components used to handle fluids under extreme conditions. This {{software interface}} translates data files generated by PLOT 3 D (a NASA grid-based plotting-and- data-display program) and by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software into a format in which the files can be read by Sculptor, which is a shape-deformation- and-optimization program. Sculptor enables the user to interactively, smoothly, and arbitrarily deform the surfaces and volumes in two- and three-dimensional CFD models. Sculptor also includes design-optimization algorithms {{that can be used}} in conjunction with the arbitrary-shape-deformation components to perform automatic shape optimization. In the optimization process, the output of the CFD software is used as feedback while the optimizer strives to satisfy design criteria that could include, for example, improved values of pressure loss, velocity, flow quality, mass flow, etc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} the hot-forging process of seamless <b>elbow</b> <b>fittings</b> into a finite element model (FEM) developed {{with the aid of a}} commercial software code. The strain gradients predicted by the FEM were compared with the strain distributions com-puted by a visioplastic analysis. Measurements made on forged elbows are used to validate the predictions of the FEM. Once the validation was successful, the FEM is used to evaluate the effect that the tooling design exerts on the final dimensions and characteristics of formed elbows; this was done by changing the design of the tooling (mandrel). Two critical characteri-stics are required in forged elbows; these are consistency in wall thickness and length of the external arc, as wall consistency is directly associated with product quality, whereas control on the length contributes to savings in raw material. Results found by the FEM allows the con-clusion that these characteristics are related to each other...|$|R

Sailor Venus wears a sailor suit colored in orange (choker, collar, center of front bow, <b>elbow</b> <b>fittings</b> on her gloves, skirt, earrings, and a matching set of orange ankle-strap heels), navy blue (front bow) and yellow (tiara gem and back bow), and retains the red bow she wears as a civilian. In the live-action series, this bow appears only when she is {{in one of her}} Guardian forms, and has a gem in the center. In the manga, live-action series and Sailor Moon Crystal, she wears an item called the Wink Chain around her waist, which she sometimes uses as a weapon. She is given specific titles throughout the various series, including Soldier of Love, Soldier of Love and Hope, and Soldier of Love and Beauty. Her personality is no different from when she is a civilian, although she must be Sailor Venus to access her celestial powers.|$|R
40|$|<b>Elbow</b> <b>fittings</b> is {{one type}} of fitting on the piping {{installation}} that serves to change the flow direction. With the sudden flow of changes, it will affect the physical condition of the elbow. The flow changes in the elbow will result in changes of  flow velocity that affect wall of elbow, the condition will cause erosion corrosion phenomenon.   Erosion corrotion {{is a type of}} corrosion that uses a mechanical process through the relative movement of the flow and metal. Corrosion erosion can also be caused by impingment corrotion or very rapid flow movement. This study aims to determine the cause of damage elbow by using a CFD simulation and troubleshooting by adding a Vortex Generator or a installed disturber system in the pipeline installation and simulating it again. From the results of research conducted that elbow damage caused by high flow velocity that concerns the outer elbow. The addition of Vortex Generator is proven to be used to reduce excessive flow velocity on erosion-corroded parts. According to the results of the investigation the placement of the most efficient vortex generator if placed at a distance of 0. 1 R from elbow inlet...|$|R
50|$|It {{is unusual}} for the general water {{velocity}} in a system to be so high that impingement attack occurs throughout {{the whole of the}} copper pipework. More commonly, the velocity is just sufficiently low for satisfactory protective films to be formed and to remain in position on most of the system, with impingement damage more likely to occur where there is an abrupt change in the direction of water flow giving rise to a high degree of turbulence, such as at tee pieces and <b>elbow</b> <b>fittings.</b> It is not generally realised how great an effect small obstructions can have on the flow pattern of water in a pipe-work system {{and the extent to which}} they can induce turbulence and cause corrosion-erosion. For example, it is most important, as far as possible, to ensure that copper tubes cut with a tube cutter are deburred before making the joint. Also a gap between the tube end and the stop in the fitting, due to the tube not having been cut to the correct length and fully inserted into the socket of the fitting, can also induce turbulence in the water stream.|$|R

This kind of pipes needs of suitable mathematical formulation providing performances, in terms of pressure drop and flow-rate.

40|$|Slush hydrogen, {{a mixture}} of the solid and liquid phases of hydrogen, is a {{possible}} source of fuel for the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) Project. Advantages of slush hydrogen over liquid hydrogen include greater heat capacity and greater density. However, practical use of slush hydrogen as a fuel requires systems of lines, valves, etc. which are designed to deliver the fuel in slush form with minimal solid loss {{as a result of}} pipe heating or flow friction. Engineers involved with the NASP Project developed FLUSH to calculate the pressure drop and slush hydrogen solid fraction loss for steady-state, one-dimensional flow. FLUSH solves the steady-state, one-dimensional energy equation and the Bernoulli equation for pipe flow. The program performs these calculations for each two-node element [...] straight pipe length, <b>elbow,</b> valve, <b>fitting,</b> or other part of the piping system [...] specified by the user. The user provides flow rate, upstream pressure, initial solid hydrogen fraction, element heat leak, and element parameters such as length and diameter. For each element, FLUSH first calculates the pressure drop, then figures the slush solid fraction exiting the element. The code employs GASPLUS routines to calculate thermodynamic properties for the slush hydrogen. FLUSH is written in FORTRAN IV for DEC VAX series computers running VMS. An executable is provided on the tape. The GASPLUS physical properties routines which are required for building the executable are included as one object library on the program media (full source code for GASPLUS is available separately as COSMIC Program Number LEW- 15091). FLUSH is available in DEC VAX BACKUP format on a 9 -track 1600 BPI magnetic tape (standard media) or on a TK 50 tape cartridge. FLUSH was developed in 1989...|$|R
