500|$|Gordon and Silver {{moved the}} project to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was {{attached}} to direct. Unsatisfied with how Hamm's script fleshed out the characters, Gilliam brought in Charles McKeown to rewrite it. The second draft, which was credited to Gilliam, Warren Skaaren, and Hamm rather than McKeown, used the character Rorschach's journal as a voice-over, and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. According to Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons, filming was to take place at Pinewood Studios. Silver wanted to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Manhattan. Because both Gilliam and Silver's previous films, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Die Hard 2 respectively, went over budget, they were only able to raise $25 million for the film—a quarter of the necessary budget. As a result, Gilliam abandoned the project, and ultimately decided that Watchmen was unfilmable. Gilliam explained, [...] "Reducing [...] to a two or two-and-a-half hour film [...] {{seemed to me to}} take away the <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Watchmen is about." [...] When Warner Bros. dropped the project, Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently.

They amount to little but occasional observations thrown hastily into a notebook to receive later but a slight editing treatment. Yet they are priceless for representing the attitude to the real life drastically different {{to the one that}} was common at the time. Never idealizing or mocking the rural habits, he is an objective scientist deeply submerged into the subject which he knows and understands profoundly well. No matter how chaotic, his stories highlight most typical and characteristic aspects of life, and in his ability to grasp the very <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what’s</b> happening around he's a real artist. You won't find here any striking or original characters, but the collective voice of the people, merging into a common choir of our peasant world, sounds convincing - and that is something you’d be hard put to find in the 1840s Russian 'folkish' literature. Muzhik's vernacular is represented impeccably, without a trace of exaggeration or artificiality. Here the literature about common people's everyday life makes a step upon the entirely new ground and Yakushkin is a pioneer of this new development." ...|$|R

He considered the open world's research and creation the most demanding aspects of the game's production. Google Maps and Street View projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks.

The team opted to condense the city's spread into an area that players could comfortably traverse, and captured [...] "the <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> really there in a city, but in a far smaller area", according to Houser.

500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts {{to make a film}} version of Watchmen since 1986, when producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver acquired film rights to the series for 20th Century Fox.

Hamm took the liberty of re-writing Watchmens complicated ending into a [...] "more manageable" [...] conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox. Fox put the project into turnaround in 1991, and the project was moved to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct and Charles McKeown to rewrite it.
