5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating <b>frame</b> <b>parts,</b> many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E

50|$|The first running {{prototype}} of the Scarab was completed in 1932, probably the first car ever with an aluminum spaceframe unit-construction body, although the <b>frame</b> <b>parts</b> were steel. The second Scarab, completed in 1935, was an evolution of the first, incorporating some styling and mechanical changes. The headlamps were set behind a fine, vertical-bar grille, and at the rear, narrow chrome bars curved from the back window down to the bumper, giving the car its Art Deco appearance. The body was now steel to reduce cost.|$|E

The frontage has 3 bays of which the outer two are gabled. Over the doorway is the date 1649 and the letters JDED for John and Elizabeth Dearden. Noticeable features are the rose window, embattled parapets and elaborate finials.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} making raised panel doors begins with gluing up panels, and then moves into cutting and {{preparing}} the <b>frame</b> <b>parts.</b> Next, the panels are cut to size and shaped. Parts and panel are sanded before construction. It is also common to apply a finish to panels prior to assembly so that raw wood is not visible if the panel shrinks. The joints are glued and set into clamps. If the frame and panel items are paint grade they are sometimes nailed at the frame joints on the reverse side. The door then moves on to finish sanding where it is brought to its final thickness, and the outside profile is added if required.|$|E
5000|$|In modern cabinetry, the cope {{and stick}} joinery is {{achieved}} {{with a set}} of special router cutters. These cut the profile {{on the edge of the}} <b>frame</b> <b>parts</b> and also cut a reverse version of the same profile in the ends of the rail so that they may be slipped over the ends of the stiles and glued in place. If done correctly, the cope cut in the end of the rail will mate perfectly with the sticking profile. When glued together, the resulting joint will have sufficient strength for most cabinet door applications without further reinforcement. For extremely large and heavy doors, the cope and stick joint can be further reinforced with dowels, loose tenons, or by some other method.|$|E

5000|$|As stated above, the altarpiece {{consisted}} {{of more than}} just the main panel. The top molding (now in the Galleria Nazionale dell’Umbria in Perugia) had a panel of [...] "God the Father in a glory of cherubim, blessing his son." [...] The main panel itself had a <b>frame,</b> <b>parts</b> of which still survive, decorated by griffins' being crowned and fed by winged putti seated on rams’ heads, all of a yellow-bronze color against a blue ground (the Baglioni family crest was a griffin’s head, as well as the name of Atalanta’s husband and son being Grifonetto). Below there was a predella of three grisaille (monochrome) compartments illustrating the Theological Virtues (1507. Oil on panel, three sections of 18 x 44 cm each. Rome, Vatican Gallery). The three panels were originally lined up {{at the base of the}} altarpiece to show, left to right, Hopehttp://images.zeno.org/Kunstwerke/I/big/1700009c.jpg, Charityhttp://images.zeno.org/Kunstwerke/I/big/1700009b.jpg, and Faithhttp://images.zeno.org/Kunstwerke/I/big/1700009a.jpg, with each figure flanked by two putti. The subjects of the predellas are meant to relate symbolically to the main panel above: Charity in the center emphasizes the theme of motherhood, while Hope and Faith refer to the principle motif, Christ’s martyrdom. Thus Raphael’s conception not only refers to the theme of the altarpiece, but also to the private circumstances of the donor, Atalanta Baglioni.|$|E

Bernh. Oberg & Co. was founded by Bernhard Oberg in 1897 and began manufacturing bicycles similar to competitor Nyman companies [...] The name probably came from Fridtjof Nansen's ship of the same name. In 1905 took over the production of AB Josef Eriksson's Bicycle Factory (later AB Joseph Erickson). In 1932 the company was purchased by the Industrial Company of Helsingborg, which manufactured King bike brand. In 1955 the company {{changed its name to}} the bicycle factory Fram. Two years later made it a three-wheel micromobile, as final assembly factory in Helsingborg, but demand was poor. Instead it was for some time sales agents for the German three-wheelers Messerschmitt and Heinkel. In 1973 production was moved almost entirely to Helsingborg. The bikes now being called Front-King, and faded away completely during the 1980s. Bernhard Oberg & Co. had offices at Svartbäcksgatan 14 Uppsala. Josef Eriksson came to take over a team building at Österplan which the factory was to last from 1917 until 1960 when a new facility at Verkstadsgatan 8 Bolandsområdet near Uppsala was introduced.
