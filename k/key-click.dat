40|$|Abstract—As touch based input {{becomes more}} popular in mobile devices, {{there is an}} {{increasing}} need for haptic feedback on key-less input surface. Four experiments were conducted to design and evaluate identifiable emulated <b>key-click</b> signals using a piezoelectric actuator. Experiments I and II assessed the information transmission capacity for the amplitude, frequency, and number of cycles of raised cosine waveforms used to drive the piezo actuators under fixed- and roving-background conditions, respectively. Experiment III estimated the total information transfer for all three parameters. The results were used {{to reduce the number}} of stimulus alternatives in the <b>key-click</b> signal set with the goal to achieve perfect identification performance. Experiment IV verified that up to 5 to 6 identifiable <b>key-click</b> signals could be achieved with the experimental setup. The present study outlines an information theoretic approach to conducting identification experiments to guide the design of and to evaluate a perfectly identifiable stimulus set. The methodology can be applied to other applications in need of perceptually identifiable stimulation patterns.

40|$|Abstract. We study masking of <b>key-click</b> {{feedback}} signals {{on a flat}} surface for ten-finger touch typing with localized tactile feedback. We hypothesize that people will attribute tactile feedback to the key being pressed, even with global tactile feedback, provided that the tactile signal on other parts of the surface is sufficiently attenuated. To this end, we measure the thresholds at which a tactile signal is barely perceptible to a finger that is resting passively on a surface while another finger actively presses on the surface and receives a <b>key-click</b> feedback signal. Combinations of the index and middle fingers of both hands are tested. The results indicate that the thresholds are independent of the signal amplitude on the active finger. Larger signal attenuation is needed when the index fingers of both hands are involved than when two fingers of the same hand are involved. Future research will extend the current experimental design to ten fingers and typing-based tasks...|$|E
40|$|We present SlickFeel, {{a single}} haptic display setup that can deliver two {{distinct}} types of feedback to {{a finger on}} a touchscreen during typical operations of sliding and clicking. Sliding feedback enables the sliding finger to feel interactive objects on a touchscreen through variations in friction. Clicking feedback provides a <b>key-click</b> sensation for confirming a key or button click. Two scenarios {{have been developed to}} demonstrate the utility of the two haptic effects. In the first, simple button-click scenario, a user feels the positions of four buttons on a touchscreen by sliding a finger over them and feels a simulated <b>key-click</b> signal by pressing on any of the buttons. In the second scenario, the advantage of haptic feedback is demonstrated in a haptically-enhanced thumbtyping scenario. A user enters text on a touchscreen with two thumbs without having to monitor the thumbs ’ locations on the screen. By integrating SlickFeel with a Kindle Fire tablet, we show that it can be used with existing mobile touchscreen devices. ACM Classification: H. 5. 2 [Information interfaces an...|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} works by Ferneyhough and other New Complexity composers, Etudes Transcendantales is infamously {{difficult}} to perform and is extremely complicated. Pitch-wise, the notes are freely sampled from all 12 tones and the quarter tones in between. Rhythmically, Ferneyhough {{is known for}} his nested irregular tuplets, and there is no exception here. Almost each individual note also has its own unique dynamics and articulation, including extended techniques such as multiphonics on the oboe, glottal stops for the voice, and <b>key-clicking</b> for the flute.|$|R
50|$|Ferneyhough's Etudes Transcendentales, a song cycle for soprano and chamber ensemble, {{demonstrates}} many traits {{found in}} New Complexity music. In {{addition to being}} generally difficult to learn and perform, the pitch vocabulary makes heavy use of microtones—in this case, equal-tempered quarter tones. It also contains many tuplets of unusual ratios which are nested in multiple layers. Rapid changes, sometimes from note to note, happen in dynamics, articulation, and playing technique, including techniques such as multiphonics on the oboe, glottal stops for the voice, and <b>key-clicking</b> for the flute. According to Richard Toop, the rhythm for the oboe part in the first song is almost totally determined by a strict system with five stages of complexity, each governed by its own cycle of numbers.|$|R
40|$|Recently touch screens {{are widely}} used for mobile devices to provide {{intuitive}} and natural interactions with fingertips. However, the lack of tactile feedback {{makes it difficult for}} users to receive <b>key-click</b> confirmation during text entry on soft keyboards. This paper examines the effect of tactile feedback on typing performance with the soft QWERTY keyboard: the most commonly used multi-finger text entry method on tablet devices. We implemented tactile feedback hardware and software to simulate the <b>key-click</b> effect on a commercially-available mobile tablet (Microsoft Surface Pro). We conducted a typing experiment to measure user performance and preference. The participants transcribed given phrases under three sensory feedback conditions: visual only, visual and audio, and visual and tactile. The results are unexpected; we did not find any significant difference in terms of typing performance, and user preference was as positive as the audio condition though better received than the visual only condition. This study thus reports different findings from previous work studying text entry on handheld devices, encouraging further examinations to fully understand the effect of tactile feedback on text entry in tablet devices...|$|E
40|$|Part 7 : Privacy Attacks and Privacy-Enhancing TechnologiesInternational audienceMalicious {{intermediaries}} {{are able}} to detect the availability of VoIP conversation flows in a network and observe the IP addresses used by the conversation partners. However, it is insufficient to infer the calling records of a particular user in this way since the linkability between a user and a IP address is uncertain: users may regularly change or share IP addresses. Unfortunately, VoIP flows may contain humanspecific features. For example, users sometimes are required to provide Personal identification numbers (PINs) to a voice server for authentication and thus the <b>key-click</b> patterns of entering a PIN can be extracted from VoIP flows for user recognition. We invited 31 subjects to enter 4 -digital PINs on a virtual keypad of a popular VoIP user-agent with mouse clicking. Employing machine learning algorithms, we achieved average equal error rates of 10 - 29 % for user verification and a hitting rate up to 65 % with a false positive rate around 1 % for user classification...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{present study}} {{examined}} the efficacy of using audio cues for redundant coding of tactile key clicks simulated with a piezoelectric actuator. The tactile stimuli consisted of six raised cosine pulses at two levels of frequency and three levels of amplitude. An absolute identification experiment was conducted to measure the information transfers associated with the tactile-audio signal set. Results from Condition 1 (C 1) provided a baseline measure by employing only the tactile signals. In Conditions 2 - 4 (C 2 -C 4), supplemental audio signals were used to encode amplitude cues only, frequency cues only, and both amplitude and frequency cues, respectively. The results showed that partial redundant coding of tactile cues with audio signals could increase information transfer, when the cue (amplitude) was not perfectly identifiable with tactile signals alone (C 2). When the cue (frequency) was well perceived through tactile signals alone, audio supplemental cues did not improve performance (C 3). With redundant coding of both amplitude and frequency cues (C 4), audio signals dominated tactile signals. It was also found that increased information transfer was achieved {{at the cost of}} increased response time (C 2), suggesting increased mental load associated with the processing of multisensory information. Our findings have implications for the design of simulated <b>key-click</b> signals for mobile devices, and the use of multimodal signals for redundant coding of information in general. ...|$|E
