40|$|Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) {{genotype}} ITA {{was first}} detected in 2011 in Italy in IBD- live vaccinated broilers. Full genome caracterization confirmed ITA to be a genetically distinctive IBDV genotype. In particular peculiar molecular characteristics {{were observed in}} key positions of the VP 2 hypervariable region, which affect charged or potentially glycosylated amino acids virtually associated with important changes in virus properties. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the pathogenicity of ITA genotype in SPF chickens. 84 Birds were housed in poultry isolators and inoculated at 35 days of life with ITA IBDV strain Italy/ 1829 / 2012 (40 birds) or a classical reference strain (40 birds). 28 controls were contextually mock inoculated with sterile water. All groups were daily observed for clinical signs up to 28 days post-infection (dpi). At 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 dpi birds were bled for IBDV antibody detection by a commercial ELISA Kit. At 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 e 28 dpi 5 birds from each of the inoculated groups, and 3 from the control group, were euthanized and subjected to post-mortem examination. Bursal and Thymus indexes were calculated; histopathology of the Bursas of Fabricious was carried out and viral tissue distribution determined by qRT-PCR in the following tissues: bursa of Fabricious, thymus, kidney, cecal tonsils, spleen, proventriculus, <b>harder</b> <b>gland</b> and bone marrow. No clinical signs, nor mortality were recorded in any group during the study. Bursas of Fabricious of both IBDV inoculated groups showed enlargement and oedema in the acute phase of the infection (2 dpi), followed by atrophy, which lasted until the end of the trial. Atrophy of the Bursas appeared earlier and was more substantial in birds inoculated with the ITA strain compared to the ones inoculated with the Classical strain. Histopatology of the Bursas showed lymphocyte depletion, cystic cavities and poor regeneration process. Viral RNA was persistently detected until the end of the trial in bursal tissues and in most of the tissues collected. The study showed that ITA genotype, though it has a subclinical course, causes a severe and persistent damage of Bursa tissues. Therefore its circulation in broilers might be a threat for the poultry industry...|$|E
40|$|A case of {{non-specific}} granulomatous prostatitis is presented. A 61 -year-old male {{consulted a}} doctor {{with the chief}} complaint of dysuria. For suspicion of prostate cancer, he was referred to our hospital. A digital examination showed stony <b>hard</b> prostate <b>gland</b> which was asymmetrically enlarged to hen's egg size with an irregular surface. Since biopsy specimen from the prostate showed eosinophilic granulation without fibrinoid necrosis, the case was diagnosed as simple nonspecific granulomatous prostatitis. After oral administration of chlormadinone acetate (CMA), he showed a remarkable increase in urinary stream. The findings of urethrogram and prostatic sonogram demonstrated dramatic improvement. He has remained asymptomatic for 29 months without any further treatment. Therefore, CMA could be effective against granulomatous prostatitis...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} points can {{be considered}} as the standard breed characteristics: Medium head with straight profile and big occipital protuberance. Small ears with much hair and slightly prominent eyes with a calm look. Horns born in the elongation of the nape of the neck, shorter and wider in the bulls, horizontal in the base and directed ahead and up with their ends directed to the back and outside. Medium neck, thin except in the male, muscled and with a big and discontinuous dewlap, which continues in little and lean withers, well-joined to the slightly muscular back but well-directed, with a slightly saddled back which ends in the hindquarters, narrow in its back diameters and slightly bent, with the birth of the tail often lifted up. Descending chest, deep and spacious breast, and well-proportioned abdomen. Short or medium extremities, beefy on the top with very thin skeletal ratios and small, round and <b>hard</b> hoof. Mammary <b>glands</b> with good development and great quality, well-implanted teats and thin and soft skin.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} process from floral bud formation to seed maturity of four top flowering annual clovers was quantified from a field experiment across 10 sowing dates at Lincoln University, Canterbury, New Zealand. For each species, a numeric reproductive scale was {{created as a}} field guide to document morphological changes as the bud progresses through reproductive development. The duration from bud visible to open flower was 341 °C days for ‘Cefalu’ arrowleaf, 215 °C days for ‘Bolta’ balansa, 196 °C days for ‘Prima’ gland and 186 °C days for ‘Mihi’ Persian clover. The inflorescence then required a further 274 - 689 °C days, 185 °C days, 256 °C days and 425 °C days for each respective species to reach physiological maturity. This was indicated when 50 % of seeds had turned red/brown for ‘Cefalu’ arrowleaf, 100 % pods turned yellow for ‘Bolta’ balansa, 100 % of seeds were yellow and <b>hard</b> for ‘Prima’ <b>gland,</b> and pods turned brown with {{the first sign of}} colour change in seeds for ‘Mihi’ Persian clover. These results can be used to facilitate on farm decision making in relation to grazing management or seed set for subsequent regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Mucoepidermoid {{carcinoma}} (MEC) is {{the most}} common salivary gland malignancy. Oncocytic MEC (OMEC) has been rarely reported with previous cases suggesting they are largely cystic low-grade neoplasms with a favorable prognosis. The differential diagnosis of OMEC includes numerous oncocytic/"oncocytoid" neoplasms. Some are benign while others are aggressive. Recent evidence suggests that p 63 is a reliable marker in the diagnosis of conventional MEC but has not been explored in OMEC. We searched the archives of various institutions for examples of OMEC to re-appraise the grade, and to evaluate p 63 immunohistochemistry as a tool to separate OMEC from its potential mimics. A total of 12 cases were identified. There were 6 males and 6 females with an age range of 30 to 79 years. Most occurred in the parotid (9) with 1 each in the sublingual <b>gland,</b> <b>hard</b> palate and neck. They showed minimal cystic content and were infiltrative and solid tumors spanning all grades. All tumors had focal mucin production and were composed almost exclusively of oncocytic cells with 2 cases demonstrating conventional MEC areas. All 6 cases tested showed the majority of oncocytic cells staining with p 63 in a diffuse pattern, demonstrating its utility in the diagnosis of OMEC. Of the 6 cases with follow-up information, 1 case had local recurrence 8 years after the initial surgery. Three cases showed skin or bone invasion. None had lymph node/distant metastases. In summary, OMEC behaves as a low-grade tumor, and is diffusely positive for p 63, which may aid in its differential diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Sjögren’s {{syndrome}} is a chronic autoimmune disorder carrying {{the risk of}} the development of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, most frequently marginal zone lymphoma. Case Outline. A 66 -year-old male patient with Sjögren’s syndrome, after a year of the disease, developed a nodal marginal zone lymphoma with lymphoma cells in peripheral blood which had the following immunophenotype: CD 19, CD 20, CD 22, CD 19 /kappa, CD 79 b+. After six cycles of chemotherapy according to CHOP protocol (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) disease remission was achieved lasting four months, followed by enlargement of lymph nodes in all areas (generalized lymphadenopathy), splenomegaly and enlargement of the right parotid gland. Bone marrow biopsy and histology confirmed lymphoma of the same morphologic and immunohistochemic profile. Biopsy of a very enlarged <b>hard</b> right parotid <b>gland,</b> by using histology and immunohistochemistry, showed lymphoid tumour tissue with blast appearance and a number of nucleoli corresponding to centroblasts and less to immunoblasts. Immunophenotypes of these cells were as follows: CD 79 alfa+, CD 20 +, CD 3 -, bcl- 2 -; proliferative activity measured with KI- 67 was high rating 60 %. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed the co-existence of a diffuse large B cell lymphoma with marginal zone lymphoma. In spite of aggressive chemotherapy treatment according to protocol ESHAP (Vepesid 200 mg i. v. on 1 st and 2 nd day and 100 mg on 3 rd, 4 th and 5 th day; Cisplatin 20 - 20 - 10 mg on 1 st to 4 th day) the disease showed a progressive course. Conclusion. In patients with Sjögren’s syndrome, the possibility of lymphoma should be kept in mind and in suspected cases timely diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken...|$|R
