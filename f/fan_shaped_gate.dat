50|$|As a stream's {{gradient}} decreases, {{it drops}} coarse-grained material. This reduces {{the capacity of}} the channel and forces it to change direction and gradually build up a slightly mounded or shallow conical <b>fan</b> <b>shape.</b> The deposits are usually poorly sorted. This <b>fan</b> <b>shape</b> can also be explained with a thermodynamic justification: the system of sediment introduced at the apex of the fan will tend to a state which minimizes the sum of the transport energy involved in moving the sediment and the gravitational potential of material in the fan. There will be iso-transport energy lines forming concentric arcs about the discharge point at the apex of the fan. Thus the material will tend to be deposited equally about these lines, forming the characteristic <b>fan</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} simulation of <b>Fan</b> <b>shape</b> fractal antenna using IE 3 D electromagnetic simulation software. The fractal structure is advantageous in generating multiple frequencies or enhancing bandwidth. <b>fan</b> <b>shape</b> fractal antenna gives better performance in return loss, efficiency and directivity.

Fractal antenna are very odd in concept and very new in design for multiband applications, many discontinues in the structure add in radiating higher frequencies. This paper proposes the design and simulation of three stages of antenna and the performance characteristics of this three antennas reported in this paper...|$|R

50|$|Convergent {{arrangements}} are triangle or <b>fan</b> <b>shaped,</b> with wide origins and more narrow insertions. The wide variation of pennation angles in this architecture can actually allow for multiple functions. For instance, the trapezius, a prototypical convergent muscle, can aid in both shoulder elevation and depression.|$|R

40|$|A volcano <b>shaped</b> <b>gated</b> Si-FEA (silicon field emitter array) {{was simply}} {{fabricated}} using sputtering as a gate electrodedeposition and lift-off {{for the removal}} of the oxide mask, respectively. Due to the limited step coverage of wellcontrolledsputtering and the high aspect ratio in Si dry etch caused by high RF power, it was possible to obtain SiFEAs with a stable volcano <b>shaped</b> <b>gate</b> structure and to realize the restriction of gate leakage current in field emissioncharacteristics. For 100 tip arrays and 625 tip arrays, gate leakage currents were restricted to less than 1 % of the anodecurrent in spite of the volcano-shaped gate structure. It was also possible to keep the emitters stable without anyfailure between the Si cathode and gate electrode in field emission for a long time...|$|R
50|$|Bunting (or bunt) is any festive decorations made of fabric, or of plastic, {{paper or}} even {{cardboard}} {{in imitation of}} fabric. Typical forms of bunting are strings of colorful triangular flags and lengths of fabric in the colors of national flags gathered and draped into swags or pleated into <b>fan</b> <b>shapes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In both {{of these}} cases, depositional {{processes}} force redistribution of deposition from areas of high deposition to areas of low deposition. This results in the smoothing of the planform (or map-view) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment. Because the sediment is laid down in this fashion, the shape of these deltas approximates a fan. The more often the flow changes course, the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan, because more rapid changes in channel position results in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front. The Mississippi and Ural River deltas, with their bird's-feet, are examples of rivers that do not avulse often enough to form a symmetrical <b>fan</b> <b>shape.</b> Alluvial <b>fan</b> deltas, as seen by their name, avulse frequently and more closely approximate an ideal <b>fan</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|R
50|$|Construction of {{the south}} tower began on September 4, 1913. When the two 185 ft towers were completed, {{falsework}} for the main span was constructed in a <b>fan</b> <b>shape</b> that allowed the main span to be constructed in the raised position 130 ft above the river. The bridge was built from steel and metal.|$|R
50|$|The {{paintings}} {{are not as}} extensive as they originally were, but cover several locations.

50|$|They {{are most}} likely created when basalt lava is intruded into a soft material, such as loose {{volcanic}} ash, which is unable to support the intrusion. As the basalt cools and forms columns, the ash collapses, causing the lava spread and form a <b>fan</b> <b>shape.</b> The formations can be vertical or any degree of horizontal.|$|R
