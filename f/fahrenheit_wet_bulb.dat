Analysis of laboratory tests in an environmental chamber resulted in two possible models for the psychrometer coefficient for these sensors. The first model included the “wet potential”, that is a coefficient for the ratio of the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature divided by the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> depression.

40|$|In {{locations}} where workforce {{is exposed to}} high relative humidity and light winds, heat stress is a significant concern. Such is the case at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Heat stress is depicted by the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe temperature, which is the official measurement used by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. The <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe temperature is measured by an instrument {{which was designed to}} be portable and needing routine maintenance. As an alternative form for measuring the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe temperature, algorithms have been created to calculate the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe temperature from basic meteorological observations. The algorithms are location dependent; therefore a specific algorithm is usually not suitable for multiple locations. Due to climatology similarities, the algorithm developed for use at the Dryden Flight Research Center was applied to data from the White Sands Missile Range. A study was performed that compared a <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe instrument to data from two Surface Atmospheric Measurement Systems that was applied to the Dryden <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe temperature algorithm. The period of study was from June to September of 2009, with focus being applied from 0900 to 1800, local time. Analysis showed that the algorithm worked well, with a few exceptions. The algorithm becomes less accurate to the measurement when the dew point temperature is over 10 Celsius. Cloud cover also has a significant effect on the measured <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe temperature. The algorithm does not show red and black heat stress flags well due to shorter time scales of such events. The results of this study show that it is plausible that the Dryden Flight Research <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe temperature algorithm is compatible with the White Sands Missile Range, except for when there are increased dew point temperatures and cloud cover or precipitation. During such occasions, the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe temperature instrument would be the preferred method of measurement.

40|$|Mist is {{increasingly}} applied to precool outdoor air in heat rejection. This study investigates how {{the coefficient of}} performance (COP) of an air-cooled chiller varies with a mist precooler {{at different levels of}} cooling effectiveness. A multivariate regression model was developed to simulate the operating variables of an air-cooled chiller with mist precooling. The model was validated with typical performance data of an air-cooled centrifugal chiller. The COP would increase by up to 30 %, depending on the cooling effectiveness and the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> depression-the difference between the dry <b>bulb</b> and <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperatures of outdoor air. At a large <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> depression, the percentage increase of COP tended to correlate linearly with the chiller capacity. Yet at a small <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> depression, the dynamic control of condensing temperature resulted in a non-linear relationship between the percentage change of COP and the cooling effectiveness.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe {{temperature}} index (WBGT) is {{a common}} method to assess the environmental contribution to heat stress {{as part of an}} occupational exposure assessment. The two purposes of this study were (1) to compare empirical relationships of some meteorological conditions to WBGT, and (2) to evaluate a smaller globe and alternative method to assess natural <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> using a relative humidity sensor. Data were collected in six West-central Florida locations over multiple days for a total of 14 measurement days. Multiple linear regression was used to explore relationships relevant to the two purposes. It was clear that estimating WBGT directly from meteorological data or through estimates of the components of WBGT can be accomplished with a 95 % confidence of ± 2 °C-WBGT. The 50 mm globe size is a reasonable approximation of the standard size (150 mm). The relative humidity method of the waterless natural <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> provides a very good estimation of natural <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature.

40|$|The <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> {{temperature}} of the intergranular air in a bulk of stored grains has a most {{profound effect on the}} growth of insect populations and grain quality.

An alternative is to refrigerate ambient tropical air before introducing it into the grain store. This is energy-intensive. In this research it is shown that air leaving the upper surface of a bulk of stored grains can be recirculated around the grain store through a grain-chilling unit in a process dubbed refrigaeration.

Physiological functions of the human and animal body respond to changes in the weather, and incidence of certain disease shows a close correlation with climate and seasons. Of the climatic elements which affect the human body, the most important one is <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature. The body 2 ̆ 7 s response to <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature is affected by the rates of conduction, convection, and radiation heat away from the body, and by cooling due to evaporation at the skin surface and in the respiratory tracts. The resulting temperature affect is known as the sensible temperature. It varies not only with the humidity factor and air movement at skin surface but also from one person to another, and it is, therefore, not measurable by any instrument. The values of sensible temperature and the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature however, are approximately the same when the skin is moist and is exposed to calm air at normal dry bulb temperature, since evaporation will then be the principal cooling process.

In sparse forests {{it might be better}} to model E and interception loss at the tree level assuming that the individual tree crowns behave as <b>wet</b> <b>bulbs</b> (‘‘wet bulb approach”). In this study, and for five different forest types and climate conditions, interception loss measurements were compared to modelled values (Gash’s interception model) based on estimates of E by the Penman–Monteith and the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> approaches. Results show that the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> approach is a good, and less data demanding, alternative to estimate E when the forest canopy is fully ventilated (very sparse forests with a narrow canopy depth). When the canopy is not fully ventilated, the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> approach requires a reduction of leaf area index to the upper, more ventilated parts of the canopy, needing data on the vertical leaf area distribution, which is seldom-available. In such cases, the Penman–Monteith approach seems preferable. Our data also show that canopy cover does not per se allow us to identify if a forest canopy is fully ventilated or not.
