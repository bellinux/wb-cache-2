He did admit to hitting her three or four times during their first five years of marriage. The children contradicted him, saying that the marriage was full of instances of domestic violence from both sides. Their middle daughter, Sara, testified in the penalty phase of the trial that during one argument Syriani chased after Teresa with a pair of scissors, in another instance back-handed her while they were in the car and one time threw her down the stairs by her hair. <b>John</b> <b>said</b> that another time, his father threatened Teresa with a bat.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} given to Top FM, Rama Valayden noted several grey area in this case; only {{the idea of}} strangulation was taken into consideration {{and there is a}} possibility that the police took the wrong path, the moment that the crime took place, that is when the door was open by the magnetic card, the suspect Sandeep Moonea was on a phone conversation with his sister according the Mauritius Telecom, a belt which was later found in the room was not analyse by police, the suitcase of the victim was found outside the room, the bathtub was displace before being analysed, several clues and accessed to the room was not protected. Rama also made a profile of John McAreavey whom he claim is very intelligent, <b>John</b> <b>said</b> that he was on his phone while waiting for the victim but his phone was not even analyse by the police, there was 117 contradictions in statements given by John including the times, John is not favorable to a second autopsy which could be crucial, the footage of the CCTV cameras was deleted.|$|E
25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. <b>John</b> <b>said</b> he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E

500|$|Petacci {{was sitting}} on the bed and Mussolini was standing. [...] "John" [...] took me outside and told me his orders were to {{eliminate}} them both, because Petacci knew many things.

500|$|De Gray {{remained}} {{close to}} John {{for most of}} the bishop's life, and one of the King's chief fundraisers. Sidney Painter, a historian and biographer of <b>John,</b> <b>said</b> of de Gray that he was [...] "probably the only man whom John trusted absolutely and without reservation for the whole period of their association". The medievalist Ralph Turner called de Gray [...] "one of John's greatest favourites", and another of John's biographers, , described de Gray as [...] "one of the best brains of the royal administration". Matthew Paris, a medieval writer, called him an [...] "evil counsellor", and blamed many of the difficulties of John's later reign on de Gray's failed election to Canterbury.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Kelly, in his 1997 {{biography}} of Shankly, calls him [...] "the ultimate obsessive". Shankly was fanatical about Liverpool and about football in general. From coaching his players and arguing with journalists to buttonholing fans in pubs, all Shankly [...] "ever {{wanted to do}} was talk about football" [...] and to be involved in football. As a result, he had few interests outside the game other than his family. His wife Nessie told Kelly that Shankly would spend time in the garden, mowing and weeding. She could also rely on him to [...] "clean the cooker when Liverpool lost". Family holidays were limited to a week in Blackpool, where they always stayed at the Norbreck Hotel. One non-football activity that Shankly did enjoy was playing cards and Ian St <b>John</b> <b>said</b> he [...] "loved" [...] it, always taking part on long coach trips to away matches.|$|E

500|$|Waugh was {{approached}} at the Oberoi by an Indian man, {{who was also}} staying at the hotel. The man called himself [...] "John" [...] and gave no surname. <b>John</b> <b>said</b> {{he was a man}} who had won money betting on cricket and asked Waugh to provide pitch and weather information; he also asked the Australian to reveal inside knowledge about the team, such as tactics and player selections, in exchange for US$4,000. Waugh accepted the money and agreed to provide information about the pitch and weather, but he refused to divulge the tactics that the Australians intended to use against their opposition, or information on which players would play and what their role would be. Information on pitch conditions provides an insight into the strategies that the team might adopt and which players might be used, and teams will field different players depending on the pitch, as their skills are suited to different conditions. The arrangement with John remained in place until the end of the 1994–95 Australian summer. Waugh later said that at the time, he did not see anything wrong with his actions, reasoning that the agreement was similar to a player speculating about their form and the playing conditions in a pre-match media interview.|$|E
500|$|Although monastic chroniclers {{after the}} Norman Conquest {{accused him of}} crimes such as perjury and homicide, they do not provide any {{evidence}} of those crimes. Almost 100 years after his death, another Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was taunted in 1164 by King Henry II's barons with Stigand's fate for daring to oppose his king. Modern historians views tend {{to see him as}} either a wily politician and indifferent bishop, or to see him purely in terms of his ecclesiastical failings. The historian Frank Stenton felt that his [...] "whole career shows that he was essentially a politician". Concurring with this, the historian Nick Higham said that [...] "Stigand was a seasoned politician whose career had been built on an accurate reading of the balance of power." [...] Another historian, Eric <b>John,</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "Stigand had a fair claim to be the worst bishop of Christendom". However, the historian Frank Barlow felt that [...] "he was a man of cultured tastes, a patron of the arts who was generous to the monasteries which he held". Alexander Rumble argued that Stigand was unlucky in living past the Conquest, stating that it could be said that Stigand was [...] "unlucky to live so long that he saw in his lifetime not only the end of the Anglo-Saxon state but also the challenging of uncanonical, but hitherto tolerated, practices by a wave of papal reforms".|$|E
500|$|Elton John, the English {{singer and}} songwriter, {{appears as a}} guest vocalist for Chef's song, {{in one of the}} {{earliest}} celebrity spoof appearances on South Park; Trey Parker, who provided the voice for Elton <b>John,</b> <b>said</b> many people thought it was the actual John singing because his impression was so accurate. In another musical reference featured in the episode, several characters claim the real-life Canadian rock group Loverboy wrote a song {{about the fact that the}} DNA of an elephant and pig will not splice. [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] includes several pop cultural references to films and television shows. The last line in the episode, [...] "That'll do pig", spoken by Cartman, is a reference to the final line of the 1995 film Babe, a movie about a talking pig, which Stone has described as one of his favorite films. When the boys try to tell Officer Barbrady about the clone, he suggests that the boys have seen too many episodes of the X-Files. In the scene in which Pip is introduced, Stan asks Pip about his peculiar name, but Cartman interrupts Pip during his answer. Pip's reply – [...] "my father's family name being Pirrip and my Christian name Phillip, my infant tongue--" [...] – is identical to the opening line of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, which is narrated by its protagonist, Pip. The fourth season episode [...] "Pip" [...] is a parody and comedic retelling of the novel, and stars Pip, who assumes the role of his namesake.|$|E

The brothers Neil (Kristoff St. John) and Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore) were introduced as love interests for Olivia and Drucilla. The Young and the Restless became popular among black viewers, which Williams and St. John attributed to the writing for the black characters. [...] "I play a CEO at a major corporation, that's something we don't see that often," [...] St. <b>John</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "And the show doesn't use the old African-American stereotypes {{that we have been}} seeing on TV, like the hustler, the pimp, the drug dealer.
