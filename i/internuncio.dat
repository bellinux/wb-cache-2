5|$|In 1658, Parchevich was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} Roman Catholic Diocese of Marcianopolis (named after an Ancient Roman city near modern Devnya, northeastern Bulgaria). Along with the Diocese of Nicopoli headed by Filip Stanislavov, Marcianopolis {{was one of the}} two sees which succeeded the Bulgarian Custody as the governing body of Catholicism in Bulgaria. Parchevich also held the position of Bulgarian <b>internuncio</b> to the Viennese court. In 1661, Parchevich had to step down as Archbishop of Marcianopolis due to pressure from Rome, which condemned his clerical inactivity, though in 1668 he became apostolic vicar to Moldavia despite continuing suspicion.|$|E
5|$|The Court Architect (Jiangzuo dajiang 將作大匠) was {{in charge}} of the construction, maintenance, and repair of {{imperial}} palace halls, government halls, temples, grave tumuli, buildings in funerary parks, roads leading out of the capital, and flood control works. His salary-rank was 2,000-dan. He directed the efforts of conscripted corvée laborers until this duty was transferred to the ministry of the newly created Excellency of Works in 8 BC. The Court Architect's subordinates were responsible for gathering timber for carpenters and stone for masons. Although his office existed at the establishment of Eastern Han, it was abolished in 57 AD and his duties were transferred to an <b>Internuncio</b> in the Ministry of the Household. However, the post was reinstated in 76 AD with the original salary-rank, yet many of his subordinates remained abolished. Since most buildings were constructed from wood, with ceramic roof tiles, a large workforce was needed to maintain buildings that fell into disrepair. The restoration of the Imperial University during Emperor Shun's (r. 125–144 AD) reign required 100,000 laborers to work for a year under the supervision of the Court Architect.|$|E

5|$|The Minister of the Household (Guangluxun 光祿勳), {{also known}} as Superintendent of the Household and Supervisor of Attendants, was {{originally}} titled the Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (Lang zhongling 郎中令) before 104 BC. He {{was responsible for the}} emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks, and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. However, to ensure that the emperor's entire safety was not entrusted to a single officer, the subordinates of the Minister of the Guards were given sole right to patrol the palaces' entrances and walls while the eunuchs guarded the emperor's private apartments and harem. Three of the five cadet corps commanded by the Minister of the Household were actually armed civilian nominees serving a period of probation before appointment to a government office; the other two corps were composed of imperial bodyguards who were never appointed to civilian offices. The former were often recommended by commandery-level Administrators as Filial and Incorrupt, while others could be relatives of high officials in central government. The Minister of the Household oversaw subordinate court advisors (Yi Lang /议郎） who advised the emperor and engaged in scholarly debates. They were allowed to openly criticize the emperor, participate in provincial inspections, and conduct mourning ceremonies for recently deceased kings and marquesses while installing their successors. <b>Internuncios</b> (Yezhe 謁者), led by a Supervisor of the <b>Internuncios</b> (Yezhe puye 謁者僕射), were subordinates of the Minister of the Household who participated in state ceremonies, condoled on behalf of the emperor for recently deceased officials, inspected public works and military camps along the frontiers, and acted as diplomats to the semi-autonomous fiefs and non-Han-Chinese peoples along the borders.|$|R
25|$|Since {{medieval times}} the episcopal see of Rome has been {{recognized}} as a sovereign entity. Earlier, there were papal representatives (apocrisiarii) to the Emperors of Constantinople, beginning in 453, {{but they were not}} thought of as ambassadors. In the eleventh century the sending of papal representatives to princes, on a temporary or permanent mission, became frequent. In the fifteenth century it became customary for states to accredit permanent resident ambassadors to the Pope in Rome. The first permanent papal nunciature was established in 1500 in Venice. Their number grew {{in the course of the}} sixteenth century to thirteen, while <b>internuncios</b> (representatives of second rank) were sent to less-powerful states. After enjoying a brilliant period in the first half of the seventeenth century, papal diplomacy declined after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, being assailed especially by royalists and Gallicans, and the number of functioning nuncios was reduced to two in the time of Napoleon, although in the same period, in 1805, Prussia became the first Protestant state to send an ambassador to Rome. There was a revival after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, which, while laying down that, in general, the order of precedence between ambassadors would be determined by the date of their arrival, allowed special precedence to be given to the nuncio, by which he would always be the dean of the diplomatic corps.|$|R
50|$|From {{the end of}} the 16th century {{their place}} was taken by vicars apostolic for the Dutch Republic, who, however, were {{generally}} driven from the country by the States-General and forced to administer their charge from abroad.Even though there was a great lack of priests, a very large part {{of the population of the}} Netherlands remained Catholic.Among these vicars apostolic, who were generally made titular archbishops, was Johannes van Neercassel, a friend of Antoine Arnauld and Pasquier Quesnel, who had fled from France and was inclined to Jansenism.His successor, Petrus Codde (1688-1704), was suspended in 1702 by Pope Clement XI on account of his Jansenistic opinions and his stubborn opposition to the papal see, and in 1704 the pope deposed him.The cathedral chapter of Utrecht, though, first illegally elected a vicar general in 1706 and then in 1723 with the approval of the States-General chose the parish priest of Utrecht, Cornelius Steenhoven, as archbishop. Steenhoven was excommunicated by Pope Benedict XIII.This was the origin of the Jansenistic Church of Utrecht, which, however, was joined by only a very small part of the Catholic clergy and laity, although the state favored it entirely.As the pro-vicars appointed by the pope were not permitted by the Government to enter the country, both the Catholic Church of Utrecht and that of the entire Netherlands was administered until the French Revolution by papal <b>internuncios</b> of Cologne and Brussels.|$|R
25|$|On 11 April 1946 Pope Pius XII {{established}} the episcopal hierarchy in China, raising all the apostolic vicariates to dioceses, Hong Kong among them, through an Apostolic Constitution in Latin sent to each Vicar Apostolic {{together with a}} letter from the Apostolic <b>Internuncio,</b> Anthony Riberi, in the summer of 1946. Since then, the Hong Kong Diocese is directly responsible to the pope. Enrico Valtorta became the first bishop of Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Huo Yi's {{father was}} Huo Jun, a general who served under the warlord Liu Bei {{in the late}} Eastern Han dynasty and died {{sometime}} in the late 210s. In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and established the state of Shu Han, after which he appointed Huo Yi as a taizi sheren (太子舍人; an attendant to the crown prince). Liu Bei died in 223 and was succeeded by his son Liu Shan, who appointed Huo Yi as an <b>Internuncio</b> (謁者) after his enthronement. Between 227 and 234, when Shu's chancellor-regent Zhuge Liang was stationed in Hanzhong Commandery during the launching {{of a series of}} military campaigns against Shu's rival state Cao Wei, he requested for Huo Yi to be transferred to his office. Huo Yi worked together with Zhuge Liang's adoptive son Zhuge Qiao during this period of time.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this moment}} Hillel and Fakredeen {{advanced}} with a hurried air of gaiety.

6000|$|A young man, {{tall and}} well-looking, dressed as an Oriental, {{but with an}} affected, jerking air, more French than Syrian, moved jauntily about the room, {{speaking}} to several persons for a short time, shrugging his shoulders and uttering commonplaces {{as if they were}} poignant originalities. This was Hillel Besso, the eldest son of the Besso of Aleppo, and the intended husband of Eva. Hillel, too, had seen the world, passed a season at Pera, where he had worn the Frank dress, and, introduced into the circles by the lady of the Austrian <b>Internuncio,</b> had found success and enjoyed himself. He had not, however, returned to Syria with any of the disgust shared by the Mesdemoiselles Laurella. Hillel was neither ashamed of his race nor his religion: on the contrary, he was perfectly satisfied with this life, with the family of Besso in general, and with himself particularly. Hillel was a little philosophical, had read Voltaire, and, free from prejudices, conceived himself capable of forming correct opinions. He listened smiling and in silence to Eva asserting the splendour and superiority of their race, and sighing for the restoration of their national glory, and then would say, in a whisper to a friend, and with a glance of epigrammatic airiness, 'For my part, I am not so sure that we were ever better off than we are.' ...|$|E
