Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time.

500|$|Beyoncé crafted most {{songs on}} B'Day through live {{instrumentation}} and diverse techniques. This is evident on [...] "Déjà Vu", which utilizes bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, horns and the 808 drum; it also features rap vocals by Jay-Z. In {{an interview with}} MTV, Beyoncé said, [...] "When I recorded 'Déjà Vu' [...] I knew that even before I started working on my album, I wanted to add live instruments to all of my songs..." [...] The album's second single [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] is noted {{for the use of}} a siren in its melody. It was called a song that [...] "shows a harder edge to Beyoncé'ss sound". [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is a crescendo that uses a two-note riff and galloping beats. The song [...] "advises women who have partners with straying eyes to put on sexy dresses and grind on other guys in the club to regain their affections." [...] Meanwhile, the use of the [...] "uh-huh <b>huh</b> huh" [...] vocals and brassy stabs in the song [...] "Green Light" [...] is a direct echo to [...] "Crazy in Love", according to Peter Robinson of The Guardian.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} general acclaim from critics. Manny Faces from BirthPlace {{cited the}} song as an improvement from her previous material, writing [...] "It’s a little harder, {{a little less}} sloppy {{and a little more}} promising than some of her previous efforts, many of which have drowned in sonic experimentation that, in some opinions (mine), haven’t done her any favors". A writer for PAPER hailed the track as [...] " [...] first 2013 party jam", adding that the song [...] "will jolt you awake this Wednesday morning more quickly than that venti coffee you've been nursing since 9 am". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen gave [...] "BBD" [...] three-and-a-half stars out of five, describing the song as [...] "a typically fleet, flashy collection of disses and boasts that glory in estrogen power, Sapphic delights, and the fun of cuckolding stupid dudes". Spin writer Marc Hogan thought that the track reflected well on Banks' sense of style, writing [...] "With the squiggly high-end and wobbly sub-bass of what we’re really calling trap-rave now, <b>huh,</b> plus some masterfully timed quiet-loud dynamic shifts, the track displays the virtuosically foul-mouthed rapper’s usual immaculately stylish beat selection".|$|E
500|$|... "Baby Don't Lie" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco, and Noel Zancanella, with Tedder and Blanco also serving as the song's producers. It is a midtempo electropop and reggae-pop song which begins with Stefani announcing, [...] "Uh <b>huh,</b> here we go," [...] to a rubbery bass line and hand claps. The song also has a hip hop-inflected breakdown, in which Stefani raps, [...] "You can tell me what you're hidin' boy/And {{you can tell me}} if I'm gettin' warm". Lyrically, the song {{discusses}} insecurities in a relationship, where Stefani questions her man's love. Nolan Feeney of Time complimented that the song is [...] "about falling in love with someone who's got a few skeletons in their closet." [...] As noted by Spins Brennan Carley, [...] "Stefani sounds shattered as she sings, [...] "But there's something behind those eyes / Those eyes / That you can't that you can't disguise / Disguise." [...] In the [...] "stomping, infuriatingly catchy" [...] chorus she sings, [...] "Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie…/I don't want to cry no longer." [...] Melodically, [...] "Baby don't Lie" [...] is written in the key of B♭ minor, performed in a common time moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute and follows the sequence B♭m - G♭ - D♭ as its chord progression. Stefani's voice spans two octaves from the lowest note A♭3 to the highest note A♭5.|$|E
500|$|During {{her first}} {{performance}} since the Uh <b>Huh</b> Her tour at the Hay Festival of Literature & Arts on 26 May 2006, Harvey revealed that her next studio album {{would be almost}} entirely piano-based. Following the October release of The Peel Sessions 1991–2004, a compilation of songs recorded from 1991 to 2000 during her radio sessions with John Peel, she began recording her seventh studio album White Chalk in November, together with Flood, John Parish, and Eric Drew Feldman in a studio in West London. White Chalk was released in September 2007 and marked {{a radical departure from}} her usual alternative rock style, consisting mainly of piano ballads. The album received favourable reviews, its style being described by one critic as containing [...] "pseudo-Victorian elements—drama, restraint, and antiquated instruments and sounds." [...] Harvey herself said of the album: [...] "when I listen to the record I feel in a different universe, really, and I'm not sure whether it's in the past or in the future. The record confuses me, that's what I like—it doesn't feel of this time right now, but I'm not sure whether it's 100 years ago or 100 years in the future", summing up the album's sound as [...] "really weird." [...] During the tour for the album Harvey performed without a backing band, and also began performing on an autoharp, which continues to be her primary instrument after guitar and has influenced her material since White Chalk.|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to {{be as simple as}} it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of the}} situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, <b>huh?</b> Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Green Light" [...] is an R-funk song {{performed}} with [...] "vivace" [...] tempo. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, {{the song is}} written in the key of A minor with a moderate groove of 132 beats per minute. The chord follows the Fm-G♭ key series with an occasional shift to additional B♭m7. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of C4 to F5. The song is built on a ripping bassline and features [...] "a more organic" [...] beat. Green Light" [...] features [...] "uh-huh <b>huh</b> huh" [...] vocals and uses brassy stabs which a reviewer from Guardian Unlimited {{found to be a}} [...] "direct echo to 'Crazy in Love'." [...] According to The London Paper, the [...] "uh-oh-oh-oh-oh" [...] vocals in [...] "Green Light" [...] is an [...] "imitation of Amerie's performance" [...] in her 2005 single [...] "1 Thing". [...] "Green Light" [...] also displays Latin percussion as well as sampled soul horns, and uses a fairly aggressive tone. Conforming to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "Green Light" [...] is a break-up song in which the female protagonist gives her love interest the permission to move out. This is shown in the lines of the hook: [...] "Go! Go!" [...] The lyrics are constructed in the traditional verse-chorus form. The song starts with an intro in which Beyoncé sings, [...] "Give it to mama". Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music commented that [...] "Green Light" [...] seems to be all [...] "slink and minimalism before a surging come-on of a chorus." [...] It follows the verse-chorus-verse-verse-chorus pattern giving way to the bridge. Beyoncé repeats the chorus, ending the song.|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh <b>huh.</b> OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E

Jordan biographer David Halberstam said that Jordan and Pippen [...] "seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta", and that [...] "in the end, {{it was as if they}} had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause."

2500|$|Though {{the closest}} of confidants, Beavis and Butt-Head have a jaded, violent, {{and at times}} {{borderline}} sadistic relationship. Butt-Head often insults and physically abuses Beavis (usually by slapping him, sometimes accompanied by a request to [...] "Settle down, Beavis!" [...] if Butt-Head feels his friend is getting a bit too hyperactive, as he often does). On occasion, Beavis will fight back or stand up for himself (“Madame Blavatsky”, “They're Coming to Take Me Away, <b>Huh</b> Huh”). His favorite means of retribution is kicking Butt-Head in the testicles. On at least one occasion, Beavis throws the first punch. In [...] "Canoe", he initiates a fight by smacking Butt-Head across {{the head with a}} paddle (although Butt-Head goaded him into doing it). Butt-Head usually knows when Beavis is approaching his breaking point and will back off (as seen when he calls Beavis [...] "Buttknocker" [...] or insults Metallica one too many times). In [...] "Choke", he specifically states that Butt-Head is [...] "not really my friend". Nevertheless, it can be inferred that the duo are still best friends, considering their shared activities, residency, interests, and their lack of any other friends. The two usually complement each other when one makes any sort of endeavor, especially if it involves their lifelong goal to 'score with chicks'.|$|E
