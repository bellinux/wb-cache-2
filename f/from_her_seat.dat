25|$|Indira Gandhi {{took this}} extreme step {{due to a}} host of reasons. The venerated Gandhian leader Jaya Prakash Narayan's {{agitation}} in Bihar for change in provincial government, was getting increasingly against the Central Government. More immediate reason for clamping of emergency was that in a judgment dated 12 June 1975, Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha of the Allahabad High Court held that Mrs. Gandhi was guilty on the charge of misuse of government machinery for her election campaign. The case was filed by Raj Narain, who had been recently defeated in the parliamentary election by Indira Gandhi. The court declared her election null and void and unseated her <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> in Lok Sabha. The court also banned her from contesting any election for an additional six years.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 1995, a 14-year-old girl fell <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> on the coaster and died. The park owner at the time, Hunt-Midwest Entertainment Inc., {{and ride}} manufacturer, Dinn Corporation, {{said she was}} {{switching}} seats when the accident occurred. A riding companion claimed that safety restraints (a lap bar and seat belt) had come undone on a sharp turn {{at the top of}} one of the ride's hills. But, Worlds of Fun officials claimed that witnesses had seen her remove her restraints and tried to switch seats and that there had been no malfunction, though her family disputed this. The ride was temporarily closed pending an investigation of its safety features, which resulted in new lap bar installations. Hunt-Midwest Entertainment Inc. and Dinn Corporation settled with the family for $200,000. This makes the Timber Wolf the only ride so far at Worlds of Fun with a fatality.|$|E

500|$|Schiff, at {{the time}} working as a {{teaching}} assistant in the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs {{on his way to}} earning a master's degree in urban planning, took a leave of absence to run for a seat on the Minneapolis City Council against Michael Guest and Kathy Thurber in 2001. He won unanimous DFL endorsement on September 11, 2001 and, in a race that was overshadowed by the 2001 terrorist attacks, he ran against Lucky Rosenbloom, an African-American Republican. Schiff received the endorsement of the Star Tribune, which noted his [...] "first-hand knowledge" [...] of light rail systems in other U.S. cities. Elected by a large majority in November 2001, Schiff became one of seven newly elected members on the 13-member city council, joining two Green Party members, two other openly gay council members, one African-American council member, and four women. He was sworn into office on December 17, 2001, earlier than his fellow councilmembers, when Thurber resigned <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> to assume the position of deputy director of Perpich Center for Arts Education.|$|E
500|$|On April 1, 2009, {{both the}} {{acoustic}} and normal version of [...] "Poker Face" [...] was performed live on Fox's American Idol. The performance started with Gaga {{sitting at a}} Plexiglass piano filled with bubbles and bathed in pink light. She started singing the second verse of [...] "Poker Face" [...] in a Bette Midler style accompanied by a violin player while wearing a shiny aluminum shoulder pad and platinum bleached blond wig. After the first chorus, the pace increased whence the original intro for the song started. Gaga got up <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> and proceeded to perform the song {{in the middle of}} the stage. She wore a silvery leotard with a giant star on her shoulder and tassels. As the song progressed to the intermediate verse, the violinist played a hoe-down version of the music and Gaga danced around frantically over the stage. The performance ended with Gaga staring towards the audience while revealing an open zipper, patched over her left eye. The performance was described an [...] "alien-disco performance art." [...] Cortney Harding of Billboard wrote, [...] " [...] Gaga's crowning TV moment ... show middle America that she was a bona fide pop star." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Voices Carry" [...] was {{directed}} by D.J. Webster, and filmed at Dorchester's Strand Theater, Davio's Restaurant, and W. Brookline St in Boston. The clip incorporates dialogue and acting, and resembles a mini-movie. The plot centers on the band's lead singer, Aimee Mann, who appears as a musician with an abusive boyfriend, played by actor Cully Holland. He mistreats her for playing in a rock band, and demands that she change her look to fit in his upper-class lifestyle. The video uses spoken dialogue in between to interrupt the musical parts, including Mann's boyfriend demanding: [...] "Why can't you for once do something for me?". At the end, the couple attend a concert at Carnegie Hall where the boyfriend is angered to notice part of Mann's rattail sticking {{out from under her}} cap. At her breaking point, Mann lashes out at him, jumping up <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> in the audience and yelling the lyrics—"He said, shut up! He said, shut up! Oh God, can't you keep it down?..."—as she removes her cap to reveal her spiky, rat-tailed hair, while the boyfriend now hides his face in embarrassment {{and the rest of the}} audience watches in shock.|$|E

500|$|The Sihanaka {{traditionally}} {{believed that}} death was always {{associated with a}} contagion that could be passed to {{family members of the}} deceased. [...] This belief is reflected in traditional funeral rites. [...] A second door to the family home was used uniquely for carrying out the body of the deceased. [...] Before the body was removed, the widow of the deceased would dress in a fine red lamba and put on all her jewelery, then watch the procession <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> at the main entryway to her house. The villagers carried the body to a house where the village women would gather, and the female family members would weep while the other women would play drums and recite prayers. The men would stay in a separate house (called the tranolahy, or [...] "men's house") where they would prepare a feast of cooked meat and rum, which they would periodically deliver to the women mourners. Occasionally a selected man would circle the house and sing a funeral chant, with the women inside interjecting in call-and-response. [...] After the feast, a community leader would dip his finger in melted fat and touch those who had assisted in the funeral, to protect them against illness and from being followed by malevolent spirits.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1915 PanamaPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, Coolbrith was named President of the Congress of Authors and Journalists. In this position she sent more than 4,000 letters to the world's most well-known writers and journalists. At the Exposition itself on June 30, Coolbrith was lauded by Senator James D. Phelan who said that her early associate Bret Harte called her the [...] "sweetest note in California literature." [...] Phelan continued, [...] "she has written little, but that little is great. It is of the purest quality, finished and perfect, as well as full of feeling and thought." [...] The Overland Monthly reported that [...] "eyes were wet throughout the large audience" [...] when Coolbrith was crowned with a laurel wreath by Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President of the University of California, who called her the [...] "loved, laurel-crowned poet of California." [...] After several more speeches were made in her honor, and bouquets brought in abundance to the podium, Coolbrith, wearing a black robe with a sash bearing a garland of bright orange California poppies, addressed the crowd, saying, [...] "There is one woman here with whom I want to share these honors: Josephine Clifford McCracken. For we are linked together, the last two living members of Bret Harte's staff of Overland writers." [...] McCracken was then ushered up <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> in the audience to join Coolbrith. Coolbrith's official status as California Poet Laureate was confirmed in 1919 as the [...] "Loved Laurel Crowned Poet of California" [...] by the California State Senate with no financial support attached.|$|E

When Amurao was {{asked if she could}} identify the killer of her fellow students, Amurao rose <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat</b> in the witness box, walked directly in front of Speck and pointed her finger at him, nearly touching him, and said, [...] "This is the man." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{connection}} to Blake's later mythology {{is found in}} The Vales of Har, which are mentioned in The Book of Thel (1789). It is in the Vales where lives Thel herself, and throughout the poem they are represented {{as a place of}} purity and innocence; [...] "I walk through the vales of Har. and smell the sweetest flowers" [...] (3:18). At the end of the poem, when Thel is shown the world of experience outside the Vales, she panics and flees back to the safety of her home; [...] "The Virgin started <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat,</b> & with a shriek./Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har" [...] (6:21-22).|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from its}} {{fund-raising}} function, {{the spectacle of}} Bethlem offered moral instruction for visiting strangers. For the [...] "educated" [...] observer Bedlam's theatre of the disturbed might operate as a cautionary tale providing a deterrent example {{of the dangers of}} immorality and vice. The mad on display functioned as a moral exemplum of what might happen if the passions and appetites were allowed to dethrone reason. As one mid-eighteenth-century correspondent commented: [...] " [...] better lesson [...] be taught us in any part of the globe than in this school of misery. Here we may see the mighty reasoners of the earth, below even the insects that crawl upon it; and from so humbling a sight we may learn to moderate our pride, and to keep those passions within bounds, which if too much indulged, would drive reason <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>seat,</b> and level us with the wretches of this unhappy mansion".|$|E
