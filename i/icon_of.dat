5|$|An <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> Saints Marina and Jovan Vladimir, dated 1711, {{is part of}} the iconostasis of the Monastery of StNaum near Ohrid {{in western}} Macedonia. The icon's {{position}} on the iconostasis indicates that Vladimir was an important figure of local veneration. He was often depicted in the company of Saints Clement and Naum in Macedonian churches. A number of 18th-century painters from central and southern Albania painted the saint in churches of the region, especially in the area of Moscopole. A portable <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> the saint was created in 1739 at the Ardenica Monastery in southwestern Albania. It depicts him seated on a throne, surrounded by twelve panels showing scenes of his life and miracles. Saint Jovan Vladimir is represented on frescos in three monasteries of Mount Athos: Hilandar, Zograf, and Philotheou; and three Bulgarian monasteries: Rila, Troyan, and Lozen.|$|E

5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is one of}} {{the four}} most devotionally revered Tirthankaras, along with Mahavira, Parshvanatha and Neminatha.

Mount Shatrunjaya, for example, is a hilly part of southern Gujarat, which {{is believed to have been}} a place where 23 out of 24 Tirthankaras preached, along with Rishabha. Numerous monks are believed to have attained their liberation from cycles of rebirth there, and a large temple within the complex is dedicated to Rishabha commemorating his enlightenment in Ayodhya. The central Rishabha <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> this complex is called Adinatha or simply Dada (grandfather). This icon is the most revered of all the murtipujaka icons, believed by some in the Jain tradition to have miracle making powers, according to John Cort. In Jain texts, Kunti and the five Pandava brothers of the Hindu Epic Mahabharata came to the hill top to pay respects, and consecrated an <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> Rishabha at Shatrunjaya.|$|E

5|$|Simeon {{turned the}} new Bulgarian capital Preslav into a {{magnificent}} {{religious and cultural}} centre, intended more as a display of his realm's heyday and as a royal residence than as a military fortress.

The development of Bulgarian art in the period is demonstrated by a ceramic <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> Theodore Stratelates and the Preslav-style illustrated ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{also found}} fault with Symeon for revering his spiritual father, Symeon the Studite.

Every year the younger Symeon arranged a celebration honoring his teacher, which included an <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> Symeon the Studite and a service to him. Stephen rebuked Symeon for honoring his teacher as a saint, because in his opinion the Studite was not worth of any honor. The conflict between the two lasted for six years.|$|E
