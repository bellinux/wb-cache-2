50|$|An {{example of}} the legal {{operation}} of the right {{is the case of}} Bart Mos and Joost de Haas, of the Dutch daily De Telegraaf. In an article in January 2006, the two journalists alleged the existence of a leak in the Dutch secret services and quoted from what they claimed was an official dossier on Mink Kok, a notorious criminal. They further alleged that the dossier in question had fallen into the hands of Kok himself. A subsequent police investigation led to the prosecution of Paul H., an agent accused of selling the file in question. Upon motions by the prosecution and the defence, the investigative judge in the case ordered the disclosure of the source for the news story, {{on the grounds that it}} was necessary to safeguard national security and ensure a fair trial for H. The two journalists were subsequently detained for refusing to comply with the <b>disclosure</b> <b>order,</b> but were released on appeal after three days, on November 30. The Hague district court considered that the national security interest served by the order was minor and should not prevail over the protection of sources.|$|E
5000|$|The court {{noted that}} even though they lacked {{interlocutory}} jurisdiction to review the discovery order, a writ of mandamus was still appropriate to prevent the disclosure because of the privacy issues at stake. The court disagreed with the SEC's interpretation of the United States v. Miller ruling, citing {{the fact that in}} the present case, the privacy rights of hundreds of innocent individuals was at risk if the wiretaps were forced to be disclosed—in contrast to United States v. Miller, where the tapes had already been played at trial and consequently, the only issue at stake was the protection against unlawful interception. The court noted that in the present case, [...] "the cat is not yet out of the bag" [...] and a writ was appropriate if the <b>disclosure</b> <b>order</b> was deemed erroneous, since no alternative remedies would be available to the defendants (in particular, an appeal of the ruling after the case would not adequately vindicate the privacy violations). The court explicitly limited the scope of their finding to the present facts, noting that the ruling [...] "does not mean that a writ of mandamus will always be appropriate to remedy an erroneous disclosure order".|$|E

This comments suggests three criteria through which the litigant must persuade the court that the state’s interest outweighs the first amendment interest. The test suggested by this comment should increase protection for the first amendment interest by decreasing the number of disclosure orders issued and by giving journalists and their confidential sources a basis for predicting in advance of publication whether a <b>disclosure</b> <b>order</b> is likely.

This article will argue that the Patriot Act 2 ̆ 7 s anti-money laundering scope was excessively narrow in that the Act did not address existing inadequacies under federal law in the area of grand jury investigations of transnational money laundering offenses. In order to enhance the efficacy of such investigations, Congress should take three steps: first, Congress should confer to federal courts the authority to compel transnational banks to disclose records subpoenaed pursuant to money laundering investigations in instances where the bank maintains branches on U. S. soil, but the subpoenaed document is located at a branch of the bank outside the United States. Second, Congress should provide stringent penalties for transnational banks that attempt to defy such disclosure orders on the ground that the <b>disclosure</b> <b>order</b> would conflict with a foreign jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s bank secrecy law. Third, Congress should empower district courts to prevent U. S. residents from suing in foreign courts to enjoin overseas banks from disclosing such U. S. residents 2 ̆ 7 bank records...|$|E
40|$|The federal circuit {{courts of}} appeals have {{generally}} recognized that a party suffers real hardship when {{the district court}} erroneously orders it to disclose privileged information. Review of the <b>disclosure</b> <b>order</b> after final judgment is usually an insufficient remedy; once the information has been disclosed, it can never again be fully confidential. Consequently, the courts have struggled to provide a mechanism by which such orders can be immediately appealed. However, privilege orders presenting novel questions of law or issues of first impression do not clearly fit within the doctrinal requirements {{of the most common}} methods of interlocutory review. Appellate courts have therefore applied varying exceptions or extensions to those requirements in an effort to encompass such privilege orders within them. This Article proposes a two-tiered system of review to remedy the harm caused by erroneous disclosure orders without stretching the current system of interlocutory review so far that the benefits of the final judgment rule vanish. The Article recommends that review begin in the district court with a motion to certify a discretionary appeal under 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (b), which requires a district court to certify an order that 2 ̆ 7 involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, 2 ̆ 7 if 2 ̆ 7 an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. 2 ̆ 7 If a district court refuses to certify an order even though it clearly satisfies the requirements of § 1292 (b), then the appellate court should exercise its mandamus power to review the case. This two-tiered system of review would provide a consistent mechanism by which the most difficult and important privilege orders could be immediately reviewed, but would not impose too heavy a burden on the already-crowded appellate dockets. On January 26, 2009, the Supreme Court granted a writ certiorari in Mohawk Industries v. Carpenter, 08 - 676.

50|$|The 1974 House of Lords {{ruling in}} Norwich Pharmacal Co. v Customs and Excise Commissioners {{established}} {{what is known}} as the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction, which allows UK courts to grant <b>disclosure</b> <b>orders,</b> known as Norwich Pharmacal orders, against innocent third parties which have been mixed up in wrongdoing.
