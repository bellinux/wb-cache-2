2500|$|In 1964, the founder's second son, Konrad Auwärter, {{developed}} a <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> {{design for a}} service bus {{as part of his}} dissertation. [...] The 'Do-Bus' design had low weight, and could carry over 100 passengers. It also featured a low-frame front axle with forward-mounted steering gear that permitted a low flat floor. The double-deck principle was applied to the coach design, creating a high-capacity comfortable touring vehicle. This vehicle was known as the Skyliner.|$|E
2500|$|The {{formation}} of British Leyland in 1968 saw rivals Daimler and Bristol merge with Leyland, bringing the two competing rear-engined chassis (Daimler Fleetline and Bristol VR) {{together with the}} Atlantean. Though the Bristol brand was retained, Daimler was dropped and products were re-badged as Leylands. After the re-organisation, Leyland set out {{to develop a new}} rear-engined <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> for the London market to replace the troublesome Fleetlines. [...] This new vehicle, the Titan B15 spawned a simpler, non-integral offshoot, the Olympian, which debuted in 1980. Though the Olympian was meant as a direct replacement for the VR, Fleetline and Atlantean, the venerable AN68 continued in production alongside the Olympian until 1986. The last Atlantean for the domestic market rolled off the production line in 1984, the last of a batch for Merseyside PTE, while the export version remained in production for a further two years, with deliveries to the city operator in Baghdad, Iraq.|$|E

Alexander Dennis engineered and tested the bus, and it was built and marketed by New Flyer under contract. During the partnership around 200 buses were delivered to 22 operators in Canada and US. In May 2017, New Flyer and Alexander Dennis announced their joint-venture would end and production of the bus would transition to Alexander Dennis' new North American factory in Indiana where it will be produced alongside the <b>double-deck</b> Enviro500 series <b>bus.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{maximum number}} of seat rows can be {{identified}} by the type designation. In the first Setra series, the number of seats was alone. In the second series (series 100), a 0 or 5 was affiixed, one of the numbers preceded {{in each of the}} following series (series 200, 300 and 400). Example: S 8 (= 8 seat rows), S 140 (= 14 seat rows), S 215 (= 15 seat rows), S 417 (= 17 seat rows) or S 319 UL (= 19 seat rows). The seats are reduced by comforter buildings or a certain star classification; The type designation is retained. Starting from the series 200, additions after the number indicated the equipment: current (series 400/500) are H for high-floor construction (no wheel arches in the passenger compartment), HD for high floor, HDH for extra-high floor, DT for <b>double-deck</b> touring <b>bus,</b> MD for mid-height floor (a spinoff of the GT series), UL for interurban commuter buses and NF for low-floor buses. In the past, the Grand Tourisme (GT), HDS for double-deck, SL for city buses and NR (low-floor Rational) were used for the first highway low-floor (200 series). Only a few types were given different designations, for example the S 250 Special (a modified S 215 HD which was also offered as an entry-level model after the introduction of the 300 series) and the S 300 NC (a former low-floor city bus as a predecessor of the Mercedes-Benz Citaro).|$|R
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Sud Aviation Caravelle rendered the Provence obsolete as a passenger aircraft. The Caravelle was faster, more comfortable and had a greater range. In 1958, Breguet borrowed F-BASQ from Air France for a sales tour to North and South America. This was the aircraft which had force-landed at Pont-Évêque in 1955. The tour covered , and took in the cities of New York, Washington, D.C. and Miami in the United States, Bogotá in Colombia, Santiago in Chile, Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia in Brazil. The tour failed to generate any orders. In North America, the jet age had begun, while the aircraft had too great a capacity for operators in South America, despite being cheaper on a cost-per-seat to operate than a Douglas DC-4. The Provence was used on fewer and fewer passenger services, being replaced by the Caravelle and Vickers Viscount. Six aircraft were transferred to the Armée de l'Air. Air France converted the six remaining Br.763s into freighters with the name Universel. These remained in service on European freight services until the early 1970s. The final flight was on 31 March 1971 from Heathrow to Paris-Orly. A <b>double-deck</b> AEC Routemaster <b>bus</b> was parked alongside the aircraft to mark the retirement of the Br.763 from service.|$|R

5000|$|During the 1970s, CIÉ's long-standing {{relationship}} with Leyland became strained, and in 1977 the company decided upon a standard [...] "family" [...] for its {{next generation of}} buses and coaches. It thus contacted FFG (Fahrzeugwerkstätten Falkenried GmbH) of Hamburg, Germany, which built six prototype vehicles: a 45-seat coach, a 72-seat <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus,</b> a 35-seat citybus, two 47-seat rural/school buses and a wheelchair-accessible midibus.|$|E
50|$|Birkenhead's first livery on trams {{and buses}} was maroon and cream {{with a white}} roof, but in 1934 Birkenhead's famous blue and cream livery was applied to a new AEC Q-type <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus.</b> It {{was the only one}} of its type {{operated}} by the Corporation but the blue and cream livery was applied to all future delivered buses with Birkenhead Corporation Motors applied in gold on the lower cream band.|$|E
50|$|The {{first of}} Rackham's new T-Type Leylands was, importantly, the <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus.</b> This was the Titan TD1 (mythological names for double-decks and animal names for single-deckers and lorries grew to be a Leyland tradition); {{it was a}} masterly {{synthesis}} of worldwide best practice in design. It and the single deck Tiger TS1 equivalent were announced at the London Olympia Motor Show of 1927 after an intense development period.|$|E
50|$|Atkinson's {{management}} {{then decided}} that although Daimler and Guy were publicly offering Gardner-engined double-deckers, and some influential (mainly Scottish) customers could purchase AEC Regents with that make of engine, {{they would also}} enter this market. Thus at the 1954 Earls' Court Commercial Motor Show two Atkinson double-deck buses were exhibited: one was a chassis, the other carried a 60-seat centre-entrance double-deck body by Northern Counties {{to the order of}} the Stalybridge, Hyde, Mossley and Dukinfield Joint Transport (and Electricity) Board. This bus (UMA370) is preserved by the Greater Manchester Transport Museum and is also of interest as the first <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> with an electrically controlled direct-acting epicyclic gearbox, this Self-Changing Gears (SCG) unit was fitted by Atkinson after delivery but before entry into service as the SHMD board's drivers (who were used to pre-selective transmissions on the fleets' standard Daimlers) did not want to use the originally installed David Brown constant-mesh unit. The un-bodied exhibition chassis, which featured semi-automatic transmission, was dismantled around the same time. No further Atkinson <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> chassis were built.|$|E
50|$|A lowbridge <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> is a {{double-decker}} bus {{which has an}} asymmetric interior layout, enabling the overall height of the vehicle to be reduced {{compared to that of}} a conventional {{double-decker bus}}. The upper deck gangway is offset {{to one side of the}} vehicle, normally the offside (or driver's side), and is sunken into the lower deck passenger saloon. Low railway bridges and overpasses were the main reason that a reduced height was desired.|$|E
50|$|The bus {{operations}} were divested as a management buy-out to form Leyland Bus, and was subsequently bought by Volvo Buses in 1988, which discontinued {{most of its}} product range but adopted the Leyland Olympian, re-engineering it as the first named Volvo Bus model, the Volvo Olympian aside from minor frame changes the major alterations were the fitment of Volvo axles, braking system and controls. Both were the best selling <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> chassis of their time.|$|E
50|$|Worcestershire bus route 144 is a {{bus service}} {{connecting}} {{the cities of}} Birmingham and Worcester, operated by First Midland Red. The route {{was one of the}} longest-running <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> operated routes, though it is now more common for single decked buses to be used. The original routing of the 144 was from Birmingham to Malvern via Bromsgrove and Worcester, though the Worcester to Malvern section now forms part of the 44 route.|$|E

50|$|Despite G J Rackham's scepticism {{about the}} three-axle <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus,</b> Leyland built a {{derivative}} of the Titan to cater for this market and named the Titanic. Unlike the rather short-lived Karrier and Guy six-wheelers, {{but like the}} slightly later AEC Renown, it had an inter-axle differential to obviate drive-line wind-up. It sold only in limited numbers from 1927 to 1939. Many of its features were shared with the Titan and the rest with the standard three-axle Leyland trolleybus line.|$|E
50|$|To {{keep up with}} {{competitors}} such as Corgi and Dinky, Lone Star began producing Corgi-sized diecast {{toy vehicles}} in 1956 with its Road-Master series (later spelled without the hyphen, see Ragan 2000, p. 34, also Johnson 1998, p. 118). Castings on the earlier vehicles, though handsome, were a bit cruder than the competition. For example, the <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> shown above has its casting line, for its two halves, right down {{the centre of the}} roof. Also, most earlier Lone Stars have simpler bumper, grille and body detail than Corgi or Dinky. The later Impy series, however, outdid Matchbox by a long shot.|$|E
50|$|The THS owns {{a number}} of trams {{formerly}} operated in Christchurch, Dunedin, and Invercargill. It also owns {{a number of}} buses and trolley buses from Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin along with an AEC Regent MkIII <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus,</b> London Transport RT3132, which was brought to New Zealand in 1974 to support the British Commonwealth Games team, and was purchased {{following the end of}} the games {{with the help of a}} generous donation from the Farmers department store chain. The Society also leases Brisbane tram No. 236 from the Wellington Tramway Museum, and has done so since 1975.|$|E
50|$|Changes in {{government}} policy in 1965 allowed the Leyland Motor Corporation {{to buy some}} shares in BCV and ECW so that their products could once again be sold to independent operators. The last new chassis to carry a Bristol badge was a VRT/SL <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> built in 1981. For a while the factory continued to build buses with Leyland badges, notably the Olympian which had been designed by the staff at Brislington. All work ended in October 1983 when the final Bristol-built Olympian chassis was sent to ECW to receive its body for Devon General (where it was registered A686 KDV). Work was then transferred to other Leyland factories.|$|E
50|$|The coachbuilding {{business}} {{continued to}} flourish and expansion was rapid. In 1969, the company bought out Potters, a bodybuilder in Northern Ireland, {{and set up}} a subsidiary Walter Alexander & Co (Belfast) Limited, and within six years started selling buses to the Far East. In 1981 the company was awarded the Queen's Award for Export. By 1983, the company was the largest supplier of <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> bodies in the world, and a year later it won a British Rail contract to construct 25 Class 143 carriages. In 1987, Walter Alexander became a publicly listed company, having previously been a private firm run by the Alexander family.|$|E
50|$|The {{point of}} its design and {{introduction}} was {{to end the}} uncomfortable and inconvenient Lowbridge <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> layout, replacing it by lowering the chassis frame and integrating it with the body, and fitting a drop-centre rear axle, so {{that there were no}} steps from the rear entrance platform {{to the front of the}} passenger gangway, itself sunk about 10 cm (6 inches) below the seating platforms on the LDX, LD and first five LDLs. A full flat floor was developed on the last LDL, then used on the LDS and the F series Lodekkas. Bristol Commercial Vehicles, Eastern Coach Works and some of their employees obtained a number of patents relating to the design.|$|E
50|$|During 1925-26 Guy Motors and Karrier, the motor-vehicle {{subsidiary}} of the Clayton Engineering company of Huddersfield, promoted the six-wheel <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> {{as the answer to}} those seeking to replace the double-deck tram. Unlike the Leviathan or the NS they ran as standard on pneumatic tyres, with two such at the end of all three axles, and at up to 30 ft long, where local construction regulations permitted (there were none nationally at the time; rules were set by local councils, watch-committees or, in London, the Metropolitan Police) passenger capacity could equal or exceed that of double-deck trams. Other builders, AEC in particular (at the time in a collaboration deal with Daimler Company), followed suit, getting the drawing offices to stretch existing buses into three-axle versions.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all other}} coachbuilders, Burlingham had a bulging order book {{at the end}} of the War, many {{operators}} having placed orders for completion as soon as peacetime conditions applied. The first post-war coach was completed in January 1946 and was very similar to the 1939 design, but featured an extra window pillar in each body side. Burlingham was justifiably cautious. as adequately seasoned timber for framing was very hard to obtain at the time. During 1946, a standard single-deck and <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> body was introduced. The double-decker was basically the Ribble-type pre-war outline, whilst the single-decker could be best described as the utility frame re-clothed with traditional refinements such as compound curvature on front and rear domes and outswept skirt panels. Output of all three types was large, with many operators, such as Ribble and Walter Alexander, not only buying new chassis (for which a substantial waiting list had built up) but also sending pre-war vehicles to Burlingham for new bodies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} of British Leyland in 1968 saw rivals Daimler and Bristol merge with Leyland, bringing the two competing rear-engined chassis (Daimler Fleetline and Bristol VR) {{together with the}} Atlantean.

5000|$|Leyland, in particular, thought differently, {{and with}} the Lion {{becoming}} the best-selling single deck bus and coach in Britain - the [...] "long Lion" [...] from early 1926 proving particularly successful - almost 3,000 Lions and Lionesses (which differed only in driving position) sold {{by the end of}} the L-series three-year run, returning Leyland to profitability after catastrophic losses in the early 1920s. Leyland's chairman Henry Spurrier (the second) decided to recruit design talent to give Leyland not just a temporary advantage but long-term technical and sales supremacy. He appointed G.J. [...] "John" [...] Rackham in the summer of 1926 as Leyland's chief engineer and commissioned from him a complete new product range, to start with a new <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus.</b> He did this because AEC now had enough capacity to offer their 420-series double-decker (similar to the NS but with a more conventional sliding-mesh gearbox) on general sale, which with AEC's ability to loss-lead on price given its large guaranteed London orders would spell the death of the Leviathan and also because of the threat from the promoters of big six-wheelers.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} event in Southampton happened in 1964 with {{the elevation of}} Southampton to City status, therefore changing the previous 'Southampton Corporation Transport' title to 'City of Southampton', with the formal date of change being 11 February 1964. The two original open top buses were now due for retirement and were replaced with two converted Guy Arab vehicles from the 1949 batch. Also the Transport Committee decided that all new buses would be A.E.C. chassis fitted with East Lancashire bodies. In 1966, bigger buses that could provide higher passenger capacities were needed and a prototype entered service in early 1966; this being a 30 feet long <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus.</b> The prototype {{proved to be a}} success and so was followed by a further seven buses and another 20 in 1967. These would be the last rear entrance double deckers to be bought by Southampton. Later in 1967 another prototype was introduced; this being an A.E.C. Swift, which was a high capacity single decker and was trailed on Woolston routes as a replacement to the Standees, which were due for retirement. The chassis were made by A.E.C. and were 36 feet long. It also had a local body, a Pacemaster built by Strachans of Hamble. Five similar buses were delivered in 1968. All of these buses were one-man operation.|$|E
5000|$|Leyland Motors {{already had}} its own coachworks {{established}} just after the Great War, next to Leyland in the neighbouring parish of Farington. It was on stream by 1921, and most Lions and many Lionesses had been bodied there; a pre-Rackham feature was that Leyland Motors would also license the designs to other coachworks, but would take to law those building [...] "pirated" [...] Leyland designs. A significant difference between these forerunners and the body for the Titan {{is that it was}} patented. It was the first lowbridge <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> body {{and as a result of}} the offset upper-deck gangway with four-abreast seating to the nearside the Titan could carry 48 or more seated passengers and yet within a 25 ft long body have an overall height of less than 13 feet 1 inch, with a covered top - a height about 2 ft less than the Leviathan or the NS. A Titan on pneumatic tyres, with the standard Leyland body, weighed less than 5⅝ tonnes unladen. This meant that as standard a Titan could carry pneumatic tyres of the same type proven with Lions and other competitive single-deckers. Pneumatic tyres on a heavy vehicle at the time meant it could legally travel at 20 mph rather than 12 mph for solids. Not only was height and weight less than competing six-wheelers, so was price.|$|E
5000|$|PD1/3: In Autumn 1946, the Construction and Use {{regulations}} were revised, allowing a maximum width for buses of 8', {{rather than the}} previous 7'6" [...] inches, provided the Traffic Commissioners approved the use of wider buses on routes, {{in the same way}} as they already had the power to approve double-deck buses on a route-by-route basis. Also, the gross vehicle weight for a <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> was increased to 12 tons, from the wartime figure of 11 tons. The PD1/3 differed from the PD1 in that it had wider axles, being designed for the 8-foot width. Oldham Corporation quickly obtained clearance for all their routes and in 1947 DBU244 with Charles H. Roe H31/25R body became the first 8-foot-wide motorbus built for service in the UK. Oldham took in total 50 similar buses in 1947/8. Manchester Corporation were also early customers for the wider bus, following up their initial 1946 batch of fifty PD1s with a 1947/8 order for 100 PD1/3 with 58-seat (H32/26R) bodies to their standard outline by Metro-Cammell. During 1948 Ribble Motor Services, who had obtained permission to use full-width double-deck coaches on their express services from East Lancashire to Blackpool, received 30 such bodies by H. V. Burlingham of Blackpool, which had full-width cabs, electrically powered folding doors to the rear platform, which itself was built-up to saloon level, allowing a small luggage boot. The body design, with additional luggage stowage over the rear wheel arches, had generously radiussed windows, two sunroofs on the upper deck and, although of lowbridge layout (the Leyland patent on this expired in 1937), were fitted out to full coach standards for 49 passengers (FCL27/22RD). Liberal use was made of chromium-plated steel trim and they carried the cream coach livery, with red relief, rather than the bus livery of red with cream relief, they soon became famous as the [...] "White Ladies" [...] was so successful that a further twenty similar vehicles on PD2/3 chassis with East Lancashire Coachbuilders bodies, were added in 1951.|$|E

40|$|Public buses play an {{important}} role in public transportation in most parts of the world and it is still the dominant public transportation mode in some regions. Nowadays, as people switch to a mobile lifestyle, they spend significant amount of time on the traveling to work, back and forth. However, not much research has been done on how to provide some on-board service for those commuters in the public bus. This paper presents a Bluetooth-based system which is inexpensive, yet flexible, and scalable to serve commuters in a personalized manner using Bluetooth enabled mobile phones. However, from the Bluetooth specification, one Bluetooth dongle can connect to at most seven other Bluetooth devices. As we expect more than 7 users to use the services provided in the Bluetooth-based system (a full <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> can carry around 100 passengers), we need to work out an effective scheduler to schedule all the private services on the Bluetooth servers in the bus. This paper also describes a scheduling algorithm that exploits the park mode feature of the Bluetooth specification to allow more users to have access to the Bluetooth services on the bus...|$|E
40|$|Directional {{stability}} and passenger comfort are {{of great concern}} {{in the case of}} a <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> subjected to a side wind. Since the shape of the bus to a lar ge extend determines its aerodynamics, a proper design is needed to avoid the co nsequences of a large side force. In this paper, we proposed the use of CFD-base d design with a response surface models to construct the optimum shape for a dou ble-deck bus subjected to a side wind with a $ 30 ^o$ yaw angle. The primary objec tive is to minimize its aerodynamic coefficients by changing the radius and angl e of its front face. The results show that increasing the curvature of the front face increases the side force and the yaw moment coefficients, while the front angle has little influence on the bus aerodynamics. The Pareto-optimal front is constructed to relate two aerodynamic coefficients in the range of the design v ariables. In general, the CFD-based design with the response surface model shows a promising and cheap alternative to the wind tunnel experiments and the tradit ional trial and error method...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} reported in this paper {{was to investigate the}} aerod ynamic response of a <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> in gusty winds using a Detached-Eddy Simula tion (DES). The bus was subjected to three different scenarios of wind gusts: g ust in a wind tunnel, gust in a natural wind and gust behind the exit of a tunne l. The proposed scenarios of gusts are in the time domain and take into account the dynamic behavior of natural winds. The Reynolds number of the flow, based on the time-averaged speed of the side wind and a reference length of squre root of 0. 1 [m], was 1300000. Detailed transient responses of the aerodynamic coe fficients and flow structures were investigated. Good agreement was found betwe en the DES results and the available experimental data. A comparison between the influence of the different gust scenarios on the aerodynamic coefficients shows that the gust behind the exit from a tunnel has a stronger influence on the aer odynamics than the other gust scenarios. Moreover, the influence of the gusts o n the time history of aerodynamics coefficients is found to be limited to the pe riod of the gust...|$|E
40|$|Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES) {{was made}} for the flow around a 1 / 10 model of a <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> of the type Scania K 112 TL.

Detailed flow structures and global quantities such as lift, drag, side force, yaw moment and pressure coefficients were computed. Visualizations of time-averaged and instantaneous flow structures showed that the flow separates on the top and the lee-side faces of the bus. The flow separations on the lee-side face of the bus was found to be unsteady yielding large vortices that shed to the wake flow leaving disturbances on the surface pressure and hence the side force. The flow separation on the top-side face was found to be more stable in the first two third of the bus length. It became unsteady three-dimensional vortex shedding in the last one third of the length of the bus. The flow under the neath of the bus was found to be very complex and was dominated with small vortices shedding from the beams and the wheels of the bus.

40|$|When {{cruising}} {{in strong}} winds, ground vehicles can experience strong aerodynamic forces and moments that may increase drag, reduce their stability, generate noise and induce accidents {{in the case}} of strong side winds. However, prevention of the unwanted influences of side winds requires that the flow structures around vehicles are fully understood in both the instantaneous and time-averaged flow. The main objective of the present work is to acquire an understanding of the side wind flow physics around two types of ground vehicles, trains and buses. In this work, Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to compute the side wind flow around stationary simplified train models. The side wind flow is obtained at three different yaw angles, 30 degree, 35 degree and 90 degree. The LES results show that the flow around high speed trains involves many small structures because of the instabilities of the shear layers that contribute to the time varying values of their aerodynamic forces and moments. The influence of the shape of the train nose on the flow field under side wind conditions is investigated. The LES results show that the shape of the nose determines to a large extent the characteristics of the wake structures and their associated frequencies. During {{the second part of the}} work, Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES) is used to investigate the flow structures around a double deck bus subjected to a 30 degree yaw angle. The influence of gusty winds on the aerodynamics of buses is investigated by making simulations using different proposed wind gust profiles. The influence of the shape of the front of a <b>double-deck</b> <b>bus</b> on its aerodynamics is investigated in CFD simulations using the realizable k-Epsilon RANS model at different designs of the front. The bus is subjected to a 30 degree side wind. For the purpose of shape optimization, the response surface method was used and the optimum shape thereby obtained. The influence of a passive flow control on the boundary layer and heat transfer is investigated by attaching small vortex generators on the surface of a heated, mounted cube. A more turbulent boundary layer is obtained behind the vortex generators and hence an enhancement in the heat transfer coefficient is observed...|$|E
