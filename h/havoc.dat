5|$|According to Pyun, {{the idea}} of Max <b>Havoc</b> has existed since at least 2001. At the time, {{he was asked to}} direct the film in Hawaii. After the September 11 attacks, it was decided that filming in Miami was more {{economically}} viable. Pyun said that Hawaiian film star Mark Dacascos was interested in playing the character of Max <b>Havoc,</b> but that he backed out after anthrax appeared in Florida. Bali was considered next for filming but the idea was abandoned after the terrorist bombing there in 2002. The director and producer settled on filming on Guam, voicing their interest to Guam officials in late 2003. Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon {{was supposed to be the}} first of two films to act as a backdoor pilot into a Max <b>Havoc</b> television series.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's fire balloons. These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause <b>havoc</b> on American soil. Local high school girls made these fire balloons out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used to help these bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} two millennia, locust plagues {{continued}} to appear at irregular intervals with the main recorded outbreaks of the desert and migratory locusts occurring in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.

The Bombay locust (Nomadacris succincta) was a major pest in India and southeastern Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries, but has seldom swarmed since the last plague in 1908.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} coastal Orange County streams, the {{watershed}} of Aliso Creek is now heavily urbanized. With 70percent {{of the original}} land surface now underneath impermeable surfaces such as pavement and buildings, far more runoff now enters the creek—not only inducing an increased year-round flow, but much larger rainy season flows. In the 1920s and 1930s, devastating floods wreaked <b>havoc</b> on much of southern California; the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 was the most famous flooding episode of this period.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to propel while rowed. A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective weapon against galleys, matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable <b>havoc,</b> but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, Neill {{left the}} Alamo, {{determined}} to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies.
