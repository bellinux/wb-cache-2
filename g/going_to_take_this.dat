500|$|On March 13, 2014, Munnerlyn {{signed a}} three-year, $14.25 million {{contract}} with $7 million in guaranteed money with the Minnesota Vikings. The Vikings wanted a four-year deal, but Munnerlyn signed a three-year deal so he could receive his third contract before turning 30. Munnerlyn stated, [...] "I had other visits set up but the number that Minnesota offered me was the number I was looking for. I was like, 'Man, instead of leaving this offer out there I'm just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this.</b> I think this team is on the up. They {{got a lot of}} talent".|$|E
500|$|Controversy ensued {{when the}} Soviets wanted {{to back out}} of the refereeing agreement. The Soviets wanted to include the German pair of referees, {{originally}} scheduled for the game. Eagleson threatened to pull Team Canada from playing the eighth game. In a compromise, Kompalla refereed along with Bata instead of Baader. The ill will spilled over into the presentation of a totem pole as a gift from Team Canada. The pre-game presentation was cancelled by the Soviets, but restored on the insistence of Team Canada. According to Coach Sinden, Eagleson stated that they [...] "were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> totem pole and bring it to centre ice and they'll have to take it or skate around it the whole game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Protests {{against the}} law {{extended}} to the arts and sports world as well. [...] Colombian pop singer Shakira came to Phoenix and gave a joint press conference against the bill with Mayor of Phoenix Phil Gordon. [...] Linda Ronstadt, of part Mexican descent and raised in Arizona, also appeared in Phoenix and said, [...] "Mexican-Americans are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> lying down." [...] A May 16 concert in Mexico City's Zócalo, called Prepa Si Youth For Dignity: We Are All Arizona, drew some 85,000 people to hear Molotov, Jaguares, and Maldita Vecindad headline a seven-hour show in protest {{against the law}}.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, sir,' said Mr Venus, winking his weak {{eyes and}} shaking his head. 'No, partner. The {{question}} is now brought up, who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of <b>this.</b> Do {{you know who}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of <b>this,</b> partner?' ...|$|R

6000|$|His voice unsteady, Carl said: [...] "Jiminy! it's so hot, Eve! I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off <b>this</b> darn {{shirt and}} collar {{and put on}} a soft shirt. S-say, w-why don't you put on a kimono or something? Be so much cooler." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} 1billionhungry campaign borrowed as its slogan {{the line}} [...] "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> anymore!", used by Peter Finch in the 1976 film, Network. Meanwhile, the yellow whistle {{has been the}} campaign symbol from the start, from 1billionhungry to Ending Hunger. (The creative concept {{was provided by the}} McCann Erickson Italy Communication Agency.) It symbolizes {{the fact that we are}} [...] "blowing the whistle" [...] on the silent disaster of hunger. It is both a symbol and – at many live events taking place around the world – a physical means of expressing frustration and making some noise about the hunger situation.|$|E
2500|$|The Smashing Pumpkins' albums Monuments to an Elegy (2014) {{and their}} {{upcoming}} tenth album (2016) will conclude the Teargarden by Kaleidyscope project. Corgan is unsure when Teargarden by Kaleidyscope {{will result in}} a box set, as originally announced, but it could include up to approximately 60 previously unreleased demos recorded for the project. He also stated that the future of the band is up in the air following the project's completion, saying: [...] "as I said {{at the beginning of the}} Teargarden project, I looked at it like, OK, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> journey, and when this journey is over—which it now will be with Day for Night—it will [...] be the beginning [...] a new era of what the Smashing Pumpkins could be in the 21st century, or it will be the end.

50|$|Before {{and during}} World War II Camras' early wire {{recorders}} {{were used by}} {{the armed forces to}} train pilots. They were also used for disinformation purposes: battle sounds were recorded and amplified and the recordings placed where the D-Day invasion was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place. <b>This</b> work was kept secret until after the war.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the train}} <b>this</b> afternoon," [...] he answered, and then continued: [...] "I've got a loose button here on my coat, Minnie. Will you fasten it before I go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Catch one yourself," [...] said Billy Mink. [...] "Old Grandpa Mink wants a {{fish for}} his dinner, so I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> home. You're afraid, Reddy Fox! 'Fraid-cat! Fraid-cat!" ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2006 Weir won {{his second}} London Marathon, setting a course record in wet {{conditions}} {{with a time}} of 1:29:48. With this time, Weir also became the first wheelchair racer to break the 1:30 mark. Weir said after his win, [...] "I wasn't even <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part <b>this</b> morning. I've been suffering from a cold and it was 50/50 whether I would turn up or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Lord, papa, do {{you think}} that superiority a recommendation? Well, sir, but I see you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> all <b>this</b> too seriously; {{whatever}} the young lady may be, I am sure, being recommended by you, she shall have no reason to complain of my want of attention."

I am <b>going</b> up-stairs <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> work <b>to</b> Miss Morgan: she does the open hemming very well. Mary Garth might do some work for me now, I should think. Her sewing is exquisite; it is the nicest thing I know about Mary. I should so like to have all my cambric {{frilling}} double-hemmed. And it takes a long time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This gentleman is my assistant," [...] he said, [...] "and {{you will}} allow him to pass in and out just as you would myself. He is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> case entirely in hand, and you will regard him as being in charge here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, now, if I wasn't {{afraid of}} it!" [...] cried Harrison, angrily. [...] "He's always {{like that when}} he's excited, and I never saw a man more off his head than {{he was when he}} heard I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> job over.

5000|$|... "We {{walk into}} the studio—we were given this song—and it was {{basically}} Kid's song. There were no females on the song. When Stargate gave us the song, we changed some of the lyrics {{and a bit of}} the concepts to make it fit our perspective. Then we went into the studio without thinking we were ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it <b>this</b> far."

5000|$|On March 6, 1912, Sneed's father, Joseph, {{was shot}} in the back and killed by a tenant farmer, R. O. Hillard, as he was walking down a street in Georgetown, Texas. According to Bartee Haile, a Texas historian, {{immediately}} after shooting the elder Sneed, Hillard committed suicide. In his pocket was found a letter that said; [...] "My mind has failed me. J.T.

6000|$|... "You are {{not looking}} as well {{yourself}} as I'd like to see you, Marilla. You look tired. I'm afraid you've been working too hard. You must take a rest, now that I'm home.

6000|$|... "Thank God!" [...] said John, his {{nostrils}} sniffing wide, surprised by joy into the unwonted formality of grace.

40|$|In this essay, I {{examine the}} role of {{collective}} identities in democratization processes in Europe and East and Southeast Asia. This study contributes to the latest academic “neorealist-liberal debate” and constructivist theories, by emphasizing a crucial acknowledgement. With {{the exception of the}} case of the European Union, which boasts the only peaceful democratization process in the post-war era, in East and Southeast Asia there is strong evidence that the orthodoxy of democratization processes is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place. <b>This</b> means that in this vast area, democratization processes will be long-lasting social constructions mixed with strong ethnic consciousness, and therefore, not so peaceful but rather violent processes.   </p...|$|R
50|$|Vann and Andy {{enter the}} barn where the {{exchange}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place. <b>This</b> time Joey is skeptical of their motives and pulls {{a gun on}} Vann. The law enforcement agents hear everything through the wire, and soon arrive to arrest Joey. Andy manages to disarm Joey, though Vann still receives a bullet wound in the buttocks. Vann delivers Andy to the airport for his flight back to Milwaukee {{and the two men}} say goodbye. Vann accidentally sets off the metal detectors in the airport and blames it on Andy. The story ends with a protesting Andy being led away by airport security for a body cavity search.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "There {{is no time}} for that sort of thing now. We will talk to him afterwards. Mr. Shirley, call all hands and get up sail.

We can sail over the same course we went on with the Miranda, and she drew more water than this vessel." ...|$|E
6000|$|Clinch cast a {{swift and}} meaning {{glance at the}} enemy, but looked approval. [...] "Keep your eyes skinned, and you're good for a dozen of 'em," [...] he said sotto voce, {{and then turned to}} Stanner. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> paper to Wild Cat.

6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} Mr. Conyers has returned, {{and that you}} will have no trouble with William's troops, whose {{reputation}} for good behaviour is not of the best. I hope that, now that you are among your friends, you have not quite forgotten us, and that you will let me have a line to say how you are, and how things are going on with you. My boy Larry is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> across, and will call tomorrow night for an answer, if you are good enough to send one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should think," [...] {{he said to}} himself, [...] "the doctor must be a man {{of large}} property, and most likely of noble family, who has taken up his {{profession}} from pure love of it. He is evidently full of energy, and has an intense desire to see Russia greater and higher in the rank of nations. I suppose that, like Kelly, {{he is one of}} the principal medical officers in the army. Certainly he must be a man of considerable influence to obtain my transfer here so easily, and to see that I travelled so comfortably. I wonder where he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me <b>this</b> morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He shouldn't go sending telegrams like this," [...] he said. [...] "You {{might have}} been ill for all I could tell. It spoiled my breakfast!" [...] For though, as a fact, it had not {{prevented}} his completing a hearty meal, he fancied that he felt hungry. [...] "When I was quartered at Halifax there was a fellow who never sent anything but telegrams. Telegraph Jo they called him. He commanded the old Bluebottles. You know the old Bluebottles? If Horace is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> sort of thing he'd better see a specialist; it's almost certain to mean a breakdown. You're up about dresses, I see.

6000|$|... "He must be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the train}} <b>this</b> afternoon," [...] said Dave, {{and he was}} right.
