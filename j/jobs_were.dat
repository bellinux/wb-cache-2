5|$|The {{number of}} state workers grew from 12,000 to 70,000 during Kirchner's administration. The {{creation}} of private-sector {{jobs in the}} province was minimal, and private companies were driven away.

5|$|For the Narnians, Berger envisioned them as more wild in appearance, as {{they have}} been forced into the forests. He also decided to {{increase}} the portrayal of various ages, sizes and races. The black dwarfs are distinguished from the red dwarfs {{as they have}} more leather and jewellery, and a darker colour scheme in their costumes. Each race of creatures also had their fighting styles made more distinguishable. The minotaurs have maces, and the centaurs use swords. The satyrs were redesigned, as their creation on the first film had been rushed. 4,600 make-up <b>jobs</b> <b>were</b> performed, which Berger believes is a record.|$|E

40|$|Grid {{computing}} {{is a form}} of {{distributed computing}} that involves coordinating and sharing data storage and network resource. The goal of grid <b>job</b> scheduling <b>is</b> to achieve high system throughput and match the job to the appropriate available computing resource. The complexity of scheduling problem increases with heterogeneous nature of grid and is highly difficult to schedule effectively. Existing algorithm does not adapt to the dynamic grid environment. In order to utilize the power of grid completely and to assign job to the resource dynamically an efficient algorithm called Adaptive Scoring <b>Job</b> Scheduling (ASJS) <b>was</b> introduced. However the bandwidth and storage capacity occupied by data intensive and computational intensive <b>job</b> <b>is</b> high and each time the user have to specify whether the <b>job</b> <b>is</b> computational intensive or data intensive [...] Due to this problem the <b>jobs</b> <b>are</b> not completed in time.

The announcement provoked threats of protests from AIL's management and labourers, who had recently faced the blow of local Humvee assembly ceasing due to budget considerations. The MDT David was chosen over the armoured version of the Storm because the heavy Storm was said to suffer from handling and reliability problems, safety hazards and limited mission operability. However the IDF said that the purchase of the David was to fill a temporary gap in production until the Storm II's testing was completed, and has since begun filling its commitment.|$|E
