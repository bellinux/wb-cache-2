5000|$|The Unicode {{standard}} {{introduced a}} separate character [...] {{to be used}} as a quotation dash. In general it is the same length as an em-dash, and so this is often used instead.

5000|$|The Tejas has a {{night vision}} goggles (NVG)-compatible [...] "glass cockpit", {{dominated}} by an CSIR-CSIO domestically-developed head-up display (HUD), three 5 in x 5 in multi-function displays, two Smart Standby Display Units (SSDU), and a [...] "get-you-home" [...] panel providing the pilot with essential flight information {{in case of}} an emergency. The displays provide information on key flight systems and controls on a need-to-know basis, along with basic flight and tactical data. The pilot interacts with onboard systems through a multifunctional keyboard and several selection panels. The CSIO-developed HUD, Elbit-furnished <b>DASH</b> helmet-mounted <b>display</b> and sight (HMDS), and hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls reduce pilot workload and increase situation awareness by allowing access to navigation and weapon-aiming information with minimal need to spend time [...] "head down" [...] in the cockpit.|$|R

The 90 % and 130 % design spectra are also <b>displayed</b> (<b>dashed</b> lines) as these are the spectral amplitude limits specified in RG 1.208. To prevent the spectra in large frequency windows from falling below the spectrum, RG 1.208 also requires that no more than nine adjacent frequency points fall below the target spectrum. It is seen that the compatible records generated satisfy these requirements.|$|R

Consequently, Opera Mini supports most of the web standards supported in Opera 12.

When {{you have}} neither time for careful study nor for Düreresque detail, sketch the outline with pencil, then dash {{in the shadows}} with the brush boldly, trying {{to do as much}} as you {{possibly}} can at once, and to get a habit of expedition and decision; laying more color again and again into the tints as they dry, using every expedient which your practice has suggested to you of carrying out your chiaroscuro in the manageable and moist material, taking the color off here with the dry brush, scratching out lights in it there with the wooden handle of the brush, rubbing it in with your fingers, drying it off with your sponge, etc. Then, when the color is in, take your pen and mark the outline characters vigorously, in the manner of the Liber Studiorum. This kind of study is very convenient for carrying away pieces of effect which depend not so much on refinement as on complexity, strange shapes of involved shadows, sudden effects of sky, etc.; and it is most useful as a safeguard against any too servile or slow habits which the minute copying may induce in you; for although the endeavor to obtain velocity merely for velocity's sake, and <b>dash</b> for <b>display's</b> sake, is as baneful as it is despicable; there are a velocity and a dash which not only are compatible with perfect drawing, but obtain certain results which cannot be had otherwise. And it is perfectly safe for you to study occasionally for speed and decision, while your continual course of practice is such as to insure your retaining an accurate judgment and a tender touch. Speed, under such circumstances, is rather fatiguing than tempting; and you will find yourself always beguiled rather into elaboration than negligence.|$|R
