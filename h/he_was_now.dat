5|$|However, on 14 March, Malenkov {{resigned}} from the secretariat of the Central Committee. This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries—indicating that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> {{in charge of the}} party. The Central Committee formally elected him First Secretary in September.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} before departure, funds for the {{expedition}} became harder to acquire. Because of limited public interest, newspaper deals were cancelled and parliament refused {{a request for a}} further 25,000kroner. Amundsen mortgaged his house to keep the expedition afloat; heavily in debt, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> wholly dependent on the expedition's success to avoid personal financial ruin.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 13, Brooks {{suffered}} a loss of confidence. After being champion in all four strokes for the previous four years, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> frequently losing.

Within a year, Brooks' physical growth began to catch up and he started to regain the dominant position. He also switched from distance to sprint events.|$|E

5|$|During the 1780s, Johnson {{achieved}} success: he {{did well}} financially and his firm published more books with other firms. Although Johnson had begun {{his career as a}} relatively cautious publisher of religious and scientific tracts, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> able to take more risks and he encouraged friends to recommend works to him, creating a network of informal reviewers. Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never took on an apprentice. Only {{in the last years of}} his life did two relatives assist him.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> {{regarded as one of}} the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.|$|E
5|$|It {{may well}} have been these Inquisitors who, in 1543, decided that Mercator was eminent enough to be sacrificed. His name {{appeared}} on a list of 52 Lutheran heretics which included an architect, a sculptor, a former rector of the university, a monk, three priests and many others. All were arrested except Mercator who had left Leuven for Rupelmonde on business concerning the estate of his recently deceased uncle Gisbert. That made matters worse for <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> classified as a fugitive who, by fleeing arrest, had proved his own guilt.|$|E

5|$|On 11 October 1855, Brunner married Jane Robson, the 26-year-old {{daughter}} of a labourer who had brought his family to New Zealand the previous year. It was a respectable match for Jane as Brunner was considered a particularly eligible bachelor in Nelson, one of around 45 professionals working {{in the town of}} about 1600 people. His salary had increased to ₤300 (₤24,000) and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> Chief Surveyor for the Nelson Province, the local returning officer and the Commissioner of Native Reserves for Nelson. He also owned three properties, including his Nelson office.|$|E
5|$|Rozhestvensky reorganized his ships {{into three}} divisions; the first {{consisted}} of the four new s commanded by himself, von Fölkersam commanded the second division of the battleships , Navarin, Sissoi Veliky and the armored cruiser , and Nebogatov retained his ships as the third division. Von Fölkersam, ill with cancer, died on 26 May and Rozhestvensky decided not to inform the fleet {{in order to keep}} morale up. The captain of Oslyabya became the commander of the 2nd Division while Nebogatov had no idea that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> the squadron's de facto second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|Rupert Murdoch {{announced}} in early February 2007 that Baron Cohen had {{signed on to}} do another Borat film with Fox. However, this was contradicted by an interview with Baron Cohen himself in which Baron Cohen stated that Borat was to be discontinued, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> too well known to avoid detection {{as he did in}} the film and on Da Ali G Show. A spokesman for Fox later stated that it was too early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.|$|E

5|$|The Crown Prince and Princess {{shared the}} outlook of the Progressive Party, and Bismarck was {{haunted by the}} fear that should the old Emperor dieand <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> in his seventiesthey would call {{on one of the}} Progressive leaders to become Chancellor.

5|$|The line {{opened to}} {{passengers}} on 31 July 1936, less than 12 weeks after construction began. It was formally opened by Lieutenant-Colonel Edwin Charles Cox, Traffic Manager of the Southern Railway, who commented {{that as the}} traffic manager of {{what was then the}} largest electric rail service in the world, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> opening what was probably the smallest. Initially, the tunnel was decorated with illuminated scenes depicting Switzerland, Canada, the Netherlands, Japan and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} {{probable}} {{reasons for the}} deviation in the division's direction: first, regiments from the III Corps were unexpectedly in the Devil's Den area and they would threaten Hood's right flank {{if they were not}} dealt with; second, fire from the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters at Slyder's farm drew the attention of lead elements of Law's Brigade, moving in pursuit and drawing his brigade to the right; third, the terrain was rough and units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood's senior subordinate, Gen. Law, was unaware that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> in command of the division, so he could not exercise control.|$|E

5|$|Van der Byl was {{appointed}} Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence on 2 August 1974. These were two distinct portfolios, {{the first of}} which (Foreign Affairs) did not amount to much in a state which lacked any form of international recognition. The Defence portfolio, at a time when Rhodesia was drifting into civil war, was an important post; although his previous political experience had been largely in the area of public relations, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> charged with responsibilities which were central to the survival of Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} five years at Wells, Wheelwright {{received}} an invitation from the church and town of Hampton, then under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, to join the Reverend Timothy Dalton as a pastor of the church there. Without apparent hesitation he went there in the spring of 1647 and entered into a written agreement with a committee of the church and town. He was installed as the minister on 12 April 1647 by some accounts, or 24 June 1647 by another. The job afforded the 55-year-old Wheelwright with a larger salary than the parish at Wells did, an important consideration given the large size of his family. No longer in a frontier setting, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> within reach of professional brethren and laymen of culture and social refinement, more aligned with his educational background.|$|E
