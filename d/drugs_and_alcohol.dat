40|$|The <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>Alcohol</b> (D&A) Psychosocial Interventions Professional Practice Guidelines are {{the first}} generic {{professional}} guidelines for psychosocial interventions to be developed in NSW for <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> practice. The Guidelines take a stepped care approach to <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> treatment, which focuses on the adoption of best practice models for people with <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> issues, <b>and</b> reflects current best evidence and practice in the <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> counselling field. Responsibility for implementation of the Guidelines is shared across all levels of <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> clinical practice, <b>and</b> the Guidelines aim to increase the effectiveness of staff as psychosocial clinicians and systematise the use of psychosocial interventions for problematic <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> use across NSW. The Guidelines are intended to be applicable across the various allied health disciplines within <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> specialist services that are providing clinical psychosocial interventions. This includes Specialist and Generalist D&A professionals across public and private sectors.

5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> have notable effects on consciousness. These {{range from a}} simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E

40|$|Depression {{and anxiety}} are common among clients {{presenting}} to <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> services.

5|$|In some {{countries}} bathhouses {{are prohibited from}} selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license {{may be required to}} submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do notor cannotregulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons.

40|$|The homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol,</b> <b>and</b> {{mental health}} service systems are {{separate}} service structures in Australia. They {{have their own}} unique funding and governance arrangements and work in separate domains. The homelessness service system fits largely within a community services support framework, while <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol,</b> <b>and</b> mental health services are embedded within their respective health systems. Despite {{the fact that the}} homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol,</b> <b>and</b> mental health service systems are separate, they share many of the same clients and address similar problems among clients. Homelessness services, for example, provide support to clients who also have <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol,</b> <b>and</b> mental health needs. Therefore, the homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol,</b> <b>and</b> mental health service systems interact. Service integration and effective working relationships between services across the homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol,</b> <b>and</b> mental health systems is, a priori, critical in achieving good outcomes for clients wherever they may be located. Service integration has become a point of policy focus in recent years. Despite the focus on systems and service integration in the present policy environment and among practitioners, there has been no study, as far as we are aware, of the integration of homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol,</b> <b>and</b> mental health services in Australia that also considers the perspective of clients. This study aims to fill this critical gap in the literature. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to increase our understanding of the extent and ways in which homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol,</b> <b>and</b> mental health services are working together to provide services to clients with particular emphasis on the needs of homeless people.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to explore problem <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users' {{perceptions}} of family members' coping in a cross-sectional interview study of problem <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users, using a long semistructured interview. Participants comprised nine problem drinkers, five problem <b>drug</b> users <b>and</b> one problem <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> user (two-thirds male). Detailed qualitative analysis of interview reports suggested that <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users have clear ideas regarding family members' coping. Coping strategies which encompass clear elements of concern for them appear to be well-received, in particular supportive coping and, in some cases, assertive coping. Controlling coping may be viewed positively by <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users provided it is used in conjunction with supportive coping, thereby indicating concern. Furthermore, results suggested that users found all other forms of coping such as emotional, tolerant, inactive and avoidance to be unsupportive, the only exception being tolerant coping, which was found to be supportive when <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users had no intention of altering their use. <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users' perceptions of family members' coping may be viewed in terms of the stress-coping model. <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users appreciate supportive coping actions, while coping strategies which involve family members withdrawing from them, making them feel guilty or forcing them to take actions against their will are felt to be unsupportive. The findings have implications for the way in which family members are advised to cope, not only in terms of their own physical and psychological well-being, but also in terms of how their actions are perceived by the users themselves...|$|R
5|$|After the show's {{transition}} from NBC to DirecTV, Eve's storylines emphasize her romance with Julian and difficult relationship with Vincent. Believed dead, Vincent reveals himself, his gender identity and his pregnancy to Eve after seducing Julian (his father) and threatens {{to kill her}} if she tells anyone. In late 2007, he begins tormenting Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born. Julian checks Eve into rehab after she relapses, abusing <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> to cope with Vincent's frequent appearances. Vincent arranges for Eve's release from rehab to help him prepare for the impending birth. Vincent's psychopathic accomplice, Viki Chatsworth, later repeatedly stabs Julian in the groin and severs his penis. Vincent plies Eve with <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent {{with the birth of}} his son on the Russells' kitchen table, when Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Eve assures Julian that they love each other emotionally and intellectually; Julian vows that the Crane family will take more responsibility for their actions now that Alistair is dead. At the rehearsal dinner, Eve and the other dinner guests eat Vincent and Viki's poisoned mushroom sauce. She dies, but is resurrected when witch Tabitha Lenox renounces magic and becomes a born-again Christian. In the series finale, Kay uses her magic to heal Julian's penis. Since T. C., Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and Vincent are the only two Russells in the final episode.|$|E
5|$|Focused on hockey, {{exposed to}} <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> and {{frequently}} getting into fights, James {{paid little attention}} to her education and nearly dropped out of school. A vice-principal at Valley Park Middle School, Ross Dixon, encouraged her to pay greater attention to her studies, allowing her to graduate from Overlea High School, now named Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute, and move onto Seneca College in Toronto. James struggled academically in her first year at Seneca, partially because she had rarely been held accountable for failing in her studies in the past, and partly because she was playing two sports at both the college and community level while working part-time jobs to help pay the family's bills. Seneca's hockey coach Lee Trempe had several arguments with James before she began to take her studies seriously.|$|E

5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E
