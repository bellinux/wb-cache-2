He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that [...] "in {{a great number of}} cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." [...] Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that [...] "if {{it is a question of}} wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." [...] This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.|$|E

They wed in September 1976 and had a son, [...] "Brendan" [...] Li Wangzhi (李望知), the following year. Their son graduated from Columbia University in 2001. Li Danyu insisted that her son change his surname to Li following her divorce from Bo Xilai in 1984. Li Wangzhi was reportedly low-key and modest and was not commonly associated with his father during the latter's political heyday. Li Wangzhi obtained a master's degree in media studies and worked {{for a few years}} at Citibank, then worked for a law firm in Beijing; he eventually went into private equity. Li had remarked publicly that his father's arrest [...] "destroyed his life". In 2014, Li released a statement on his microblog feed revealing that his father was doing well in prison and that medical treatment is available to him should he need it. Li wrote, [...] "life is short... if the law allows, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him more.

I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E
