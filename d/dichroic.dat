5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a <b>dichroic</b> coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours.|$|E

25|$|Certain crystals, due to {{the effects}} {{described}} by crystal optics, show dichroism, preferential absorption of light which is polarized in particular directions. They can therefore be used as linear polarizers. The best known crystal of this type is tourmaline.

50|$|In the United Kingdom, Rank Precision Industries was {{experimenting with}} the flying-spot scanner (FSS), which {{inverted}} the {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) concept of scanning using a television screen. The CRT emits a pixel-sized electron beam which is converted to a photon beam through the phosphors coating the envelope. This dot of light is then focused by a lens onto the film's emulsion, and finally collected by a pickup device. In 1950 the first Rank flying spot monochrome telecine was installed at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios. The advantage of the FSS is that colour analysis is done after scanning, so {{there can be no}} registration errors as can be produced by vidicon tubes where scanning is done after colour separation—it also allows simpler <b>dichroics</b> to be used.|$|R

25|$|To {{block the}} {{excitation}} light {{from reaching the}} observer or the detector, filter sets of high quality are needed. These typically consist of an excitation filter selecting the range of excitation wavelengths, a <b>dichroic</b> mirror, and an emission filter blocking the excitation light. Most fluorescence microscopes are operated in the Epi-illumination mode (illumination and detection {{from one side of}} the sample) to further decrease the amount of excitation light entering the detector.|$|E

40|$|We are {{developing}} antenna-coupled Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) bolometer arrays {{for use in}} measurements of the CMB polarization. TES bolometers have many well-known advantages over conventional bolometers, such as increased speed, linearity, {{and the existence of}} readout multiplexers. Antenna-coupled bolometers use an on-chip planar antenna to couple light into the bolometer. The antenna directivity and polarization sensitivity, along with the potential for on-chip band defining filters and channelizing circuits, allow a significant increase in focal plane integration. This eliminates the bulky horns, quasioptical filters, <b>dichroics,</b> and polarizers which might otherwise be needed in a conventional bolometric system. This simplification will ease the construction of receivers with larger numbers of pixels. We report on the fabrication and optical testing of single antenna-coupled bolometer pixels with integrated band defining filters.

25|$|In media termed birefringent, {{in which}} the amplitudes are {{unchanged}} but a differential phase delay occurs, the Jones matrix is a unitary matrix: |g1| = |g2| = 1.

By 1932, color photography in general had nearly been abandoned by major studios, until Technicolor developed a new advancement to record all three primary colors. Utilizing a special <b>dichroic</b> beam splitter equipped with two 45-degree prisms {{in the form of a}} cube, light from the lens was deflected by the prisms and split into two paths to expose each one of three black-and-white negatives (one each to record the densities for red, green, and blue).|$|E
25|$|Their {{principal}} {{feature is}} the ability to remotely control the movement and characteristics of the output beam of light.

Usually they also contain other controls to shape, texture and color the light, such as gobo or <b>dichroic</b> wheels. This ability to precisely, and repeatedly set the position of the fixture allows one light to perform many functions, lighting multiple different areas in different ways.

25|$|The photo-isomerization of {{azobenzene}} {{is a form}} of light-induced molecular motion. This isomerization {{can also}} lead to motion on larger length scales.

However, those relaxed (trans) molecules that fall perpendicular to the incoming light polarization will {{no longer be able to}} absorb, and will remain fixed. Thus, there is a statistical enrichment of chromophores perpendicular to polarized light (orientational hole burning). Polarized irradiation will make an azo-material anisotropic and therefore optically birefringent and <b>dichroic.</b> This photo-orientation can also be used to orient other materials (especially in liquid crystal systems).

We describe how these tasks are accomplished with UnISIS, the Rayleigh laser guided adaptive optics system at the Mt. Wilson Observatory 2. 5 -m telescope. We use several methods: a 10, 000 RPM rotating disk, <b>dichroics,</b> a fast sweep and clear mode of the CCD readout electronics on a 10 µs timescale, and a Pockel’s cell shutter system.

Invariably such instruments use precision infrared bandpass filters and coatings for spectral selction, often operating at cryogenic temperatures. More recent developments in the use of spectrally-selective cooled detectors in focal plane arrays have simplified the optical layout and reduced the component count of radiometers but have placed additional demands on both the spectral and physical performance requirements of the filters. This paper describes and contrasts the more traditional radiometers using discrete detectors with those which use focal plane detector array technology, with particular emphasis on the function of the filters and coatings in the two cases. Additionally we discuss the spectral techniques and materials used to fabricate infrared coatings and filters for use in space optics, and give examples of their application in the fabrication of some demanding long wavelength <b>dichroics</b> and filters.
