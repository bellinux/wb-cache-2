500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{believed}} the episode was important developmentally for the series, explaining it was [...] "creatively {{when the show}} really hit its stride in the first season." [...] Jackson continued, [...] "I think right around the midway point of [...] season the show decided what it wanted to be. From about the midway, point it got on a pretty good streak of episodes. I can’t remember the exact number, but the two-part episode where Dunham gets kidnapped. After that, it was pretty clear; we introduced the bad <b>guys</b> <b>for</b> the season {{and there was a}} much clearer narrative drive {{through the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E

Suddenly there's a voice from one of the stalls: 'I've got just the <b>guys</b> <b>for</b> you!' Having Tom and George did make life easier, although Arthur and I went over their scripts for a light polishing." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2015, Cornell openly said in {{interview}} with Total Guitar {{that he was}} quite eager to reunite with Audioslave: [...] "I {{think it would be}} great. We did a lot of songs, and with the benefit of not having done anything with those <b>guys</b> <b>for</b> so long, I can't imagine what it would be. It would be a really amazing experience just to get back and work with the same guys again." [...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And {{to be able to play}} the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. I hope we do something like that again." ...|$|E

It is being released in the UK via Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Chris [...] "Zeuss" [...] Harris. Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs {{are a little more}} on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room for me to have some fun. There {{is no doubt in my}} mind that this will be the best performance of my career, so far, and I owe that to my <b>guys</b> <b>for</b> bringing me incredible riffs to write killer drum parts to." [...] As of the fall of 2009 the band was appearing on the 'Shock & Raw' tour of North America with 2Cents, Otep & Five Finger Death Punch.

2500|$|On January 1, 2013, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett {{announced}} he would sue the NCAA in federal court over the sanctions imposed on Penn State. [...] Although Corbett is an ex officio {{member of the board}} of trustees, Penn State was not involved in the suit. [...] According to the Associated Press, Corbett was filing an antitrust suit against the NCAA. Though Corbett had originally [...] "endorsed [...] as 'part of the corrective process'", [...] he and other Pennsylvania elected officials had more recently begun to object to the prospect of the $60 million fine being spent mostly outside of Pennsylvania. One reason given for the objection is that there is no legal way Penn State can ensure that taxpayer money won't be used to pay the fine. In sharply criticizing the governor's move in an editorial, The New York Times noted that the governor [...] "barely mentioned the young victims" [...] in his 2013 statement. It continued: [...] "In his complaints, the governor only confirmed the inquiry finding that the university’s obsession with football predominance helped drive the cover-up of Mr. Sandusky’s crimes." [...] It also noted that, in the suit, Corbett [...] "bypassed incoming state attorney general Kathleen Kane [...] in her election campaign last year ... promised to look into why it took so long for the pedophilia scandal to be investigated when Mr. Corbett previously served as attorney general". The Patriot-News said of the suit: [...] " [...] comes after a year of withering criticism of Corbett by some quarters of the Penn State community, which has seen the governor and his fellow PSU trustees as too quick to brand former head coach Joe Paterno and others as fall <b>guys</b> <b>for</b> the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal." [...] On June 6, 2013, federal Middle District Judge Yvette Kane said she could not [...] "find any factual allegations" [...] and threw out the lawsuit calling it [...] "a Hail Mary pass" [...] that easily warranted dismissal.|$|E
