40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the development of young children's recognition of <b>fake</b> <b>crying.</b> Sixty-two children aged from 3 to 6 were studied individually. They were questioned about their knowledge of <b>fake</b> <b>crying,</b> whether their friends engaged in real and <b>fake</b> <b>crying,</b> the situations in which they did so, and their own reactions to these cries. They were also questioned about whether they themselves engaged in real and <b>fake</b> <b>crying,</b> the situations in which they cried, and their friends' reactions to these cries. The children were assigned "crying tasks," which were developed by Mizokawa and Koyasu (2007). Their answers were classified into three groups based on their crying task performances (low. middle. and high). The results revealed that children in the low group did not distinguish <b>fake</b> <b>crying</b> from real crying and they recognized that both expressions would attract attention and elicit helping behavior by others to help them. In turn, children in the middle group were able to distinguish <b>fake</b> <b>crying</b> from real crying. Lastly, children in the high group not only distinguished between these types of crying, but also they clearly recognized that <b>fake</b> <b>crying</b> would deceive others...|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} Visine causing upset {{gastrointestinal}} effects when being ingested {{is depicted in}} the movie Wedding Crashers where John Beckwith (portrayed by Owen Wilson) poisons Sack's (Bradley Cooper) drink, causing him to suffer all night. John Beckwith also uses the Visine several times {{over the course of}} the film to <b>fake</b> <b>crying.</b> This movie has gained notoriety for encouraging the deadly prank of putting Visine eyedrops in drinking water bottles, threatening severe or fatal injury to drinkers.|$|R
5|$|Strickland's {{career began}} in 1999 {{with a brief}} {{appearance}} as a mourner at a funeral after-party in The Sixth Sense, a two-line part that she received after impressing writer-director M. Night Shyamalan when reading lines for those auditioning for the film. According to Strickland, {{her role in the}} film helped her learn to temper her <b>fake</b> <b>crying.</b> The same year, she served as an extra in the independent film The Sterling Chase, and appeared in a small role opposite Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie in James Mangold's drama Girl, Interrupted.|$|R
5000|$|Tanisha (Zolee Griggs) is a bratty, spoiled 4th grader {{who is one}} of Sophie's classmates. As {{claimed by}} Sophie, she is the most popular girl in her class. She is one of the Sunshine Girls with Sophie. Tanisha cheated her way to being class {{president}} by <b>fake</b> <b>crying.</b> She appears in several different episodes. However, in some episodes it can be questioned that Tanisha and Sophie are friends, even though at first she seemed like Sophie's enemy. In [...] "I Ain't Got No Rhythm" [...] she nearly left Sophie's sleepover because she did not like Samantha.|$|R
50|$|Gilligan {{also makes}} several discoveries, {{but they often}} have {{disastrous}} results, and he is usually faced with big decisions. Often, Thurston Howell III attempts to bribe him with money, or Ginger with seduction or <b>fake</b> <b>crying.</b> Examples include whom to give the last orange on the island, or whom to give hot water from {{a hole in the}} ground (which the Professor later discovered to be an active volcano). On one occasion, Gilligan found seeds which gave people the ability to read minds, but when the seeds proved to have disastrous results, he gathered up the bush and all the seeds on the island and burned them.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies in}} {{developmental}} psychology often implicitly presuppose that utterances {{can be divided}} into cry and non-cry utterances (e. g. Masataka, 1992). Our last study (Hayashibe, et al., 1996) hypothesizes that cry and non-cry utterances are the origins of the various functions of language like mand and tact (Skinner, 1957). Obviously we should have criteria to divide child's utterances into some classes including cries and non-cries. Thus we carried out an experiment in which a mother listened to her child's utterances and classified them into certain categories. The results indicate that the mother has a clear criterion to divide the utterances into three categories, i. e. vocalization, <b>cry</b> and <b>faking</b> <b>cry,</b> and that the duration and the pitch of utterances affect the mother's judgment...|$|R

40|$|This {{study reveals}} the {{functional}} {{development of the}} Down syndrome's vocalization in his early infancy. Subjects were two mother-infant pairs : one infant was with Down syndrome and the other infant was non-retarded. They were videotaped for six hours when the infants were 5 -and 7 month old and when the Down syndrome infant was 9 month-old. In the observation, the three kinds of mothers' behavior were picked up, holding her {{baby in her arms}} (holding), feeding milk or weaning food to her baby (feeding), and speaking to her baby (speech). Sixty-second infants' vocalization before and after their mother's feeding and holding were analyzed. Infants' vocalization was classified into three categories, <b>cry,</b> non-cry and <b>faking</b> <b>cry.</b> Three kinds of vocalization patterns were recorded in the unit of second. The acoustic features of fundamental frequency and duration in Down syndrome infant's vocalization were analyzed. Three results were obtained. 1) There were no non-cries of 15 seconds before holding except in the data of the 5 month-old Down syndrome infant. 2) Developmentally Down syndrome infant's non-cries before holding existed longer than the "normal" one. 3) Down syndrome infant's vocalization could not be classified into clear categories compared to the non-retarded infant. From these results, we conclude that the Down syndrome infant has some backwardness in the development of functional use of vocalization...|$|R
40|$|Not all {{emotional}} displays {{are always}} appropriate, not all subjective feelings desired. Hence, people control their emotions by resorting {{to all sorts}} of emotion regulation strategies: <b>Crying,</b> <b>faking,</b> talking, writing, singing, walking, thinking, hiking, dreaming, sleeping, eating, hiding, swimming, leaving, drinking, fighting [...] . These emotion regulation strategies have been at the heart of my work: The circumstances under which they are preferred and employed, and the effects they have on different emotional components. ...|$|R
50|$|The largest local {{landlord}} Zhou had {{a serious}} family problem: his fourth concubine committed suicide by hanging herself because she could not take Zhou's wife's pressure. Bie Tingfang ordered his followers to hide outside {{the windows of the}} rooms of Zhou's residence, <b>faking</b> the <b>crying</b> of the dead concubine, which threatened the wife, who was directly responsible for the concubine's death. Zhou's wife obviously had nerve break-down and Zhou was disparate to find a solution. Bie Tingfang offered his service to rid of the fourth concubine's ghost from Zhou's residence, and after an elaborate ceremony, Bie Tingfang begun his so-called supernatural services by acting alone, while others were only too happy to oblige. Bie Tingfang entered the room in which the fourth concubine hanged herself and then the wife's bedroom, and soon reappeared, claiming the ghost was destroyed for good. The ghostly crying of the fourth concubine stopped the very same night (Of course, Bie had simply ordered his followers to stop).|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "Crocodile tears" [...] (and {{equivalents}} {{in other}} languages) {{refers to a}} false, insincere display of emotion, such as a hypocrite <b>crying</b> <b>fake</b> tears of grief. It is derived from an ancient anecdote that crocodiles weep in order to lure their prey, or that they cry for the victims they are eating, first told in the Bibliotheca by Photios I of Constantinople. The story is repeated in bestiaries such as De bestiis et aliis rebus. This tale was first spread widely in English in {{the stories of the}} Travels of Sir John Mandeville in the 14th century, and appears in several of Shakespeare's plays. In fact, crocodiles can and do generate tears, but they do not actually cry.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{political}} cartoons, {{legends and}} stories feature crocodiles {{who claim to}} be sad about someone else's grief and then <b>cry</b> <b>fake</b> tears as a result. This stereotype {{is based on the}} fact that in real life crocodiles can often be observed with teary eyes while they consume their dead prey. The reason for this behaviour lies is that crocodiles are unable to chew and thus forced to rip their food into chunks and swallow them whole. Since the glands that keep their eyes moist are right near their throats this eating habit actually forces them to produce tears. This observation lead humans to believe that crocodiles are crying about the death of the animal they hypocritically just killed themselves and created the expression [...] "crying crocodile tears", which means that one shows emotions without really meaning it.|$|R
50|$|Kantmiss Evershot {{practices}} archery in the forest, but her boyfriend, Dale, surprises her; {{the arrow}} accidentally hits the Wizard of Oz. They return to District 12, where children {{afraid of getting}} picked for the Games injure and mutilate themselves to avoid selection. At the Gathering for the 75th Annual Starving Games, President Snowballs explains his reason for separating America into districts, as well as ridiculous prizes for winning. During the drawing for District 12's contestants, Petunia, Kantmiss's sister, tricks Kantmiss into volunteering when she gets picked by <b>crying</b> <b>fake</b> tears. Dale tries volunteering as well, but the town idiot Peter Malarkey beats him to it. When the Games begin, Kantmiss grabs a backpack and tries fleeing, but Seleca, the Games' producer, sends Angry Birds to attack her; she defeats them and squashes the Annoying Orange. Peter teams up {{with a group of}} contestants led by Marco, who aim to kill Kantmiss. Marco tries to kill her with a spear but it kills one of his allies instead. They flee when she knocks down a beehive using a chainsaw. Kantmiss is stung, and the venom causes her to hallucinate being a Na'vi. She is slapped back to her senses by fellow contestant Rudy; they team up, vowing to kill the other contestants first. After the halftime show is played, Marco again tries to kill Kantmiss, but Rudy kicks his shin. Marco then kills Rudy. Wanting to spice up the Games, Snowballs decides to implement a lesbian love story, but learns Kantmiss is the only woman left; thus, only a straight romance is possible. After it is announced only a couple can win the games, Kantmiss tries to team up with Marco over Peter, but Seleca fakes being killed to convince her to find Peter instead. Kantmiss kills all of the contestants but Marco, and flees with Peter to a cave. As Peter starts to have a fever, he reveals that he had been stalking Kantmiss for most of her life. Since Kantmiss is keeping her distance from Peter, Seleca offers to send medical supplies to treat Peter if she gets more intimate with him. Kantmiss has sex with Peter, which is televised. Dale is disgusted by this and storms the Starving Games arena, expressing his hatred for Peter. The next day, Kantmiss and Peter attack Marco, but Snowballs orders Seleca to send in the Expendables. An armed Dale arrives, kills them, and asks Kantmiss to come back with him. When Kantmiss orders him to leave, he breaks up with her. Marco holds Peter hostage, but Kantmiss shoots a loaf of bread into his eye, killing him. Seleca then announces there can only be one winner again. Peter tries convincing Kantmiss to commit suicide with him by ingesting poisonous berries, to not give those in charge the satisfaction of them fighting to the death. Instead, Kantmiss kills Peter with an arrow, telling him it was nothing personal. Afterwards, Nick Fury and the Avengers show up, with Fury saying he wants Kantmiss to join the Avengers team as a replacement for Hawkeye. Then, the Avengers all die after stepping off their platforms and onto mines.|$|R
