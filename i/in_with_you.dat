2500|$|Kevin Keegan quickly {{reinstated}} McManaman to the England {{starting lineup}} after {{coming on the}} job. John Barnes spoke about McManaman in his autobiography in 1999 as [...] "probably the greatest individual talent in English football {{and has to be}} presented the correct way", and Keegan gave several interviews in 1999 backing up that point; adding that he was finding out how best to utilise McManaman. Keegan eventually decided on deploying McManaman on the left wing on several occasions in 1999 and under Keegan, McManaman finally broke his international goal scoring duck when he scored twice on 4 September 1999 in the 6–0 Euro 2000 qualifier victory over Luxembourg, again, at Wembley. Keegan took McManaman's new career at Madrid to reinstate his confidence in him, and handed him a coveted free role ahead of Euro 2000, stating that [...] "in the past we compromised him... but , we said 'we'll fit <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> you've earned that chance' McManaman played only once in Euro 2000, where he scored the last of his three England goals in a famous opening game against Portugal, where McManaman put England 2–0 ahead, only for it to end because McManaman got injured after scoring, forcing a tactical switch. McManaman never played for Keegan again as Keegan left the England job two months later in October 2000.|$|E
