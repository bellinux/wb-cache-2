5|$|In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 {{animated}} {{adaptation of}} The Lord of the Rings, which corresponds to The Fellowship of the Ring {{and part of}} The Two Towers, Saruman is voiced by Fraser Kerr. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>only</b> one major scene—his attempt to persuade Gandalf to join him. He appears again briefly before the battle of Helm's Deep, speaking to his army. The character is dressed in red and is called 'Saruman' and 'Aruman' at different points. Smith and Matthews suggest {{that the use of}} 'Aruman' was intended to avoid confusion with 'Sauron'. The 1980 Rankin/Bass TV animated version of The Return of the King begins roughly where Bakshi's film ends but does not include Saruman's character.|$|E

5|$|Shane Warne, {{a retired}} {{international}} Australian cricketer, took {{a number of}} five-wicket hauls during his career for Australia. In cricket, a five-wicket haul - {{also known as a}} five-for or fifer- refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and only four bowlers have taken more than 30 five-wicket hauls in their Test cricket careers. Warne has the second-most five-wicket hauls in Test cricket with 37, behind Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan. Despite this <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>only</b> taken a single five-wicket haul in One Day Internationals (ODI). He {{is one of the most}} experienced Australian cricketers, and the second leading wicket taker in Test cricket history with 708 wickets, again behind Muralitharan. He is twelfth on the all-time list of ODI wicket takers. In 2000, Warne was named fourth of five Wisden Cricketers of the Century behind Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers and Sir Jack Hobbs.|$|E
5|$|Van der Sloot's cell {{became the}} target of a media circus, with reporters vying to gain {{exclusive}} access and report about his prison surroundings. Since his incarceration, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>only</b> consented to interviews to De Telegraaf, in which he admitted to extorting the Holloway family and said that he received a number of marriage proposals in his cell, including one from a woman who wanted to have his child. Van der Sloot reportedly receives fan mail from around the world, though mostly from women residing in the United States and the Netherlands. According to sources within the prison, Van der Sloot sought $1 million in exchange for an on-camera interview.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth Mattias Öhlund (born 9 September 1976) is a Swedish former {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} defenceman who last {{played for the}} Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL). Prior to joining the Lightning, he played eleven seasons with the Vancouver Canucks. Öhlund played two seasons in the Swedish Allsvenskan, the second highest tier of hockey in Sweden, with Piteå HC before being selected by the Canucks thirteenth overall in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft; he then joined Luleå HF of the Elitserien, the highest league in Sweden, winning the Le Mat Trophy as league champions in 1996. He began his NHL career with Vancouver in 1997–98, the start of an eleven-year tenure with the club. A serious eye injury before his third NHL season {{was the first of}} many injuries Öhlund has sustained over his career, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>only</b> played a full season twice in eleven years. A four-time winner of the Babe Pratt Trophy as the team's best defenceman, Öhlund is the Canucks' all-time leading goal and point-scorer among defencemen.|$|E

5|$|Rhys {{goes along}} to a cookery class that Vanessa is {{teaching}} and flirts with Tiffany Giles (Shaye Hopkins) to make Vanessa jealous. She invites him {{to dinner and}} he suffers an allergic reaction to the food. Vanessa and Rhys almost kiss, but are interrupted by Lucas. The following day, Rhys goes to Harold's Store and kisses Vanessa. Rhys opens up to her about his father and they arrange a date. When Troy Miller (Dieter Brummer) is brought into the hospital, he tells Rhys that Jade attacked him. Rhys reports this {{to the police and}} when Jade finds out, she asks him to leave the house. Rhys applies for a three-month study tour in Japan and asks Vanessa to come with him. Rhys' mother later gives him a ring so that he can propose to Vanessa. Shortly before leaving for Japan, Rhys comes across a car accident involving the street's teenagers. He rings the emergency services, before assessing their injuries. Rhys cuts his hand on a piece of wreckage, which forces him to cancel the trip to Japan. He later learns that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>only</b> a five per cent chance of making a full recovery. Following an EMG, Rhys learns that there has been no improvement to his hand. After altering the report to say that his nerves are healing, Rhys is invited to assist Jessica in surgery.|$|E

25|$|Retro Girl – The first arc {{details the}} death of Retro Girl (first name Janis, last name unrevealed), a popular and {{powerful}} super-heroine.

25|$|Stig: His {{nickname}} {{may come}} from the term stigma, as he is marked an outsider for his notable lack of hygiene. Stig is the last member to be initiated into this generation of the Midnight Society. As such, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>only</b> two stories in the series before the cast is changed. Due to the aversion people seem to have against him for his looks, both his stories seem to revolve around outsiders judged for their appearances and tastes.|$|E

The 16/220 claimed in the match is the 5th best bowling record in a match, a {{position}} it has stood in since the match.|$|E
25|$|Stove {{notes that}} in part one <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>only</b> {{demonstrated}} how an irrational position might be expressed, {{in such a way}} as it had some appearance of credibility, not that such a position is actually held by the subjects of his study. He now turns to establishing this second point. The philosophers he is criticising not only use language in unusual ways, but do indeed also make plain language assertions of an irrationalist nature. Stove presents examples of what he believes are the clearest statements of irrationalism in their writing. Ultimately he considers providing examples from Karl Popper suffices. He presents the quotes and paraphrases apparently in ascending order of irrationality.|$|E
