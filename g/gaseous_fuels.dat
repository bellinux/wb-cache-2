5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} way as with {{synthetic}} alcohol production, hydrogen {{can be used on}} site to directly (nonbiologically) produce greenhouse-neutral <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels.</b> Thus, captive-hydrogen-mediated production of greenhouse-neutral methane has been proposed (note that this is the reverse of the present method of acquiring hydrogen from natural methane, but one that does not require ultimate burning and release of fossil fuel carbon). Captive hydrogen (and carbon dioxide from, for example, CCS (Carbon Capture & Storage)) may be used onsite to synthesize methane, using the Sabatier reaction. This is about 60% efficient, and with the round trip reducing to 20 to 36% depending on the method of fuel utilization. This is even lower than hydrogen, but the storage costs drop by at least a factor of 3, because of methane's higher boiling point and higher energy density. Liquid methane has 3.2 times the energy density of liquid hydrogen and is easier to store compactly. Additionally, the pipe infrastructure (natural gas pipelines) are already in place. Natural-gas-powered vehicles already exist, and are known to be easier to adapt from existing internal engine technology, than internal combustion autos running directly on hydrogen. Experience with natural gas powered vehicles shows that methane storage is inexpensive, once one has accepted the cost of conversion to store the fuel. However, the cost of alcohol storage is even lower, so this technology would need to produce methane at a considerable savings with regard to alcohol production. Ultimate mature prices of fuels in the competing technologies are not presently known, but both are expected to offer substantial infrastructural savings over attempts to transport and use hydrogen directly.|$|E

A direct {{injection}} of a <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> in Ie piston engines {{seems to be}} advantageous {{with respect to the}} conventional-like gas fuel supply {{in the form of the}} air-fuel mixture delivered through the inlet duct. High compression ratio used in that type of combustion systems, necessary to create the satisfactory conditions for the self-ignition of the diesel oil is not sufficient to assure the self-ignition of the <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> (methane). It is therefore necessary to use the forced ignition in the form of the spark plug. The major problem which is associated with spark ignition of the highly stratified charge created by the fuel gas {{direct injection}} is to choose the proper location of the ignition point, suitable for the given combustion chamber geometry. The preliminary results of studies of the ignition of the <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> jet in a combustion bomb equipped with the special ignition chamber are presented.
