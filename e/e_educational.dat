40|$|We {{assess the}} impact of R&D {{manpower}} diversity on firms' technological performance. Relying on insights from two theoretical perspectives on team diversity (i. e. social categorization perspective and information decision-making perspective), we hypothesize that both demographic and task-related sources of diversity within firms' R&D workforce influence technological performance. In addition, we expect that these two dimensions of diversity interact with each other. To test our hypotheses, we rely on survey data from 938 Singaporean firms, providing in-depth information on three sources of demographic diversity (i. e. gender, age, and nationality of R&D employees) and two sources of task-related diversity (i. <b>e.</b> <b>educational</b> and knowledge area background of R&D employees). Our findings point to significant interactions between different sources of R&D manpower diversity. In particular, we identify substitutive relationships between (a) educational and gender diversity, and (b) nationality and knowledge area diversity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between mental retardation and learning disabilities is clouded by conceptual issues and current practices in applied (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>educational</b> and noneducational) settings. In this article, we initially discuss whether mental retardation {{can be considered}} a concomitant disability associated with learning disabilities or whether these two disabilities are mutually exclusive categories. Conceptual issues related to this question are then reviewed to provide a perspective for viewing these two traditional areas of exceptionality. Emerging areas of concern in terms of definition, classification, etiology, and lifelong issues are addressed. Attention is then given to applied issues that have a direct effect on the lives of individuals with disabilities. Specific topics include educational curricula, instruction, inclusion, and adult services and supports. I n a series of manuscripts devoted to concomitant disabilities that may be associated with learning disabilities, some categories of disabili-ties will quite logically warrant spe-cial attention. For example, the articles in this series that are focused on emo-tional and behavioral disorders, visual disabilities, hearing impairments, an...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify the issues, which have led to Roma exclusion from the mainstream education. The first part of the paper is focused on data, correlating unequal educational opportunities and the ethnicity factor. The text presents an insight into the widely argued Roma dropout phenomenon. Different sets of reasons for dropping out from school are being discussed, i. <b>e.</b> <b>educational,</b> ethnic and cultural, economic, and family reasons. In addition, the article reflects on the retrograde beliefs of the majority population as a prerequisite for Roma reluctance towards continuing education. Moreover, the article puts forward a review on the most recent key policy measures for equal educational opportunities, targeting the Roma. Various aspects of adopted policy interventions for stimulating educational inclusion are illustrated, and supplemented by a critical analysis. The authors conclude that the required strategic actions, targeting educational equity for marginalized social groups, such as the Roma, have been indeed formulated by the stakeholders; yet, certain shortcomings have been noticed and these are primarily linked to the practical implementation of the national documents into real actions...|$|E
40|$|The {{main results}} of the paper are {{obtained}} where the education policy is chosen by the government maximizing the aggregate welfare of all individuals in a country. This {{seems to be a}} reasonable approximation to reality, where education policies are often determined by government bureaucracies rather than by a referendum or other voting process. Nonetheless, it is still possible that they are indirectly affected by voter preferences, for example, through the choice of the ruling party or the education minister. We develop a full-blown political economy model in this section based on both the majority voting rule and the probabilistic voting approach, and show that our main result (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>educational</b> choices become more divergent after trade) still holds under a variety of reasonable political scenarios.
