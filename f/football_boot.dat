25|$|In 2013, with advancements in technology, Nike used Kevlar in {{shoes for}} the first time. It {{launched}} the Elite II Series, with enhancements to its earlier version of basketball shoes by using Kevlar in the anterior {{as well as the}} shoe laces. This was done to decrease the elasticity of the tip of the shoe in contrast to nylon used conventionally as Kevlar expanded by about 1% against nylon which expanded by about 30%. Shoes in this range included LeBron, HyperDunk and Zoom Kobe VII. However these shoes were launched at a price range much higher than average cost of basketball shoes. It was also used in the laces for the adidas F50 adiZero Prime <b>football</b> <b>boot.</b>|$|E
500|$|Between 1888 and 1894 McGregor {{also served}} as {{chairman}} of The Football Association (the FA), English football's overall governing body, which had existed since 1863. He became known as a football celebrity, writing a weekly column for the Birmingham Gazette and endorsing products such as footballs, and a type of <b>football</b> <b>boot</b> which the manufacturer billed as the [...] "McGregor lace-to-toe boot". Though he held many different administrative posts in his lifetime, McGregor never played the sport competitively; his only on-pitch involvement was occasional goalkeeping during Aston Villa practices in the 1870s.|$|E
50|$|For indoor <b>football,</b> indoor <b>boots</b> are used. These {{come with}} rubber soles, meant to {{maximize}} {{grip on the}} floor. Some are built {{on the design of}} firm-ground <b>football</b> <b>boots,</b> and some are specifically designed for the indoor game. For football on turf or artificial grass, some players wear regular firm ground <b>football</b> <b>boots.</b> But wearing regular <b>football</b> <b>boots</b> on turf greatly reduces the life of the boot, so companies such as Nike have developed <b>football</b> <b>boots</b> for artificial grass (AG).|$|R

2500|$|McManaman's {{image of}} being a {{contract}} rebel and mercenary was exacerbated by his involvement in a year-long dispute between 1997 and 1998 with Umbro, his <b>football</b> <b>boot</b> sponsor. Umbro sued him for breach of contract for knowingly wearing Reebok branded boots in contravention of the deal, and deliberately [...] "blacking out" [...] their logo on his boots in protest. McManaman argued that his contract was unenforceable and an unlawful restraint of trade. McManaman claimed {{that he was being}} exploited. He hired the services of agent Simon Fuller to help free him from the sponsorship contract. The court initially ordered McManaman to fulfil his contract, plus an undertaking to pay Umbro's legal costs for launching contempt of court proceedings against him in 1997, which McManaman accepted and apologised for. A year on, however, McManaman continued to dishonour the deal. He finally won an out-of-court settlement in October 1998, freeing him to negotiate with other companies for what he regarded as remuneration appropriate to his status. The case, in addition to his Liverpool contract wrangles saw the media describe McManaman as the [...] "star performer in his own soap", though McManaman's Liverpool manager Roy Evans defended the player, stating, [...] "Macca is so laid-back you would never know he was hurting inside. But he has been. Some of the criticisms have been so unfair. Typical of Macca, he's responded magnificently." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Jacob Dodson, {{interviewed by}} the Manchester Weekly <b>Football</b> <b>Boot,</b> stated that his decision, arrived at after a close and careful study {{of the work of}} both teams, was that Houndsditch Wednesday had rather less chance in the {{forthcoming}} tourney than a stuffed rat in the Battersea Dogs' Home. It was his carefully-considered opinion that in a contest with the second eleven of a village Church Lads' Brigade, Houndsditch Wednesday might, with an effort (conceding them that slice of luck which so often turns the tide of a game), scrape home. But when {{it was a question of}} meeting a team like Manchester United--here Mr Dodson, shrugging his shoulders despairingly, sank back in his chair, and watchful secretaries brought him round with oxygen.|$|E

50|$|The {{possible}} {{merits of}} this variation {{can be derived}} from the difference between stud-less training shoes and <b>football</b> <b>boots</b> with studs. The studs of <b>football</b> <b>boots</b> provide less contact area with the ball when compared to a stud-less shoe, thereby increasing the possibility of the move being unsuccessful. However, since Zidane has performed both versions of the move using studded boots, it is possible that his decision is based on instinct.|$|R
