50|$|The fall of Carthage {{was at the}} end of {{the third}} Punic War in 146 BC. In spite of the initial devastating Roman naval losses at the {{beginning}} of the series of conflicts and Rome's recovery from the brink of defeat after the terror of a 15-year occupation of much of Italy by Hannibal, the end of the series of wars resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by Scipio Aemilianus. The Romans pulled the Phoenician warships out into the harbor and burned them before the city, and went from house to <b>house,</b> <b>slaughtering</b> and enslaving the people. The city was set ablaze, and in this way was razed with only ruins and rubble to field the aftermath.|$|E
40|$|This {{bulletin}} is {{a report}} of some recent developments in livestock marketing practices abroad. Several years ago we began to feel that our livestock marketing research would benefit from an investigation of marketing methods in other countries. Accordingly, while I was visiting several European countries during the last 4 months of 1935, I paid particular attention to their livestock marketing methods. Two countries were particularly interesting—Denmark, which has a world wide reputation for advanced marketing methods, and Great Britain, which, until quite recently, has been very backward in that respect. My investigation was then rounded out {{in the fall of}} 1936 by a month spent in Canada, which is a country of special interest because of its proximity and similarity to the United States. In these three countries, every opportunity was given me to study livestock marketing from the ground up. I spent days and weeks in local auction markets, in central or terminal stockyards, on packing <b>house</b> <b>slaughtering</b> and processing floors, and in the offices of farmers’ representatives, packing house managers, and government men...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an overall view of major sources {{that may lead}} to the pollution of the Tigris within Mosul city. A stretch exceeding 20 kms in length is selected that represents the Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â˜sickÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™ path of the river. Many sites along the studied stretch are likely to affect the river quality in some way or another. Samples from 40 sources sites are taken for quality analyses These sources Ã¢Â€Â“ as huge as 400000 m 3 a day Ã¢Â€Â“ are characterized as (medium Ã¢Â€Â“ strong) in composition. Such wastewaters with the pollutants they carry alter the river water quality rendering it unsuitable for beneficial uses. Such alterations Ã¢Â€Â“ do leave Ã¢Â€Â“many negative consequences concerning human beings and aquatic life. It is found that domestic discharges are among the most important sources of pollution. Sanitary wastes are often discharged Ã¢Â€Â“ untreated -into the Tigris. Other illegal practices such as in- <b>house</b> <b>slaughtering</b> add to the pollution as well. Industrial, tourist and institutional wastes put an additional burden on pollution of the river water quality. These wastes contain lead, chrome, and other heavy metals that may pose health risks. Wastewater treatment plants that exist in some sectors do not perform as they are expected. They need proper evaluation and rehabilitation. Eutrophication - a characteristic problem in lakes - finds an access to occur into the Tigris. This problem results from intensive use of detergents rich in nutrients (P&N compounds). In general, pollutants of different sources heavily affect the river water. Recovery and self purification of the river is estimated to occur at 40 km far from reference point. The paper concludes with the necessity of construction of a central treatment plant(s) or tackling the pollutants at their origin. The paper also stresses on importance of environmental education and awareness in order to combat pollution problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{livestock}} marketing {{methods in}} the Ryukyus are not operated satisfactorily. Butchers are taking multiple {{roles in the}} distribution of livestock products. That is, the butchers purchase live-hogs from producers, dress them at the <b>slaughter</b> <b>house,</b> and then directly sell the meat to consumers. The <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> are the center of the hog transaction and occupy an important position in the local market. There are 31 <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> of various sizes on the islands now : 27 in Okinawa Islands; 1 in Miyako; and 3 in Yaeyama. About 280, 000 head of hogs were slaughtered there in 1970. It is often said that the existed <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> hamper the efficient livestock marketing activities. However, no studies were made for them to the present time. The {{purpose of this study is}} to grasp the present status of the <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> and to find out problems that need to be improved. From the analysis of the present <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses,</b> the following problems are found out : 1) Based on the number of hogs slaughtered per year, the number of <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> in operation is large, and in general, most of them are very small in size and operated inefficiently. 2) There are too many butchers in slaughtering work and hog marketing. 3) Management of the small sized <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> is not done successfully, because of a small number of hogs slaughtered and a small income. 4) <b>Slaughter</b> <b>house</b> facilities are very poor in general. With few exceptions, hogs are slaughtered under poor sanitary conditions. Sanitary conditions of the large scale <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> are considered adequate and hog slaughtering facilities are properly maintained. However sanitary conditions of the small scale are far from being adequate. For improving such a situation, consideration should be given reducing the number of the <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses</b> and also the number of the butchers. A new meat center should be formed in main area by a consolidation of the present <b>slaughter</b> <b>houses.</b> The center will have cold storage and operate an auction market for the meat. Therefore, the former methods of livestock and meat transaction should be changed. The Okinawan people have not yet acquired the taste for chilled (frozen) pork and there is little demand for the product. Therefore, a consumer education on chilled (frozen) pork consuption should be initiated by the GRI. Timely market information on supply, demand, and prices will be provided by the center to every producers. This information will assist producers develop a more efficient production and marketing system and make it possible to adjust shipments of hogs, thus contributing to the stabilization of prices. The establishment of a new meat center can eliminate unfair transactions between the butchers and producers such as unfair grading, price discrimination, and other harmful practices of the butchers...|$|R
