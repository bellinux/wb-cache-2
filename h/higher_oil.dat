40|$|The current grain {{marketing}} {{system is not}} designed to handle specialty grains, as specialty grains must be segregated from commodities to preserve the value-added traits. Tighter supply chain management is needed to coordinate the flow of grain from the producer to the end-user, {{and to keep the}} grain identity-preserved (IP). ^ The objectives of this study were: (1) To determine the demand for <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn as an input in swine and broiler feed rations; (2) To evaluate the risks and returns to producing <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn on cash-grain farms; and (3) To evaluate alternative <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn supply chains. ^ A stochastic programming (SP) feed-mix model, incorporating energy and protein content variability, was used to determine the quantity of commodity corn, <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn, and choice white grease fed in hog and broiler rations. The ration data generated by the SP model was used to estimate a constant elasticity of substitution demand system for commodity corn, <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn, and choice white grease. ^ The cross-price elasticities of demand for commodity corn and <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn indicate a high degree of substitution. Because commodity corn and <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn are close substitutes, the value of <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn is capped by the cost of purchasing commodity corn and choice white grease. ^ A stochastic simulation model was used to compare the per acre return over variable costs for commodity and <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn production. The simulation model incorporated yield risk, oil content variability, price risk, and buyer 2 ̆ 7 s call risk. The results indicate that <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn does not provide any diversification benefits. Risk averse producers would plant a corn-soybean rotation, while risk neutral producers would plant <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn. <b>High</b> <b>oil</b> corn production is a way to increase expected returns, but will not reduce the variability of returns. ^ A price-endogenous model determined market equilibrium prices and demand for commodity corn and <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn, and indicated which supply chains handled <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn. The results indicated that energy variability in <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn limits the demand for <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn. The demand for <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> corn diminished as producers demanded more consistent ingredients for their feed rations. Finally, the results also indicated that grain deficit areas such as the southeast may be viable markets for creating a high-oil corn supply chain. ...|$|R

25|$|Because {{the slate}} of {{chemical}} products {{that can be}} made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from natural gas and petroleum, the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa, China, India and the United States where there are abundant coal resources. The abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in China is strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry pursued there. In the United States, the best example of the industry is Eastman Chemical Company which has been successfully operating a coal-to-chemicals plant at its Kingsport, Tennessee, site since 1983.

2500|$|In {{comparison}} with terrestrial-based biofuel {{crops such as}} corn or soybeans, microalgal production results in a much less significant land footprint due to the <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> productivity from the microalgae than all other oil crops. [...] Algae can also be grown on marginal lands useless for ordinary crops and with low conservation value, and can use water from salt aquifers that is not useful for agriculture or drinking. Algae can also grow {{on the surface of}} the ocean in bags or floating screens. Thus microalgae could provide a source of clean energy with little impact on the provisioning of adequate food and water or the conservation of biodiversity. Algae cultivation also requires no external subsidies of insecticides or herbicides, removing any risk of generating associated pesticide waste streams. [...] In addition, algal biofuels are much less toxic, and degrade far more readily than petroleum-based fuels. [...] However, due to the flammable nature of any combustible fuel, there is potential for some environmental hazards if ignited or spilled, as may occur in a train derailment or a pipeline leak. [...] This hazard is reduced compared to fossil fuels, due to the ability for algal biofuels to be produced in a much more localized manner, and due to the lower toxicity overall, but the hazard is still there nonetheless. [...] Therefore, algal biofuels should be treated in a similar manner to petroleum fuels in transportation and use, with sufficient safety measures in place at all times.|$|E

As the global climate change has made energy related issues popular, it has also stimulated the debate over the peaking of oil production and the future of oil based economy. There is a lot of speculation about these topics as nobody knows the exact situation of the remaining <b>oil</b> reserves. <b>High</b> <b>oil</b> price, which is usually a result from tight oil supply, can affect negatively to the whole global economy.

The oil production peak predictions and their background were critically assessed and a picture from the oil supply and the price formation was consisted with the aid of related literature. The main insight from the literature was that as cheap conventional oil becomes more difficult to find, the oil supply remains tight in the future. The price formation of oil was revealed to be affected by multiple factors and its long term development is difficult to predict. The possible effects of the <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> prices were then derived from the expert literature related to peaking of <b>oil</b> production and <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> prices and a data content analysis made by the author.
