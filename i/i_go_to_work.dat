And I've got opportunities I wouldn't have otherwise. And, you know, they make great music and I'm proud of my dad and whatever.'

The other three are his wife, daughters, and [...] "a hot, chewy roll of buttered dough" [...] (e.g. soft pretzels).

He also enjoys the cakes that accompany office birthdays, but doesn't like Oscar's suggestion that he eat a healthy apple to ward off insulin shock in their absence. Stanley used to drive a late-model Lincoln LS, and as of season three, he drives a white Chrysler 300. In the episode [...] "Safety Training", Michael inadvertently bounces a watermelon onto Stanley's car.
