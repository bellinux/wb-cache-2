60|$|There being now a {{great many}} parties in the streets, each went to work {{according}} to its humour, and a dozen houses were quickly blazing, including those of Sir John Fielding and two other justices, and four in Holborn--one of the greatest thoroughfares in London--which were all burning at the same time, and burned until they went out of themselves, for the people cut the <b>engine</b> <b>hose,</b> and would not suffer the firemen to play upon the flames. At one house near Moorfields, they found {{in one of the}} rooms some canary birds in cages, and these they cast into the fire alive. The poor little creatures screamed, it was said, like infants, when they were flung upon the blaze; and one man was so touched that he tried in vain to save them, which roused the indignation of the crowd, and nearly cost him his life.|$|E

50|$|In the US {{the junior}} officer grade {{of the fire}} service is the lieutenant. The most common {{insignia}} for fire department lieutenants are collar and cover devices commonly called bugles (though they are really representative of 18th century speaking trumpets); a lieutenant usually displays a single silver bugle, though some variations exist. In addition to the bugle, lieutenants often display a single silver sleeve band and wear a helmet of a different color from those worn by their subordinates, most usually limited to a white helmet shield on a black or red helmet (jurisdictionally dependant). Many cities and towns, however, employ {{a wide variety of}} other ranks and insignia. Lieutenants are typically responsible for an individual <b>engine,</b> <b>hose</b> tender, rescue squad, fire boat or ladder company and its crew.|$|E

50|$|The RAC {{introduced}} uniformed mobile patrols {{around the}} roads of Britain during 1901 with the patrolmen wearing a uniform {{not unlike the}} military police of the day, including tailored jodhpur trousers.

Mounted on Matchless motorbikes with sidecars containing a tool kit, fanbelts, <b>engine</b> <b>hoses,</b> and metal cans of spare petrol they were usually located on standby at laybys and major road junctions. Until around 1930 control could only contact the mobile patrolmen by telephone, so they waited by public telephone boxes for the callout. From 1957 onwards they were equipped with radio sets for two way contact with their local headquarters.|$|R

All pipe, pumps, <b>engines,</b> <b>hose,</b> tools, and Victaulic couplings were standard commercial design.” Victaulic couplings or similarly designed couplings, consisting of a synthetic rubber gasket {{held in place by}} two semicircular metal castings, were used to assemble pipelines that would establish fuel dumps to the front line and keep the troops well supplied.|$|R
