40|$|This paper {{uses the}} opening, high, low, and closing prices of five energy futures to {{estimate}} and model volatility {{based on the}} unbiased extreme value volatility estimator (the Add RS estimator). The statistical and distributional properties of the logarithm of the Add RS estimator {{support the use of}} the appropriate order linear long-memory Gaussian model (ARFIMA-Add RS model) to model the Add RS estimator. The out-of-sample evaluation analysis indicates that the volatility forecasts based on the ARFIMA-Add RS model provide superior forecasts of realised volatility of energy futures in relation to the alternative models from the GARCH family. This suggests that the ARFIMA-Add RS model can be a viable candidate for generating more accurate forecasts of realised volatility for energy futures.

40|$|Combining establishment-level {{data from}} the 1999 – 2003 Manufacturing Industry Surveys and the 2007 Industrial Census of Thailand, this paper {{examines}} and documents the relationships between establishment-level profitability and three types of international traders- exporters, <b>importers</b> <b>and</b> two-way <b>traders</b> in Thai manufacturing. The main analysis {{is divided into three}} parts. First, we empirically measure trader profitability premia for various profit measures such as operating profit, sales profit, and the rate of profit. Second, we test for trader profitability premia by running regressions of different profit measures on trader status using probit estimation to provide further evidence. Third, we examine whether trade activities are related to firm profitability. Comparing between four groups of firms: two-way traders (being both exporters <b>and</b> <b>importers),</b> only exporters, only <b>importers,</b> <b>and</b> firms that do not trade internationally, the results generally reveal that exporters tend to be the most profitable groups of internationally functioning firms. Two-way <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> <b>importers</b> are roughly the same in terms of profit performance, and firms with no trade are the least profitable as there is evidence for international trader profitability premia. We additionally find that there is a positive correlation between being various types of <b>traders</b> <b>and</b> firm profitability. Particularly, being an exporter is mostly and strongly correlated with an increase in sales profit and the rate of profit of a firm...|$|R

In the early 1980 s, Moroccan agriculture, indeed the Moroccan economy, was highly regulated with important state interventions throughout the system. Sectoral adjustment in the industrial sector {{began in the early}} 1980 s and in agriculture in the late 1980 s. Morocco was an active participant in the GATT round of trade negotiations, and even hosted the signing of the agreement in Marrakech. In accordance with its GATT offer, Morocco converted its quantitative (licensing) import restrictions to tariffs. In 1996, a major reform was implementing in its agricultural tariff regime as well as domestic marketing regulations. Private <b>importers</b> <b>and</b> domestic <b>traders</b> gained substantial freedom of operation. In 1998, protection was reduced on maize. In 2000, the entire system of oilseed chain protection and subsidies of vegetable oils was reformed. In 2003, another tariff reform was implemented for cereals.

40|$|Since their {{introduction}} in 1994, {{more and}} more genetically modified (GM) crops are grown worldwide and introduced in food or feed products. In the European Union (EU), the production, trade and marketing of GM products is strictly regulated, but the situation is becoming more complex due to the increasing number and complexity of GM crops, and asynchronic approval procedures with the major GM crop producing countries. <b>Importers</b> <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> are obliged to assess their respective supply chains for the potential presence of authorised and unauthorised GM organisms (GMOs), where wrong decisions may lead to substantial economic losses. This article presents a decision support system SIGMO aimed at guiding producers and traders with {{the assessment of the}} likelihood that their products may comprise authorised or unauthorised GM materials. The assessment is based on traceability data about the product (nature and origin of the raw materials, transportation aspects), as well as analytical results of the presence of GMOs in the final product or its ingredients. The approach uses a combination of data-driven and model-driven decision support. SIGMO is composed of (1) a data base providing data about GMO crop species produced and approved in counties worldwide, (2) a multi-attribute model for the assessment of GMO presence in food/feed products, and (3) an on-line user interface. SIGMO helps producers and traders to better comply to valid EU GMO regulations and to better control their products and supply chains in terms of the unintended presence of (unauthorised) GMOs in a cost-effective way. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} marketing of vegetable seed in private sector as well as public sector in five selected areas of Bangladesh. Besides for traders` survey apart from above mentioned areas Mymensingh town and Dhaka city were selected. Three types of respondents, such as vegetable growers, seed traders and seed importers/producers were interviewed {{with the help of}} pretested questionnaire during January to April, 1998. 50 % of the seeds used were either retained by farmers from previous seasons or purchased from other farmers. Traders handled 48 per cent of the seed and the remaining two per cent was marketed by public sector. <b>Importers</b> <b>and</b> <b>traders</b> purchased seed at Tk. 502190. 47 and 140913. 33 per quintal, respectively. The production cost of seed producing farm was Tk. 162236. 84. Seed was sold by importers, traders and producing farms at Tk. 590790. 47, 157836. 66 and Tk. 212052. 63 per quintal, respectively. So the gross return of importers, traders and seed producing farms were Tk. 88600. 00, 16923. 33 and Tk. 49815. 79 per quintal, respectively. Their marketing costs were Tk. 1177. 45, 719. 48 and Tk. 353. 04 respectively and net returns were Tk. 87422. 55, Tk. 16203. 85 and Tk. 49462. 75 respectively. The problems in vegetable production were: adulteration of seed, low germination of seed, problem of collecting import permit, lack of capital, problem of collecting clearing permit, lack of technological facilities, non-availability of experienced farmer and lack of modern storage facilities. To solve the above problems, the respondents suggested for ensuring the supply of required quality of seed in appropriate time at reasonable price, provision for Bank loan, improving Banking procedure, providing training facilities to the farmers, paying reasonable wage to farmers and development of storage facility...|$|E

40|$|Firms {{may benefit}} from {{proximity}} to each other due {{to the existence of}} several externalities. The productivity premia of firms located in agglomerated regions an be attributed to savings and gains from external economies. However, the capacity to absorb information may depend on activities of the firm, such as involvement in international trade. <b>Importers,</b> exporters <b>and</b> two-way <b>traders</b> are likely to employ a different bundle of resources and be organised differently so that they would appreciate inputs and information from other firms in a different fashion and intensity. Getting a better understanding of such external economies by looking at various types of firms is the focus of present paper. Using Hungarian manufacturing data from 1992 - 2003, we confirm that firms perform better in agglomerated areas <b>and</b> show that <b>traders</b> gain more in terms of productivity than non-traders when agglomeration rises. Firms that are stable participants of international trade gain 16 % in terms of total factor productivity growth as agglomeration doubles while non-traders may not benefit from agglomeration at all. Results also suggest that traders' productivity premium is most apparent in urbanised economies. agglomeration, international trade, firm heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|Constructing a {{comprehensive}} data set covering Dutch firms {{over the years}} 2002 - 2008 I am the first to investigate the relationship between trade status, firm size and firm-level productivity in the Netherlands, thereby focusing particularly on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The empirical evidence can be summarized in four stylized facts. The productivity ranking by trade status of Dutch manufacturing firms in increasing order of productivity is: non-traders, <b>importers,</b> exporters <b>and</b> two-way <b>traders.</b> Firm size <b>and</b> being controlled by a company located abroad are positively associated with firm-level productivity. The results point {{in the direction of}} self-selection of more productive manufacturing firms into importing, particularly for firms that did not trade altogether prior to the import start and for build-up periods of two and three years towards the import start. I do not find evidence that firms become more productive after an import start because of learning effects. I find considerable heterogeneity in the productivity premia of trade along the firm size distribution. The results suggest that exporting is more complex than sourcing inputs internationally for small firms relative to larger firms...|$|R

South Africa's re-integration {{into the}} global trading economy and its {{participation}} in various trade agreements has resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of import and export transactions processed by the South African Revenue Services Customs Division. <b>Importers</b> <b>and</b> Exporters are expanding into new markets and regions, which require them to adhere to the legislative administrative requirements, enforced at the various designated Customs branch offices. To achieve Customs compliance, it is necessary that <b>importers</b> <b>and</b> exporters make the correct declaration to the SARS and make available the appropriate documentary information to support import and export transactions. Also, increasing pressure from other government authority and government agencies makes it a prerequisite that any goods cleared for either import and export is properly declared taking cognisance of all Acts enforced by the SARS Customs Division.
