40|$|Microtubule inhibitors {{interfere}} with microtubule dynamics, causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These effects {{are responsible for}} the chemotherapeutic activities of members of the taxane and Vinca alkaloid families in oncology. Unfortu- nately, a major side effect of the taxanes and Vinca alkaloids is the development of peripheral neuropathies. <b>Indibulin</b> (N-[pyridin- 4 -yl]-[1 -(4 -chlorbenzyl) -indol- 3 -yl]-glyoxyl-amid; D- 24851; ZIO- 301), a novel synthetic small molecule microtu- bule inhibitor, destabilizes microtubules and has antitumor activity but does not exhibit neurotoxicity in preclinical animal studies. In the present study, it has been found that <b>indibulin</b> is able to discriminate between highly posttranslationally modified tubulin present in mature neuronal micro- tubules, and less-modified tubulin present in immature neuronal or nonneuronal microtubules. Vincristine and colchicine act on either tubulin equally well. The binding site of <b>indibulin</b> on mature neuronal microtubules seems to be inaccessible due to the posttranslational modifications, a theory that is supported by the observation that <b>indibulin</b> did not disrupt the integrity of highly modified microtubules present in neurites of pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells. The specificity of <b>indibulin</b> for unmodified microtubules seems to be dependent on the pyridyl moiety of <b>indibulin</b> because derivatives that have the pyridyl moiety replaced are not able to discriminate between highly and less-modified tubulins. The observed broad antitumor activity of <b>indibulin</b> and the lack of central and peripheral nervous system toxicity in preclinical studies make it a promising candidate for development as a cancer treatment. <b>Indibulin</b> is currently in phase I clinical trials...|$|E
