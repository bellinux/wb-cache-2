40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this paper is}} to {{investigate}} the effect of rotor tip gap size on how the rotor unsteady tip clearance flow structure changes in a low speed one and <b>half</b> <b>stage</b> axial compressor at near stall operation (for example, where maximum pressure rise is obtained). A Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is applied to calculate the unsteady flow field at this flow condition with both a small and a large tip gaps. The numerically obtained flow fields at the small clearance matches fairly well with the available initial measurements obtained at the Johns Hopkins University with 3 -D unsteady PIV in an index-matched test facility which renders the compressor blades and casing optically transparent. With this setup, the unsteady velocity field in the entire flow domain, including the flow inside the tip gap, can be measured. The numerical results are also compared with previously published measurements in a low speed single stage compressor (Maerz et al. [2002]). The current study shows that, with the smaller rotor tip gap, the tip clearance vortex moves to the leading edge plane at near stall operating condition, creating a nearly circumferentially aligned vortex that persists around the entire rotor. On the other hand, with a large tip gap, the clearance vortex stays inside the blade passage at near stall operation. With the large tip gap, flow instability and related large pressure fluctuation at the leading edge are observed in this one and a <b>half</b> <b>stage</b> compressor. Detailed examination of the unsteady flow structure in this compressor stage reveals that the flow instability is due to shed vortices near the leading edge, and not due to a three-dimensional separation vortex originating from the suction side of the blade, which is commonly referred to during a spike-type stall inception. The entire tip clearance flow is highly unsteady. Many vortex structures in the tip clearance flow, including the sheet vortex system near the casing, interact with each other. The core tip clearance vortex, which is formed with the rotor tip gap flows near the leading edge, is also highly unsteady or intermittent due to pressure oscillations near the leading edge and varies from passage to passage. For the current compressor stage, the evidence does not seem to support that a classical vortex breakup occurs in any organized way, even with the large tip gap. Although wakes from the IGV influence the tip clearance flow in the rotor, the major characteristics of rotor tip clearance flows in isolated or single stage rotors are observed in this one and a <b>half</b> <b>stage</b> axial compressor...|$|E

40|$|When a free falling object {{enters a}} free surface of water, it may go through four {{successive}} phases: impact, flow {{separation from the}} body surface, creation and pinch-off of the cavity above the body, and oscillation of cavity after the pinch-off. These phenomena have direct relevance to the effective design of freefall lifeboats. To understand such phenomena, numerical, theoretical and experimental methods are developed/conducted for the water entry of a free-falling wedge, which characterizes the bow section of a lifeboat. The present work focuses on {{the motion of the}} wedge and the dynamics of the cavity created {{on the top of the}} wedge and the influence of the cavity on the motion of the wedge. Non-linear boundary element methods were developed for simulating the water entry of the freefall wedge with and without the effect of air flow. It was found that the air flow starts to play an important role just before the closure of the cavity and the influence of air flow is limited due to the short duration. Numerical simulations showed that the initial entry speed of the wedge has a negligible influence on the closure period and the size of the cavity, but a significant influence on the submergence depth of the wedge at the closure of the cavity. The mass of the wedge strongly influences the formation and closure of cavities. A cavity will not be formed for light wedges. The cavity size is highly dependent on the mass. A larger mass leads to a larger cavity. The submergence depth at the closure of the cavity increases nearly linearly with mass, but the cavity closure period seems to be independent of the mass of the wedge. The influence of the deadrise angle was also investigated and it was found that the deadrise angle of the wedge has a weak influence on the formation and closure of cavities. Theoretical models were proposed to analyze the motions and cavity dynamics of free falling wedges entering the water surface. The theoretical model successfully predicted the peak acceleration and the evolution of submergence depth and velocity during the water entry of freefall wedges. It was revealed that slamming will significantly reduce the velocity of a light wedge, and there exists a critical initial entry velocity. If the initial velocity of wedge is less than the critical velocity, the velocity of wedge will increase after slamming phase; otherwise it will decrease. The theoretical models explained why the characteristics of the transient cavity, such as the nondimensional pinch-off (closure) time, pinch-off depth and wedge depth at pinch-off, scale roughly linearly as the Froude number (the dimensional pinch-off time is independent of the initial entry speed of the wedge, which is consistent with the finding of numerical simulations). The transient drag coefficients during the collapse phase of the cavity are extensively studied. It was found that for the light wedge the transient drag coefficients have slow variation in the first <b>half</b> <b>stage</b> and rapid variation in the last <b>half</b> <b>stage,</b> which is due to the fact that the hydrostatic force is the dominant component in the drag force at the last <b>half</b> <b>stage</b> for the light wedge. For the heavy wedge the transient drag coefficients vary slowly during the whole stage and can be treated as constant. The cavity closure point was found to move to the deeper water zone with increasing Froude number. This is opposite of the cavity seal mechanism from deep seal to surface seal for circular disks or spheres entering the water. The proposed numerical models and theoretical models were validated by experiments. The experiments also investigated the evolutions of the global hydrodynamic loads, the pressure on the impact side of the wedge, the air-water interface, and the cavity pressure after pinch-off. A typical evolution of the global hydrodynamic loads is found to be: rapid growth during slamming, rapid drop due to flow separation, slow variation during the formation of cavity and oscillation after the closure of cavity. The oscillation of the cavity pressure after pinch-off is a complex phenomenon. The oscillation frequency is related to the shape of the cavity, the mass of the wedge and the shape of the water surface, and the boundary conditions. The air leakage, thermal conductivity, and shear viscosity play important roles during the evolution of the closed cavity and directly affect the damping of the cavity pressure. As a first approximation, it can be assumed that the closed cavity has a uniform pressure field and follows an adiabatic process. PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of a large}} rotor tip gap on the {{performance}} of a one and <b>half</b> <b>stage</b> axial compressor are investigated in detail with a numerical simulation based on LES and available PIV data. The current paper studies the main flow physics, including why and how the loss generation is increased with the large rotor tip gap. The present study reveals that when the tip gap becomes large, tip clearance fluid goes over the tip clearance core vortex and enters into the next blade's tip gap, which is called double-leakage tip clearance flow. As the tip clearance flow enters into the adjacent blade's tip gap, a vortex rope with a lower pressure core is generated. This vortex rope breaks up the tip clearance core vortex of the adjacent blade, resulting in a large additional mixing. This double-leakage tip clearance flow occurs at all operating conditions, from design flow to near stall condition, with the large tip gap for the current compressor stage. The double-leakage tip clearance flow, its interaction with the tip clearance core vortex of the adjacent blade, and the resulting large mixing loss are the main flow mechanism of the large rotor tip gap in the compressor. When the tip clearance is smaller, flow near the end wall follows more closely with the main passage flow and this double-leakage tip clearance flow does not happen near the design flow condition for the current compressor stage. When the compressor with a large tip gap operates at near stall operation, a strong vortex rope is generated near the leading edge due to the double-leakage flow. Part of this vortex separates from the path of the tip clearance core vortex and travels from the suction side of the blade toward the pressure side of the blade. This vortex is generated periodically at near stall operation with a large tip gap. As the vortex travels from the suction side to the pressure side of the blade, a large fluctuation of local pressure forces blade vibration. Nonsynchronous blade vibration occurs due to this vortex as the frequency of this vortex generation {{is not the same as}} the rotor. The present investigation confirms that this vortex is a part of separated tip clearance vortex, which is caused by the double-leakage tip clearance flow...|$|E

This advanced compressor has been investigated both experimentally and analytically in the past. The measured compressor efficiency is significantly lower than the efficiency calculated with various existing tools based on RANS and URANS. The general understanding is that some important flow physics in this modern compressor design are not represented in the current tools. To pinpoint the source of the efficiency miss, an advanced test with detailed flow traverse was performed for the front one and a <b>half</b> <b>stage</b> at the NASA Glenn Research Center. In the present paper, a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is employed to determine whether a higher-fidelity simulation can pick up any additional flow physics that can explain past efficiency miss with RANS and URANS. The results from the Large Eddy Simulation were compared with the NASA test results and the GE interpretation of the test data. LES calculates lower total pressure and higher total temperature on the pressure side of the stator, resulting in large loss generation on the pressure side of the stator. On the other hand, existing tools based on the RANS and URANS do not calculate this high total temperature and low total pressure on the pressure side of the stator. The calculated loss through the stator from LES seems to match the measured data and the GE data interpretation. Detailed examination of the unsteady flow field from LES indicates that the accumulation of high loss near the pressure side of the stator is due to the interaction of the rotor wake with the stator blade. The strong rotor wake interacts quite differently with the pressure side of the stator than with the suction side of the stator blade. The concave curvature on the pressure side of the stator blade increases the mixing of the rotor wake with the pressure side boundary layer significantly. On the other hand, the convex curvature on the suction side of the stator blade decreases the mixing and the suction side blade boundary layer remains thin. The jet velocity in the rotor wake in the stator frame seems to magnify the curvature effect in addition to inviscid redistribution of wake fluid toward the pressure side of the blade...|$|E

NASA plans to continue human space exploration and space station utilization. Launch vehicles used for heavy lift cargo and crew will be needed. One of the current leading concepts for future heavy lift capability is an inline one and a <b>half</b> <b>stage</b> concept using solid rocket boosters (SRB) and based on current Shuttle technology and elements. Potentially, the quickest and most cost-effective path towards an operational vehicle of this configuration is to make use of a demonstrator vehicle fabricated from existing shuttle assets and relying upon the existing STS launch infrastructure. Such a demonstrator would yield valuable proof-of-concept data and would provide a working test platform allowing for validated systems integration. Using shuttle hardware such as existing RS- 25 D engines and partial MPS, propellant tanks derived from the External Tank (ET) design and tooling, and four-segment SRB s could reduce the associated upfront development costs and schedule when compared to a concept that would rely on new propulsion technology and engine designs. There are potentially several other additional benefits to this demonstrator concept. Since a concept of this type would be based on man-rated flight proven hardware components, this demonstrator has the potential to evolve into the first iteration of heavy lift crew or cargo and serve as a baseline for block upgrades. This vehicle could also serve as a demonstration and test platform for the Orion Program. Critical spacecraft systems, re-entry and recovery systems, and launch abort systems of Orion could also be demonstrated in early test flights of the launch vehicle demo. Furthermore, an early demonstrator of this type would provide a stop-gap for retaining critical human capital and infrastructure while affording the current emerging generation of young engineers opportunity to work with and capture lessons learned from existing STS program offices and personnel, who were integral in the design and development of the Space Shuttle before these resources are no longer available.

40|$|The present paper reports an {{investigation}} of unsteady loss generation in the stator due to the incoming rotor wake in an advanced GE transonic compressor design with a high-fidelity numerical method. This advanced compressor with high reaction and high stage loading has been investigated both experimentally and analytically in the past. The measured efficiency in this advanced compressor is {{significantly lower than the}} design intention/goal. The general understanding is that the current generation of compressor design/analysis tools miss some important flow physics in this modern compressor design. To pinpoint the source of the efficiency miss, an advanced test with a detailed flow traverse was performed for the front one and a <b>half</b> <b>stage</b> at the NASA Glenn Research Center. Detailed data-match analysis by GE identified an unexpected high loss generation in the pressure side of the stator passage. Higher total temperature and lower total pressure are measured near the pressure side of the stator. Various analyses based on the RANS and URANS of the compressor stage do not calculate the measured higher total temperature and lower total pressure on the pressure side of the stator. In the present paper, a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is applied to find the fundamental mechanism of this unsteady loss generation in the stator due to the incoming rotor wake. The results from the LES were first compared with the NASA test results and the GE interpretation of the test data. LES calculates lower total pressure and higher total temperature on the pressure side of the stator, as the measured data showed, resulting in large loss generation on the pressure side of the stator. Detailed examination of the unsteady flow field from LES shows that the rotor wake, which has higher total temperature and higher total pressure relative to the free stream, interacts quite differently with the pressure side of the blade compared to the suction side of the blade. The higher temperature in the wake remains high as the wake passes through the pressure side of the blade. On the other hand, the total temperature diffuses as it passes through near the suction surface. For the presently investigated compressor, the classical intra-stator wake transport to the pressure side of the blade by the slip velocity in the wake seems to be minor. The main causes of this phenomenon are three-dimensional unsteady vortex interactions near the blade surface. The stabilizing effect of the concave curvature on the suction side keeps the rotor wake thin. On the other hand, the destabilizing effect of the convex curvature of the pressure side makes the rotor wake thicker, which results in a higher total temperature measurement at the stator exit. Additionally, wake stretching through the stator seems to contribute to the redistribution of the total temperature and the loss generation...|$|E

The changes in unsteady tip clearance flow with the 0. 62 % tip gap as the flow rate is reduced to near stall condition are also investigated. A Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is applied to calculate the unsteady flow field at these three flow conditions. Detailed Stereoscopic PIV (SPIV) measurements of the current flow fields were also performed at the Johns Hopkins University in a refractive index-matched test facility which renders the compressor blades and casing optically transparent. With this setup, the unsteady velocity field in the entire flow domain, including the flow inside the tip gap, can be measured. Unsteady tip clearance flow fields from LES are compared with the PIV measurements and both LES and PIV results are used to study changes in tip clearance flow structures. The current study shows that the tip clearance vortex is not a single structure as traditionally perceived. The tip clearance vortex is formed by multiple interlaced vorticities. Therefore, the tip clearance vortex is inherently unsteady. The multiple interlaced vortices never roll up to form a single structure. When phased-averaged, the tip clearance vortex appears as a single structure. When flow rate is reduced with the same tip gap, the tip clearance vortex rolls further upstream and the tip clearance vortex moves further radially inward and away from the suction side of the blade. When the tip gap size is increased at the design flow condition, the overall tip clearance vortex becomes stronger and it stays closer to the blade suction side and the vortex core extends all the way to the exit of the blade passage. Measured and calculated unsteady flow fields inside the tip gap agree fairly well. Instantaneous velocity vectors inside the tip gap from both the PIV and LES do show flow separation and reattachment at the entrance of tip gap as some earlier studies suggested. This area at the entrance of tip gap flow (the pressure side of the blade) is confined very close to the rotor tip section. With a small tip gap (0. 5 mm), the gap flow looks like a simple two-dimensional channel flow with larger velocity near the casing for both flow rates. A small area with a sharp velocity gradient is observed just above the rotor tip. This strong shear layer is turned radially inward when it collides with the incoming flow and forms the core structure of the tip clearance vortex. When tip gap size is increased to 2. 4 mm at the design operation, the radial profile of the tip gap flow changes drastically. With the large tip gap, the gap flow looks like a two-dimensional channel flow only near the casing. Near the rotor top section, a bigger region with very large shear and reversed flow is observed...|$|E
