40|$|Carcass from 260 Simmental and 159 Brown bulls were {{dissected}} {{first to}} different cuts (chuck, shoulder, front shank, rib roast, back, loin, tenderloin, brisket, rib, flank, leg and <b>hind</b> <b>shank)</b> {{and then to}} lean, fat, tendon and bone. The comparison between two breeds was made at 12. 5 % carcass fat. Simmental breed had statistically significantly higher share of leg and brisket with rib and lower share of chuck, front and <b>hind</b> <b>shank,</b> rib roast, tenderloin and flank, with higher lean and lower bone percentage, but the differences were relatively small compared to Brown breed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{quantify}} basic feedlot performance and carcass value characteristics of Holstein bulls slaughtered as “young cattle” at 300 kg of live weight. The observation {{was carried out in}} a group of 12 Holstein bulls fattened in identical conditions and fed on a diet consisting of ad libitum amount of crushed grain (barley and wheat) and a limited amount of protein concentrate. The mean overall values were as follows: age and live weight at slaughter 275. 9 days and 299. 3 kg, daily weight gain and net weight gain since birth 0. 962 kg and 0. 527 kg, dressing percentage 48. 3 %, weight of cold right carcass half 71. 0 kg, weight of bones 17. 5 kg, weight of muscle 53. 0 kg and separable fat 0. 54 kg. The mean weight of hide was 21. 6 kg. The great majority of calves were classified as O 2, one calf graded R 2. The forequarter to hindquarter ratio was 1. 4 with mean weights 29. 1 kg and 41. 9 kg. The mean weight of neck was 3. 9 kg, chuck 3. 6 kg, shoulder 5. 9 kg, fore shank 3. 4 kg, loin 4. 1 kg, filet 1. 5 kg, round 18. 2 kg and <b>hind</b> <b>shank</b> 1. 3 kg. We found highly significant (P< 0. 01) coefficients of correlation between carcass weight and live weight at slaughter (r= 0. 963) or daily weight gain (r= 0. 723). Net weight gain since birth was highly significantly (P< 0. 01) correlated to live weight at slaughter (r= 0. 723) or to daily weight gain (r= 0. 982) and significantly correlated (P< 0. 05) to age at slaughter (r= – 0. 665). Despite the average or worse-than-average feedlot performance parameters our experimental Holstein bulls had an adequate proportion of muscle (comparable with other literature sources), a high ratio of bones and a very low proportion of fat. Thanks to small meat trim, weights of the main dissection parts of fore-and hindquarters were comparable to those usually found in young Holstein bulls...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} "The Influence of Genotype of Leptin Gene on Qualitative Characteristics of Beef" {{describes the}} effect of polymorphisms of gene of leptin on selected qualitative, morphometric and weight indicators of beef and carcass. The analysis was carried out on 333 bulls of Czech Fleckvieh, which were genotyped (by PCR/RFLP method) of chosen locus. This locus is associated with qualitative changes in beef according to previous foreign studies. The weight of carcass, fore and hind quarter of the right half of the carcass, {{the weight of the}} individual tissues (meat, bone, and fat) and the weight of main meaty parts from the right half of carcass were measured. Before the dissection chosen morphometric indicators were measured. After the dissection, a sample of the musculus longissimus lumborum et thoracis was taken and then analysed in the laboratory. Basic chemical composition (dry matter, fat content, protein, and ash), muscle fibers diameter and fatty acid profile was determined. In addition, pH, added water holding capacity, colour (CIE Lab colour coordinates) were analysed both for one-day post-mortem and after 14 days of ageing. The shear force (using the Warner-Bratzler probe) was evaluated at the same time intervals as for both raw and heat-treated samples by grilling. The studied LEP polymorphism had a statistically significant effect on the weight of the hot carcass, the weight of right half of carcass and fore and hind quarter. LEP polymorphism significantly affected the proportion of meat on the right half of carcass, the weight of the bones and total weight of the I. class meat, and the weight of the I. class meat in the fore quarter. Further, {{the effect of}} LEP polymorphism on the weight of boneless round, boneless chuck, plate, flank, rib, <b>hind</b> <b>shank,</b> and meat trimmings of fore quarter was found. In a group of morphometric indicators, the effect was significant on lengths of round, fullness of round and round circumference. In the case of chemical composition, the effect of LEP polymorphism on the intramuscular fat content was significant. From the qualitative indicators, the effect was significant on the pH value and added water holding capacity, both one-day post-mortem and after 14 days of ageing. In the case of tenderness, the effect on shear force of heat treated, non-aged meat was significant. From the indicators describing colour, a statistically significant effect on the indicator of lightness was found in the case of unconditioned meat and after 14 days of ageing the effect was significant on the indicator characterising yellow colour and the colour saturation. Determination of fatty acid profile was carried out by gas chromatography. The effects of studied polymorphism and differences between LEP genotypes were found in myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, linoleic, -linolenic, -linolenic, conjugated linoleic, eisocapentaenoic, docosatetraenoic, docosapentaenoic both n- 6 and n- 3 and docosahexaenoic acids. From aggregated indicators, the statistical significant effect of LEP polymorphims on PUFA content, omega- 3 fatty acids content, and omega- 6 /omega- 3 fatty acids ratio was found. In connection with other candidate gene loci influencing the quality of beef, the results of dissertation can be used in the preparation of breeding schemes aimed at the production of quality breeding animals, highlighting the higher quality standards of the produced meat...|$|E
60|$|Certain beetles {{have also}} been {{modified}} so as exactly to imitate wasps; and in these cases the beetle waist, usually so solid, thick, and clumsy, grows as slender and graceful as if the insects had been supplied with corsets by a fashionable West End house. But the greatest refinement of all is perhaps that noticed in certain allied species which mimic bees, and which have acquired useless little tufts of hair on their <b>hind</b> <b>shanks</b> to represent the dilated and tufted pollen-gathering apparatus of the true bees.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine {{the relationship between the}} ratio of the bones and valuable meat preparates to the carcass, the age and the sex parameters in Holstein and Swiss Braun race cattle which are widely breaded in our country. The half and quarter carcasses of the cattle that are slaughtered in Istanbul were used as working material. The carcasses were separated into 4 groups as above 3 years of age group (n= 24), under 3 years of age group (n= 46), male group (n= 53) and female group (n= 17). Totally 140 carcasses were evaluated. According to the obtained results, hind quarter weight, fillet, loin, rump, tranche, sirloin, round, flank, shank, brisket, fore loin, sticking, chuck and total bones parameters were significantly different at (p< 0. 001) level between above the 3 years of age and under the 3 years of age group. Between the same groups the sirloin tip parameter was significantly different at p< 0. 01 level. At the parameters of leg weight, shank and half carcasses {{there was no significant difference}} between the groups. We could not determine any significant differences in the percentage ratio of all meat parameters to the carcass between the groups of above 3 years of age and under 3 years of age. In the male and female groups, all the parameters except loin, leg weight and shank were significantly different between the 2 groups. <b>Hind</b> quarter and <b>shank</b> parameters were significantly different at p< 0. 05 level, round parameter was significantly different at p< 0. 01 level, and the other valuable meat propagates were significantly different at p< 0. 001 level. Rump parameter was evaluated as significantly different at p< 0. 05 level between male and female groups. The other parameters were not significantly different between the mentioned groups...|$|R
