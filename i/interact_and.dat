5|$|Predators and prey <b>interact</b> <b>and</b> coevolve, the {{predator}} {{to catch the}} prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|A {{planet that}} can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not {{originate}} there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and <b>interact,</b> <b>and</b> sufficient energy to sustain metabolism. The distance of Earth from the Sun, {{as well as}} its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, with a {{group of}} twenty-five other businessmen, Lilly began {{sponsoring}} the Charity Organization Society and soon became the primary patron of its Indiana chapter. The society merged with other charitable organizations to form the Family Welfare Society of Indianapolis, a forerunner to the Family Service Association of Central Indiana and the United Way. The associated group organized charitable groups under a central leadership structure that allowed them to easily <b>interact</b> <b>and</b> better assist people by coordinating their efforts and identifying areas with the greatest need.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) is the relativistic {{quantum field theory}} of electrodynamics. In essence, it describes how light and matter <b>interact</b> <b>and</b> is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved. QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction.|$|E
5|$|The New Age {{has also}} been {{identified}} by various scholars of religion {{as part of the}} cultic milieu. This concept, developed by the sociologist Colin Campbell, refers to a social network of marginalised ideas.

5|$|While {{predictions}} of the future can never be absolutely certain, present understanding in various fields allows for the prediction of far-future events, if only in the broadest outline. These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, <b>interact,</b> <b>and</b> die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.|$|E
5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants <b>interact</b> <b>and</b> respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E
5|$|The game's storyline {{focuses on}} {{a young man named}} Wander who enters a {{forbidden}} land. Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with whom to <b>interact,</b> <b>and</b> no enemies to defeat other than the colossi. Shadow of the Colossus {{has been described as a}} puzzle game, as each colossus' weakness must be identified and exploited before it can be defeated.|$|E

5|$|Muramasa was {{worked on}} by 16 people, {{over half the}} entire staff of Vanillaware, {{including}} Kamitani as the game's writer. The Wii {{was chosen as the}} game's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2, the console for which Odin Sphere was developed. This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware. Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but went undeveloped due to budget limitations. Using the Wii's motion controls was tested by the team, but due to the game's old-fashioned style there was little need to implement them. The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics, especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game's scenery to <b>interact</b> <b>and</b> respond properly. They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum, which was made possible due to the Wii's area pre-loading abilities. Technical tinkering of this kind went on until the end of development. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, whose biggest challenge was creating a battle system which allowed for cancelling of attacks, while maintaining the appearance of smooth attack animation. The resultant code looked so strange that another programmer thought it was a fault and deleted it, forcing Ohnishi to rebuild it. The team was highly dedicated {{to the success of the}} project, putting a large amount of work to make it as good as it could be for players. By the time of release, funds for the company had been drained.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive cursor. The cursor changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can <b>interact,</b> <b>and</b> {{can be used to}} talk to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking {{on the edge of the}} screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.|$|E
