500|$|Harriet Hanson Robinson, an eleven-year-old <b>doffer</b> at {{the time}} of the strike, {{recalled}} in her memoirs: [...] "One of the girls stood on a pump and gave vent to the feelings of her companions in a neat speech, declaring that it was their duty to resist all attempts at cutting down the wages. This was the first time a woman had spoken in public in Lowell, and the event caused surprise and consternation among her audience." ...|$|E
6000|$|Night had fallen, the {{electric}} arcs burned blue overhead, {{she was in}} another street--was it Stanley? Sounds of music reached her, the rumble of marching feet; dark, massed figures were in the distance swimming toward her along the glistening line of the car tracks, and she heard the shrill whistling of the <b>doffer</b> boys, who acted {{as a sort of}} fife corps in these parades--which by this time had become familiar to the citizens of Hampton. And Janet remembered when the little red book that contained the songs had arrived at Headquarters from the west and had been distributed by thousands among the strikers. She recalled the words of this song, though the procession was as yet too far away for her to distinguish them:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|She remembered, oddly, the Stanley Street bridge {{where the}} many streams met and mingled, streams from the Arundel, the Patuxent, the Arlington and the Clarendon; and, eager to prolong and intensify her sensations, hurried thither, {{reaching}} it at last and thrusting her way outward {{until she had}} gained the middle, where she stood grasping the rail. The great structure was a-tremble from the assault, its footpaths and its roadway overrun with workers, dodging between trolleys and trucks,--some darting nimbly, dinner pails in hand, along the steel girders. <b>Doffer</b> boys romped and whistled, young girls in jaunty, Faber Street clothes and flowered hats, linked to one another for protection, chewed gum and joked, {{but for the most}} part these workers were silent, the apathy of their faces making a strange contrast with the hurry, hurry of their feet and set intentness of their bodies as they sped homeward to the tenements. And the clothes of these were drab, save when the occasional colour of a hooded peasant's shawl, like the slightly faded tints of an old master, lit up a group of women. Here, going home to their children, were Italian mothers bred through centuries to endurance and patience; sallow Jewesses, gaunt, bearded Jews with shadowy, half-closed eyes and wrinkled brows, broad-faced Lithuanians, flat-headed Russians; swarthy Italian men and pale, blond Germans mingled with muddy Syrians and nondescript Canadians. And suddenly the bridge was empty, the army vanished as swiftly as it came! ...|$|E
50|$|Children were {{employed}} in the mills as spinners, sweepers and <b>doffers,</b> with girls usually starting as spinners and boys as <b>doffers</b> and sweepers. When the bobbins on the spinning frames were full, the machinery stopped. The <b>doffers</b> would swarm into the mill and, as quickly as possible, change all the bobbins, after which the machinery would be restarted and the <b>doffers</b> were free to amuse themselves until the next change-over. On the newer and taller frames, the <b>doffers</b> often had to climb to reach the bobbins.|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "The Doffing Mistress" [...] {{is about}} flax {{spinning}} in Northern Ireland and describes the <b>doffers</b> {{respect for their}} mistress. The line [...] "she hangs her coat on the highest pin" [...] is because the <b>doffer's</b> work could lead to deformity of the spine.|$|R

6000|$|Caldwell stood {{close to}} her, {{shouting}} his explanations in her ear, while she strained to follow them. But she was bewildered and entranced by the marvellous swiftness, accuracy and {{ease with which}} each of the complex machines, fed by human hands, performed its function. These human hands were swift, too, as when they thrust the bobbins of roving on the ring-spinning frames to be twisted into yarn. She saw a woman, {{in the space of}} an instant, mend a broken thread. Women and boys were here, <b>doffer</b> boys to lift off the full bobbins of yarn with one hand and set on the empty bobbins with the other: while skilled workmen, alert for the first sign of trouble, followed up and down in its travels the long frame of the mule-spinner. After the spinning, the heavy spools of yarn were carried to a beam-warper, standing alone like a huge spider's web, where hundreds of threads were stretched symmetrically and wound evenly, side by side, on a large cylinder, forming the warp of the fabric to be woven on the loom. First, however, this warp must be stiffened or [...] "slashed" [...] in starch and tallow, dried over heated drums, and finally wound around one great beam from which the multitude of threads are taken up, one by one, and slipped {{through the eyes of the}} loom harnesses by women who sit all day under the north windows overlooking the canal--the [...] "drawers-in" [...] of whom Ditmar had spoken. Then the harnesses are put on the loom, the threads attached to the cylinder on which the cloth is to be wound. The looms absorbed and fascinated Janet above all else. It seemed as if she would never tire of watching the rhythmic rise and fall of the harnesses,--each rapid movement making a V in the warp, within the angle of which the tiny shuttles darted to and fro, to and fro, carrying the thread that filled the cloth with a swiftness so great the eye could scarcely follow it; to be caught on the other side when the angle closed, and flung back, and back again! And in the elaborate patterns not one, but several harnesses were used, each awaiting its turn for the impulse bidding it rise and fall!... Abruptly, as she gazed, one of the machines halted, a weaver hurried up, searched the warp for the broken thread, tied it, and started the loom again.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{people have}} given credit to Richard Arkwright for inventing the <b>doffer,</b> which was {{incorporated}} in his machine, but others consider {{that it was}} invented by James Hargreaves. The design was refined by Samuel Crompton shortly after 1785. Before {{the surface of the}} carding cylinder reaches the <b>doffer</b> it passes a [...] "fancy roller", which brushes and raises the fibers on the cylinder so they can be transferred to the <b>doffer</b> more easily. In a wool mill a <b>doffer</b> would move relatively slowly compared {{to the surface of the}} carding cylinder, picking up the fiber. The fiber would then be removed from the <b>doffer</b> by a comb.|$|E
50|$|By 1900 in Crown Mills, Whitfield County, Georgia, {{the average}} <b>doffer</b> was {{fourteen}} years old.A <b>doffer</b> in North Carolina in 1904 would earn $2.40 per week, while a head <b>doffer</b> would earn $3.50. Skilled workers would earn more. A drawing-in girl could make $6.00, a warper $7.50 and an engineer up to $9.00, while the weave boss made {{as much as}} $15.00. The working week would be ten hours a day from Monday to Saturday. In 1907, a <b>doffer</b> in North Carolina only had to work about half the time, being able to play baseball, swim in the local river or otherwise relax until the whistle of the head <b>doffer</b> called {{them back to the}} mill. If a rural mill depended on a water wheel for power, a drought could provide more free time as the mill would only run a few hours each day.|$|E

50|$|Various inventors {{proposed}} improvements. Thus, in October 1835 Stephen R. Parkhurst filed {{a patent}} for a <b>doffer</b> {{made of a}} set of parallel wheels with rims about four inches wide, separated by an inch or slightly more. By setting the wheels at a slight angle, the whole surface of the main cylinder would be cleared by them. This <b>doffer</b> would feed a system of rollers that could feed the fiber onto spools or into machines that would immediately twist it into a thread.However, the ring <b>doffer</b> was relatively inefficient.|$|E

50|$|<b>Doffers</b> in 1887 {{in a large}} mill in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, {{both boys}} and girls, earned 40 cents a day. In New England in the 1890s, the <b>doffers,</b> piecers and back boys had their own union, and were not {{admitted}} to the mule spinners' union, even though they often aspired to become mule spinners. Many left the industry rather than tolerate the conditions. William Madison Wood, the manager at the Washington Mill in Lawrence, Massachusetts instituted a system in 1895 where employees gained bonuses for meeting production quotas, {{as long as they}} missed no more than one day per month. The effect was that weavers drove spinners to produce, spinners drove <b>doffers</b> and so on, and that workers came in even when sick or injured. Wood then used the increased pay to justify running the looms at ever faster speeds.|$|R
5000|$|Confusingly, {{the word}} <b>doffer</b> (meaning {{something}} that takes off, as in [...] "doff your hat") {{is also used}} for mill workers {{whose job it is}} to remove full bobbins or pirns holding spun fiber and replace them with empty bobbins or pirns. In modern mills, a machine called a <b>doffer</b> may do this task.|$|E

50|$|During the {{industrial}} revolution, spinners, <b>doffers,</b> and sweepers {{were employed in}} spinning mills from the 18th to 20th centuries. Many mill owners preferred to employ children due to their small size and agility.|$|R
50|$|At 12 {{years of}} age, {{children}} could begin work at Avondale Mills as bobbin <b>doffers.</b> This was a fast-paced job that required dexterity but little technical skill. The {{room where the}} children worked became filled with lint from the operation. This got into their lungs, and the children often later developed brown lung disease as adults.|$|R
2500|$|In 1910, over 2 million {{children}} in the same age group were employed in the United States. [...] This included children who rolled cigarettes, engaged in factory work, worked as bobbin <b>doffers</b> in textile mills, worked in coal mines and were employed in canneries. Lewis Hine's photographs of child labourers in the 1910s powerfully evoked the plight of working {{children in the}} American south. [...] Hines took these photographs between 1908 and 1917 as the staff photographer for the National Child Labor Committee.|$|R

Between ten and twelve boys could handle a factory with about ten thousand throstle spindles, depending on the amount of yarn being spun.The <b>doffers</b> were usually the sons of poor people, and were small and skinny.

40|$|The authors {{present a}} VHDL design that {{incorporates}} optimizations {{intended to provide}} digital signature generation with as little power, space, and time as possible. These three primary objectives of power, size, and speed must be balanced along with other important goals, including flexibility of the hardware and ease of use. The highest-level function <b>doffered</b> by their hardware design is Elliptic Curve Optimal El Gamal digital signature generation. The parameters are defined over the finite field GF(2 {sup 178 }), which gives security that is roughly equivalent to that provided by 1500 -bit RSA signatures. The optimizations include using the point-halving algorithm for elliptic curves, field towers {{to speed up the}} finite field arithmetic in general, and further enhancements of basic finite field arithmetic operations. The result is a synthesized VHDL digital signature design (using a CMOS 0. 5 {micro}m, 5 V, 25 C library) of 191, 000 gates that generates a signature in 4. 4 ms at 20 MHz...|$|R

50|$|At first, {{the card}} {{clothing}} for wool mills {{was made in}} the form of sheets, and when attached to the cylinder and to all the rollers including the last <b>doffer</b> there were gaps of about an inch between the sheets. This made it impossible to make endless slubbings. Even when it became possible to wrap the <b>doffer</b> with fillet clothing with no gaps, sheets with gaps continued to be used because a continuous woolen sliver was too difficult to manage through the subsequent steps.|$|E
50|$|A doffing cylinder, {{also called}} doffing roller or {{commonly}} just <b>doffer</b> is a component used in textile mills to remove fiber {{from the main}} cylinder of a card, on which the fibers have been straightened and aligned. The main cylinder of the card will {{have one or two}} doffers that comb and remove the fiber. The <b>doffer</b> is set with pins that hold the fiber, which is then removed by a comb or knife and fed into the next stage of production. Doffers are also used in cotton pickers and other machinery that handle fiber.|$|E
