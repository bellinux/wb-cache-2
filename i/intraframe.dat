30|$|In video {{compression}} technologies, such as MEPG and H. 264 [4], encoded pictures (or frames) {{are arranged in}} groups of pictures (GOPs). An encoded video stream consists of successive GOPs. A GOP can contain the following frame types: I-frame, P-frame, and B-frame. The order of <b>intraframes</b> and interframes is specified in a GOP. An I-frame is a reference picture which is intracoded corresponding to a fixed image and it is independent of other pictures. A P-frame is predictive-coded frame which contains motion-compensated difference information from the preceding I- or P-frame. A B-frame is bidirectionally predictive-coded frame which contains different information from the preceding and following I- or P-frame within a GOP. I-frame and P-frame are {{often referred to as}} anchor frames. A GOP always begins with an I-frame. Afterwards, several P-frames follow. The B-frames are inserted between two consecutive anchor frames.|$|R

40|$|Rate control plays a {{key role}} in video coding standards. Its goal is to achieve a good quality at a given target bit-rate. In H. 264 /AVC, rate control {{algorithm}} for both Intra and Inter-frames suffers from some defects. In the Intra-frame rate control, the initial quantization parameter (QP) is mainly adjusted according to a global target bit-rate and length of GOP. This determination is inappropriate and generates errors in the whole of video sequence. For Inter coding unit (Frame or Macroblock), the use of MAD (Mean Average Differences) as a complexity measure, remains inefficient, resulting in improper QP values because the MAD handles locally images characteristics. QP miscalculations may also result from the linear prediction model which assumes similar complexity from coding unit to another. To overcome these defects, we propose in this paper, a new Rate-Quantization (R-Q) model resulting from extensive experiments. This latter is divided into two models. The first one is an Intra R-Q model used to determine an optimal initial quantization parameter for <b>Intraframes.</b> The second one is an Inter R-Q model that aims at determining the QP of Inter coding unit according to the statistics of the previous coded ones. It does not use any complexity measure and substitutes both linear and quadratic models used in H. 264 /AVC rate controller. Objective and subjective simulations have been carried out using JM 15. 0 reference software. Compared to this latter, the global R-Q model (Intra and Inte...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} and analyzes {{a new approach}} to data hiding that embeds in both the intra- and interframes from the H. 264 /AVC video codec. Most of the current video data hiding algorithms take into account only the <b>intraframes</b> for message embedding. This may be attributed to the perception that inter-frames are highly compressed due to the motion compensation, and any embedding message inside these may adversely affect the compression efficiency significantly. Payload of the inter-frames is also thought to be less, compared with the intra-frames, because of the lesser residual data. We analyze data hiding in both intra- and inter-frames over a wide range of QP values and observe that the payload of the inter is comparable with that of the intra-frames. Message embedding, in only those non-zero quantized transform coefficients (QTCs) which are above a specific threshold, enables us to detect and extract the message on the decoding side. There is no significant effect on the overall bitrate and PSNR of the video bitstream because instead of embedding message in the compressed bitstream, we have embedded it during the encoding process by taking into account the reconstruction loop. For the non-zero QTCs, in the case of intra-frames, we benefit from the spatial masking, while in the case of inter-frames, we exploit the motion and texture masking. We can notice that the data hiding is done during the compression process and the proposed scheme takes into account the reconstruction loop. The proposed scheme does not target robustness and the obtaine...|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} to build a computer-based video editor that spots problems caused when I frames are edited out while other frames need them.

50|$|MPEG IMX allows {{recording}} {{in standard}} definition, using MPEG-2 encoding at data rate of 30, 40 or 50 megabits per second.

50|$|Uncompressed video {{delivers}} maximum quality, {{but with}} a very high data rate.A variety of methods are used to compress video streams, with the most effective ones using a Group Of Pictures (GOP) to reduce spatial and temporal redundancy. Broadly speaking, spatial redundancy is reduced by registering differences between parts of a single frame; this task is known as <b>intraframe</b> compression and {{is closely related to}} image compression. Likewise, temporal redundancy can be reduced by registering differences between frames; this task is known as interframe compression, including motion compensation and other techniques. The most common modern standards are MPEG-2, used for DVD, Blu-ray and satellite television, and MPEG-4, used for AVCHD, Mobile phones (3GP) and Internet.|$|E
50|$|The most {{powerful}} used method works by comparing each frame {{in the video}} with the previous one. If the frame contains areas where nothing has moved, the system simply issues a short command that copies {{that part of the}} previous frame, bit-for-bit, into the next one. If sections of the frame move in a simple manner, the compressor emits a (slightly longer) command that tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, lighten, or darken the copy. This longer command still remains much shorter than <b>intraframe</b> compression. Interframe compression works well for programs that will simply be played back by the viewer, but can cause problems if the video sequence needs to be edited.|$|E
50|$|As {{a purely}} <b>intraframe</b> {{compression}} scheme, the image quality of M-JPEG is directly {{a function of}} each video frame's static (spatial) complexity. Frames with large smooth transitions or monotone surfaces compress well {{and are more likely}} to hold their original details with few visible compression artifacts. Frames exhibiting complex textures, fine curves and lines (such as writing on a newspaper) are prone to exhibit DCT artifacts such as ringing, smudging, and macroblocking. M-JPEG-compressed video is also insensitive to motion complexity, i.e. variation over time. It is neither hindered by highly random motion (such as the water-surface turbulence in a large waterfall), nor helped by the absence of motion (such as static landscape shot by tripod), which are two opposite extremes commonly used to test interframe video formats.|$|E
5000|$|MPEG IMX is a 2001 {{development}} of the Digital Betacam format. Digital video compression uses H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 encoding at a higher bitrate than Betacam SX: 30 Mbit/s (6:1 compression), 40 Mbit/s (4:1 compression) or 50 Mbit/s (3.3:1 compression). Unlike most other MPEG-2 implementations, IMX uses <b>intraframe</b> compression. Additionally, IMX ensures that each frame has the same exact size in bytes to simplify recording onto video tape. Video recorded in the IMX format is compliant with CCIR 601 specification, with eight channels of audio and timecode track. It lacks an analog audio (cue) track as the Digital Betacam, but will read it as channel 7 if used for playback. This format has been standardized in SMPTE 365M and SMPTE 356M as [...] "MPEG D10 Streaming".|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In motion-compensated lifted wavelet video coding, the {{calculation}} of the highpass frame involves interframe prediction. Due to occlusions, or change of intensity, or new objects in the video frame, interframe prediction is not always effective. <b>Intraframe</b> prediction provides an alternative and increases coding efficiency. However, previous analysis shows that these <b>intraframe</b> predicted pixels suffer higher distortion propagation {{than the rest of}} the pixels in the open-loop scheme. The main contribution of this paper is to mitigate this increased distortion through an <b>intraframe</b> update step. We propose a perfectly invertible sequence of operations. In addition, we present theoretical analysis of the reduction in distortion due to the inclusion of the proposed <b>intraframe</b> update step for various <b>intraframe</b> prediction modes.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf [61]) The {{objective of}} this study is to evaluate the compression performance of several variations of the JPEG-LS compression algorithm for video sequence compression, when interframe predictions are employed in addition to the standard <b>intraframe</b> predictions. <b>Intraframe</b> predictor of the JPEG-LS standard uses neighboring pixels of current pixel x to predict its value. Interframe predictions are implemented via the block matching technique. Optimal and sub-optimal search algorithms are investigated for block matching to evaluate the level of compression degradation caused by sub-optimal algorithms. Sub-optimal algorithms used in this study are two-dimensional logarithmic, three-step, orthogonal, and one-at-a-time search algorithms. Fixed and variable-size block matching techniques are employed to reveal their effects on the compression performance of JPEG-LS. High and low-motion video sequences are utilized to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Performance results for three different cases are presented in this thesis. In the first case, only the <b>intraframe</b> predictions are used in the JPEG-LS. It is important to note that the compression rates obtained from the first case reflect the performance of the standard JPEG-LS algorithm and help us to form a benchmark for comparison purposes.
