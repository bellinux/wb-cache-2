40|$|The {{objectives}} of the study are to map the distribution of rainfall in Java, to analyze its potential and the impact to groundwater storage. To achieve those goals, rainfall distribution is mapped using <b>isohyet</b> <b>method.</b> From the average distribution of monthly rainfall, the annual potential of rainwater on every watershed was calculated. Afterwards, the groundwater storage was analyzed and counted by applying the water balance concept. The {{results of the study}} show that the mean of the highest annual rainfall is 4082 mm which occurs on Cisadane- Ciliwung watershed and the lowest one is 1421 mm on Citarum Hilir watershed. From the rainfall potential, Cisadeg-Cikuningan watershed has the highest rainfall potential at the amount of 25342 million m 31 month and Grindulu Panggul watershed has the lowest potential at the amount of 3678 million m 3 lmonth. Meteorologically, Cisadeg-Cikuningan watershed has the highest groundwater storage at the amount of 6088 million m 31 yearand the lowest amount of it occurs on Madura watershed at 78 million m 3 lyear...|$|E
