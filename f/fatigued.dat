40|$|Abstract—A {{probabilistic}} framework {{based on}} the Bayesian networks for modeling and real-time inferring human <b>fatigue</b> by integrating information from various sensory data and certain relevant contextual information is introduced. A static <b>fatigue</b> model that captures the static relationships between <b>fatigue,</b> significant factors that cause <b>fatigue,</b> and various sensory observations that typically result from <b>fatigue</b> is first presented. Such a model provides mathematically coherent and sound basis for systematically aggregating uncertain evidences from different sources, augmented with relevant contextual information. The static model, however, fails to capture the dynamic aspect of <b>fatigue.</b> <b>Fatigue</b> is a cognitive state that is developed over time. To account for the temporal aspect of human <b>fatigue,</b> the static <b>fatigue</b> model is extended based on dynamic Bayesian networks. The dynamic <b>fatigue</b> model allows to integrate <b>fatigue</b> evidences not only spatially but also temporally, therefore, leading to a more robust and accurate <b>fatigue</b> modeling and inference. A real-time nonintrusive <b>fatigue</b> monitor was built based on integrating the proposed <b>fatigue</b> model with a computer vision system developed for extracting various visual cues typically related to <b>fatigue.</b> Performance evaluation of the <b>fatigue</b> monitor using both synthetic and real data demonstrates {{the validity of the}} proposed <b>fatigue</b> model in both modeling and real-time inference of <b>fatigue.</b> Index Terms—Bayesian networks (BNs), dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), human <b>fatigue</b> monitoring, information fusion, vigilance test.

5|$|A deep {{stop was}} {{originally}} an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent, at a greater depth than the deepest stop required by their computer algorithm or tables. This practice {{is based on}} empirical observations by technical divers such as Richard Pyle, who found that they were less <b>fatigued</b> if they made some additional stops for short periods at depths considerably deeper than those calculated with the currently published decompression algorithms. More recently computer algorithms that are claimed to use deep stops have become available, but these algorithms {{and the practice of}} deep stops have not been adequately validated. Deep stops are likely to be made at depths where ingassing continues for some slow tissues, so the addition of deep stops of any kind can only be included in the dive profile when the decompression schedule has been computed to include them, so that such ingassing of slower tissues can be taken into account. Nevertheless, deep stops may be added on a dive that relies on a personal dive computer with real-time computation, as the PDC will track the effect of the stop on its decompression schedule. Deep stops are otherwise similar to any other staged decompression, but are unlikely to use a dedicated decompression gas, as they are usually not more than two to three minutes long.|$|E
5|$|From the 1830s to the interwar period (1919–1939), the Anglo-Norman {{was one of}} {{the main}} horses used by the French cavalry. Although author Alfred Gallier stated that it was a good breed for this use, many {{opposing}} scholars argued that this was not the case. Military requirements conflicted with Norman breeders, as the carriage horses preferred by the breeders were very different from the style sought by the military, which required fast horses with stamina and agility. According to military equestrian Denis Bogros, the economic weight of the Norman horse breeders was such as they negatively influenced the effectiveness of the French army until the early 20th century, producing only large, overweight trotters that became <b>fatigued</b> more easily than Barbs or Arabians. Bogros states that breeders of Norman horses managed to deceive the French government, through powerful lobbying groups, by selling the military rejects from the breeding programs. The Anglo-Norman was a commercial success as carriage horses, but proved worthless for the cavalry. This led to the creation of the Société du cheval de guerre (Society of the War Horse), which in 1906 severely criticized the use of the Anglo-Norman. Bogros considered the Anglo-Arabians bred near Tarbes to be much more useful for the military.|$|E
