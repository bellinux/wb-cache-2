5000|$|Montana flumes require free-spilling {{discharge}} off the flume (<b>for</b> <b>free-flow</b> conditions). To {{accommodate the}} drop in an existing channel either the flume must be raised above the channel floor (raising the upstream water level) or the downstream channel must be modified.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the strategy of}} using self-assembled microbeads to build a robust and tunable membrane <b>for</b> <b>free-flow</b> zone electrophoresis in a PDMS microfluidic chip. To fabricate a porous membrane as a salt bridge <b>for</b> <b>free-flow</b> zone electrophoresis, we used silica or polystyrene microbeads between 3 – 6 μm in diameter and packed them inside a microchannel. After complete evaporation, we infiltrated the porous microbead structure with a positively or negatively charged hydrogel to modify its surface charge polarity. Using this device, we demonstrated binary sorting (separation {{of positive and negative}} species at a given pH) of peptides and dyes in standard buffer systems without using sheath flows. The sample loss during sorting could be minimized by using ion selectivity of hydrogel-infiltrated microbead membranes. Our fabrication method enables building a robust membrane <b>for</b> pressure-driven <b>free-flow</b> zone electrophoresis with tunable pore size as well as surface charge polarity.

5000|$|Not all Parshall flumes {{have the}} energy-recovering {{divergence}} section. These flumes, called [...] "Montana flumes", or [...] "short-section Parshall flumes", must instead have a free-spilling discharge at all expected flow rates, {{which increases the}} drop along the whole flume system. The measurement calculations {{are the same as}} <b>for</b> <b>free-flow</b> in a standard Parshall flume, but submerged flow cannot be adjusted for.|$|R
