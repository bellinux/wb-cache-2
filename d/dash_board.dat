2500|$|The second {{generation}} Rambler American was achieved through a heavy restyling {{of the previous}} year's model under AMC's styling Vice President Edmund E. Anderson. While mechanically identical to the 1960 model, Anderson's restyle resulted in a car that was three inches (76mm) narrower and shorter in its exterior dimensions with an overall length of , but increased in its cargo capacity. Continuing to ride on the [...] wheelbase, the American's new styling was more square (sometimes described as [...] "breadbox") instead of the round [...] "roly-poly" [...] shape (or [...] "bathtub"), and the visual connection with the original 1950 Nash model had finally disappeared. Popular Mechanics wrote [...] "seldom has a car been completely restyled as the 1961 Rambler American and yet retain the same engine, driveline, suspension on the same unit body". All outside sheet metal was changed, but the side window frames remained the same as previous models. Only the back glass changed {{to conform to the}} new roof line. The firewall and <b>dash</b> <b>board</b> were new stampings, with the clutch and brake pedals moved from under the floor to the firewall.|$|E
50|$|In 1955 a USAF {{surgeon who}} advised the US Surgeon General {{wrote an article}} {{on how to make}} cars safer for those riding in it. Aside from the usual safety features, such as seat belts and padded <b>dash</b> <b>boards,</b> bumper shocks were introduced.|$|R

2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts me still since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears... I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard times, and I got in the car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico... They came right around the corner head on. You know how big a Dodge Ram truck is? I broke my arm in three places and my knee went into the <b>dash</b> <b>board...</b> It was bone to bone... I was on crutches and on a cane for about three years and I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything. I was fucked up. I was ready for the scrapheap.|$|E

The nigh horse was running, the off horse pacing, and the splatter of their feet, the slash of the wheels and the roaring of their heavy breathing, made my boyish heart leap. I could hardly repress a yell of delight.|$|E

50|$|For 1958, the Golden Hawk {{switched}} to 14-inch wheels instead of 15-inch wheels, making the car ride a little lower. The 15-inch wheels, however, were available as an option. Other styling changes included a new, round Hawk medallion {{mounted in the}} lower center of the grille, and the available contrasting-color paint was now applied to both the roof and tailfins. One unique feature was a vacuum gauge on the instrument panel. Padded <b>dash</b> <b>boards</b> were standard.|$|R
50|$|The Ambassador had an {{excellent}} power-to-weight ratio for its time and provided spirited performance with 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) times of less than 10-seconds, and low 17-second times through a quarter-mile (402 m) dragstrip. It could be equipped with a limited slip differential, as well as power brakes, power steering, power windows, and air conditioning. Numerous safety features (such as deep-dished steering wheels and padded <b>dash</b> <b>boards)</b> came standard, while lap seat belts were optional.|$|R
5000|$|Dubbed a [...] "gruff-voiced, cigar chomping, hard-bargaining Senate veteran," [...] Keller was {{a leader}} in forming tax policy for the state.

In 1961 alone, he was the chief author of 18 bills calling for new and tougher traffic safety laws.

50|$|Data {{obtained}} from a crash simulation indicate the capability of the car body or guard rail structure to protect the vehicle occupants during a collision (and also pedestrians hit by a car) against injury. Important results are the deformations (for example, steering wheel intrusions) of the occupant space (driver, passengers) and the decelerations (for example, head acceleration) felt by them, which must fall below threshold values fixed in legal car safety regulations. To model real crash tests, today's crash simulations include virtual models of crash test dummies and of passive safety devices (seat belts, airbags, shock absorbing <b>dash</b> <b>boards,</b> etc.). Guide rail tests evaluate vehicle deceleration and rollover potential, as well as penetration of the barrier by vehicles.|$|R

5000|$|The CP System <b>Dash</b> <b>boards</b> {{have four}} {{interlocking}} PCBs and {{are contained in}} gray plastic boxes. To combat piracy, [...] "suicide batteries" [...] were implemented, which power the volatile RAM which contained the manual configuration of the display hardware registers, {{as well as the}} priorities registers. The CPS-1 Dash 68000 code is not encrypted at all. If the batteries' voltage should drop below +2V, the registers manually defined in factory by Capcom in RAM would be lost, and the PPU would no longer have access to the hardware specific register set on the game used, rendering the game inoperable, and necessitating the operator sending the board to Capcom to be fixed, at his own expense. Unlike the CP System II, CP System Dash sound ROMs were encrypted using [...] "Kabuki" [...] Z80s.|$|R
5000|$|In 1933, Chrysler {{decided to}} catch up with Ford and Chevrolet with respect to engine {{cylinder}} count. The 190 cu in version of Chrysler's flathead-six engine was equipped with a downdraft carburetor and installed in the new 1933 Plymouth PC, introduced on November 17, 1932. However, Chrysler had reduced the PC's wheelbase from 112 to 107 in, and the car sold poorly. By April 1933, the Dodge division's Model DP chassis, with a 112 in wheelbase, was put under the PC body with DP front fenders, hood, and radiator shell. The model designation was advanced to PD' and the car was marketed as the [...] "DeLuxe" [...] 1933 Plymouth. This car sold very well and is the 1933 model most commonly found in collections. The PC became the 'Standard Six'. It had been the 'Plymouth Six' at introduction, and was sold through to the end of 1933, but in much lower numbers. It is consequently in the minority in collectors' hands today. In 1937, Plymouth (along with the other Chrysler makes) added safety features such as flat <b>dash</b> <b>boards</b> with recessed controls and the back of the front seat padded for the rear seat occupants.The PC was shipped overseas to Sweden, Denmark, and the UK, as well as Australia. In the UK, it was sold as a 'Chrysler Kew', Kew Gardens being the location of the Chrysler factory outside London. The flathead six which started with the 1933 Model PC stayed in the Plymouth until the 1959 models.|$|R

The man who should have called the boarders to action by the roll of the drum was not on duty, and the bugler was ordered to sound the call. He was so frightened by this awful fight that he ran and hid himself, and when he was pulled out from his retreat, he had not breath enough to blow his bugle. Some of the men were sent below to shout for the boarders and call them on deck,--a very slow procedure at such a time; but before any of them arrived, the brave Lawrence was stretched upon the deck by a musket ball.|$|R

5000|$|The {{trend of}} cases piling {{up to be}} resolved, however, {{disturbed}} Cox. He told {{a meeting of the}} American Bar Associations Labor Relations Section in San Francisco: [...] "Every morning my breakfast is spoiled by reading about another wage settlement calling for an increase whose approvability is doubtful under present stabilization policies." [...] But in the first case he sat on, the board approved a 10¢ per hour increase for 25,000 employees of North American Aviation, a major producer of military aircraft, even though the raise was 50% above the amount permissible under the previous boards policy. After the decision the industry members met with Cox to tender their resignation. He pleaded with them not to <b>dash</b> the <b>board,</b> telling them that proposing a new, somewhat higher wage rate as a matter of uniform policy, one consistently held to, would best keep wages stabilized.
