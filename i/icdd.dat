40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the solution of heterogeneous problems by the interface control domain decomposition (<b>ICDD)</b> method, a strategy introduced for the solution of partial differential equations in computational domains partitioned into subdomains that overlap. After reformulating the original boundary value problem by introducing new additional control variables, the unknown traces of the solution at internal subdomain interfaces; the latter are determined by requiring that the (a priori) independent solutions in each subdomain undergo the minimization of a suitable cost functional. We provide an abstract formulation for coupled heterogeneous problems and a general theorem of well-posedness for the associated <b>ICDD</b> problem. Then, we illustrate and validate an efficient algorithm based on the solution of the Schur-complement system restricted solely to the interface control variables by considering two kinds of heterogeneous boundary value problems: the coupling between pure advection and advection–diffusion equations and the coupling between Stokes and Darcy equations. In the latter case, we also compare the <b>ICDD</b> method with a classical approach based on the Beavers–Joseph–Saffman conditions...|$|E

40|$|Modulated and {{composite}} {{crystal structures}} are fascinating crystal structures which “violate ” {{the main idea}} that “perfect ” crystal structures should possess a 3 -dimensional periodicity. However, the violations follow rules associated with the existence of periodic “modulation waves”. In that regard, they {{can be described as}} the 3 -dimensional hypersection of a 4 - or higher-dimensional periodic structure requiring additional mathematical tools to be described. [1] In past decades, several of these types of structures have attracted various scientists based on their unique physical properties. Indeed, the knowledge of these modulation waves is usually the key for understanding physical properties such as thermoelectricity, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, mineral formation, drug activity, etc. This strong interest by the scientific community in these classes of materials is clearly observed by the number of modulated structures being published. <b>ICDD</b> is responding to the need of the scientific community by incorporating a significant number of modulated structures into the <b>ICDD</b> database this year.

The ability of x-ray diffraction methods to analyze complex formulations is useful for quality control, competitive analyses and law enforcement (analysis of counterfeits). Several studies have been used to determine best practices, including three <b>ICDD</b> global customer surveys (Fawcett et. al. 2006, 2009, 2012), an international pharmaceutical round robin on quantitative Rietveld phase analysis (Fawcett et. al. 2010), and periodic bulk formulation analyses (Fawcett and Hubbard, 2004; Fawcett et al. 2006). The purpose of these studies are to align <b>ICDD</b> database capabilities and educational instructions with best methods and practices to benefit the scientific community.
