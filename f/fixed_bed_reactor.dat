In the case that biomass is utilized to as an energy resource, the emission of carbon dioxide caused by its use is absorbed by newly grown biomass and this is called as carbon-neutral. Moreover, for the negligible sulfur, nitrogen and metal contents comparing with fossil fuels, biomass is a clean energy source. In China, there is abundance of biomass. Therefore the development and utilization of biomass energy is significative to the energy security of China. Hydrogen {{is not only an}} important resource for chemical industry, but also a clean fuel for fuel cell and combustion engine. Catalytic reforming from biomass pyrolytic oil {{is one of the most}} promising methods for hydrogen production. In this thesis, we mainly evaluated the performance of hydrogen production from reforming bio-oil aqueous phase over Z 2 O 4 catalyst; we also designed Two-stage <b>Fixed</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Reactor,</b> and therefore investigate the performance of hydrogen production from catalytic reforming bio-oil aqueous phase on this reactor. The results of catalytic reforming abtained on Two-stage <b>Fixed</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Reactor</b> were better. First of all, the performance of hydrogen production from reforming of bio-oil aqueous phase over Z 2 O 4 catalyst was evaluated. The results showed that the temperature was the main factor for hydrogen production from reforming bio-oil aqueous phase. In our experiment, reaction temperature at 750 ℃, reduction time at 1 hour was the best condition for hydrogen production, under which H 2 yield reaches 42 ％ after 30 min, and keeps about 35 ％ for the next 540 min. The resistance increase in the reaction chamber is due to the carbon deposit and the inorganic ash composed of Fe, Ca, Al. To prevent carbon residue formation on catalyst and reactor wall from non-volatile fraction, we designed Two-stage <b>Fixed</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Reactor</b> to enhance the catalyst reforming results, whose performance of hydrogen production from reforming bio-oil aqueous phase was evaluated too. We discovered that the productive rate of hydrogen on Two-stage <b>Fixed</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Reactor</b> was higher than the case on the normal <b>Fixed</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Reactor</b> under the same condition and the stability of catalyst in Two-stage <b>Fixed</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Reactor</b> was better as expected. Therefore, Two-stage <b>Fixed</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>Reactor</b> was better in optimizing the catalyst and preventing the resistance increase of the reactor. We discussed the possible reactions in the hydrogen production from reforming bio-oil aqueous phase based on the six most components detected in the condensed products from Two-stage <b>Fixed</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>reactor</b> and the majority components in bio-oil aqueous phase. Our conclusion is that the reactions in reforming bio-oil aqueous phase are mostly the catalytic pyrolysis of volatile fraction, the catalytic reform of methane and the shift-conversion of steam全球化石燃料的消耗和日益增长的能源需求造成的环境污染使生物质能源逐渐成为能源研究的热点。生物质作为能源消耗时，产生的CO 2 会被植物等量的吸收，因此CO 2 为零排放。另外，与化石燃料相比，生物质含硫、氮较少，因而是一种清洁的能源。我国生物质资源十分丰富，生物质能源的开发和利用对于我国的能源安全有重要的意义。氢气是一种重要的化工原料，而且还是一种可以用于燃料电池和内燃机的清洁燃料。生物油的催化重整是有前途的制氢技术之一。本文主要对自制生物油的水相重整特性进行了研究。作者对生物油水相在固定床上的催化重整制氢特性进行了评价；设计了两段式固定床反应器，探索了生物油水相在两段式固定床反应器上的催化重整制氢特性。并取得较高的催化重整效果。 首先利用催化剂Z 204 在固定床上对生物油水相重整制氢的特性进行评价。实验结果表明温度是影响生物油水相重整制氢的重要因素，反应温度 750 ℃，还原时间为 1 h为最佳H 2 产出条件，在此条件下反应 30 min后H 2 产率达到 42 ％，随后略有下降，在约 540 min内基本保持在 35 ％左右。 固定床反应器中反应器阻力增大问题是由积碳和含有Fe，Ca，Al等无机元素的灰分组成的碳渣引起的。为了阻止不可挥发组分在催化剂和反应器内形成碳渣，设计了两段式固定床以提高催化重整效果。并对两段式固定床反应器上生物油水相重整制氢反应的特性进行了评价。研究发现，两段式反应器上生物油水相重整制氢的H 2 收率高于相同条件下固定床反应器的情况；并且在两段式反应器上催化剂活性保持较好；两段式反应器可以有效的避免出现反应器内部阻力的增大。 综合生物油两段式固定床冷凝相中检测出了的六种主要物质和生物油水相中检测出含量较多的物质，对生物油水相重整制氢可能发生的反应进行探讨，发现生物油水相重整可能主要包括水相中可挥发份在催化剂作用下的高温热解、甲烷催化重整反应和水煤气变化反应等...|$|E

This study is furthered to optimize the operating conditions {{by focusing on the}} reaction pressure to enhance the yield and quality of shale oil in the <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>reactor</b> with internals. Reducing the pyrolysis pressure increased the shale oil yield in comparison with the pyrolysis under atmospheric pressure. This influence due to reducing reaction pressure appeared to be higher in the reactor with internals than in the reactor without any internals. Moreover, there were higher yield of aliphatic components and fewer aromatic species in the reactor with internals, essentially indicating the suppressed secondary reactions to the produced primary shale oil in the new reactor. In this reactor the shale oil yield reached 97. 57 % of the Fisher Assay yield (8. 24 wt. % dry basis) at a furnace heating temperature of 1000 degrees C under reduced pressure conditions. Consequently, there is actually some synergistic effect between internals and reducing pressure so that adopting internals and using vacuum condition can grant the indirectly heated <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> <b>reactor</b> great potential to achieve high yield and high quality of shale oil in oil shale pyrolysis.
