40|$|A {{class of}} linear {{convolutional}} codes for compound channels (i. e., channels on which burst and random errors occur) is given. It is shown that for any rate and burst length {{there exists a}} linear convolutional code of that rate that can correct almost all bursts of errors of that length and that requires a much smaller <b>guard</b> <b>space</b> than any code that can correct all possible bursts of errors {{less than or equal}} to that length. Protection against random errors can be obtained at the expense of the burst-error-correction capability. Explicit formulas are given for the number of bursts and random errors that can be corrected. A particular scheme to construct some codes is given. It is noted that these codes exhibit limited error propagation.

Statistical properties introduced by the cyclic (OFDM) systems. Statistical properties introduced by the cyclic prefix, a <b>guard</b> <b>space</b> between OFDM symbols, provide su±cient information about the unknown parameters. It is shown that the redundancy introduced by this cyclic prefix allows the estimation to be performed without additional pilots.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is part of}} a conceptual study of multi-user OFDM systems, parts of which previously has been presented at the ETSI STC SMG 2 meetings no 18 and 19. This part proposes and explains in detail methods for the estimation of time and frequency offsets of pulse-shaped OFDM signals. In particular, focus is on the uplink of time- and frequency-divided systems. Synchronization in such context is accomplished by remote-adjusting the clocks and oscillators of the mobiles to those of the base station. For this purpose, the estimation of the respective time and frequency offsets of each mobile at the base station is crucial. For OFDM systems employing a <b>guard</b> <b>space</b> and pulse shaping this paper presents methods for obtaining these estimates. The performance of the estimators is discussed in terms of error variance, and results for some of the channel characteristics specified by ETSI are presented...|$|E
40|$|Underwater {{acoustic}} communications (UAC) at the reverberation-limited range {{results in}} severely distorted information signals. Wide-band signals {{are subject to}} both intermodal and intramodal-type of dispersions. The underwater acoustic channel impulse response and the sidelobes strongly depend on the waveguide structure and the source and receiver positions. The motion and displacement from this position, {{as well as other}} environmental variabilities impose a real-time adaptivity for the receiver operation {{to keep track of the}} fluctuations. To increase the system's reliability and data rate, there is a need to employ adaptive equalizers and diversity techniques to improve the margins against noise, and intersymbol interference (ISI). Blind adaptive equalization (BAE) is the ideal adaptive compensation when operating point-to-multipoint network, and centralized communication systems in general. Inherent optimum Multiple resonant modes within the ocean acoustic waveguide can be exploited judiciously via a new proposed parallel data multicarrier modulation (MCM) scheme by sending data over the multiple subcarriers. MCM might eventually obviate equalization which introduces higher-order computational complexity to the receiver. The above modulation eliminates multipaths and allows operation at multiples of the single-carrier transmission rate. The system's immunity to distortions such as ISI, fast fades, and impulsive noises, is increased due to incorporation of symbol <b>guard</b> <b>space.</b> Direct comparisons with single carrier schemes (such as higher-order statistics (HOS) -based equalization) are of great interest, since the proposed new receiver configuration has low-complexity to provide a compact, portable and low-power practical acoustic modem. Finally, network topology issues are considered to determine optimum network architectures for underwater acoustic LAN's. A central topology (CT) supported by BAE and MCM transmission is proposed conclusively...|$|E

40|$|The high {{latitude}} ionosphere forms {{a highly}} dynamic and disturbed medium which can severely degrade {{the performance of}} hf radio links. Characteristics of the signal which may be affected include signal strength, fading rate and the frequency range over which signals may propagate. Furthermore, large Doppler frequency shifts and spreads may be imposed on the signal due to movements in the ionosphere near to the reflection point. To investigate these effects, signals from a transmitter located at Clyde River on Baffin Island in the Canadian North West Territories were received near Fairbanks, Alaska and at Alert, Elsmere Island. Doppler spread, signalling error rates and error distribution patterns occurring were measured during one month campaigns in summer 1988 and winter 1989. Several interesting features were observed: (a) Large Doppler spreads, often in excess of 10 Hz were frequently observed on the trans-auroral path and their occurrence was well correlated with the average position of the auroral oval relative to the path reflection points. (b) The bit error rate of low speed FSK signals was not influenced by the level of Doppler spreading observed. Error rate was well correlated with the received {{signal to noise ratio}} and was in good agreement with theory. Signal to noise ratio was well correlated with predicted variations in ionisation due to changes in solar zenith angle. (c) Distribution of errors were related to changes in Doppler spreading. Large Doppler spreads, were correlated with significantly shorter bursts of error was less than when Doppler spreading was small. However, there was no significant correlation with the length of <b>guard</b> <b>space</b> between errors. This work is of particular relevance to researchers developing high latitude prediction programs and those employing channel simulators to assess communication systems...|$|E
