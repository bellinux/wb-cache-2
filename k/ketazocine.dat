2500|$|The {{pharmacodynamic}} {{response to}} an opioid depends upon the receptor to which it binds, its affinity for that receptor, and whether the opioid is an agonist or an antagonist. [...] For example, the supraspinal analgesic properties of the opioid agonist morphine are mediated by activation of the μ1 receptor; respiratory depression and physical dependence by the μ2 receptor; and sedation and spinal analgesia by the κ receptor. [...] Each group of opioid receptors elicits a distinct set of neurological responses, with the receptor subtypes (such as μ1 and μ2 for example) providing even more [...] specific responses. [...] Unique to each opioid is its distinct binding affinity to the various classes of opioid receptors (e.g. the μ, κ, and δ opioid receptors are activated at different magnitudes according to the specific receptor binding affinities of the opioid). For example, the opiate alkaloid morphine exhibits high-affinity binding to the μ-opioid receptor, while <b>ketazocine</b> exhibits high affinity to ĸ receptors. [...] It is this combinatorial mechanism that allows for such a wide class of opioids and molecular designs to exist, {{each with its own}} unique effect profile. Their individual molecular structure is also responsible for their different duration of action, whereby metabolic breakdown (such as N-dealkylation) is responsible for opioid metabolism.|$|E

50|$|Spiradoline (U-62066) {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a highly {{selective}} κ-opioid agonist. It has analgesic, diuretic and antitussive effects, and produces subjective effects in animals {{similar to those of}} <b>ketazocine</b> and alazocine. The main effect in humans is sedation, along with analgesic and diuretic effects, but significant side effects such as dysphoria and hallucinations have stopped it from being used clinically. Kappa-agonists have been shown to react negatively with the mu receptor, instead of having an assumed synergy since they are both opioid receptors, such as with the mu (μ) receptors and delta (δ) receptors (which both mediate pain-relief, euphoria and overall potency of opioid effects).|$|E
50|$|The σ1 {{receptor}} {{is defined}} by its unique pharmacological profile. In 1976 Martin reported {{that the effects of}} N-allylnormetazocine (SKF-10,047) could not be due to activity at the μ and κ receptors (named from the first letter of their selective ligands morphine and <b>ketazocine,</b> respectively) and a new type of opioid receptor was proposed; σ (from the first letter of SKF-10,047). However, ligands acting at this new “opioid” receptor were not blocked by the classical opioid antagonists naloxone and naltrexone. Consequently, the opioid classification was eventually dropped and the receptor was later termed the σ1 receptor. It was found to have affinity for the (+)-stereoisomers of several benzomorphans (e.g., (+)-pentazocine and (+)-cyclazocine), various structurally and pharmacologically distinct psychoactive chemicals such as haloperidol and cocaine, and neuroactive steroids like progesterone.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{pharmacological}} {{results have}} suggested {{that members of the}} heterocyclic bicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonan- 9 -one-like compounds are potent κ-opioid receptor specific agonists. One lead molecule of this series, called compound 1 (dimethyl 7 -methyl- 2, 4 -di- 2 -pyridyl- 3, 7 -diazabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonan- 9 -one- 1, 5 -dicarboxylate) exhibited high affinity for [3 H]ethylketocyclazocine and [3 H]U- 69, 593 binding sites in guinea pig cerebellar membranes which known to be a good source for κ 1 receptors. It was shown by molecular modelling that heterocyclic bicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonan- 9 -ones fit very well with the structure of <b>ketazocine,</b> a prototypic κ-selective benzomorphan compound; when compared to the arylacetamide structure of U- 69, 593, a specific κ 1 -receptor agonist, a similar geometry was found with a slightly different distribution of the charges. It is postulated, that the essential structural skeleton involved in the opioid activity is an aryl-propyl-amine element distributed along the N 7 -C 6 -C 5 -C 4 -aryl bonds...|$|E
40|$|Results {{of studies}} on the discriminative {{stimulus}} effects of narcotics {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that multiple receptors mediate the effects of these compounds. In the rat, at least three subsets of discriminative effects exist, although some drugs appear to have effects that transcend more than one subset. The discriminative effects of morphine-like narcotics ([mu] agonists), for example, are often clearly distinguishable from the discriminative effects produced by [kappa] agonists, such as <b>ketazocine,</b> and from those produced by phencyclidine-like agonists, such as SKF- 10, 047 and cyclazocine. Cyclazocine, however, has been reported to have discriminative effects in common with morphine (45) and fentanyl (17) and appears to have [kappa]-like, in addition to phencyclidine-like, discriminative effects. The relative ability of pure narcotic antagonists to block the discriminative effects of these compounds also provides evidence for distinct pharmacologic actions of these drugs. In the rat, the discriminative effects of morphine are blocked by doses of naloxone that are considerably smaller than those that are needed to block the discriminative effects of cyclazocine (44). The discriminative effects of phencyclidine are not altered at all by naltrexone (63) ...|$|E
