25|$|Water, however, is not {{a finite}} {{resource}} (meaning the availability of water is limited), but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation in quantities many orders of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking water supply, which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years), that is a non-renewable resource, and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce, rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption), since the manufacturing process uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main issue}} was {{constitutional}} rights of Englishmen, so the French in Quebec did not react. [...] Some English-speaking merchants were opposed, but were in a fairly small minority. The Quebec Gazette ceased publication until the act was repealed, apparently over the unwillingness to use stamped paper. [...] In neighboring Nova Scotia a number of former New England residents objected, but recent British immigrants and London-oriented business interests based in Halifax, the provincial capital were more influential. [...] The only major public protest was the hanging in effigy of the stamp distributor and Lord Bute. [...] The act was implemented in both provinces, but Nova Scotia's stamp distributor resigned in January 1766, beset by ungrounded fears for his safety. [...] Authorities there were ordered to allow ships bearing unstamped papers to enter its ports, and business continued unabated after the distributors ran out of stamps. [...] The Act occasioned some protests in Newfoundland, and the drafting of petitions opposing not only the Stamp Act, but {{the existence of the}} customhouse at St. John's, based on legislation dating back to the reign of Edward VI forbidding any sort of duties on the <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> related to its fisheries.|$|E

60|$|According to the {{doctrine}} now stated, the only direct advantage of foreign commerce consists in the imports. A country obtains things which it either {{could not have}} produced at all, or which it must have produced at a greater expense of capital and labor {{than the cost of}} the things which it exports to pay for them. It thus obtains a more ample supply of the commodities it wants, for the same labor and capital; or the same supply, for less labor and capital, leaving the surplus disposable to produce other things. The vulgar theory disregards this benefit and deems the advantage of commerce to reside in the exports: as if not what a country obtains, but what it parts with, by its foreign trade, was supposed to constitute the gain to it. An extended market for its produce—an abundant consumption for its goods—a vent for its surplus—are the phrases by which it has been customary to designate the uses and recommendations of commerce with foreign countries. This notion is intelligible, when we consider that the authors and leaders of opinion on mercantile questions have always hitherto been the selling class. It is in truth a surviving relic of the Mercantile Theory, according to which, money being the only wealth, selling, or, in other words, exchanging goods for money, was (to countries without mines of their own) the only way of growing rich—and <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> that is to say, parting with money, was so much subtracted from the benefit.|$|E
