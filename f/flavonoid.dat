5|$|Phenolics, {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring bonded to a hydroxy group. Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt endocrine activity. Phenolics range from simple tannins {{to the more}} complex flavonoids that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called polyphenols are capable of producing {{many different types of}} effects on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed tannins, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) <b>flavonoid</b> molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E

40|$|Context: Prenylated <b>flavonoids</b> are {{a unique}} class of {{naturally}} occurring <b>flavonoids</b> that exist {{especially for the}} plant’s self-defensive strategy. This special class of <b>flavonoids</b> increases the bioactivities of their backbone <b>flavonoids</b> with non-prenylation; therefore, prenylated <b>flavonoids</b> have more potential to be developed and utilized. Objective: The number, position and type of the prenyl group on the <b>flavonoids</b> backbone structure may have close relationships with the bioactivities of <b>flavonoids.</b> Methods: PubMed and WEB OF KNOWLEDGE® were used to search articles published in English between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2012, which discuss the structure–activity relationship between prenylated <b>flavonoids</b> and their bioactivities. Results: It is proposed that the prenyl-moiety makes the backbone compound more lipophilic, which leads to its high affinity with cell membranes. The prenylation brings the <b>flavonoids</b> with enhancement of antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxicity, larvicidal as well as estrogenic activities. However, it is reported that the prenyl-moiety decreases the bioavailability and plasma absorption of prenylated <b>flavonoids.</b> Conclusion: The prenyl group affects the bioactivities of <b>flavonoids</b> in certain ways, while the action mechanisms and the structure–activity relationship {{as well as more}} in vivo studies even clinical validation trials need to be further investigated.

40|$|NAD+ is {{important}} for oxidative metabolism by serving as an electron transporter. Hyperglycemia decreases NAD+ levels by activation of the polyol pathway and by overactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) -polymerase (PARP). We examined the protective role of three structurally related <b>flavonoids</b> (rutin, quercetin, and flavone) during high glucose conditions in an in vitro model using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Additionally we assessed the ability of these <b>flavonoids</b> to inhibit aldose reductase enzyme activity. We have previously shown that <b>flavonoids</b> can inhibit PARP activation. Extending these studies, we here provide evidence that <b>flavonoids</b> are also able to protect endothelial cells against a high glucose induced decrease in NAD+. In addition, we established that <b>flavonoids</b> are able to inhibit aldose reductase, the key enzyme in the polyol pathway. We conclude that this protective effect of <b>flavonoids</b> on NAD+ levels {{is a combination of}} the <b>flavonoids</b> ability to inhibit both PARP activation and aldose reductase enzyme activity.

Recently, it was suggested that the Aβ lowering properties of <b>flavonoids</b> are mediated by a direct inhibition the β-secretase (BACE- 1) activity, the rate limiting enzyme responsible for the production of Aβ peptides. Westernblots and ELISAs were employed to monitor the impact of <b>flavonoids</b> on amyloid precursor protein processing and Aβ production. A cell free chemoluminescent assay using human recombinant BACE- 1 was used to assess the effect of <b>flavonoids</b> on BACE- 1 activity. The effect of <b>flavonoids</b> on NFκB activation was determined by using a stable NFκB luciferase reporter cell line. Molecular docking simulations were performed to predict the binding of <b>flavonoids</b> to the BACE- 1 catalytic site. Real time quantitative PCR was used to determine the effect of <b>flavonoids</b> on BACE- 1 transcription. We show in a cell free assay that <b>flavonoids</b> are only weak inhibitors of BACE- 1 activity. Docking simulation studies with different BACE- 1 structures also suggest that <b>flavonoids</b> are poor BACE- 1 inhibitors as they appear to adopt various docking poses in the active site pocket and have weak docking scores that differ as a function of the BACE- 1 structures studied. Moreover, a weak correlation was observed between the effect of <b>flavonoids</b> on Aβ production in vitro and their ability to lower BACE- 1 activity suggesting that the Aβ lowering properties of <b>flavonoids</b> in whole cells are not mediated via direct inhibition of BACE- 1 activity. We found however a strong correlation between the inhibition of NFκB activation by <b>flavonoids</b> and their Aβ lowering properties suggesting that <b>flavonoids</b> inhibit Aβ production in whole cells via NFκB related mechanisms.
