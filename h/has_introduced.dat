5|$|Bees can be {{severely}} and even fatally affected by pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals that man <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> into the environment. They can appear inebriated and dizzy, and even die. This is serious {{because it has}} substantial economic consequences for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Poland <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> {{a series}} of {{projectiles}} for Rheinmetall's tank gun, including an armor-piercing penetrator target practice round (APFSDS-T-TP), a high-explosive round, and a high-explosive target practice (HE-TP) projectile. The ammunition is manufactured by Zakłady Produkcji Specjalnej Sp. z o.o.|$|E

North Korea also believed the U.S. <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> new weapons earlier, citing Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection team reports for August 1953 to April 1954.|$|R
50|$|The {{expectation}} {{was that}} all the member states would <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> the CARICOM passport by 2008 when the stock of their old passports is depleted. This deadline was missed by a year, and by 2009 all CSME participating states <b>had</b> <b>introduced</b> the common passport design.|$|R
5|$|Another {{significant}} human {{impact is}} roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities {{have tried to}} limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs. Oregon <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting turtles across the road.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of countries, mainly in Asia, {{legislation}} or corporate practice <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> formal menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid {{leave of absence from}} their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it is unfair to men.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, the {{expansion}} of the southern suburbs of Washington, D.C. into Northern Virginia <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> an urban heat island primarily caused by increased absorption of solar radiation in more densely populated areas. In the American Lung Association's 2011 report, 11 counties received failing grades for air quality, with Fairfax County having the worst in the state, due to automobile pollution. Haze in the mountains is caused in part by coal power plants.|$|E

The prevalence of drag culture in mainstream media <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> a step of separation between femininity and “being female”. While the show preaches a message of acceptance, this separation of impersonation and identity can cause issues for the transgender community.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment Station at the University of Minnesota <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> {{a steady}} {{progression}} of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists, throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. Its most important contributions have included 'Haralson' (which {{is the most}} widely cultivated apple in Minnesota), 'Wealthy', 'Honeygold', and 'Honeycrisp'.|$|E
5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (Salix lapponum), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), alpine mouse-ear (Cerastium alpinum), alpine meadowgrass (Poa alpina) and others have been able to survive in these coves since the last glaciation through a combination of rocks rich in basic minerals, a harsh micro-climate, and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, these populations are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> a recovery plan for them.|$|E

5|$|As senator, Ford <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> many {{bills with}} {{only a small number}} {{becoming}} law, but has been more successful in contributing to compromise bills. After becoming senator, Ford attempted to have the Confederate flag removed from the South Carolina State House. It was the last state capitol to display a Confederate battle flag, and Ford had picketed the building in the 1960s as a symbol of discrimination. Following years of debate, the flag was moved to a nearby monument with the adoption of a compromise bill authored by Ford. He was responsible for the passage of a 1998 bill that paired Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with Confederate Memorial Day as paid holidays. Ford stated that he hoped the legislation would improve race relations in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> the EVA Air Check-in Kiosks at T2, {{counters}} 6A, allowing {{passengers to}} check in and print their boarding passes electronically, since December 2009. The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, if passengers were {{to check in}} for an EVA Air flight, {{they would have to}} go to an airline representative at the counters.|$|E
5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> several other side {{products}} {{over the course}} of its existence. Onion rings {{have been part of the}} menu for the majority of BK history. Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella sticks with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since been relegated to a regional menu item in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> goats, as part of a {{programme}} to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E
5|$|Panavision is an American {{motion picture}} {{equipment}} company specializing in cameras and lenses, based in Woodland Hills, California. Formed by Robert Gottschalk {{as a small}} partnership to create anamorphic projection lenses during the widescreen boom in the 1950s, Panavision expanded its product lines {{to meet the demands}} of modern filmmakers. The company introduced its first products in 1954. Originally a provider of CinemaScope accessories, the company's line of anamorphic widescreen lenses soon became the industry leader. In 1972, Panavision helped revolutionize filmmaking with the lightweight Panaflex 35mm movie camera. The company <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> other groundbreaking cameras such as the Millennium XL (1999) and the digital video Genesis (2004).|$|E
5|$|While {{extremely}} severe {{commercial and}} recreational overfishing in the 1800s {{and the early}} 1900s caused the first strong declines of Murray cod, overfishing by recreational fishermen, aided by inadequate fishing regulations, continues today and remains an extremely serious threat to Murray cod. The current size limit of 60centimetres in most states is inadequate now that scientific studies have documented average size at sexual maturity in Murray cod. This and catch data and computer modelling exercises on wild Murray cod stocks indicate measures such as raising the size limit to 70centimetres and reducing the bag and possession limits from 2 and 4 fish respectively to 1 fish are urgently needed to maintain the long-term viability of wild Murray cod populations. As of November 2014, the NSW Department of Fisheries <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> a maximum size limit of 75cm for Murray Cod to provide protection for large breeding fish, {{as well as a}} new minimum size limit of 55cm.|$|E

5|$|Support for airport {{expansion}} {{is based on}} an economic case that regards the air transport industry not only as an important industry in its own right, but also as a facilitator of growth for the economy as a whole. One study predicts that the government's strategy will realise an additional £13billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030. Another study which is critical of the government approach, and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport, indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion. In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK carbon emissions, a figure that is set to rise as demand increases. Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport, air travel in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050. Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements, whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes. Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for air travel, primarily through the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. Local environmental issues include noise and air quality, and the impact of these, particularly {{in the case of the}} former, is subject to debate. Government policy generally is that these are local issues best addressed locally, and <b>has</b> <b>introduced</b> legislation designed to facilitate this.|$|E
