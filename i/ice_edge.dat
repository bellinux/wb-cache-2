5|$|Reinsdorf {{was one of}} two bidders for the Phoenix Coyotes {{that would}} commit to not {{relocating}} the team. On July 29, 2009 Reinsdorf and his group were approved for ownership of the Coyotes for $148 million. In August 2009, it was reported that Jerry Reinsdorf & <b>Ice</b> <b>Edge</b> LLC had dropped its bid for the Coyotes, leaving only Balsillie and the NHL as bidders for the team. The NHL bid ultimately prevailed, however the league stated it wished to re-sell the franchise as soon as possible. On March 24, 2010, it was reported that Reinsdorf was once again a possible buyer for the Phoenix Coyotes. Reinsdorf had been working out an arrangement to make the deal more feasible with the municipality of Glendale, Arizona. As late as August 2011, negotiations between Reinsdorf and the City of Glendale were still in process for the purchase of the Coyotes. However, in 2013, the Coyotes were sold to IceArizona, a group of investors that did not include Reinsdorf.|$|E

The overall winter {{distribution}} is probably similar, and it is believed there is a net movement of seals northward with the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> in late spring and summer. Thus, ringed seals occupying the Bering and southern Chukchi seas in winter apparently are migratory, but details of their movements are unknown.|$|E

A 15–20cm (6–8in) layer of volcanic gravel tops off the pier to provide a non-slip surface and to insulate the ice from the summer sun.|$|E

Although the species has {{cosmopolitan}} distribution and is usually not considered to cross the equator line, seasonal observations at Cape Verde suggest possible interactions among populations from both hemispheres. Aside from the Arabian Sea group, year-round presences have been confirmed among British and Norwegian waters. Parts of wintering grounds around the globe have been poorly studied or being undetected, such as around Pitcairn Islands, Northern Mariana Islands (e.g. Marpi and CK Reefs vicinity to Saipan [...] ), Daitō Islands, Volcano Islands, Pasaleng Bay, Trindade and Martin Vaz, Mauritius, Aldabra, and so on.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the return}} of the Winnipeg Jets again leaving Saskatchewan the only Canadian {{province}} outside Atlantic Canada without an NHL franchise, interest in bringing an NHL team to Saskatchewan where it would serve as a natural rival to the Jets has been further renewed. [...] In early 2012 Saskatoon mayor Don Atchison announced that On Ice Management Group Inc. had approached him with plans to place an NHL franchise in a renovated Credit Union Centre – it is not yet known if On Ice Management Group is related in any way to the former <b>Ice</b> <b>Edge</b> group. [...] Shortly afterward, in an interview NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman included Saskatoon in a list of cities that had expressed recent interest in acquiring a franchise, although the commissioner did not indicate how serious he thought that interest might have been.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{a number}} of changed {{circumstances}} since then, including {{the introduction of a}} salary cap following the 2004-05 NHL lockout, a return of the exchange rate to parity, a relatively strong provincial economy and reports of {{a number of}} U.S. franchises struggling has led to speculation that Saskatchewan may again attempt to acquire an NHL franchise. [...] The league has been scheduling exhibition games at Credit Union Centre with some regularity since the lockout. [...] Following the NHL takeover of the bankrupt Phoenix Coyotes, a Canadian-American ownership group called <b>Ice</b> <b>Edge</b> Holdings that was negotiating to purchase the Coyotes announced their intention to play a limited number of Coyotes home games at Credit Union Centre as part of an overall plan to keep the team based in Arizona.

Some of this variation may be related to effects such as the Arctic oscillation, which may itself be related to global warming.|$|R

This was immediately objected to by the Goldwater Institute, stating that it placed undue risk on the City of Glendale and Reinsdorf took none of the risk. <b>Ice</b> <b>Edge's</b> proposal, which required annual fees of $5 million in parking revenues, was more acceptable to the Institute.|$|R
40|$|Change and {{variability}} in the timing and magnitude of sea ice geophysical and thermodynamic state have consequences on {{many aspects of the}} arctic marine system. The changes in both the geophysical and thermodynamic state, and in particular the timing of the development of these states, have consequences throughout the marine system. In this paper we review the 'consequences' of change in sea ice state on primary productivity, marine mammal habitats, and sea ice as a medium for storage and transport of contaminants and carbon exchange across the ocean-sea-ice-atmosphere interface based upon results from the International Polar Year. Pertinent results include: 1) conditions along <b>ice</b> <b>edges</b> can bring deep nutrient-rich 'pacific' waters into nutrient-poor surface waters along the arctic coast, affecting local food webs; 2) both sea ice thermodynamic and dynamic processes ultimately affect ringed seal/polar bear habitats by controlling the timing, location and amount of surface deformation required for ringed seal and polar bear preferred habitat 3) the <b>ice</b> <b>edges</b> bordering open waters of flaw leads are areas of high biological production and are observed to be important beluga habitat. 4) exchange of climate-active gases, including CO 2, is extremely active in sea ice environments, and the overall question of whether the Arctic Ocean is (or will be) a source or sink for CO 2 will be dependent on the balance of competing climate-change feedbacks...|$|R

40|$|The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging {{technique}} enables the mapping of the Earth’s surface independent of weather and light conditions, {{which makes it}} a suitable instrument during Antarctic winters. Since the early 1990 s, imaging radar techniques have been established in polar sciences. The imagery can be used to support Antarctic wintering staff; e. g. to detect crevasses or other surface features. To do so, the radar backscattering behaviour of homogeneous (undisturbed) and heterogeneous (crevassed) areas is used to map crevasse fields or <b>ice</b> <b>edges.</b> A semi‐automatic technique of surface feature detection can help to process the data more rapidly.
