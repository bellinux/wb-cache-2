25|$|On her 16th birthday, Rose {{left the}} home for troubled {{teenagers}} {{to return to her}} parents (Fred at the time serving a 30-day sentence for theft and unpaid fines). Upon Fred's release, Rose left her parents' home to move into the Cheltenham flat Fred then resided in. Shortly thereafter, Fred collected Charmaine and Anna Marie from the social services. Bill Letts did make one final effort to prevent his daughter from seeing Fred, and Rose was examined by a police surgeon in February 1970, who confirmed she was pregnant. In response, Rose was again placed into care, but was discharged on 6 March on the understanding she would terminate her pregnancy and return to her family. Instead, Rose opted to live with Fred, resulting <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> forbidding his daughter from ever again setting foot in his household.|$|E
25|$|Lauren meets Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), a man {{who works}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> Max Branning's (Jake Wood) office, and they are {{attracted}} to each other. Josh encourages Lauren {{to apply for a}} job there but Steven is unimpressed by Lauren's plans as he wants her {{to spend more time with}} him and Louie. He suggests that they start trying for a baby but Lauren refuses because she wants to concentrate on her career, so Steven secretly pieces holes in condoms. Lauren gets a job at the company and tells Steven that she barely sees Josh but Steven visits her at work and sees her with Josh, and he becomes suspicious. Steven is unaware that Lauren is pregnant and planning an abortion, although her sister Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) makes him question Lauren and Josh's relationship. During an argument with Abi, who resents Lauren, Steven is stunned to hear Lauren aborted his child. A few days later, following Abi's 21st birthday party, another disagreement between Abi and Steven ends with them sleeping together. Some time after, Steven has sex with Abi again after seeing footage of Lauren and Josh. Despite the affair with Abi, Steven insists he wants to be with Lauren and Abi does her best to poison his mind against her. When Lauren tells Josh that she doesn't love Steven, Abi persuades her to return to New Zealand. Just as she is about to leave, Josh visits Steven and tells him that Lauren has resigned from her job. Steven bashes his head against the wall, causing it to bleed. He later bumps into Lauren before she leaves and she plans to end their relationship, but notices Steven's head injury. In a desperate act to keep Lauren with him, Steven lies the injury is caused by him trying to remove a brain tumour, claiming that he has cancer and he is dying.|$|E

Finn manages to rip the amulet off of Marceline, which renders her unconscious. To escape the rebellious demon masses, Finn puts the amulet on and pushes Marceline and Jake through the portal. Hunson Abadeer arrives {{on the scene}} and rips the amulet from Finn's neck, sending Finn falling back through the portal. Marceline is initially disappointed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> for tricking her into ruling the Nightosphere to make him proud, but they reconcile when Hunson reassures Marceline that he is proud of her, no matter what she does, and that he actually enjoys Finn and Jake.|$|E

500|$|Scully's co-option of Mulders' usual role also {{demonstrates}} {{the complexity of}} her character. Although she is strongly influenced by her scientific background, she has religious faith too. Paul C. Peterson notes that although this episode is not directly about religion, it shows {{the first of several}} visions Scully experiences throughout the series; later visions appear in episodes more directly related to religion and Scully's faith, such as [...] "One Breath", [...] "Elegy" [...] and [...] "All Souls". In this episode, her faith <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> ultimately proves stronger than her belief in the paranormal as she refuses to be tempted by Boggs. Rather than take him up on his offer to help her contact her father, Scully visits her partner in the hospital.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Naples, the Shelleys {{settled in}} Rome, {{the city where}} her husband wrote where [...] "the meanest streets were strewed with {{truncated}} columns, broken capitals...and sparkling fragments of granite or porphyry...The voice of dead time, in still vibrations, is breathed from these dumb things, animated and glorified [...] as they were by man". Rome inspired her to begin writing the unfinished novel Valerius, the Reanimated Roman, where the eponymous hero resists the decay of Rome and the machinations of [...] "superstitious" [...] Catholicism. The writing of her novel was broken off when her son William died of malaria. Shelley bitterly commented that she come to Italy to improve her husband's health, and instead the Italian climate had just killed her two children, leading her to write: [...] "May you my dear Marianne never {{know what it is}} to lose two only and lovely children in one year-to watch their dying moments-and then at last to be left childless and forever miserable". To deal with her grief, Shelley wrote the novella The Fields of Fancy, which became Matilda dealing with a young woman whose beauty inspired incestuous love <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>father,</b> who ultimately commits suicide to stop himself from acting on his passion for his daughter, while she spends the rest of her life full of despair about [...] "the unnatural love I had inspired". The novella offered a feminist critique of a patriarchal society as Matilda is punished in the afterlife though she did nothing to encourage her father's feelings.|$|E
500|$|The film {{begins with}} the Dreamer, a restless and {{disappointed}} dreamer who has a wife and child. He gazes at his hands and dreams of becoming a conqueror, but laments that no chance comes to him and continues to dream. The Dreamer becomes the subject of ridicule and his wife becomes the subject of pity by the community. The Dreamer decides enter the world of men and abandons his wife leaving her to seek refuge <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>father.</b> Her father wishes for her to marry a wealthy gentleman {{who is also a}} stranger in the town. The Dreamer heads into the desert and wanders until exhaustion takes its toll. A woman, [...] "The Desert Flower", finds him and takes him to her hut in the desert. There the woman spends her time looking over the garments of the man who courted her, the same stranger now attempting to marry the Dreamer's wife. The woman learns of the Dreamer's story and shows the dreamer the futility of conquering worlds unknown when he cannot conquer his own small corner of the world. The Dreamer sees himself in the roles of great conquerors, but each vision ends with death. The Dreamer's wife has been kicked out for refusing to marry the stranger, and is reunited with the Dreamer {{on the edge of the}} desert. The stranger is sent out into the desert and the Dreamer and his wife return to the town. In time, the Dreamer becomes respected by the community.|$|E

2500|$|She and Mia don't {{see eye to}} eye: Clarisse is {{concerned}} with attracting publicity to Genovia and ensuring Mia does not embarrass her country while Mia prefers to focus on politics. Though she and Mia butt heads often, she does care for her granddaughter and gives her advice about love and relationships that Mia takes {{with a grain of}} salt due to her grandmother's cold nature. For example, when Clarisse was married to the king of Genovia, she led him to believe that she was only interested in his status and money and never once said [...] "I love you", in order to keep her husband on his toes. Mia also mentions that her father is terrified of his mother because she would lock him in the palace dungeons whenever he misbehaved (although when she informs him that he gives the appearance of being a little bit scared of Clarisse <b>in</b> , <b>her</b> <b>father</b> replies that he is not scared of his mother and that she really isn't as bad as Mia thinks; in his view, Clarisse [...] "just needs proper handling").|$|E
2500|$|The show explores most of {{the main}} characters' {{connections}} to their families in great detail. Walt justifies his decision to cook crystal meth and become a criminal because of his desire to provide for his family. In the third season he tries to exit the business because it has driven Skyler to leave him. Gus convinces him to stay, telling him it is a man's job to provide for his family, {{even if he is}} unloved. In the final episode of the series, however, Walt finally admits to Skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest, in spite of secretly securing the 9.72 million dollars (which is all that he had managed to salvage) for her and the children. Jesse's loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents' decision to kick him out of their home due to his drug-related activities. This parental disconnect brings him closer to Jane, whose father berates her for her drug use. When Walt crosses paths with Jane's father, he refers to Jesse as his nephew and laments the fact that he can't get through to him. Jane's father responds by telling him to keep trying, saying [...] "Family. You can't give up on them, ever. What else is there?" [...] Jane's subsequent death, which Walt purposefully did not prevent, is a major factor <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> causing the airline crash {{at the end of the}} second season.|$|E
2500|$|One of Orville Hungerford's goals was to {{earn enough}} {{money from his}} ventures to build a grand home. In 1823, he began to {{construct}} the largest house in Watertown {{on a piece of}} property that he purchased in 1816 for $500.00 from Olney and Eliza Pearce. On November 11, 1825, he opened the six-paneled door with a brass eagle-knocker at 336 Washington Street and moved into his mansion, made out of native limestone with 10 fireplaces and a carriage house. The English ivy-covered residence eventually passed to Orville's daughter, Frances E., a spinster, whose estate conveyed it to her niece Helen Hungerford (Mrs. Leland G. Woolworth). [...] After Helen died, ownership of the house transferred to her sister Harriet Hungerford, another spinster. Harriet had been living next door <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> Marcus Hungerford's house at 330 Washington Street. She moved into the Orville Hungerford mansion in 1946 and lived there until her death on October 26, 1956. By this time most of the family had moved out of the Watertown area and no one wanted to return. The Watertown National Bank bought the property from Harriet's estate and sold it to Joseph Capone, a developer. In turn, John R. Burns, purchased the structure and reassembled the house minus the left wing several blocks away on Flower Avenue West, where it still stands. The house is in remarkably good shape today due to the loving care and modernization efforts of its recent owners. At present, the old Hungerford homestead on Washington Avenue is the site of a Best Western Carriage House Inn, attached out back to the original carriage house.|$|E
