40|$|<b>Devolution</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom (UK) is at {{its most}} {{developed}} stage ever. From the advent of Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish <b>devolution</b> processes <b>in</b> 1997, the steady march of more autonomy has continued. <b>Devolution</b> <b>in</b> the UK is not symmetric, either between or within the nations and regions of the UK. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have their own devolved legislatures; England does not. Scotland has far greater powers than the legislatures in Wales and Northern Ireland, reflecting seemingly different appetites for devolution. At the same time, the growth and development of city-deals tied {{to the creation of}} new “metro-mayors” in some parts of England will see much more local control than others. Now {{is a good time to}} reflect on this process, and to consider the nature and impact of <b>devolution</b> <b>in</b> the UK and its economy...|$|R

50|$|With the {{partition}} of Ireland, Northern Ireland received home rule in 1920, though civil unrest meant direct rule was restored in 1972. Support for (non-British) nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales led to proposals for <b>devolution</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s though only in the 1990s did devolution actually happen. Today, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each possess a legislature and executive, with <b>devolution</b> <b>in</b> Northern Ireland being conditional on participation in certain all-Ireland institutions. The United Kingdom government remains responsible for non-devolved matters and, {{in the case of}} Northern Ireland, co-operates with the government of the Republic of Ireland.|$|R

5000|$|The Conservatives, as a Britain-wide party, fielded {{candidates}} in Scotland until {{the creation of}} a separate Unionist Party in 1912. This was a separate party which accepted the Conservative whip in the UK Parliament until it was merged into the Conservative Party in 1965. The Declaration of Perth policy document of 1968 committed the Conservatives to Scottish <b>devolution</b> <b>in</b> some form, and in 1970 the Conservative government published Scotland's Government, a document recommending {{the creation of a}} Scottish Assembly. Support for devolution within the party was rejected and was opposed by the Conservative governments led by Margaret Thatcher and John Major in the 1980s and 1990s. The party largely remained opposed to <b>devolution</b> <b>in</b> the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum campaign. That referendum was passed with a large majority, the Conservatives have since accepted <b>devolution</b> <b>in</b> both Scotland and Wales. The governments led by David Cameron devolved further powers to the Scottish Parliament in 2012 and 2016. Cameron also attempted to answer the [...] "West Lothian question" [...] by changing the procedures of the UK Parliament (English votes for English laws).|$|R
