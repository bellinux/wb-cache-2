5|$|Terns have {{sometimes}} benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could {{lead them to}} fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> many species. Pollution {{has been a problem}} in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> the Great Lakes area of the US. Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.|$|E
5|$|Reef {{environments in}} Biscayne National Park have seen <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> species {{richness}} and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006–2007.

A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract {{and the decline}} in fish species. <b>Declines</b> <b>in</b> populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.|$|E

30|$|Given the {{inability}} to explain the <b>decline</b> by shifts <b>in</b> the composition of individual and business characteristics, we explored a few additional methods of explaining the decline. The distribution of establishment-level employment change has been narrowing during the last 10 to 15 years, fully accounting for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> job creation and job destruction, yet this narrowing only explains {{about a third of}} the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> hires and separations. This tells us that the explanation for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> hires and separations will be different than the explanation for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> job creation and job destruction. We also find that the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> hires and separations is being driven by the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> job-to-job flows and the disappearance of short-duration jobs in the U.S. economy.|$|R

An important component of these declining trends is a marked <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the firm startup rate. A recent finding in the literature is that the changing composition of U.

The implication is {{that much of the}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> dynamism should be viewed as occurring within detailed industry, firm size and firm age categories. To explore the factors underlying this within-cell <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> dynamism, we address two sets of closely related questions in this paper: First, what types of startups have exhibited the largest decline and, relatedly, what types {{of business}}es have exhibited the largest <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> dynamism?

5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). <b>Declines</b> <b>in</b> self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E

The bird has been adversely affected in these areas by intensive agriculture, and in several countries it has been red-listed due to population declines of more than 50%. Numbers dwindled in the United Kingdom by more than 80% between 1966 and 2004; although populations in some areas such as Northern Ireland were stable or even increased, those in other areas, mainly England, declined even more sharply. The overall decline seems to be due to the low survival rate of young birds, which may be caused by changes in agricultural practices. The intensive farming methods used in northern Europe mean there is less pasture and meadow habitat available, and the supply of grassland invertebrates needed for the nestlings to thrive is correspondingly reduced.|$|E
