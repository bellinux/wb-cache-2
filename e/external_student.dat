5|$|Encouraged by the Assistant Official Assignee, James Walter Davy Ambrose (who {{was later}} {{appointed}} a High Court Judge), to study law, Choor Singh enrolled as an <b>external</b> <b>student</b> at the University of London, passing the matriculation examination and intermediate LL.B. examination. In 1948 {{he was appointed}} a coroner, and the following year was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. Following law studies at Gray's Inn on a government scholarship, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. He was appointed a district judge in 1960 and a judge of the Supreme Court in 1963. Especially noted for his criminal judgments, Singh was the first Singapore judge to impose the death penalty on a woman.|$|E
5|$|The Assistant Official Assignee, James Walter Davy Ambrose (later a High Court Judge), advised Choor Singh {{to study}} law. Singh read law books in his leisure time and began saving money to study law in England. This {{proved to be}} unnecessary; {{following}} {{a change in the}} rules, he was able to enrol as an <b>external</b> <b>student</b> at the University of London and passed the matriculation examination and, in 1948, the intermediate LL.B. examination. However, he could not be called to the Bar as a barrister as he did not have time to keep the required dining terms. On 20 May 1948, he was appointed a coroner. In December 1949, Singh was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. He continued his law studies at Gray's Inn, and in 1953 was granted leave on a government scholarship to dine at Gray's Inn. After making four trips in two years, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. In 1958, he was appointed a member of the Appeal Tribunal under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.|$|E

Results show that while staff see the advantages for <b>external</b> <b>students,</b> they question {{the extent to which these}} advantages apply to internal students. In contrast both cohorts of students were positive about the benefits of the technologies for their learning and they adopted similar strategies for their use.

In 1884 he entered Kharkov University, beginning his studies in the natural sciences. He was awarded the degree of Candidate of Sciences in 1888 but he became interested in political economy and wound up completing his studies as an <b>external</b> <b>student</b> with a degree from the school's Faculty of Law and Economics in 1890.

25|$|It was {{in school}} at Otapete Methodist that Olowofoyeku first met a new classmate, Tai Solarin, then known as Augustus Solarin. That was the {{beginning}} of a lifelong friendship that later brought them together again as colleagues at St. Andrew's College, Oyo (1936–1942). Solarin admitted that he was radically changed by Olowofoyeku's final essay in which he made the observation that some of the colonialists were ignorant, and not well-prepared for the duties they were assigned, and therefore had no business running the lives of Nigerians. For this essay, he was punished for his audacity in challenging the status quo, and was suspended from college in his final academic year. He however sat for and passed the final teacher's examination as an <b>external</b> <b>student</b> a year later.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to {{investigate}} the library needs and library usage of <b>external</b> <b>students</b> in remote areas. The study emphasised external students' perception of their own library needs. Four distinct areas of research evolved from the {{purpose of the study}}: to identify the library service needs of external students; to identify library use by external students; to identify external students' perceptions of library needs; and to identify student status in relation to library use. Information was collected by an interview with former <b>external</b> <b>students,</b> a questionnaire to the libraries involved in the study and by Nominal Group Technique (NGT) sessions with <b>external</b> <b>students.</b> The primary instrument was a questionnaire to the <b>external</b> <b>students</b> in the population under investigation requesting information of their library usage and needs. The population under investigation were <b>external</b> <b>students</b> enrolledin the South Australian College of Advanced Education (SACAE) and resident in Whyalla, South Australia. It was decided to survey the total population rather than a sample because of the small numbers involved. Thirty-five responses were received out of a population of 52, representing a response rate of 69 percent. The results of the survey were analysed using a Statview SE statistical package and a spreadsheet and graphics package, Excel. Frequency distributions were computed to determine the number of respondents who selected each option. The study found that the <b>external</b> <b>students</b> who used libraries tended to use a variety of libraries. Students used not only their own institution's library, but the a range of libraries accessible to them in Whyalla. The study concludes by identifying issues, recommending possible solutions, and identifying areas for further research...|$|R

A pedagogic approach suited to online teaching is used in which online role-play scenarios are conducted using a variation of the online fishbowl approach. With this approach internal and <b>external</b> <b>students</b> take on character roles and interact in a synchronous online environment during a two-week intensive teaching block.

This ALL program was delivered using the Wimba virtual learning environment on the “Blackboard” e-learning platform. Wimba provides a live synchronous class-room where students can interact with their lecturer and fellow students. Live classes were recorded and archived for students’ online asynchronous access. Specifically, the study assessed the effects of the embedded ALL program on student learning outcomes measured by their academic perform-ance and their self-report of their online experience. For the purposes of comparison, the outcomes of <b>external</b> <b>students</b> in synchronous Wimba, asynchronous Wimba and no Wimba groups were compared with those of internal (face-to-face) students who received no ALL support. Findings of this study showed that the <b>external</b> <b>students</b> who received online synchronous ALL support had significantly better outcomes than those who received ALL support via the archived recording. The mean assessment marks of the external synchronous group were 11 percent higher than the other groups. The findings also suggest that through live virtual interaction with others, the <b>external</b> <b>students</b> felt more confident and more connected to other students and the lecturers involved. These findings have important implications for the design of e-learning processes and delivery of embedded ALL support for external students’ study skills using e-learning platforms...|$|R
