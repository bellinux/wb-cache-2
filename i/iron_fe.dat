5|$|The {{types of}} {{minerals}} present in volcanic ash {{are dependent on}} the chemistry of the magma from which it erupted. Considering that the most abundant elements found in silicate magma are silicon and oxygen, {{the various types of}} magma (and therefore ash) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly explained in terms of their silica content. Low energy eruptions of basalt produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~45 - 55% silica that is generally rich in <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> and magnesium (Mg). The most explosive rhyolite eruptions produce a felsic ash that is high in silica (>69%) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition (e.g., andesite or dacite) have a silica content between 55-69%.|$|E

25|$|Although {{chromium}} (Cr), <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe),</b> and aluminium (Al) readily dissolve in dilute nitric acid, the {{concentrated acid}} forms a metal-oxide layer {{that protects the}} bulk of the metal from further oxidation. The formation of this protective layer is called passivation. Typical passivation concentrations range from 20% to 50% by volume (see ASTM A967-05). Metals that are passivated by concentrated nitric acid are iron, cobalt, chromium, nickel, and aluminium.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 mbar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> may rain out from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side {{in the form of}} particles of minerals, such as enstatite, corundum and spinel, wollastonite, silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as perovskite and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca I, Ca II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a cloudless atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure. From the data available, scientists can only infer that COROT-7b does not resemble any of the rocky planets of the Solar System.|$|E

500|$|The {{chemical}} composition {{of a star}} provides important clues to its evolutionary history, including {{the age at which}} it formed. The interstellar medium of dust and gas from which stars form is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of heavier elements. As nearby stars continually evolve and die, they seed the interstellar medium with an increasing portion of heavier elements. Thus younger stars will tend to have a higher portion of heavy elements in their atmospheres than do the older stars. These heavy elements are termed metals by astronomers and the portion of heavy elements is the metallicity. The amount of metallicity in a star is given in terms of the ratio of <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe),</b> an easily observed heavy element, to hydrogen.

40|$|Abstract. The {{exceptional}} high hardness of {{lath martensite}} in quenched Fe-C steels {{is explained by}} the Engel-Brewer valence electron theory for crystal structures. The theory predicts the transformation sequence FCC-HCP-BCC with FCC <b>iron</b> as <b>Fe</b> 3 v, HCP <b>iron</b> as <b>Fe</b> 2 v, BCC <b>iron</b> as <b>Fe</b> 1 v and carbon as C 4 v. Electronic compatibility requires transformation from FCC to HCP to form two separate components. Carbon-rich clusters of C 4 v with 8 Fe 3 v atoms are distributed uniformly in a carbon-free matrix of HCP Fe 2 v atoms. The carbon-iron clusters are viewed as particle-like, calculated as 0. 63 nm in size, and {{is responsible for the}} high strength of martensite. The carbon-free region experiences shear deformation during FCC to HCP transformation leading to work hardened fine grains. Subsequent transformation to BCC iron maintains the same size carbon cluster with additional shearing deformation during HCP to BCC formation in the carbon-free region. Tempering studies of quenched martensite are shown to support the carbon-iron cluster model...|$|R
40|$|Erythrocytes are {{especially}} vulnerable to reactive oxygen species because of their direct role in oxygen transport. Moreover, hemoglobin contains <b>iron</b> ions (<b>Fe</b> 2), which catalyze both the Fenton reaction and lipid peroxidation. Reactive oxygen species in erythrocytes are also generated through nonenzymatic and enzymatic processes of heme degradation. The nonenzymatic process of heme degradation is initiated by e. g. hydrogen peroxide, whereas the process of enzymatic degradation is {{under the influence of}} heme oxygenase. In both cases biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO) and <b>iron</b> ions (<b>Fe</b> 2) are generated. These products of heme degradation can initialize the oxidative processes within erythrocytes, but at low concentrations exhibit cytoprotective properties. ...|$|R

Two possible mechanisms are discussed {{for the formation of}} alane in Clasen's electrochemical cell containing THF as the solvent, sodium aluminium hydride as the electrolyte, an aluminium anode, and an <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> wire submerged in mercury (Hg) as the cathode. [...] The sodium forms an amalgam with the Hg cathode preventing side reactions and the hydrogen produced in the first reaction could be captured and reacted back with the sodium mercury amalgam to produce sodium hydride.

2500|$|A {{heme group}} {{consists}} of an <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> ion (charged atom) held in a heterocyclic ring, known as a porphyrin. This porphyrin ring consists of four pyrrole molecules cyclically linked together (by methine bridges) with the iron ion bound in the center. The iron ion, which {{is the site of}} oxygen binding, coordinates with the four nitrogen atoms {{in the center of the}} ring, which all lie in one plane. The iron is bound strongly (covalently) to the globular protein via the N atoms of the imidazole ring of F8 histidine residue (also known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring. A sixth position can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond, completing the octahedral group of six ligands. Oxygen binds in an [...] "end-on bent" [...] geometry where one oxygen atom binds to Fe and the other protrudes at an angle. When oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site, forming a distorted octahedron.|$|E
2500|$|The sodium {{carbonate}} test (not {{to be confused}} with {{sodium carbonate}} extract test) is used to distinguish between some common metal ions, which are precipitated as their respective carbonates. The test can distinguish between copper (Cu), <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe),</b> and calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Sodium carbonate solution is added to the salt of the metal. A blue precipitate indicates Cu2+ ion. A dirty green precipitate indicates Fe2+ ion. A yellow-brown precipitate indicates Fe3+ ion. A white precipitate indicates Ca2+, Zn2+, or Pb2+ ion. [...] The compounds formed are, respectively, copper(II) carbonate, iron(II) carbonate, iron(III) oxide, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, and lead(II) carbonate. This test is used to precipitate the ion present as almost all carbonates are insoluble. While this test is useful for telling these cations apart, it fails if other ions are present, because most metal carbonates are insoluble and will precipitate. In addition, calcium, zinc, and lead ions all produce white precipitates with carbonate, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Instead of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide may be added, this gives nearly the same colours, except that lead and zinc hydroxides are soluble in excess alkali, and can hence be distinguished from calcium. For the complete sequence of tests used for qualitative cation analysis, see qualitative inorganic analysis.|$|E

2500|$|A 2005 {{work has}} shown that the slip is a matrix of mainly silicon and {{aluminium}} oxides, within which are suspended sub-microscopic crystals of haematite and corundum. The matrix itself does not contain any metallic ions, the haematite is substituted in aluminium and titanium while the corundum is substituted in iron. The two crystal populations are homogenously dispersed within the matrix. [...] The colour of haematite depends on the crystal size. Large crystals of this mineral are black but as the size decreases to sub-micron the colour shifts to red. The fraction of aluminium has a similar effect. It was formerly thought that the difference between 'red' and 'black' samian was due to the presence (black) or absence (red) of reducing gases from the kiln and that the construction of the kiln was so arranged as to prevent the reducing gases from the fuel from coming into contact with the pottery. The presence of iron oxides in the clay/slip was thought to be reflected in the colour according to the oxidation state of the <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe</b> for the red and Fe for the black, the latter produced by the reducing gases coming into contact with the pottery during firing).
