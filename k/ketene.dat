25|$|The {{route from}} acetic acid to acetic {{anhydride}} via <b>ketene</b> {{was developed by}} Wacker Chemie in 1922, when the demand for acetic anhydride increased due {{to the production of}} cellulose acetate.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} {{of this type of}} tautomerism can be found in bullvalene, and in open and closed forms of certain heterocycles, such as organic azides and tetrazoles, or mesoionic münchnone and acylamino <b>ketene.</b>|$|E
40|$|A novel rhodium-catalyzed linear codimerization of alkyl phenyl <b>ketenes</b> with {{internal}} alkynes to dienones and a novel synthesis of furans by an unusual cycloaddition of diaryl <b>ketenes</b> {{with internal}} alkynes have been developed.

40|$|The enol {{forms of}} β-keto esters thermolyze to {{alcohols}} and α-oxo <b>ketenes,</b> which {{are characterized by}} low-temperature IR spectroscopy and on warming regenerate the β-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated esters. The matrix isolated s-Z and s-E forms of α-oxo <b>ketenes</b> are characterized and photochemically converted into other conformers or sites. Matrix photolysis of 2, 2, 6 -trimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxin- 4 -one gives the s-Z acetylketene initially. α-Oxo <b>ketenes</b> polymerize {{in the cold and}} dimerize only at elevated temperatures...|$|R

25|$|The Mukaiyama aldol {{reaction}} is the nucleophilic addition of silyl enol ethers to aldehydes catalyzed by a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride (as boron trifluoride etherate) or titanium tetrachloride. The Mukaiyama aldol reaction {{does not follow}} the Zimmerman-Traxler model. Carreira has described particularly useful asymmetric methodology with silyl <b>ketene</b> acetals, noteworthy for its high levels of enantioselectivity and wide substrate scope.|$|E
25|$|The {{bomb that}} Çatlı's team had planted in Ara Toranyan's car on 22 March 1983 did not explode. A {{follow-up}} attempt also failed. Toranyan {{said they had}} planted the bomb in the wrong car. Likewise, Henri Papazyan's car bomb on 1 May 1984 did not explode. Çatlı claimed credit for killing Hagop Hagopian, however {{he was in a}} French prison (again, on narcotics charges) {{at the time of the}} attack. Papazyan is now believed to have been killed as a result of infighting. The second French team (led by <b>Ketene)</b> did carry out some attacks (which Çatlı also claimed credit for), such as the 1984 Alfortville monument and Salle Pleyel concert room attacks. It is unknown whether the Lebanese contingent did anything at all.|$|E
500|$|The {{product of}} the {{condensation}} of two molecules of acetic acid is acetic anhydride. The worldwide production of acetic anhydride is a major application, and uses approximately 25% to 30% of the global production of acetic acid. The main process involves dehydration of acetic acid to give <b>ketene</b> at 700–750°C. <b>Ketene</b> is thereafter reacted with acetic acid to obtain the anhydride: ...|$|E

500|$|Acetic acid {{undergoes}} {{the typical}} chemical reactions of a carboxylic acid. Upon treatment {{with a standard}} base, it converts to metal acetate and water. With strong bases (e.g., organolithium reagents), it can be doubly deprotonated to give LiCH2CO2Li. Reduction of acetic acid gives ethanol. The OH group is the main site of reaction, {{as illustrated by the}} conversion of acetic acid to acetyl chloride. Other substitution derivatives include acetic anhydride; this anhydride is produced by loss of water from two molecules of acetic acid. Esters of acetic acid can likewise be formed via Fischer esterification, and amides can be formed. When heated above , acetic acid decomposes to produce carbon dioxide and methane, or to produce <b>ketene</b> and water: ...|$|E

50|$|Another way to {{generate}} <b>ketenes</b> is through flash vacuum thermolysis (FVT) with 2-pyridylamines. Plüg and Wentrup developed a method in 1997 that improved on FVT reactions to produce <b>ketenes</b> with a stable FVT that is moisture insensitive, using mild conditions (480 °C). The N-pyridylamines are prepared via a condensation with R-malonates with N-amino(pyridene) and DCC as the solvent.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to carbonyls, other electrophiles such as imines can be successfully used. For example, using a simple chiral thiourea catalyst, the asymmetric Mannich reaction of aromatic imines with silyl <b>ketene</b> acetals can be catalyzed with high ee in near quantitative conversion. The mechanism of this reaction {{is not fully}} resolved and the reaction is very substrate-specific, only effective on certain aromatic electrophiles.|$|E
2500|$|Ethylene oxide is {{relatively}} stable to heating – {{in the absence}} of a catalyst, it does not dissociate up to 300°C, and only above 570°C there is a major exothermic decomposition, which proceeds through the radical mechanism. The first stage involves isomerization, however high temperature accelerates the radical processes. They result in a gas mixture containing acetaldehyde, ethane, ethyl, methane, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, <b>ketene</b> and formaldehyde. High-temperature pyrolysis (830–1200 K) at elevated pressure in an inert atmosphere leads to a more complex composition of the gas mixture, which also contains acetylene and propane. Contrary to the isomerization, initiation of the chain occurs mainly as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>ketene</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{of the form}} R′R″C=C=O. <b>Ketene</b> also refers to CH2=C=O, occasionally called ethenone. Although they are highly useful, <b>ketene</b> and its various derivatives are rarely isolated.|$|E
5000|$|They can undergo ring {{expansion}} reaction with {{electrophilic reagents}} like <b>ketenes</b> or isocyanates.|$|R

30|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>ketenes,</b> experimental and theoretical investigations on {{the mechanism of}} addition of transition metal-oxide of the type LMO 3 (M = Mn, Tc and Re) across the C=C double bonds of olefins has been extensively reported (Sharpless and Akashi 1975; Wiberg 1965; Aniagyei et al. 2013 a, b, c; Tia and Adei 2009, 2011; Nelson et al. 1997; Corey and Noe 1997; Haller et al. 1997; Houk and Strassner 1999; Torrent et al. 1998; Del Monte et al. 1997; Tia and Adei 2011; Pietsch et al. 1998; Deubel and Frenking 1999; Gisdakis and Rösch 2001). <b>Ketenes</b> are related to olefins {{by the presence of}} the C=C double bonds but <b>ketenes</b> constitute activated double bonds due to the presence of the C=O double bond directly bonded to the C=C double bond. Therefore the chemistry of the addition of transition metal oxo complexes of the type LReO 3 to <b>ketenes</b> is much expected to be the same as olefins periselectivity.|$|R
5000|$|Diphenylketene is a {{chemical}} {{substance of the}} <b>ketene</b> family. Diphenylketene, like most disubstituted ketenes, is a red-orange oil at room temperature and pressure. Due to the successive double bonds in the <b>ketene</b> structure R1R2C=C=O, diphenyl <b>ketene</b> is a heterocumule. The most important reaction of diphenyl <b>ketene</b> is the 2+2 cycloaddition at C-C, C-N, C-O, and C-S multiple bonds.|$|E
