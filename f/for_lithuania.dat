5|$|The {{birth of}} the yellow, green, and red tricolor {{occurred}} during a drive by other European republics to change their flags. One example that gave life {{to the idea of}} the tricolor was the French blue, white and red flag adopted after the French Revolution. The only tricolor that existed <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania</b> before the yellow, green and red flag was a green, white and red flag used to represent Lithuania Minor.|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent IV {{supported}} Mindaugas, {{hoping that}} a new Christian state could stem the inroads being made by the Golden Horde, {{a state of the}} Mongol Empire. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One of them ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania,</b> and to build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the pope. This was a welcome development to the Lithuanians, since they were concerned that their long-standing antagonists, the Livonian Order, would exert too much control over the new state.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a larger}} press corps in Brussels than Washington D.C.; in 2007 media outlets in every Union member-state had a Brussels correspondent. However, since the global {{downturn}} by 2010 the press corps in Brussels shrunk by a third. There is one journalist covering EU news for Latvia and none <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> Although {{there has been a}} worldwide cut in journalists, the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to believe they can cover the EU from these source and news agencies. In the face of high-level criticism, the Commission is also due to shut down Presseurop on 20 December 2013.|$|E

5|$|In 1250 or 1251, Mindaugas {{agreed to}} receive baptism and {{relinquish}} control over some lands in western Lithuania, {{in return for}} an acknowledgment by Pope Innocent IV as king. The Pope welcomed a Christian Lithuania as a bulwark against Mongol threats; in turn, Mindaugas sought papal intervention in the ongoing Lithuanian conflicts with the Christian orders. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania,</b> and build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the Holy See, {{rather than to the}} Archbishop of Riga. This autonomy was a welcome development. The precise date of Mindaugas's baptism is not known. His wife, two sons, and members of his court were baptized; Pope Innocent wrote later that a multitude of Mindaugas's subjects also received Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania {{had been}} part of the Russian Empire since the {{partitions}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. After the unsuccessful uprising of 1863, Lithuania was subjected to Russification policies: the Lithuanian press ban was initiated, schools were required to teach in the Russian language, Roman Catholics could not hold positions in government institutions and could own only limited amounts of land, and political rights were restricted. However, these measures had limited effects on the Lithuanian National Revival, and a sense of the Lithuanian national identity continued to grow. The first Lithuanian political parties, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and Lithuanian Democratic Party, included goals of political autonomy <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania</b> within the Russian Empire in their basic program.|$|E
5|$|Until 2010 {{counties}} {{were administered}} by county governors (Lithuanian: singular – apskrities viršininkas, plural – apskrities viršininkai) {{appointed by the}} central government in Vilnius. Their primary duty was {{to ensure that the}} municipalities obey the laws and the Constitution of Lithuania. They did not have great powers vested in them, and so it was suggested that 10 counties are too much <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania</b> as the two smallest counties administer only four municipalities. There was a proposal to replace the counties with four or five lands, a new administrative unit, that would be decided according to the ethnographic regions of Lithuania and based on the 5 major cities with the population more than 100,000.|$|E

The coaching staff was also inexperienced in the Olympics aside from assistants Valdemaras Chomičius and Donnie Nelson.|$|E

25|$|As a result, a weak {{coalition}} government was formed, which, in turn, inspired the 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état. Lithuanian {{relations with the}} Holy See were normalized a few months later, on 4 June 1927, when a concordat was signed between Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri for the Holy See and Dr. Jurgis Šaulys <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> The improvements in 1927 were mostly due {{to the efforts of}} Prime Minister Augustinas Voldemaras.|$|E
25|$|His son left London in {{the early}} 1930s to study in the yeshiva of Kelm.

25|$|The {{description}} in the Bychowiec Chronicle {{is clearly a}} piece of Lithuanian propaganda. The chronicle was compiled {{in the first half}} of the 16th century when Lithuania and Moscow were engaged in a series of Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars. The wars were unsuccessful <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania</b> – it lost a significant portion of its territory, including the strategically important Smolensk in 1514. Therefore, the chronicle used the historical event to encourage the Lithuanians to fight. The episode with the spear was probably borrowed from Polish historiography: King Boleslaus I of Poland used his sword (Szczerbiec) to hit the Golden Gate in Kiev in 1018.|$|E

25|$|The Klaipėda Revolt {{took place}} in January 1923 in the Klaipėda Region (Memel Territory, Memelland). The region, located north of the Neman River, was {{detached}} from East Prussia, Germany by the Treaty of Versailles and became a mandate of the League of Nations. It was placed under provisional French administration until a more permanent solution could be worked out. Lithuania wanted to unite with the region (part of Lithuania Minor) due to its large Lithuanian-speaking minority of Prussian Lithuanians and major port of Klaipėda (Memel) – the only viable access to the Baltic Sea <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> As the Conference of Ambassadors favored leaving {{the region as a}} free city, similar to the Free City of Danzig, the Lithuanians organized and staged a revolt.|$|E
25|$|Kairys {{joined the}} Lithuanian Social Democratic Party in 1900. The party had already {{separated}} {{itself from the}} Russian Social Democrats and sought independence <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> Kairys {{was elected to the}} Central Committee of the party next year and remained in the leadership roles until the party ceased its activities in 1944. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he participated in the Great Seimas of Vilnius as a member of presidium. The Great Seimas clearly expressed Lithuania's intentions to become an independent state, or at least to gain considerable autonomy from the Russian Empire. In 1907, Kairys was among the 5 Lithuanian social democrats elected to the second Duma. Before World War I, Kairys worked to promote his party and social democracy.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{there was}} tension over the Soviets' moves in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, {{which were in}} the Soviet sphere of influence. All three were given {{no choice but to}} sign a {{so-called}} Pact of defence and mutual assistance which permitted the Soviet Union to station troops in them. Nazi Germany advised them to accept the conditions. The Baltic states acceded to the Soviet demands and signed mutual assistance treaties on September 28, October 5, and October 10, 1939, respectively (for ten years for Estonia and Latvia and fifteen years <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania).</b> The tension included the internment of a submarine crew in the Orzeł incident. On October 18, October 29, and November 3, 1939, the first Soviet troops entered Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania under the Pact.|$|E

25|$|Though, again a tough semi-final awaited against {{defending}} {{world champions}} Spain. The victory value was huge: the dreamed Olympic final, guaranteed silver {{and a chance}} at gold, while also providing {{the opportunity to take}} back on the 66–91 shellacking during preparations. Both teams played at their best, with Spain compensating the absence of José Calderón to lead by the first quarter, only <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania</b> to dominate for the following two and having a minimal 74–73 advantage by the fourth. Then rising performances by Rudy Fernandez and Pau Gasol (9 and 7 points respectively) during the concluding quarter along with the Lithuanians' exhaustion and lack of big men input lead the Spanish to barely edge and win the semifinal 91–86. Head coach Ramūnas Butautas said that the team played well and {{there was no need to}} be disappointed.|$|E
25|$|After the German {{occupation}} {{during the}} war, Kairys became actively involved with people seeking independence <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> In 1917 he attended Vilnius Conference {{where he got}} elected to the 20-member Council of Lithuania. The council was formed by the conference to declare and establish independence of Lithuania. The task, however, was extremely tough because of the German Wehrmacht presence in the state. The Germans promised to recognize the state if the council agreed to form a firm and permanent federation with Germany. The council issued a declaration to that effect on December 11, 1917. However, Germany did not keep its word and did not recognize the state. The council was torn apart and Kairys with three others withdrew on January 26, 1918. However, on February 16, 1918 they returned to sign the Act of Independence of Lithuania. The act did not mention anything in specific about relations to Germany.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{begun with}} a tough victory over FIBA Americas champions Mexico, 87–74. While the Mexicans won the first quarter 27–22, the Lithuanians then {{achieved}} their domination, marked by scoring 20 points against only 2 in the third quarter. One day later, another difficult match was held against African champions Angola, that the Lithuanians won 75–62, led by the young Donatas Motiejūnas and Jonas Valančiūnas, who scored a combined 23 points and defended the team with 18 rebounds. Tough games continued <b>for</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> The third game against Australia had the Lithuanians 19 points behind at halftime, winning the third quarter 28–15, and leading at some points of the concluding period, but still lost 75–82. Head coach Jonas Kazlauskas described the game as having the team's worst first half that season. The team recovered by sweeping South Korea 79–49, guaranteeing a spot at the knockout rounds and managing {{to become the first}} team in FIBA World Cup history to not have any free throw attempts. Lithuania took first spot in the group by closing with a tremendous victory against Slovenia, 67–64, with the Slovenians only scoring two points in the fourth quarter.|$|E
