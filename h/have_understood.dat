5|$|Beyond heaven, in the heart, {{that which}} shines within, states Brahma in verse 3 of the Upanishad, is the {{destination}} {{of those who}} <b>have</b> <b>understood</b> the meaning of Vedanta doctrine. There, states the text, all the sannyasis (renunciates) who have reached that wisdom reside, {{in the state of}} pure being. The Upanishad says, seclusion is their place, enthroned is their joy, calm is their Yoga.|$|E
5|$|Military {{thinking}} shifted rapidly. Given {{the lack}} of equipment and properly trained men, Ironside had {{had little choice but}} to adopt a strategy of static warfare, but it was soon perceived that this would not be sufficient. Ironside has been criticised for having a siege mentality, but some consider this unfair, as he is believed to <b>have</b> <b>understood</b> the limits of the stop lines and never expected them to hold out indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Martin Filler {{acknowledged}} that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, {{such as in the}} probably imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would <b>have</b> <b>understood</b> a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis. They only warmed to Churchill later in the war, because of his performance as a wartime leader.|$|E

5|$|An {{average of}} 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an {{estimated}} 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted {{that it was not}} as good as the opening ceremony. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would <b>have</b> <b>understood</b> the nods to British film and television. George Michael was roundly criticised for his song choice while Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Russell Brand were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, and other high-profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony. NBC in the United States and Prime TV in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony. There was also a concert in Hyde Park to close the Olympics, featuring Blur, New Order, and The Specials.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was said}} by chroniclers to be good-looking, red-haired, freckled, {{with a large}} head; he had a short, stocky body and was bow-legged from riding. Often he was scruffily dressed. Not as {{reserved}} as his mother Matilda, nor as charming as his father Geoffrey, Henry was famous for his energy and drive. He was also infamous for his piercing stare, bullying, bursts of temper and, on occasion, his sullen refusal to speak at all. Some of these outbursts, however, may have been theatrical and for effect. Henry was said to <b>have</b> <b>understood</b> {{a wide range of}} languages, including English, but spoke only Latin and French. In his youth Henry enjoyed warfare, hunting and other adventurous pursuits; {{as the years went by}} he put increasing energy into judicial and administrative affairs and became more cautious, but throughout his life he was energetic and frequently impulsive.|$|E
5|$|Merrifield opens The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic by {{discussing}} how archaeologists <b>have</b> <b>understood</b> magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining {{that on the}} whole {{it had been a}} neglected area of study. Looking at the archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain, he discusses animal and human sacrifice, as well as the offering of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the deposition of metal goods in water. Looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he then looks at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record.|$|E

5|$|Reynolds {{believes}} The Sun Also Rises {{could only}} have been written in 1925: it perfectly captured the period between World WarI and the Great Depression, and immortalized a group of characters. In the years since its publication, the novel has been criticized for its anti-Semitism, as expressed in the characterization of Robert Cohn. Reynolds explains that although the publishers complained to Hemingway about his description of bulls, they allowed his use of Jewish epithets, which showed the degree to which anti-Semitism was accepted in the US after World WarI. Cohn represented the Jewish establishment and contemporary readers would <b>have</b> <b>understood</b> this from his description. Hemingway clearly makes Cohn unlikeable not only as a character but as a character who is Jewish. Critics of the 1970s and 1980s considered Hemingway to be misogynistic and homophobic; by the 1990s his work, including The Sun Also Rises, began to receive critical reconsideration by female scholars.|$|E
5|$|Rosebery's {{frequent}} absences {{from his}} wife fuelled gossip {{that he was a}} secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would <b>have</b> <b>understood</b> them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E
5|$|Sam Jones III was {{the last}} of the season one series regulars to be cast–being hired just four days before filming for the pilot episode began. Jones, who is African American, was also cast against the Superman mythology where Pete Ross is Caucasian. Jones has stated that he would <b>have</b> <b>understood</b> if the {{producers}} had simply created a black character for him to portray, but the fact that they chose to go with him, even though the character has always been white, gave him more honor {{to be a part of}} the show. During the first season, Jones felt like he should have more screen time, but later conceded that the show was about Clark's journey and that the other characters are there to help his story move along.|$|E

He also had thought of the stableful of horses which had belonged to himself when he came of age; and of the much more humble position which his son would have to fill than that which his father had prepared for him. He thought of this, and was sad enough, though he had sufficient spirit to hide from his friends around him the fact, that the Honourable John's arrow had not been discharged in vain.|$|R
