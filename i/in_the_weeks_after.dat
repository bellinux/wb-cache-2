In the months after the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes {{to compensate for the}} damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition. In the subsequent years, about 40% of the forest at Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region.|$|E
