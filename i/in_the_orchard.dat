5|$|He {{served on}} the boards of the Electricity Trust and the Housing Trust, among others. Here, unused to not being in {{absolute}} control, and having little specific scientific knowledge, he occasionally stumbled in his decisions. This also created difficulties with the other board members, who were reluctant to disagree with their former boss, regardless of their expertise. But his thrift, a theme throughout his Premiership, did not abate; he was constantly forcing the trusts to use cost-saving methods and old vehicles for their work. This extended to his family property; he vigorously opposed his son's desire to install a new irrigation system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchard.</b>|$|E
