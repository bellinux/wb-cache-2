5|$|North of Cedar Brook, {{the route}} {{traverses}} CR 536, becoming Cedarbrook Road. It intersects CR 680 and CR 711 before widening into a divided highway {{prior to a}} junction where CR 712 heads northeast and CR 561 splits from Route 73 by heading north on Cedarbrook Road. Past this intersection, Route 73 becomes an unnamed road and encounters CR 710 at a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection.</b> A short distance later, the route enters Waterford Township and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with U.S. Route 30 (White Horse Pike) and County Route 536 Spur.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continued}} past Redbird {{into the}} town of Stockton, where it left Cassadaga Creek and headed uphill as it curved to the west. In Centralia, NY380 met CR54 and CR57 at a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection.</b> Here, NY380 {{turned back to the}} north and descended into another valley surrounding the Bear Lake Outlet. The route crossed the outlet and followed the waterway into the hamlet of Stockton, centered on the intersection between NY380 and NY424 (now part of CR58).|$|E
5|$|In Bay County, M-15 follows Tuscola Road {{where it}} meets the western {{terminus}} of M-138 which runs along Munger Road in Munger. As the highway enters Bay City on the southeast side of town, Tuscola Road leaves the farmlands for residential areas of Bay City. The roadway runs northerwesterly near the St. Stanislaus, St. Patrick and Elm Lawn cemeteries, before turning north on Trumbull Street at 10th Street. The highway follows Trumbull Street for five blocks, where the highway designation ends at a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> with M-25/Center Avenue. Trumbull Street continues north through this residential {{section of the}} city.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, South Africa, and Canada, {{there are}} <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections</b> with {{a stop sign}} at every entrance, called four-way stops. A failed signal or a {{flashing}} red light is equivalent to a four-way stop, or an all-way stop. Special rules for four-way stops may include: ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{countries}} use the priority-to-the-right rule, despite {{driving on}} the left. Australia uses the priority-to-the-right rule at <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections</b> where the roads all have equal priority, but specific rules apply for T-intersections. Singapore also uses priority-to-the-right, as well as priority to vehicles going straight and turning vehicles {{to give way to}} vehicles going straight.|$|R
2500|$|In Europe {{and other}} places, there are similar intersections. These may be marked by special signs (according to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals), a danger sign {{with a black}} X {{representing}} a crossroads. This sign informs drivers that the intersection is uncontrolled and that default rules apply. In Europe and {{in many areas of}} North America the default rules that apply at uncontrolled <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections</b> are almost identical: ...|$|R
5|$|M-67 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US41 near Trenary {{east of the}} West Branch of the Whitefish River. From that intersection the highway runs east crossing Scott Creek before running into downtown Trenary along relatively flat terrain. East of town, the highway turns north running parallel to the AuTrain River Basin. The trunkline crosses Dexter Creek between Paulsen and Trout Lake roads. About halfway along the north–south segment of the highway, M-67 passes through the community of Limestone and crosses Johnson Creek. After running for , M-67 ends at a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> with M-94 and Tunteri Road.|$|E
5|$|NY31A {{begins at}} a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> in the {{southern}} portion of the village of Medina. At this junction, NY31 travels {{to the west and}} to the north (eastbound), NY63 travels to the north and to the south, and NY31A travels to the east as Maple Ridge Road. It leaves the village shortly afterward, entering a rural area of Orleans County dominated by open fields. The route heads due east to Millville, a small hamlet situated at the junction of NY31A and East Shelby Road in northeastern Shelby. At {{the eastern edge of the}} community, NY31A meets West County House Road, the former routing of NY31A toward Knowlesville.|$|E
5|$|The bridge ends at a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> where US 5 turns left on Washington Avenue, Route 22 {{continues}} {{straight on}} Clintonville Road, and Route 103 begins {{on the right}} along Washington Avenue. The four-lane Washington Avenue runs through the commercial areas of North Haven still paralleling the railroad tracks, crosses under I-91 (at exit 12) and continues into Wallingford as South Colony Street. At the town line is the Wharton Brook State Park just north {{of which is a}} short expressway connector (Wharton Brook Connector) to I-91 (at exit 13). South Colony Street narrows to two lanes within the Wallingford town center.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 study {{suggests}} that land use patterns {{play a significant role}} in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern. While all intersection types in general reduce the incidence of fatal crashes, <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections,</b> which occur regularly in a grid, increase total and injurious crashes significantly. The study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Route 1 Bypass is a 4.3 mi long bypass of U.S. Route 1 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Kittery, Maine. Most of {{its north}} section, {{northeast}} of the Portsmouth Circle where it meets the Blue Star Turnpike and Spaulding Turnpike, is built to rudimentary freeway standards, with no cross traffic but driveway access. The southern portion is similarly constructed, although there are two <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections</b> with traffic lights {{just south of the}} circle and a third at its south end, just before intersecting with US 1.|$|R
25|$|Past the {{junction}} with NY238, which forks {{off to the}} southeast towards Attica, the highway begins going straight up and down into the creek valleys here at the northern fringe of the Allegheny Plateau. Passing lanes are sometimes available on the downhill sections, particularly in the next community to the east, Alexander, where another route to Attica, NY98 crosses via an overpass. This allows traffic to continue at a high speed through the surrounding dairy and sod farms up {{the other side and}} into Bethany, the next town, whose four <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections</b> offer no traffic control devices to slow down drivers.|$|R
5|$|NY63 {{begins at}} a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> with NY15 and NY21 {{in the village}} of Wayland, located in {{northern}} Steuben County. It heads west through the village on the two-lane West Naples Street to a less developed part of the town of Wayland, where it parallels Interstate390 (I-390) {{on the north side of}} a wide valley. The route soon enters Livingston County and the town of North Dansville, gaining the name Main Street as it bends northwestward into the village of Dansville. Here, it overlaps with NY36 for one block through the village center, beginning at Clara Barton Street and ending at Ossian Street. After another block, NY63 meets the south end of NY256 at Perine Street. While NY256 heads north toward Conesus Lake, NY63 proceeds northwest past Dansville Municipal Airport and out of the village limits.|$|E
5|$|Route59 {{begins at}} a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> with Union County Route610 (CR610; South Avenue) in the {{community}} of Cranford. Route59 heads northwestward, passing a couple of businesses in both directions. The route crosses under the New Jersey Transit-owned Raritan Valley Line at which point the border of Cranford and Garwood runs along the center of the road. The route continues to the northwest, passing businesses before ending at a signalized T-intersection with Route28 (North Avenue). The pavement ends at the intersection though a state-constructed bridge carrying the intersection over a small creek is angled such that a road could continue northwest. Throughout {{the entire length of the}} route, it is four lanes wide (two in each direction). There is no signed speed limit on any portion of the route.|$|E
5|$|Half a {{mile from}} the start of the bypass and a short {{distance}} before the arterial makes a turn eastward to traverse Canandaigua Lake to the southeast, US20 and NY5 meet NY21 at a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection.</b> Like US20 and NY5, NY21 once continued directly into downtown, in this instance via Bristol Street to the east of the junction, but now follows US20 and NY5 along the east–west leg of the bypass. Past Bristol Street, the bypass widens from two to four lanes and, after meeting two local streets, enters the city of Canandaigua as the limited-access Western Boulevard, albeit with no exits. The route loses this distinction prior to intersecting South Main Street, where US20, NY5 and NY21 meet the southern terminus of NY332. NY21 departs the bypass, following NY332 into downtown, while US20 and NY5 continue onto the four-laned, median separated Eastern Boulevard, the original section of the US20 and NY5 bypass of Canandaigua. The roadway acts a center of commerce for the city, sporting restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets along its length within the city limits.|$|E
50|$|Emissions {{from all}} {{transportation}} {{account for about}} 30% of the total from all sources and personal car use amounts to about 60% percent of that share that translates to about 18% {{percent of the total}} GHG production. Three factors that affect emissions from personal travel relate to network configuration and function: a) trip length b) speed of travel c) propensity for congestion. Studies have shown that Radburn-type networks could add up to 10 percent to the length of local, short trips. As was seen earlier under congestion, grid-type patterns induce longer trip times that are primarily due to stops at the characteristic and frequent <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections.</b>|$|R
50|$|The use of culs-de-sac {{reduces the}} amount of car traffic on {{residential}} streets within the subdivision, thus reducing noise, air pollution and the probability of accidents. Ben-Joseph (1995) and Lovegrove/Sayed (2006) indicate a substantially lower collision rate for street networks based on the cul-de-sac street type. Dumbaugh and Rae (2009) suggest that land use patterns {{play a significant role}} in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern. While all intersection types in general increase the incidence of fatal crashes, <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections,</b> which rarely occur in a network with cul-de-sac or loop streets, increase total and injurious crashes significantly. The study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable.|$|R
5000|$|For planned neighbourhoods, studies {{recommend}} new network configurations, {{such as the}} Fused Grid or 3-Way Offset. These layout models {{organize a}} neighbourhood area as a zone of no cut-through traffic by means of loops or dead-end streets. They also ensure that pedestrians and bicycles have a distinct advantage by introducing exclusive shortcuts by path connections through blocks and parks. Such a principle of organization {{is referred to as}} [...] "Filtered Permeability" [...] implying a preferential treatment of active modes of transport. These new patterns, which are recommended for laying out neighbourhoods, are based on analyses of collision data of large regional districts and over extended periods. They show that <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections</b> combined with cut-through traffic are the most significant contributors to increased collisions.|$|R
5|$|M-115 {{starts in}} {{downtown}} Clare at a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> {{with the two}} business loops, Bus. US 127 and Bus. US 10, in town. From this junction, M-115 runs west following the former routing of US10 along Ludington Drive to Farwell. In the middle of town, M-115 turns northwesterly to meet {{the end of the}} US10 freeway near Surrey Lake. The highway continues northwest through forest lands and lake country. The trunkline passes into northern Osceola County near its crossing of the Muskegon River. There are intersections with both M-66 and M-61 south of Marion near rural farms. The roadway subsequently crosses into southern Wexford County. Near Stone Lake south of Cadillac, M-115 meets US131 and M-55. M-55 leaves the US131 freeway and joins M-115, and the two run concurrently along the western end of Lake Cadillac. They separate near Lake Mitchell, and M-115 turns northwesterly between the two lakes passing Mitchell State Park and the eastern shore of the latter lake.|$|E
5|$|MD 410's name becomes EastWest Highway {{again as}} it heads east from MD 650 as a four-lane {{undivided}} highway through {{the northern part}} of Chillum. The highway has frontage roads on either side of its crossing of Sligo Creek, then becomes divided ahead of its intersection with MD 212 (Riggs Road). MD 410 briefly has six lanes as it heads southeast to Ager Road, which leads toward the West Hyattsville Station on the Washington Metro's Green Line. MD 410 has a partial intersection with Ager Road; the missing movements between MD 410 and Ager Road are made via 23rd Avenue to the east. MD 410 crosses Northwest Branch Anacostia River and enters the city of Hyattsville. The highway expands to six lanes as it passes between The Mall at Prince George's and Prince George's Plaza Station on the Green Line. East of University Town Center and the headquarters of the National Center for Health Statistics, MD 410 has a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> with the northern end of MD 500 (Queens Chapel Road) and the southern end of Adelphi Road.|$|E
5|$|MD222 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD7 (Broad Street) {{in the town}} of Perryville. The highway heads north as two-lane Aiken Avenue, which reaches its northern end at US40 (Pulaski Highway) immediately to the east of the toll plaza for the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge. MD 222 continues northeast as Perryville Road, which crosses over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. The highway curves north and leaves the town of Perryville and passing Perryville High School. MD222 intersects the southern end of MD824 (Reservoir Road) and the entrance to the Perryville Outlet Center before meeting I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange. At {{the north end of the}} interchange, the highway briefly re-enters the town of Perryville, intersects the ramps to and from southbound I-95 and the entrance to Hollywood Casino Perryville, and passes wast of a park and ride lot before it reaches a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> with the northern end of MD824 (Blythedale Road) and MD275 (Perrylawn Drive). MD222Truck follows MD275 north toward Rising Sun, and MD222 turns west onto Bainbridge Road toward Port Deposit.|$|E
50|$|State Route 155 (SR 155) is an east - west {{state highway}} {{in the southeastern}} portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. The highway's western {{terminus}} is at SR 93 in Shawnee. Its eastern terminus is at a <b>four-way</b> stop <b>intersection</b> with SR 13 in Corning.|$|R
40|$|Fostering {{road safety}} nearby schools is a {{strategy}} that contributes to build safe, healthy and sustainable cities.

Build environment, socioeconomic data, characteristics of the educational institution and accident data (from 2012 to 2014) nearby 905 schools in Porto Alegre were used to analyze severity. Discrete choice models of ordered and unordered structures were estimated and compared. However, it was not possible to identify the superiority of one methodological approach over the other. The models have shown that the severity of accidents near schools is influenced by school, accidents, socioeconomic characteristics and the build environment, in special the negative influence of the quantity of <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections...</b>|$|R
25|$|MD 414 {{continues}} east as a four-lane {{road with}} a center turn lane {{into the heart}} of Oxon Hill, where the highway intersects Livingston Road. The highway becomes divided just west of John Hanson Lane, which is unsigned MD 975A and provides full access between MD 414 and both the county-maintained portion of St. Barnabas Road and Brinkley Road. The latter highway leads to historic St. Ignatius Church; Rosecroft Raceway, a harness racing facility; and the community of Temple Hills. Just east of John Hanson Lane, MD 414 continues east as St. Barnabas Road and meets the Capital Beltway at a cloverleaf interchange. The straight exit ramps from the Beltway in the interchange meet the highway at orthogonal <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections</b> that serve Brinkley Road and, {{on the north side of}} the Beltway, Alice Avenue. The state highway continues northeast as a four-lane highway with center turn lane and enters Marlow Heights.|$|R
5|$|M-66 {{continues}} northward through Barry County on Capital Avenue {{which becomes}} 9 Mile Road north of Baseline Road. The highway passes through Assyria before meeting M-79, {{with which it}} has a short concurrency, in Nashville. On {{the north side of}} the village, M-66 crosses the Thornapple River and continues north through mixed rural forest land and farm fields. Near Woodland, M-66 joins M-43 and the two run to the northeast and along the Barry–Eaton county line. M-43/M-66 meets M-50 at a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> southwest of Lake Odessa near Woodbury, and M-43 turns east leaving M-66 in favor of a concurrency with M-50. M-66 crosses a rail line of CSX Transportation and the county line on State Road. It meets I-96 in a rural southern part of the Ionia County south of Ionia. On the south edge of town, the highway passes the county airport and curves to the northeast becoming Dexter Street. While entering downtown Ionia, the trunkline crosses the Grand River and the abandoned mainline of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad near the county fairgrounds. M-66 turns west along M-21 (Lincoln Avenue) for two blocks before turning back to the north along State Street. The trunkline runs through the northern part of the county and meets M-44's eastern terminus near Woodard Lake.|$|E
5|$|MD 30 begins {{within the}} Reisterstown Historic District at an {{intersection}} with MD 140, which heads south as Main Street and northwest as Westminster Pike. The state highway heads north as two-lane Hanover Pike through a residential area to a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> with MD 128 (Butler Road) and unsigned MD 795, a connector between MD 30 {{and the northern}} terminus of I-795 (Northwest Expressway) at MD 140 {{that serves as a}} bypass of Reisterstown for MD 30 traffic. As the highway leaves Reisterstown, Old Hanover Pike splits to the northeast and MD 30 crosses over the Maryland Midland Railway. Old Hanover Pike reconnects with the state highway where the highway briefly parallels CSX's Hanover Subdivision and passes to the east of the Montrose Mansion and Chapel. At the hamlet of Woodensburg, the old road splits northeast again to follow the railroad through the village of Boring. The railroad and old road return to MD 30 again just north of the state highway's intersection with MD 91 (Emory Road). MD 30 parallels the railroad through the community of Upperco, which is also known as Arcadia, before crossing the BaltimoreCarroll county line.|$|E
5|$|Levering Road {{continues}} easterly {{leaving town}} south of Sherett Lake. East of the intersection with Ingleside Road, C-66 crosses into Cheboygan County. The roadway curves {{to the northeast}} before returning to a due eastward course north of Munro Lake along the Hebron–Munro township line.. The landscape changes to include more farm fields once road passes the lake. C-66 intersects I-75 at exit326 along the latter. On {{the east side of}} the interchange, Levering Road passes Sea Shell City, a tourist trap, and turns northeastward into Hebron Township. C-66 then turns easterly again before it crosses into Beaugrand Township, taking the additional name Cheboygan Road. The roadway crosses branches of the Little Black River and passes to the south of the Cheboygan County Airport. East of the airport, C-66 enters the city of Cheboygan and follows State Street into town; this area is residential in nature. State Street crosses the North Central State Trail, a rail trail, before turning to the southeast. The roadway passes into the northern end of downtown near several smaller businesses.. C-66 terminates at a <b>four-way</b> <b>intersection</b> with Main Street one block west of the Cheboygan River; this intersection also marks the northern terminus of M-27.

Despite a myriad of research work in the last two decades, optimization of traffic signals in network level is still an open research problem. This paper for the first time employs advanced cuckoo search optimization algorithm for optimally tuning parameters of intelligent controllers. Neural Network (NN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are two intelligent controllers implemented in this study. For the sake of comparison, we also implement Q-learning and fixed-time controllers as benchmarks. Comprehensive simulation scenarios are designed and executed for a traffic network composed of nine <b>four-way</b> <b>intersections.</b> Obtained results for a few scenarios demonstrate the optimality of trained intelligent controllers using the cuckoo search method. The average performance of NN, ANFIS, and Q-learning controllers against the fixed-time controller are 44 %, 39 %, and 35 %, respectively...|$|R
