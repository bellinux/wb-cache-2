5000|$|Jackfruit have a {{distinctive}} sweet and fruity aroma. In {{a study of}} flavour volatiles in five jackfruit cultivars, the main volatile compounds that were detected were ethyl isovalerate, propyl isovalerate, butyl isovalerate, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> 3-methylbutyl acetate, 1-butanol, and 2-methylbutan-1-ol. A fully ripe and unopened jackfruit is known to [...] "emit a strong aroma," [...] with {{the inside of the}} fruit described as smelling of pineapple and banana. [...] After roasting, the seeds may be used as a commercial alternative to chocolate aroma.|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of sugar replacement with erythritol or erythritol/sucralose on textural properties (hardness and visco-elastic behaviour) and flavour release of low ester pectin gels containing 0. 04 % or 0. 12 % (w/w) calcium citrate were analysed. Flavour release of (Z) -hex- 3 -en- 1 -ol (cis- 3 -hexenol), benzaldehyde, ethyl butanoate and 2 -methylpropyl 3 -methylbutanoate (<b>isobutyl</b> <b>isovalerate)</b> was determined using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). In-vitro {{studies showed that}} the replacement of sucrose with erythritol did not influence flavour release, whereas the release tended to be higher and faster for erythritol- or erythritol/sucralose-containing gels during in-vivo measurements. Additionally, different flavour release patterns were obtained between harder and softer pectin gels during in-vivo measurements, while only release of <b>isobutyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> was significantly different during in-vitro analysis. The sensory analysis exhibited {{significant differences between the}} flavoured pectin gels with similar textures, confirming the results of PTR-MS measurements. Generally, flavour perception was reduced with increased gel hardness independently of the nose-space concentrations, reflecting perceptual interactions between texture and flavour...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVolatile {{components}} {{extracted from}} the aerial parts and separated organs of Corsican and Sardinian Teucrium massiliense has been studied. The chemical composition of essential oils obtained by Hydrodistillation (HD) has been investigated using GC/RI, GC-MS and C- 13 NMR spectroscopy. For the first time, a real concentration via calibration curves and response factor calculations has been determinate for each oil components. The concentrations of the major components were 6 -methyl- 3 -heptyl acetate (23. 83 - 18. 16 g/ 100 g), 3 -octyl acetate (10. 55 - 6. 95 g/ 100 g), <b>isobutyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> (7. 67 - 2. 91 g/ 100 g), germacrene D (6. 13 - 1. 01 g/ 100 g) and linalool (5. 23 - 6. 63 g/ 100 g). To our knowledge, the occurrence of 6 -methyl- 3 -heptyl acetate as natural product was reported for the first time. Furthermore, the chemical composition of volatile fractions emitted from the aerial parts and separated organs of T. massiliense L. has been studied by HS-SPME/GC-RI and GC-MS after optimization of SPME parameters. Concerning the organ contribution to the aromatic plant fingerprint, we noted that flowers produced more volatiles than the others organs. The volatile fractions obtained from the different organs were qualitatively quite similar to each other but differed from the percentages of their major components. As well as the influence of HS-SPME extraction parameters (equilibrium and extraction times and temperature) on the chemical composition of the plant volatile fraction was discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe head-space {{volatiles}} of Gethyllis afra and G. ciliaris fruits {{collected in}} the South Western Cape Province of South Africa were analysed by solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Twenty-nine compounds were characterized in the fruit of G. ciliaris representing 96. 5 % of the total composition. Major compounds include pentacosane (19. 2 %); ethyl octanoate (18. 0 %); ethyl isovalerate (11. 7 %); ethyl hexanoate (9. 1 %) and ethyl benzoate (7. 4 %). These compounds may be the major contributors to the fruity-sweet odour of G. ciliaris. Forty-three compounds were identified in the fruit of G. afra representing 87. 9 % of the total composition with α-pinene (11. 2 %), n-butyl n-butyrate (8. 5 %), isoamyl acetate (8. 1 %), β-pinene (6. 4 %) and 2 -methylbutyl butyrate (5. 8 %) as main constituents. These major constituents may impart the banana/piney/fruity odours associated with the G. afra. The compounds identified in the volatiles of the two fruits in amounts greater than 1 % include ethyl butyrate, ethyl <b>isovalerate,</b> <b>isobutyl</b> 3 -methyl butyrate, ethyl octanoate and ethyl benzoate...|$|R
