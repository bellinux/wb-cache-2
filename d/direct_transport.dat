We found that under the action of spatial harmonic oscillations of the channel, the system exhibits a <b>directed</b> <b>transport</b> in either direction, presenting multiple current reversals as the amplitude and/or frequency of the oscillations are varied. The particles of different masses {{may be forced to}} move with different velocities in the same or in the opposite directions by properly adjusting driving parameters. The <b>directed</b> <b>transport</b> can be produced in both directions {{even in the absence of}} thermal noise, the latter can speed up or slow down the transport depending on the system parameters...|$|R

As compared to <b>directed</b> <b>transport</b> in bipartite lattices exploiting the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling recently suggested by Creffield [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 110501 (2007) ], the present scheme realizes a robust quantum state transport owing to the adiabaticity of the particle transfer. The transport is realized by an external force with a sawtooth profile and does not require modulation of lattice parameters (intersite couplings and energy levels).

40|$|Neurons {{are highly}} {{polarized}} cells, and neuron-neuron communication {{is based on}} <b>directed</b> <b>transport</b> and release of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and neurotrophins. Directed communication may also be attributed to neuron-microglia signaling, since neuronal damage can induce a microglia reaction at specific sites only. However, the mechanism underlying this site-specific microglia reaction is not yet understood. Neuronal CCL 21 is a microglia-activating chemokine, which in brain is solely found in endangered neurons and is therefore a candidate for neuron-microglia signaling. Here we present that neuronal CCL 21 is sorted into large dense-core vesicles, the secretory granules of the regulated release pathway of neurons. Live-cell imaging studies show preferential sorting of CCL 21 -containing vesicles into axons, indicating its <b>directed</b> <b>transport.</b> Thus, mouse neurons express and transport a microglia activating factor very similar to signaling molecules used in neuron-neuron communication.

For attractive particles, on increasing the interaction strength, the average velocity firstly decreases to its minima, then increases, and finally decreases to zero.
