5000|$|From {{approximately}} 1978 through 1983, and {{in later}} Korean made instruments with few exceptions, stamps, or [...] "brands" [...] were <b>embossed</b> into the <b>back</b> brace wood {{instead of using}} a paper label. Labels would return later during the Korean years (1990's) and continue through final production in Taiwan and Indonesia.|$|R

50|$|Dave Beer {{has been}} the {{creative}} mind behind the Back To Basics club flyers since the night first began. Over the years, they have featured tongue-in-cheek, controversial imagery, {{many of which were}} heavily influenced by the punk explosion of the 1970s. The most famous of all Basics’ flyers is a piece of customised iconography of the Sex Pistols God Save The Queen album cover <b>embossed</b> with the <b>Back</b> To Basics punk slogan: Two Steps Further Than Any Other Fucker.|$|R
5000|$|According to Gascoigne, 19th century chromoxylographs are {{identified}} by <b>embossing</b> on the <b>back</b> of the paper, distinctly delineated outlines, created by pressing the paper against the engraved blocks, {{and the presence}} of crosshatchings. He writes that [...] "an impossibly and perfect and delicate area of crosshatching will suggest at first that the graver could not possibly have scooped out such small and regular interstices, but on closer inspection the lines in the two directions will be found to be of slightly different colours." ...|$|R
50|$|The oldest known {{objects that}} can project images are Chinese magic mirrors. The origins of these mirrors have been {{traced back to}} the Chinese Han dynasty (206 BC - 24 AD) and are also found in Japan. The mirrors were cast in bronze with a pattern <b>embossed</b> at the <b>back</b> and a mercury amalgam laid over the {{polished}} front. The pattern seen {{on the back of the}} mirror is seen in a projection when light is reflected from the polished front onto a wall or other surface. No trace of the pattern can be discerned on the reflecting surface with the naked eye, but minute undulations on the surface are introduced during the manufacturing process and cause the reflected rays of light to form the pattern. It is very likely that the practice of image projection via drawings or text on the surface of mirrors predates the very refined ancient art of the magic mirrors, but no evidence seems to be available.|$|R
50|$|The cover art appears rather plain {{at first}} glance, but the {{printing}} method was somewhat elaborate. Instead of normal four-colour printing, it used cardboard painted solid red, with metallic silver print. (Black print also {{appears on the}} <b>back.)</b> <b>Embossing</b> was also used, especially on the back cover where ink-free embossing illustrates a tall marching bandleader's shako hat, the logo for the Music Band series. (The next album's innersleeve photo would show the band posing with a cardboard cut-out man wearing this hat, and the cartoon face that had appeared {{on the cover of}} Why Can't We Be Friends? in 1975.) The inner gatefold for this album has a full colour photo of the group (without either Dickerson or Rabb, but with new member Smith), and the album also came with a lyric and credits innersleeve. The track listing on the back cover shows songs in a different order from their actual appearance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Braille is {{a writing}} system used by {{visually}} impaired community. The Braille writing is embossing dots arranged in {{different combinations of}} three rows and two columns. Braille can be embossed only one side using Braille slate. Braille printer or Braille embosser can print simultaneously {{on both sides of}} a paper. Inter-point Braille document looks like having little mountains (front side embossing-recto dots) and valleys (back side embossing-verso dots). The reading finger of visually impaired will read only the bulged mountains of the Braille dots and hence only one side of the document can be read by human reading. The valleys are to be read from other side of the document. When you turn the page to read these valleys they look like mountains on that side. For human reading by visually impaired they are read separately. But when the inter-point Braille is digitized, we can recognize both sides in one scan using image processing technique. This paper presents an algorithm which analysis and recognizes both front and <b>back</b> <b>embossed</b> dots of single scanned image of an Inter-point Braille document. Algorithm uses the knowledge of Braille dot size, and dimension of the Braille cell...|$|R
50|$|King Dedede is an obese bird-like {{being that}} dresses {{in red and}} white royal finery with his {{personal}} emblem, a stylized version of his hand striking the V sign, <b>embossed</b> on the <b>back</b> of his robe. He also wears yellow mitten-like gloves, a red and yellow zigzag-patterned belt, and usually wields a giant wooden mallet as an offensive weapon. The mallet sometimes has other features built into it to increase its power and versatility, including a jet engine, precision bearings, and in Kirby: Triple Deluxe, a chargeable laser weapon for shooting at targets from afar. He has {{many of the same}} abilities as Kirby himself does, such as being able to inhale objects and spit them back out with tremendous force, and being able to breathe in huge amounts of air at once to hover and/or fly. Although he {{is considered to be a}} major antagonist of the series, critics have noted he does not fully fit the profile of a villain, tending to be merely greedy and selfish rather than truly evil. He even helps and fights alongside Kirby in some situations, and has been shown to compete with him in events such as speed-eating contests and mini-games.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} remastered for re-release by Skin Graft Records on 21 June 2013. It was {{available}} as a CD, with all artwork printed using three classy metallic pantone inks, and a LP in three variations: two metal sleeved limited edition LP variants and a standard issue version, marking {{the first time it}} was released on LP in a standard [...] "printed" [...] issue. The same sheet metal shop was used to fabricate the metal sleeve variations, which were different and immediately discernable from the original 1995 LP copies. The metal sleeved editions will also include a metallic pantone printed lyric card inside the jacket, and unlike the original run of sleeves which were crimped and folded on the right side, they were crimped at the bottom. Each of the metal sleeve editions was hand polished differently, featuring the band name embossed into the metal on the front and an individual control number <b>embossed</b> on the <b>back,</b> so that no two will be alike. It was originally intended for release in May 2013, but it was not ready by [...] "press time" [...] as the original metal stamper broke at the pressing plant, which forced Skin Graft {{to go back to the}} lacquer stage. Rittmann made use of the extra time to remaster the bonus track, [...] "Found a Place to Have My Kittens." ...|$|R
5000|$|The first Retina, Nr. 117, was {{introduced}} in late July 1934. The successive model: Nr 118 Retina followed in 1935 with minor modifications to the Nr. 117. The Nr. 119 Retina (I) and the more expensive Nr. 126 Retina (I) follow in 1936. Nr. 117, Nr. 118 and Nr. 119 Retina cameras all had black lacquered top housings, black lacquered body edges and nickel-plated control surfaces. Nr. 126 Retina (I) was the first with a chrome-plated finish to the top housing, chrome-plated top deck below the rewind knob and chrome-plated control surfaces with the body edges being polished aluminum alloy with a clear lacquer coat. Nr. 122 Retina II {{was introduced}} in 1936 with a separate coupled rangefinder and viewfinder and at this point, Nr. 119 and Nr. 126 Retina cameras were designated as [...] "Retina I" [...] cameras. The Nr. 122 Retina II had a problematic film advance lever and was replaced in June 1937 by the Nr. 142 Retina II with {{a return to the}} knob advance. Nr. 141 Retina I is a chrome finished model with a shutter release on the top body which {{was introduced in}} late 1937. Nr. 143 Retina I was the black lacquer/nickel-plated version of the Nr. 141 Retina I introduced in early 1938. The identification of Retina I cameras is based on the finish and configuration of the top housings of each camera and should NOT be based on lens/shutter or serial number, as lenses, shutters and back doors can be easily interchanged by repairman. In 1939 a Nr. 150 Retina IIa was introduced to replace the Nr. 142 Retina II, but it was unrelated to the flash capable Type 016 Retina IIa series of the early 1950s. Also in 1939, the Nr. 148 Retina I and the Nr. 149 Retina I with double exposure prevention are introduced. Late versions of the Type 148 Retina I have a black lacquer finish to the body edges. The last pre-war Retina I is the Nr. 167 Retina I which was manufactured in July 1941 and was for export only. The Nr. 167 Retina I was a [...] "Retina" [...] version of the Nr. 160 Retinette II with basically the same body, but with [...] "Retina" [...] <b>embossed</b> on the <b>back</b> door and a chrome-plated top housing and chrome-plated deck under the rewind knob.|$|R
