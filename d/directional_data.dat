40|$|A {{knowledge-based}} system for inferring physical and biological surface properties of vegetation using nadir and/or <b>directional</b> reflectance <b>data</b> as input is developed. A {{portion of this}} system has been developed to discriminate between user-defined vegetation classes using spectral and directional reflectance relationships. This discrimination program was used to classify targets into user-defined ground cover and plant height classes. The program learns class descriptors from samples (both positive and negative) of spectral, <b>directional</b> reflectance <b>data</b> of natural surfaces (bare soils, natural vegetation, and agricultural vegetation). The system is designed to handle any combination of directional view angles. The explicit relationships used in the class descriptions include greater-than relationships between combinations of two view angles and maximum and minimum value relationships. The class descriptions are used to classify an unknown target using the same directional views. The program was tested by learning class descriptions of various categories of percent ground cover and vegetation height...|$|R
50|$|The Lambert {{azimuthal}} projection was originally conceived as an equal-area map projection. It is now {{also used in}} disciplines such as geology to plot <b>directional</b> <b>data,</b> as follows.|$|E
5000|$|This {{may be more}} succinctly {{stated by}} realizing that <b>directional</b> <b>data</b> are in fact vectors of unit length.

The mean resultant vector for the sample is then: ...|$|E
50|$|Thus the Lambert {{azimuthal}} projection lets us plot directions as {{points in a}} disk. Due to the equal-area property of the projection, one can integrate over regions of the real projective plane (the space of directions) by integrating over the corresponding regions on the disk. This is useful for statistical analysis of <b>directional</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{extraction}} {{technique for}} inferring physical and biological surface properties of vegetation using nadir and/or <b>directional</b> reflectance <b>data</b> as input has been developed. A knowledge-based system (VEG) accepts spectral data {{of an unknown}} target as input, determines the best strategy for inferring the desired vegetation characteristic, applies the strategy to the target data, and provides a rigorous estimate of {{the accuracy of the}} inference. Progress in developing the system is presented. VEG combines methods from remote sensing and artificial intelligence, and integrates input spectral measurements with diverse knowledge bases. VEG has been developed to (1) infer spectral hemispherical reflectance from any combination of nadir and/or off-nadir view angles; (2) test and develop new extraction techniques on an internal spectral database; (3) browse, plot, or analyze <b>directional</b> reflectance <b>data</b> in the system's spectral database; (4) discriminate between user-defined vegetation classes using spectral and directional reflectance relationships; and (5) infer unknown view angles from known view angles (known as view angle extension) ...|$|R

5000|$|By {{expanding}} the effective {{radius of the}} window function [...] (that is, increasing its variance), one can make the structure tensor more robust {{in the face of}} noise, at the cost of diminished spatial resolution.

Relative bearings then serve as the baseline data for converting relative <b>directional</b> <b>data</b> into true bearings (N-S-E-W, relative to the Earth's true geography).

5000|$|Combined, these survey {{tools and}} BHA designs made {{directional}} drilling possible, {{but it was}} perceived as arcane. The next major advance was in the 1970s, when downhole drilling motors (aka mud motors, driven by the hydraulic power of drilling mud circulated down the drill string) became common. These allowed the drill bit to continue rotating at the cutting face {{at the bottom of}} the hole, while most of the drill pipe was held stationary. A piece of bent pipe (a [...] "bent sub") between the stationary drill pipe and the top of the motor allowed the direction of the wellbore to be changed without needing to pull all the drill pipe out and place another whipstock. Coupled with the development of measurement while drilling tools (using mud pulse telemetry, networked or wired pipe or EM telemetry, which allows tools down hole to send <b>directional</b> <b>data</b> back to the surface without disturbing drilling operations), directional drilling became easier.|$|E

5000|$|Mud logs {{are well}} logs {{prepared}} by describing rock or soil cuttings {{brought to the}} surface by mud circulating in the borehole. In the oil industry they are usually prepared by a mud logging company contracted by the operating company. One parameter a typical mud log displays is the formation gas (gas units or ppm). [...] "The gas recorder usually is scaled in terms of arbitrary gas units, which are defined differently by the various gas-detector manufactures. In practice, significance is placed only on relative changes in the gas concentrations detected." [...] The current oil industry standard mud log normally includes real-time drilling parameters such as rate of penetration (ROP), lithology, gas hydrocarbons, flow line temperature (temperature of the drilling fluid) and chlorides but may also include mud weight, estimated pore pressure and corrected d-exponent (corrected drilling exponent) for a pressure pack log.

50|$|Pooh's Hunny Hunt utilises a {{trackless}} ride system {{developed by}} Walt Disney Imagineering. Although other trackless ride systems do {{exist on the}} market (such as ETF's Mystic Mover), Pooh's Hunny Hunt differs in that it utilises an array of sensors {{as opposed to a}} dedicated wire embedded in the floor. A custom local positioning system (LPS; {{not to be confused with}} GPS) is used to manage these sensors. The patented control system works by <b>directional</b> <b>data</b> being relayed from a master control computer directly to the vehicles which are fashioned to resemble honey pots. This data is then used to move an individual honey pot car through a complicated matrix embedded within the actual floor tiles. Every few seconds, the master computer generates a random path and ‘steers’ the honey pot in real-time, so as the cars roll through the ride the vehicles are, in fact, being told where to go. Because this system is in real-time, they can maneuver accordingly in just fractions of a second. This also allows for spontaneous yet synchronized ‘honey pot choreography’ with groups of honey pots (as many as 8 in a single show scene) appearing to ‘dance’ with the others, often timed with ‘beats’ in the music. Due to limitless variations possible, each journey through the attraction is unique. Overall, Pooh's Hunny Hunt is reported to have had a budget of $130 million.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, an MFL tool {{consists}} {{of two or more}} bodies. One body is the magnetizer with the magnets and sensors and the other bodies contain the electronics and batteries. The magnetizer body houses the sensors that are located between powerful [...] "rare-earth" [...] magnets. The magnets are mounted between the brushes and tool body to create a magnetic circuit along with the pipe wall. As the tool travels along the pipe, the sensors detect interruptions in the magnetic circuit. Interruptions are typically caused by metal loss and which in most cases is corrosion and the dimensions of the potential metal loss is denoted previously as [...] "feature." [...] Other features may be manufacturing defects and not actual corrosion. The feature indication or [...] "reading" [...] includes its length by width by depth as well as the o'clock position of the anomaly/feature. Mechanical damage such as shovel gouges can also be detected. The metal loss in a magnetic circuit is analogous to a rock in a stream. Magnetism needs metal to flow {{and in the absence of}} it, the flow of magnetism will go around, over or under to maintain its relative path from one magnet to another, similar to the flow of water around a rock in a stream. The sensors detect the changes in the magnetic field in the three directions (axial, radial, or circumferential) to characterize the anomaly. The sensors are typically oriented axially which limits data to axial conditions along the length of the pipeline. Other designs of smart pigs can address other <b>directional</b> <b>data</b> readings or have completely different functions than that of a standard MFL tool. Often times an operator will run a series of inspection tools to help verify or confirm MFL readings and visa versa. An MFL tool can take sensor readings based on either the distance the tool travels or on increments of time. The choice depends on many factors such as the length of the run, the speed that the tool intends to travel, and the number of stops or outages that the tool may experience.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} study, non-linear spectral mixing {{models have been}} developed and employed to achieve unmixing the proportions of components accurately and retrieving the physical parameters of the mixture. The first focus is on a comparative study of linear and non-linear spectral mixing models. A carefully-controlled experiment was conducted in the laboratory. The aim is to test both models to unmix ternary powdered-chalk mixtures by using the <b>directional</b> reflectance <b>data.</b> The results demonstrated {{the superiority of the}} non-linear model over the linear model. However, there was at least one case when the linear model produced more accurate results than the non-linear model. As a consequence, a hypothesis was made that the <b>directional</b> reflectance <b>data</b> obtained from certain measurement geometries may not contain useful information for deriving surface parameters. In order to investigate this, an error analysis was employed to observe the sensitivity to error of a physical parameter, which is needed in the non-linear unmixing, when estimated from <b>directional</b> reflectance <b>data</b> at certain measurement geometries. This theoretical investigation was tested against reflectance data of mineral mixtures obtained from a laboratory experiment. The results showed that the unmixing could be improved when the angular measurements were carefully chosen. Information contained in each surface measurement can be useful or damaging depending on the measurement geometry and the brightness of the surface itself. The next focus is on the utilisation of non-linear spectral mixing model to retrieve the biophysical properties of vegetation canopies by means of a canopy reflectance modelling. A two-layer model of the bidirectional reflectance of homogeneous vegetation canopies was proposed in this study. The anisotropic scatterings of both the vegetation canopy and the background were taken into account. This new model was validated against simulated and field-measurement data. The results showed that this model can be used to model the bidirectional reflectance and to retrieve the optical properties of canopy elements (leaves) and background of a homogeneous canopy. Finally, a simple non-linear spectral mixing model was developed. The second order interaction between vegetation and soil was taken into account. Results from the experiments showed that the vegetation cover and leaf area index of moderate density canopies can be retrieved by using this model...|$|R
