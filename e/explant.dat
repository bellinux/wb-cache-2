40|$|Because {{macrophage}} migration inhibitory factor (MIF) {{is a key}} cytokine {{in pregnancy}} and has a role in inflammatory response and pathogen defense, {{the objective of the}} present study was to investigate the effects of MIF in first- and third-trimester human placental <b>explants</b> infected with Toxoplasma gondii. <b>Explants</b> were treated with recombinant MIF, IL- 12, interferon-γ, transforming growth factor-β 1, or IL- 10, followed by infection with T. gondii RH strain tachyzoites. Supernatants of cultured <b>explants</b> were assessed for MIF production. <b>Explants</b> were processed for morphologic analysis, immunohistochemistry, and real-time PCR analysis. Comparison of infected and stimulated <b>explants</b> versus noninfected control <b>explants</b> demonstrated a significant increase in MIF release in first-trimester but not third-trimester <b>explants.</b> Tissue parasitism was higher in third- than in first-trimester <b>explants.</b> Moreover, T. gondii DNA content was lower in first-trimester <b>explants</b> treated with MIF compared with untreated <b>explants.</b> However, in third-trimester <b>explants,</b> MIF stimulus decreased T. gondii DNA content only at the highest concentration of the cytokine. In addition, high expression of MIF receptor was observed in first-trimester placental <b>explants,</b> whereas MIF receptor expression was low in third-trimester <b>explants.</b> In conclusion, MIF was up-regulated and demonstrated to be important for control of T. gondii infection in first-trimester <b>explants,</b> whereas lack of MIF up-regulation in third-trimester placentas may be involved in higher susceptibility to infection at this gestational age...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the present investigation were to control bacterial contamination in <b>explants</b> cultured in vitro. Lower contamination rates were obtained in leaf and shoot tip <b>explants</b> when surface sterilized by a two-step method. In the first step, the <b>explants</b> were sterilized with 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite for 15 min outside the laminar flow. In the second step, before resterilization in the laminar flow, the midrib of leaf <b>explants</b> and three leaves covering the shoot tip <b>explants</b> were removed and then sterilized with the same concentration of sodium hypochlorite used in the first step, for five minutes. The <b>explants</b> were washed 3 - 4 times with sterile distilled water after each sterilization step. Pre-treatment of <b>explants</b> (leaf, ovary, and shoot tip) with hot water (40. 2 - 45. 2 ℃) did not help in controlling contamination in in vitro cultures. Addition of Benlate®, an antifungal agent, in the culture medium was not useful in controlling contamination in leaf and ovary <b>explants.</b> Lower contamination rates were obtained in ovary and shoot tip <b>explants</b> pretreated with liquid MS medium containing either 500 mg/l cefotaxime for 3 days. Pretreatment of <b>explants</b> with antibiotics did not inhibit either callus formation in leaf <b>explants</b> or growth of shoot tip <b>explants.</b> 本研究以彩虹鳥蕉(Heliconia psittacorum cv.

Both SHELL+CAM and SHELL ONLY <b>explants</b> released calcium into the culture medium, but the former released considerably more calcium than the latter.

In deep neural-over-mesoderm <b>explants,</b> neural plate cells express monopolar medially directed motility and notoplate cells express randomly oriented motility, two new morphogenic cell behaviors. In contrast, in deep neural <b>explants</b> (without notoplate), all cells express bipolar mediolateral cell motility. Deep neural-over-mesoderm and deep neural <b>explants</b> also differ in degree of neighbor exchange during mediolateral cell intercalation.

Callus induction percentage, fresh weight, color and texture of the callus were assessed after 11 and 22 days of culture. The optimum medium for the proliferation of embryogenic calli from leaf and root <b>explants</b> was MS supplemented with 2. 5 mg/L BAP and 0. 5 mg/L NAA. Concentrations of 2. 5 mg/L BAP and 1. 5 mg/L IBA also had a remarkable effect on root and stem <b>explants.</b> The best concentration to produce callus from stem <b>explants</b> was 0. 5 mg/L BAP and 1 mg/L IBA. Results of mean comparison showed that BAP and NAA were more effective on different <b>explants</b> than BAP and IBA. Results of the double staining method proved that somatic embryogenesis occurred in the most concentrations of BAP and NAA. Under microscopic observations, the different developmental stages of the embryos (globular, heart, torpedo and cotyledonary) were revealed together in callus cells, indicating that the most tested hormone combinations were effective for somatic embryogenesis formation in this species.
