5|$|A {{short man}} {{but with a}} strong build, as a batsman he was a {{vigorous}} hooker and a wristy cutter, scoring mostly square of the wicket. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> good against spin bowling, even on difficult pitches.|$|E
5|$|Cagney, born in 1899 (prior to {{widespread}} use of automobiles), loved horses from childhood. As a child, he often sat on the horses of local deliverymen, and rode in horse-drawn streetcars with his mother. As an adult, well after horses were replaced by automobiles as the primary mode of transportation, Cagney raised horses on his farms, specializing in Morgans, a breed of which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> fond.|$|E
5|$|In a 2008 {{evaluation}} of state Governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking {{him in a}} tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> lauded for his efforts to cut taxes, where he received {{the highest score on}} tax policy of all 50 governors. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> {{famous for}} his pederastic and satirical poetry.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> {{associated}} with the RSPB reserve at Langford Lowfields.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to composing, Poulenc was an accomplished pianist. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> celebrated for his performing partnerships with the baritone Pierre Bernac (who also advised him in vocal writing) and the soprano Denise Duval, touring in Europe and America with each, and making many recordings. He {{was among the}} first composers to see the importance of the gramophone, and he recorded extensively from 1928 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Parsons and Cameron {{decided to}} travel to Mexico for a few months, both for a {{vacation}} and for Parsons {{to take up a}} job opportunity establishing an explosives factory for the Mexican government. They hoped that this would facilitate a move to Israel, where they could start a family, and where Parsons could bypass the U.S. government to recommence his rocketry career. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> disturbed by the presence of the FBI, convinced that they were spying on him.|$|E
5|$|After leaving school, Mühe was {{employed}} as a construction worker and a border guard at the Berlin Wall. He then turned to acting, and from the late 1970s into the 1980s appeared in numerous plays, becoming a star of the Deutsches Theater in East Berlin. He was active in politics and denounced Communist rule in East Germany in a memorable address at the Alexanderplatz demonstration on 4 November 1989 shortly before {{the fall of the}} Berlin Wall. After German reunification he continued to appear in a large number of films, television programmes and theatre productions. In Germany <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> known for playing the lead role of Dr. Robert Kolmaar in the long-running forensic crime series Der letzte Zeuge (The Last Witness, 1998–2007).|$|E

5|$|Ambrose's bowling method {{relied on}} {{accuracy}} and conceding few runs; {{several of his}} best performances came when he took wickets in quick succession to devastate the opposition. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> successful against leading batsmen. From 1995, Ambrose was increasingly affected by injury, and several times critics claimed {{that he was no}} longer effective. However, he continued to take wickets regularly up until his retirement, although he was sometimes less effective in the early matches of a series. In his final years, the West Indies team was in decline and often relied heavily on Ambrose and Walsh; both men often bowled with little support from the other bowlers. Following his retirement, Ambrose has pursued a career in music as the bass guitarist in a reggae band.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E
5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> {{known for}} his concept of [...] "two realms of will".|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> {{noted as}} a singers conductor, {{and for his}} {{handling}} of recitative.|$|R

5|$|Further {{appointments}} followed. Stainer {{became an}} honorary {{fellow of the}} Royal Academy of Music in 1877 and an examiner for the Doctor of Music degree at Cambridge and London Universities. He accepted the post of Musical Director of the Madrigal Society of London. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> honoured {{to be asked to}} be a juror at the French Exhibition in Paris in 1878 and in 1880 was an adjudicator at the Welsh Eisteddfod at Caernarvon. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1879.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels, who {{aspired to}} be an author, {{obtained}} a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Heidelberg in 1921. He joined the Nazi Party in 1924, and worked with Gregor Strasser in their northern branch. He was appointed as Gauleiter (district leader) for Berlin in 1926, where he began to {{take an interest in}} the use of propaganda to promote the party and its programme. After the Nazi Seizure of Power in 1933, Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted controlling supervision over the news media, arts, and information in Germany. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on the Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempting to shape morale.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> {{interested}} in dementia praecox (which he favored renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse anatomic {{differences in the}} brains of schizophrenic patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did not live to see it published.|$|E

5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> interested in the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs' {{success was}} based on fast footwork, an ability to play many {{different}} shots, and excellent placement of the ball. Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers, he adapted his technique to meet the new styles of bowling that arose early in his career; he mixed classical shots with an effective defence. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> successful on difficult pitches for batting. An opening batsman, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and Andy Sandham for Surrey and with Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe for England. His partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2016 the most effective for the first wicket, in terms of average partnership, in Test history. Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly, and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Crawford was {{included}} in an Australian team which toured North America. The team was organised by Edgar Mayne, a South Australian batsman who tried to secure backing from the Australian Board of Control {{to make it an}} official representative team, but the Board refused to do so. In all matches, Crawford scored over 1,000 runs and took over 200 wickets, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> effective as a bowler in the matches designated first-class. He later stated that this was the best tour he had been on; more press rumours suggested that he would return to England {{at the conclusion of the}} tour, but he returned to Australia with the rest of the team.|$|E

5|$|In Dorset, Druitt {{played for}} the Kingston Park Cricket Club, and the Dorset County Cricket Club. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> noted for his skill as a bowler. In 1882 and 1883, he toured the West Country with a gentleman's touring team called the Incogniti. One of Druitt's fellow local players was Francis Lacey, the first man knighted for {{services}} to cricket. Druitt played for another wandering team, the Butterflies, on 14 June 1883, when they drew against his alma mater Winchester College. The team included first-class cricketers A. J. Webbe, J. G. Crowdy, John Frederick and Charles Seymour.|$|E
5|$|In {{these years}} Sargent tackled a wide repertoire, {{recording}} much of it, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> noted for performances of choral pieces. He promoted British music, {{as he would}} throughout his career, conducting Handel's Messiah performed with large choruses and orchestras; and the premières of At the Boar's Head (1925) by Holst; Hugh the Drover (1924) and Sir John in Love (1929) by Vaughan Williams; and Walton's cantata Belshazzar's Feast (at the Leeds Triennial Festival of 1931). To popularise classical music, Sargent conducted many concerts for young people including the Robert Mayer Concerts for Children from 1924 to 1939.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Burnet was a {{chairman}} of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in human biology. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> interested in kuru (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.|$|E
