It is worthwhile to apply some {{energy saving measures}} to overcome the disadvantage of high power consumption in fan driving of forced ventilation. Here we present a new developed controller based on PLC which mainly can control the ventilation fan’s rotation speed in combination with variable frequency drive except for manipulating other facilities in greenhouse like pad, shading screen etc. The control system integrates a sense module which measuring solar radiation, temperature and humidity {{inside and outside of}} greenhouse, an actuating module which includes variable frequency <b>drive,</b> <b>pad</b> control and radiation screens to perform a optimized cooling strategy to reduce electrical energy consumption by low down the fans rotation speed with ambient condition changes...|$|E

50|$|<b>Driving</b> a <b>padded</b> v-hull takes {{practice}} and patience. At speed the hull is riding {{on a small}} area {{roughly the size of}} a paper towel. It is a balancing act to keep the hull on the pad and it requires small steering inputs from the driver to keep the hull flying level. Padded v-hulls will want to chine-walk if no steering corrections are used. Chine-walk is when the boat rocks side to side on the rear portion of the hull. As speeds increase, chine walk becomes more of a factor and can become violent and dangerous if the driver does not know how to compensate for it.|$|R

The transmitter is a buffer that <b>drives</b> the transmitter <b>pad,</b> and the receiver converts the data with various logic thresholds to that with optimum logic threshold. The receiver with the optimum logic threshold achieves the highest sensitivity of 25 mV {{at the data}} rate of 2 Gb/s in 0. 18 µm CMOS. The proposed receiver increases the communication distance over 4 times while providing tolerance against the distance-voltage-area variations. I...|$|R

50|$|In simple terms, {{inductive}} charging works by separating {{the two halves}} of an electric transformer with an air gap - one half, the Plugless Power Vehicle Adapter, is installed on the vehicle and the other half, the Plugless Power Parking Pad, is installed {{on the floor of a}} garage or in a parking lot. When a car with an Adapter <b>drives</b> over a <b>Pad,</b> the two pieces are brought into close proximity, 70 - 130 mm, then current from the electrical grid flows through the coils in the Power Pad to create magnetic fields and these fields induce current flow in the Vehicle Adapter's coils to charge the battery.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNobox is an oocyte-specific {{transcriptional}} regulator. Nobox deficiency disrupts early folliculogenesis and {{the expression}} of oocyte-specific genes in mice. In the present study, we found that peptidylarginine deiminase 6 (Pad 6) was downregulated in Nobox-null ovaries. Pad 6 is preferentially expressed in oocytes and its transcript is detectable at embryonic day 16. 5. In addition, we identified one Nobox DNA-binding element (NBE) within the mouse Pad 6 promoter. The NBE includes a core sequence TAATTA. Sequence-specific binding of Nobox to the TAATTA motif was confirmed. Nobox overexpression augmented transcriptional activity of a luciferase reporter <b>driven</b> by mouse <b>Pad</b> 6. Our findings indicate that Nobox is a critical regulator that orchestrates oocyte-specific genes such as Pad 6 during folliculogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Testability {{is crucial}} in today’s complex {{industrial}} system on chips (SoCs), where sensitive on-chip analog voltages need to be measured. In such cases, an operational amplifier (opamp) is required to sufficiently buffer the signals before they can <b>drive</b> the chip <b>pad</b> and probe parasitics. A single-stage opamp offers an attractive choice since it is power efficient and {{eliminates the need for}} frequency compensation. However, it has to satisfy demanding specifications on its stability, input common mode range, output swing, settling time, closed-loop gain and offset voltage. In this work, the settling time performance of a conventional folded-cascode (FC) opamp is substantially improved. Settling time of an opamp consists of two major components, namely the slewing period and the linear settling period. In order to reduce the settling time significantly without incurring excessive area and power penalty, a prudent circuit implementation that minimizes both these constituents is essential. In this work, three different slew rate enhancement (SRE) circuits have been evaluated through extensive simulations. The SRE candidate providing robust slew rate improvement was combined with a current recycling folded cascode structure, resulting in lower slewing and linear settling time periods. Exhaustive simulations on a FC cascode amplifier with complementary inputs illustrate the effectiveness of these techniques in settling time reduction over all envisaged operating conditions...|$|R
