5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} as oil mines but by then the emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed {{before the end of the}} war and <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances</b> even the slightest traces of their original locations have disappeared. A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the rusty remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained an oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E

Kramer {{would go on to}} form AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP), a political activist organization that forced government and media to pay attention to AIDS. Jones formed the NAMES Project that created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the largest folk art display in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a state coat of arms or seal has {{generally}} been authorized by {{a provision in the}} state constitution or a legislative act. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances</b> a committee (more often than not consisting of three members) was appointed to study the issue, seek advice from qualified artists, historians, legal scholars, etc., and report back to the authorizing legislative body with a design for their approval. Historically, this committee has consisted of notable members of society and elected officials.|$|E

50|$|Party {{politics}} in local municipal government was undeveloped at this point, with many candidates making {{no reference to}} their party affiliations, and instead running on local or personal platforms. The election did however see increasing numbers of both Independent Labour, and also Socialist, candidates. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>instance</b> these candidates appeared to win votes {{at the expense of}} Liberals, allowing Conservative candidates to capture Liberal seats. Prominent examples of this took place in Northampton, Salford, and Portsmouth.|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} two adaptations, both done by Clark, the tales were adapted {{by a number of}} playwrights and screenwriters. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances</b> the adaptations alter the {{original}} source material. For example, A Warning to the Curious frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction and reducing the number of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, is changed from a young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure to a middle-aged character driven by poverty to seek the treasure and acting in full awareness of what he is doing.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances</b> being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E
5|$|The tournament has {{a number}} of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, {{although}} it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances,</b> only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot {{on the morning of the}} first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.|$|E

5|$|The F-4's biggest weakness, {{as it was}} {{initially}} designed, was its lack of an internal cannon. For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little {{effort was made to}} teach pilots air combat maneuvering. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots would slow down {{in an effort to get}} behind their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to use multiple shots (also known as ripple-firing), just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, rules of engagement in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances,</b> as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying SUU-16 external gunpods containing a 20mm (.79in) M61A1 Vulcan Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the SUU-23, virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight. Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing. In addition to the loss of performance due to drag, combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate unless frequently boresighted, yet far more cost-effective than missiles. The lack of a cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20mm (.79in) M61A1 Vulcan on the F-4E.|$|E

25|$|Plasma zinc {{level has}} been {{associated}} with many psychological disorders. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances.</b> An increasing amount of evidence suggests that zinc deficiency could play a causal role in the etiology of depression. Indeed, zinc supplementation has been reported to improve measures of depression in randomized double blind placebo controlled trials.|$|E
25|$|Directors and {{officers}} insurance is provided so that competent professionals {{can serve as}} supervisors of organizations without fear of personal financial loss. Directors are typically not managing the day-to-day operations of the organization and therefore cannot ensure that the organization will be successful; further, business is inherently risky. Thus the business judgment rule has developed to shield directors <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many Zen {{communities}} in the United States confer the honorific title of rōshi to their teachers as a regular title, in deference to perceived Japanese Zen tradition. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> western <b>instances</b> it is used synonymously with the term Zen master, which has a quite specific meaning in Japan, namely the select group of persons who are qualified to supervise the headtemples and monk training halls.|$|R
25|$|The law of {{chastity}} {{has also}} been interpreted to include standards of modesty in dress and action. Sexual activity outside of marriage may result in church discipline, including excommunication, in which a member loses his or her church membership and privileges but may continue to attend meetings. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances,</b> the church strongly discourages surgical sterilization as an elective form of birth control among married couples.|$|E
25|$|After {{more than}} a century of often bitterly {{contentious}} relationships between the osteopathic and allopathic medical professions, we now find ourselves living at a time when osteopathic and allopathic graduates are both sought after by many of the same residency programs; are <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances</b> both licensed by the same licensing boards; are both privileged by many of the same hospitals; and are found in appreciable numbers on the faculties of each other's medical schools.|$|E
25|$|The spread was {{partially}} {{blamed on the}} poor distribution of health supplies due to logistical problems.

25|$|Pendulums {{are used}} in science {{education}} to demonstrate the law of conservation of energy. A heavy object such as a bowling ball or wrecking ball {{is attached to a}} string. The weight is then moved to within a few inches of a volunteer's face, then released and allowed to swing and come back. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances,</b> the weight reverses direction slightly before the position it was released from, and the volunteer is unharmed.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances</b> {{this may}} have been {{equivalent}} to a death sentence in practice, but the actual death penalty seems to have been foreseen only for very rare cases, such as sexual crimes (rape, promiscuity), religious crimes (incest) or crimes against the king (treason). Alamannic law also foresees the death penalty for plotting to assassinate the duke, and for military treason (assisting enemies or causing rebellion in the army), but in these cases the penalty may also be outlawry or a fine, depending on the judgement of the duke or the chieftains.|$|E
25|$|The {{infection}} <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>instances</b> presents as a painless lump {{just under}} the skin. In southern Australia, the presentation is more often as a pimple in the skin (dermis) rather than under it. The infection is mostly in the limbs, most often in exposed areas, {{but not on the}} hands or feet. In children, all areas may be involved, including the face or abdomen. A more severe form of infection produces diffuse swelling of a limb, which, unlike the papule or nodule, can be painful and accompanied by fever. Infection may frequently follow physical trauma, often minor trauma such as a small scratch.|$|E

40|$|A pair {{of blood}} group factors, {{designated}} G and g, was identified in rabbits by serological means. These factors {{were found to}} be alleles, and one or the other or both of them were regularly present in the red cells of every one {{of a large number of}} mongrel and inbred rabbits. The factors were not demonstrable in other tissue cells or in the body fluids. They were capable of stimulating the formation of specific immune isoantibodies when repeatedly injected into appropriate rabbits. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>instance</b> both agglutinating and coating antibodies to the G or g factors were present in a given antiserum. The coating antibodies-which did not act as true blocking antibodies-were detected by means of an antiglobulin test (Coombs test), or by means of specific cells modified by the action of trypsin. The antibodies were heat-stable and were active over a wide temperature range; and under suitable conditions, they proved to be potent hemolysins and also capable of fixing complement.
