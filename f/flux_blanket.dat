The process is characterized by the use of granular <b>flux</b> <b>blanket</b> that covers the molten weld pool during operation.

A large converter assembly, consisting of a 20 -cm-thick layer of graphite followed by a 17. 5 -cm-thick U 0 2 fuel region, is used to convert thermal neutrons into fast neutrons to drive a blanket mockup. Operating at 55 watts, the converter generates <b>blanket</b> <b>fluxes</b> at an equivalent LMFBR core power of about 350 watts, with as little as one tenth of the blanket material required for a critical assembly. Calculations show that the converter leakage spectrum is a close approximation to the core leakage spectrum from reference LMFBR designs, and that the axial distribution of the neutron <b>flux</b> in the <b>blanket</b> assembly simulates that in the radial blanket of a large LMFBR when the effective height and width of the blanket assembly are correctly chosen. Testing of the completed facility with a blanket composed of 50 v/o iron and ! 50 v/o borax showed that the lateral flux distributions were cosine-shaped, and that lateral spectral equilibrium was achieved in a large central volume of the blanket.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} experimental {{observations of}} explosive boiling {{from a large}} (relative to bubble sizes) flat heating surface at very low heat fluxes in microgravity. The explosive boiling is characterized as either a rapid growth of vapor mass over the entire heating surface due to the flashing of superheated liquid or a violent boiling spread following the appearance of single bubbles on the heating surface. Pool boiling data with saturated Freon 113 was obtained in the microgravity environment of the space shuttle. The unique features of the experimental results are the sustainability of high liquid superheat for long periods and the occurrence of explosive boiling at low heat fluxes (0. 2 to 1. 2 kW/sq m). For a heat flux of 1. 0 kW/sq m a wall superheat of 17. 9 degrees C was attained in ten minutes of heating.

40|$|Blanket bogs act as {{the largest}} {{terrestrial}} store of carbon within the UK. Unfortunately many are degraded with exacerbated erosion being common. Although considerable efforts {{have been made to}} quantify carbon <b>fluxes</b> across <b>blanket</b> bogs, less attention has focussed on quantifying losses associated with erosion. Traditional approaches to measuring erosion have relied on erosion pins and sediment traps. However, both methods suffer from several problems and are unable to provide data over large areas. Terrestrial laser scanning has been used widely in geomorphology to create detailed 3 D topographic maps in a range of environments. A pilot study was carried out over winter 2010 - 2011 to test the applicability of terrestrial laser scanning to measure erosion across a blanket bog within the North Pennines, UK. The technique was found to be superior to traditional methods providing high resolution spatial data on surface elevation change. A net increase in the peat surface height of 2. 5. mm was calculated from the terrestrial laser scans between October 2010 and March 2011. This compares with a net surface lowering of 38. mm measured using pins. These results suggest that previous erosion data from peatland sites based on pin measurements ought to be treated with caution. However, several improvements are required to the laser scanning technique before it is fully implemented in peatland environments including the development of a filter to remove vegetation from the scan results, and taking account of 'mire-breathing' which can cause surface level rise and fall in peatlands. It is clear that once these factors are dealt with, regular repeated ground based laser scanning will vastly improve our understanding of the role of processes that affect the surface elevation of peatlands including the relative roles of storm events and long-term seasonal cycles, and 'roughening' of the peat surface as a result of needle-ice formation, desiccation and wind-scouring...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Pristine peatlands are a {{significant}} source of atmospheric methane (CH 4). Large spatio–temporal variation has been observed in flux rates within and between peatlands. Variation is commonly associated with water level, vegetation structure, soil chemistry and climatic variability. We measured spatial and temporal variation in CH 4 <b>fluxes</b> in a <b>blanket</b> bog during the period 2003 – 2005. The surface of the bog was composed of different vegetation communities (hummocks, lawns and hollows) along a water level gradient. CH 4 fluxes were measured in each commu-nity using a chamber method. Regression modelling was used to relate the fluxes with environmental variables and to integrate fluxes over the study period. Water level was the strongest controller of spatial variation; the average flux rate was lowest in hum-mocks and highest in hollows, ranging from 3 to 53 mg CH 4 m − 2 day− 1. In vegetation communities with a permanently high water level, the amount and species composition of vegetation was also a good indicator of flux rate. We observed a clear seasonal variation in flux that was chiefly controlled by temperature. The annual average flux (6. 2 g CH 4 m − 2 year− 1) was similar to previous estimates from blanket bogs and continental raised bogs. No interannual variation was observed...|$|R
40|$|The spheromak {{could be}} {{extended}} {{into the high}} beta regime by supporting the pressure on flux-conserving walls, allowing the plasma {{to be in a}} Taylor state with zero pressure gradient and thus stable to ideal and resistive MHD. The concept yields a potentially attractive, pulsed reactor which would require no external magnets. The flux conserver would be shaped to be stable to the tilt and shift instabilities. We envision a plasma which is ohmically ignited at low beta, with the kinetic pressure growing to beta > 1 by fueling from the edge. The flux conserver would be designed such that the magnetic decay time = the fusion burn time. The thermal capacity of the <b>flux</b> conserver and <b>blanket</b> would exceed the fusion yield per discharge, {{so that they can be}} cooled steadily. Ignition is estimated to require minimum technology: 30 - 100 MJ of pulsed power applied at a 0. 5 GW rate generates an estimated bum yield > 1 GJ. The concept thus provides an alternate route to a fusion plasma that is MHD stable at high beta, yielding a reactor that is simple and cheap.

Full calculations of stability to kink and ballooning modes show the possibility of greater than 50 % beta toroidal with the normalized beta as high as 10 and fully aligned 100 % bootstrap current. Such beta values coupled with 2 [...] 3 T toroidal fields imply a pilot plant {{about the size of}} the present DIII-D tokamak could produce {approximately} 800 MW thermal, 160 MW net electric, and would have a ratio of gross electric power over recirculating power (Q{sub PLANT}) of 1. 9. The high beta values in the ST mean that E x B shear stabilization of turbulence should be 10 times more effective in the ST than in present tokamaks, implying that the required high quality of confinement needed to support such high beta values will be obtained. The anticipated beta values are so high that the allowable neutron <b>flux</b> at the <b>blanket</b> sets the device size, not the physics constraints. The ST has a favorable size scaling so that at 2 [...] 3 times the pilot plant size the Q{sub PLANT} rises to 4 [...] 5, an economic range and 4 GW thermal power plants result. Current drive power requirements for 10 % of the plasma current are consistent with the plant efficiencies quoted.

40|$|The report {{presents}} the results of the flight experiment Tank Pressure Control Experiment/Thermal Phenomena (TPCE/TP) performed in the microgravity environment of the space shuttle. TPCE/TP, flown on the Space Transportation System STS- 52, was a second flight of the Tank Pressure Control Experiment (TPCE). The experiment used Freon 113 at near saturation conditions. The test tank was filled with liquid to about 83 % by volume. The experiment consisted of 21 tests. Each test generally started with a heating phase to increase the tank pressure and to develop temperature stratification in the fluid, followed by a fluid mixing phase for the tank pressure reduction and fluid temperature equilibration. The heating phase provided pool boiling data from large (relative to bubble sizes) heating surfaces (0. 1046 m by 0. 0742 m) at low heat fluxes (0. 23 to 1. 16 kW/sq m). The system pressure and the bulk liquid subcooling varied from 39 to 78 kPa and 1 to 3 C, respectively. The boiling process during the entire heating period, as well as the jet-induced mixing process for the first 2 min of the mixing period, was also recorded on video. The unique features of the experimental results are the sustainability of high liquid superheats for long periods and the occurrence of explosive boiling at low heat fluxes (0. 86 to 1. 1 kW/sq m). For a heat flux of 0. 97 kW/sq m, a wall superheat of 17. 9 C was attained in 10 min of heating. This superheat was followed by an explosive boiling accompanied by a pressure spike of about 38 % of the tank pressure at the inception of boiling. However, at this heat <b>flux</b> the vapor <b>blanketing</b> the heating surface could not be sustained. Steady nucleate boiling continued after the explosive boiling. The jet-induced fluid mixing results were obtained for jet Reynolds numbers of 1900 to 8000 and Weber numbers of 0. 2 to 6. 5.

40|$|The Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) Target/Blanket (T/B) {{system is}} {{comprised}} of an assembly of tritium producing modules supported by control, heat removal, shielding and retargeting systems. The T/B assembly produces tritium using a high-energy proton beam, a tungsten/lead spallation neutron source and {sup 3 }He gas as the tritium producing feedstock. For the nominal production mode, protons are accelerated to an energy of 1030 MeV at a current of 100 mA and are directed onto the T/B assembly. The protons are expanded using a raster/expansion system to illuminate a 0. 19 m by 1. 9 m beam spot on the front face of a centrally located tungsten neutron source. A surrounding lead blanket produces additional neutrons from scattered high-energy particles. The tungsten neutron source consists of nested, Inconel- 718 clad tungsten cylinders assembled in horizontal Inconel- 718 tubes. Each tube contains up to 6 cylinders with annular flow channel gaps of 0. 102 cm. These horizontal tubes are manifolded into larger diameter vertical inlet and outlet pipes, which provide coolant. The horizontal and vertical tubes make up a structure {{similar to that of}} rungs on a ladder. The entire tungsten neutron source consists of 11 such ladders separated into two modules, one containing five ladders and the other six. Ladders are separated by a 0. 3 m void region to increase nucleon leakage. The peak thermal-hydraulic conditions in the tungsten neutron source occur in the second ladder from the front. Because tungsten neutron source design has a significant number of parallel flow channels, the limiting thermal-hydraulic parameter is the onset of significant void (OSV) rather than critical heat <b>flux</b> (CHF). A <b>blanket</b> region surrounds the tungsten neutron source. The lateral blanket region is approximately 120 cm thick and 400 cm high. Blanket material consists of lead, {sup 3 }He gas, aluminum, and light-water coolant. The blanket region is subdivided into rows based on the local power density in the lead. The rows immediately surrounding the tungsten neutron source receive the highest particle fluxes, and therefore experience the highest power densities. Moving outward from the tungsten neutron source, the lead power density drops steeply. To accommodate this variation, the amount of lead and coolant is tailored to the power density to maximize tritium production...|$|R
40|$|When nuclear {{reactors}} operate, a fission chain reaction (FCR) of heavy nuclei proceeds. In thermonuclear facilities with magnetic confinement of (DT) -plasma {{as a result}} of fusion reaction, along with the energy generation, the neutrons are generated too. Due to the extremely low concentration of ions in the plasma compared with the concentration of atomic nuclei in the blanket a neutron balance in the facility is completely determined by the blanket physical properties. The aim of this work is to create the physical conditions in which the rates of neutrons absorption in the plasma and in the blanket would be comparable. Such conditions could arise, if, first, the plasma has a component with a large cross-section of neutron absorption (for example 3 -He, 6 -Li and 10 -B), and second, if materials of the blanket are characterized by record low neutron capture cross-section (e. g., 208 -Pb, heavy water, graphite). Thus, in general, a controlled fusion chain reaction supported by neutrons (FCRn) could also take place in the thermonuclear facility. During implementation of the work a concept of suppressed neutron generation (D- 3 He) -cycle was used. To substantiate the idea suggested in the article, it is proposed to use (DT- 3 He) -fuel cycle facilities with low neutron absorption blanket. We obtain the following results: (1) Unlike the suppressed neutron generation (D- 3 He) -fuel cycle, the (DT- 3 He) -fuel cycle considered here is profitable by its potential for generation of neutrons, i. e. the fact that there could be generated neutrons, which are also generated in FCRn. (2) Tritium breeding {{as a result of}} n(3 -He, T) 1 H reaction takes place in the plasma volume rather than in the blanket (as is usually the case). Tritium will be reproduced in the plasma, where it should be consumed, which will improve its use. (3) An additional heating of the plasma as a result of neutron absorption in the plasma is provided. The fusion neutron source is considered to be the “richest”: neutron generation is accompanied by relatively small-scale processes. The thermonuclear facility with low neutron absorption blanket under consideration here could create a high density neutron <b>flux</b> in the <b>blanket.</b> It can be concluded from the above that such thermonuclear facilities could be used for fast transmutation of long-lived fission products with low neutron absorption cross-section, and perhaps even without their preliminary isotopic separation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of current and any future climate change, methane (CH 4) is an {{important}} greenhouse gas (GHG). However, current global trends of changes in atmospheric CH 4 are unpredictable and the relative contributions of individual global sources and sinks are inadequately quantified. If net CH 4 emissions are to be reduced, an improved understanding of key components, including natural wetlands, is required. A {{study was conducted in}} order to construct an annual landscape estimate of CH 4 flux for a typical UK blanket bog site near to Lake Vyrnwy, North Wales. Flux measurements were made following an established chamber method and sampling was maintained throughout a calendar year and was spatially stratified by vegetation to facilitate landscape extrapolation. In order to identify which environmental variables controlled CH 4 <b>fluxes</b> from the <b>blanket</b> bog, regression analyses were performed using environmental variables measured at the time of flux measurement. In order to identify the longer term influence of environmental conditions, regression analyses were also conducted with running averages of measurements from periods prior to the day of flux measurement. A series of in situ experiments were undertaken to test hypotheses which examined the different controls on the observed variation in CH 4 fluxes, related to temporal and spatial patterns of CH 4 flux and to putative biases of sampling methods due to the limited footprint of chambers. CH 4 fluxes displayed a distinct seasonal pattern with low mean fluxes from January until June, when a dramatic increase in net methane emission occurred; higher CH 4 fluxes continued until November and December. The site was a net source of CH 4 and the best landscape estimate of CH 4 flux (± standard error of the mean) was 9. 8 (± 3. 8) g CH 4 m- 2 year 1. Errors associated with the extrapolation of measurements to a landscape-scale estimate resulted in estimates that ranged from 8. 6 (± 3. 7) to 11. 1 (± 3. 8) g CH 4 m 2 year- 1. Soil temperature and water table were the environmental variables which were most consistently associated with CH 4 fluxes. However, the relationship between fluxes and water table did not always control CH 4 fluxes in an expected manner. At some sites CH 4 emissions were lower when the water table was closer to the surface, a result which contradicted the acrotelm-catotelm model of CH 4 flux, but may be explained by the hysteresis of fluxes in response to changing water table. Strong hysteresis of CH 4 fluxes was also apparent in response to temperature and radiation. Hourly measurements of CH 4 flux showed high variability but no significant difference between measurements during day and night. Similarly, a replicated landscape-scale experiment of water table manipulation was expected to cause changes in CH 4 flux but, despite controlling for other aspects of spatial variation, the manipulation had no significant effect on CH 4 fluxes. Flux estimates were made using chambers with footprints that varied by three orders of magnitude and there was no significant effect on mean CH 4 fluxes. However, the variance of CH 4 flux estimates strongly correlated with sample area with markedly smaller variance as chamber size increased. Overall estimates of landscape CH 4 flux were in the range of previous estimates made for UK peatland sites, but virtually all estimates displayed high variability. Such variability constrained the comparison of different estimates but it is possible to use methods, such as chambers with very large footprints, to improve the results of in situ studies. ...|$|R
