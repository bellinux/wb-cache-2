500|$|During the follow pre-season, Holdsworth allowed Nix {{to attend}} a trial with Dutch Eerste Divisie side Sparta Rotterdam. Nix {{described}} it as a [...] "chance of a lifetime" [...] to pursue his dream of playing for the Australian national side with Sparta having an Australian coach. However, his trial was unsuccessful and he returned to Mansfield and he immediately scored in a friendly ahead of the new Conference season. Nix was not included in Mansfield's squad for the first three games of the season, and during the third match with the side losing, the club's fans were singing Nix's name. After eventually winning 3–1, Holdsworth said: [...] "I know Kyle is a very good player and <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> <b>the</b> fans have individuals they like. But we have a healthy squad here and I picked what I felt was a winning side today which proved to be right." [...] His first game of the season was as a late substitute for Adam Smith moments after Mansfield conceded an equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Kettering Town. His first start of the season came as Holdsworth made changes to personnel and formation for a game at Southport on 11 September. A 2–1 victory was Mansfield's third consecutive win. Before the end of the month, he had scored his first goal of the month, during a 5–0 victory against York City which put Mansfield second in the table.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{release of the}} game, some players were {{disappointed}} that they lost the option of using Quiet as an ally after completing [...] "Mission 45: A Quiet Exit". David Roberts of GamesRadar wrote few developers {{would be willing to}} incur the wrath of players by creating {{one of the most powerful}} characters in the game, [...] "integrating her completely so as to make her absolutely vital during some particularly difficult missions, then taking her away forever.
