40|$|Building on the {{orienting}} {{theory of}} the Concealed Information Test, Elaad and Ben-Shakhar [Elaad, E., & Ben-Shakhar, G. (2006). <b>Finger</b> <b>pulse</b> waveform length in the detection of concealed information. Int. J. Psychophysiol., 61, 226 - 234. ] proposed a new measure {{for the detection of}} concealed information: <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> line length (FPLL). This measure is recorded with a plethysmograph and combines pulse rate and pulse amplitude. Because the validity of <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> amplitude is still not established, one could question the benefits of FPLL to well validated measures such as heart rate. In the present study we compared the validity of FPLL <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> rate and <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> amplitude in the detection of concealed information. Male community volunteers (n = 77) who had acquired crime knowledge through a mock crime procedure, were instructed to deny knowledge in a Concealed Information Test. Skin conductance, <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> line length, <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> rate and amplitude, heart rate and respiration were recorded. FPLL validity was significantly higher than that of <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> amplitude and heart rate.

40|$|Breathing and <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> {{rates were}} {{investigated}} as potential indicators of faking in a phallometric test procedure. Forty-nine heterosexual male university students with no admitted or documented history of sexual deviance {{were divided into}} two groups and administered a standard phallometric test for age and gender preference according to the following procedures: (1) instructed faking of a preference for female children (N = 23) and (2) a no-instruction control (N = 26). Results confirmed earlier research showing that the phallometric test was easily falsified. With respect to breathing and <b>finger</b> <b>pulse,</b> statistically significant positive correlations between penile volume and <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> rate were observed in the instructed faking group during conditions of faking. No significant correlations among the three measures (penile tumescence, <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> rate, and breathing rate) were found in the no-instruction control group.

40|$|Abstract- In this study, we {{analyze the}} {{characteristic}} of biological signals using nonlinear data analysis methodology. Biological signals are not linear so {{to get a}} more accurate portrait of nonlinear signals, we must analyze them with nonlinear analysis methods. The nonlinear analysis method is emerging as relatively new and rapidly growing in biomedical field. One of the most useful techniques in nonlinear data analysis {{is the concept of}} Lyapunov exponent. As we may know, Lyapunov exponent is often used to define whether a dynamical system is chaotic or not. If the system exhibits at least one positive Lyapunov exponent and is purely deterministic, then it is chaotic. In this work, we measure the <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> signal for twenty minutes in two different situations. Then, we analyze the <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> signal using nonlinear data analysis method. We extract and evaluate Lyapunov exponent parameters from the <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> signal. We finally find the positive value of Lyapunov exponent and confirm the existence of chaotic nature in biological systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract StressEraser is {{a commercially}} marketed {{biofeedback}} device {{designed to enhance}} heart rate vari-ability. StressEraser makes its internal calculations on beat-to-beat measures of <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> intervals. However, the accuracy and precision of StressEraser in quantifying interbeat intervals using <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> intervals has not been evaluated against standard laboratory equipment using R–R intervals. Accuracy was assessed by simultaneously recording interbeat intervals using StressEraser and a standard laboratory ECG system. The interbeat intervals were highly correlated between the systems. The average deviation in interbeat interval recordings between the sys-tems was approximately 6 ms. Moreover, correlations approached unity between the systems on estimates of heart period, heart rate, and heart rate variability. Feedback from StressEraser {{is based on an}} interbeat time series that provides sufficient information to provide an excellent estimate of the dynamic changes in heart rate and heart rate variability. The slight variations between StressEraser and the laboratory equipment in quantifying heart rate and heart rate variability are due to features related to moni-toring heart rate with finger pulse: (1) a lack in precision in the peak of the <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> relative to the clearly defined inflection point in the R-wave, and (2) contribution of variations in pulse transit time...|$|E

Using {{a modified version of the}} Sternberg memory task, we selectively manipulated either the difficulty of the task (Experiment 1) or the subjects' level of engagement in the task (Experiment 2). We found a significant difference in <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> wave amplitude between rest and task periods, suggesting that the measure reflects changes in sympathetic activity due to task engagement. In addition, our results suggest that reduced pulse wave amplitude, signaling vasoconstriction, occurs when subjects are investing effort...|$|E

Because central blood flow may be preferentially preserved, we investigated the oesophagus as an alternative monitoring site. A reflectance blood oxygen saturation probe was developed and evaluated in 49 patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. The oesophageal pulse oximeter results were in good agreement with oxygen saturation measurements obtained by a blood gas analyser, a CO-oximeter and a commercial <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> oximeter. The median (IQR [range]) difference between the oesophageal oxygen saturation results and those from blood gas analysis were 0. 00 (- 0. 30 to 0. 30 [- 4. 47 to 2. 60]), and between the oesophageal oxygen saturation results and those from CO-oximetry were 0. 75 (0. 30 to 1. 20 [- 1. 80 to 1. 80]). Bland-Altman analysis showed that the bias {{and the limits of}} agreement between the oesophageal and <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> oximeters were - 0. 3 % and - 3. 3 to 2. 7 %, respectively. In five (10. 2 %) patients, the <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> oximeter failed for at least 10 min, whereas the oesophageal readings remained reliable.

In poorly perfused tissues, SpO 2 readings may be compromised due to the poor quality of the PPG signals. In order to investigate further the threshold where pulse oximetry fails to produce accurate SpO 2 values, we have developed a custom made multimode <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry probe that operates in conventional, reflectance and transmittance mode independently and also in a combined mode called transreflectance. Experiments on twenty healthy volunteers undergoing induced artificial hypoperfusion utilising a brachial blood pressure cuff were performed in order to investigate the possible threshold of failure to accurately estimate SpO 2 values from all pulse oximetry modes.

40|$|Peripheral {{perfusion}} {{is often}} poor and barely pulsatile in patients undergoing prolonged major surgery. Hence, the arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) readings from commercial <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> oximeters can become unreliable or cease {{when they are}} most needed. To overcome this limitation, the esophagus has been investigated as an alternative measurement site, as perfusion may be preferentially preserved centrally. A reflectance esophageal pulse oximeter probe, and a processing system implemented in LabVIEW were developed. The system was evaluated in clinical measurements on 49 cardiothoracic surgery patients. The SpO 2 values from the esophagus were in good agreement with arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO 2) values obtained from blood gas analysis and CO-oximetry. The means (+/-SD) {{of the differences between}} the esophageal SpO 2 and SaO 2 results from blood gas analysis and CO-oximetry were 0. 02 +/- 0. 88 % and - 0. 73 +/- 0. 72 %, respectively.

The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the accuracy of the ear pulse oximetry and the fingertip with the finger sensor in the ICU patients under the mechanical ventilation. Materials & Methods: In the analytic comparative study, 60 hospitalized patients under the mechanical ventilation in the ICU of Moddares Hospital in Kashmar Township were studied in 2015. The subjects were selected via available convenience sampling method. One <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry sensor having been attached to the upper part of the ear and the other to the fingertip, the arterial blood sampling was done simultaneously. Data was analyzed by SPSS 22 software using repeated ANOVA and Spearman correlation tests. Findings: Mean oxygen saturation percentage and the heartbeat of ear, fingertip, and arterial blood pulse oximetry were significantly different (p 0. 05). Conclusion: The utilization of ear pulse oximetry with the finger sensor on the fingertip cannot lead to accurate results of the oxygen saturation in the hospitalized patients in the ICU under the mechanical ventilation. However, in case of any reduction in the arterial blood oxygen pressure, the accuracy of the <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry starts to drop out...|$|E

40|$|Determination of {{the blood}} oxyhemoglobin {{saturation}} in the retinal vessels of the eye can be achieved through spectrophotometric retinal oximetry which provides access {{to the state of}} oxyhemoglobin saturation in the central nervous system circulation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the capability of the Oxymap T 1 oximeter to detect systemic hypoxemia and the effect of supplemental oxygen on retinal vessel oxyhemoglobin saturation. Oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in retinal arterioles and venules was measured in 11 subjects with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on long term oxygen therapy. Measurements were made with and without their daily supplemental oxygen. Eleven healthy age and gender matched subjects were measured during ambient air breathing for comparison of oxyhemoglobin saturation in retinal arterioles and venules. Retinal arteriolar oxyhemoglobin saturation in COPD subjects inspiring ambient air was compared with <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry and blood samples from radial artery. COPD subjects had significantly lower oxyhemoglobin saturation during ambient air breathing than healthy controls in both retinal arterioles (87. 2 %± 4. 9 % vs. 93. 4 %± 4. 3 %, p = 0. 02; n = 11) and venules (45. 0 %± 10. 3 % vs. 55. 2 %± 5. 5 %, p = 0. 01). Administration of their prescribed supplemental oxygen increased oxyhemoglobin saturation in retinal arterioles (87. 2 %± 4. 9 % to 89. 5 %± 6. 0 %, p = 0. 02) but not in venules (45. 0 %± 10. 3 % to 46. 7 %± 12. 8 %, p = 0. 3). Retinal oximetry values were slightly lower than radial artery blood values (mean percentage points difference = - 5. 0 ± 5. 4, 95 % CI: - 15. 68 to 5. 67) and <b>finger</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry values (- 3. 1 ± 5. 5, 95 % CI: - 14. 05 to 7. 84).
