5|$|Skip Holtz {{grew up in}} many towns {{while his}} father coached football. After Skip was born in Connecticut, the Holtz family moved to Columbia, South Carolina for two years, as his father worked as an {{assistant}} coach at the University of South Carolina. In 1968, the family moved to Columbus, Ohio after Holtz took a job at Ohio State University. One year later, the Holtz family moved to Williamsburg, Virginia and The College of William & Mary for Lou's first head coaching position. After two seasons, Lou took a head coaching position with the Wolfpack of North Carolina State University. The family lived in Raleigh, North Carolina for four years until Lou accepted a head coaching job for the National Football League's New York Jets. The family lived in Cold Spring Harbor, New York for one year, while Lou coached the Jets. After resigning from the Jets, Lou took his family back to the American South when he accepted the head coaching job <b>in</b> <b>Fayetteville,</b> Arkansas, at the University of Arkansas in 1977. <b>In</b> <b>Fayetteville,</b> Skip attended Fayetteville High School and graduated in 1982.|$|E

5|$|Judah and two {{siblings}} were boarded {{with relatives}} <b>in</b> <b>Fayetteville</b> for about 18 {{months after the}} rest of the family moved to Charleston. He attended the Fayetteville Academy, a well-regarded school where his intelligence was recognized. In Charleston, his father was among the founders of the first Reform congregation in the United States, with shorter services conducted in English rather than Hebrew. Philip was ultimately expelled from that community, as he did not keep the Sabbath, and the extent of Judah's religious education is uncertain. The boy's intelligence was noted by others in Charleston, one of whom offered to finance his education.|$|E

5|$|In 1850, Cleveland's father {{moved to}} Clinton, Oneida County, New York, {{to work as}} {{district}} secretary for the American Home Missionary Society. Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship <b>in</b> <b>Fayetteville.</b> The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling {{at the completion of}} the apprentice contract. In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again. Shortly after, he died from a gastric ulcer, with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as a professional ballplayer in an inter-squad game on March 7, 1914. He played shortstop and pitched the last two innings of a 15–9 victory. In his second at-bat, Ruth hit a long home run to right field; the blast was locally reported to be longer than a legendary shot hit by Jim Thorpe <b>in</b> <b>Fayetteville.</b> Ruth made first appearance against a team in organized baseball in an exhibition game versus the major-league Philadelphia Phillies. Ruth pitched the middle three innings and gave up two runs in the fourth, but then settled down and pitched a scoreless fifth and sixth innings. In {{a game against the}} Phillies the following afternoon, Ruth entered during the sixth inning and did not allow a run the rest of the way. The Orioles scored seven runs {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inining to overcome a 6–0 deficit, and Ruth was the winning pitcher.|$|E

5|$|While at {{high school}} <b>in</b> <b>Fayetteville,</b> Skip played for the school's {{football}} team at the quarterback position, bringing moderate success to the program. As a high school junior, he visited Notre Dame and met with head football coach Gerry Faust and head basketball coach Digger Phelps. In his final year of high school, Skip was denied admission to Notre Dame due to average grades and his failure to learn a foreign language. Coaches Faust and Phelps encouraged Skip to enroll at nearby Holy Cross College, located adjacent to the university in Notre Dame, Indiana. After two years of study at Holy Cross, Skip had improved his grades and transferred to Notre Dame. After his first year, Skip {{decided he wanted to}} speak with Coach Faust about walking on to the football team during his senior year. The discussions were cut short, however, as after the 1985 season, Coach Faust resigned. Replacing Faust was Skip's father, Lou, who eagerly accepted his son as a walk-on. Skip began spring practice before the 1986 season as a quarterback, but quickly changed to flanker due to his lack of throwing ability. As a flanker, he earned 54yards on three receptions at the Blue-Gold intra-squad game in the spring of 1986. During the fall of 1986, Skip played in all 11 games on special teams. He never caught a pass, but rushed once for one yard.|$|E
5|$|PA 997 was {{designated}} in 1928 between Mont Alto and US 30 <b>in</b> <b>Fayetteville</b> along Mont Alto Road. The same year, the present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro {{became part of}} PA 316 while the section between Lurgan and Roxbury became part of PA 433.

By 1930, PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro, while PA 333 was moved to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury (running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury) and PA 996 was designated onto the road between Scotland and Green Village. In 1937, PA 997 was extended south to MD 60 at the Maryland border south of Waynesboro and northwest to US 11 in Green Village, replacing PA 996 between Scotland and Green Village, while {{the north end of}} PA 333 was cut back to PA 433 in Lurgan and PA 944 was designated onto the road between Roxbury and McCrea. PA 997 swapped alignments with PA 316 south of Waynesboro in 1941, being rerouted to end at MD 64 at the Maryland border. PA 333 was rerouted to head southeast from Pleasant Hall to PA 433 in Culbertson in the 1940s, with a section of the former alignment south of Pleasant Hall removed for the Letterkenny Army Depot. PA 997 was extended north from Green Village to PA 233 in McCrea, replacing the entire length of PA 333, PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, and PA 944 between Roxbury and McCrea. The route was shifted east to its current alignment between Mont Alto and north of Fayetteville in 1977.|$|E
5|$|When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, {{what is now}} PA 997 {{between the}} Maryland border and Waynesboro was {{designated}} as part of Legislative Route 44 while {{a section of the}} current route south of Roxbury became part of Legislative Route 264. At this time, an unpaved road ran between Waynesboro, Mont Alto, and Fayetteville. PA 997 was signed in 1928 from Mont Alto, where an unnumbered paved road continued south to Waynesboro, north to US 30 <b>in</b> <b>Fayetteville,</b> following Mont Alto Road. Upon designation, the entire length of PA 997 was paved. The present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro was designated as part of PA 316, which was paved, while PA 433 was designated onto the unpaved road between Lurgan and Roxbury. PA 333 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Chambersburg northeast to US 11 in Shippensburg, heading north on North Franklin Street and Letterkenny Road to Pleasant Hall before heading west to Upper Strasburg, northeast to Roxbury, east to Newburg, and south to Shippensburg. Upon designation, PA 333 was paved between Chambersburg and Pleasant Hall and Newburg and Shippensburg and was unpaved between Pleasant Hall and Newburg. On February 25, 1929, a bill passed that authorized the state to take over the road between Newburg and McCrea. By 1930, PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro, following a paved road. The same year, PA 333 was shifted east to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury that was under construction, running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, while PA 996 was designated onto the paved road between Scotland and US 11 in Green Village. The former alignment of PA 333 became PA 633 (now PA 533) between Pleasant Hall and Upper Strasburg and an unnumbered road between Upper Strasburg and Roxbury. At this time, the road between Mont Alto and Scotland was an unnumbered, unpaved road, the road between Green Village and Culbertson was an unnumbered, paved road, and the road between Roxbury and McCrea was an unnumbered, unpaved road.|$|E
