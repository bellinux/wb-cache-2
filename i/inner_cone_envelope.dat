30|$|From Fig.  7, {{it can be}} seen that: {{when the}} radius of {{gyration}} r <  40  mm, per revolution-specific rock-breaking work decreases with the increase of <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> angle; when <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> angle increases form 10 ° to 40 °, per revolution-specific rock-breaking work decreases from 7.45 to 1.44  J/m 3 in {{the central part of the}} bit, and the drop rate reached to 80  %; when the radius of gyration r >  40  mm, the change of per revolution-specific rock-breaking work of different <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> angles is not obvious.

2500|$|The welder {{can adjust}} the {{oxy-acetylene}} flame to be carbonizing (aka reducing), neutral, or oxidizing. Adjustment {{is made by}} adding more or less oxygen to the acetylene flame. The neutral flame is the flame most generally used when welding or cutting. The welder uses the neutral flame {{as the starting point}} for all other flame adjustments because it is so easily defined. This flame is attained when welders, as they slowly open the oxygen valve on the torch body, first see only two flame zones. At that point, the acetylene is being completely burned in the welding oxygen and surrounding air. The flame is chemically neutral. The two parts of this flame are the light blue <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> and the darker blue to colorless outer <b>cone.</b> The <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> is where the acetylene and the oxygen combine. The tip of this <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> is the hottest part of the flame. It is approximately [...] and provides enough heat to easily melt steel.

40|$|A methane-air {{premixed}} flame {{with and}} equivalence ratio of 1. 25 was simulated {{with a model}} including 91 pairs of elementary reactions occurring among 29 species. In this second part, the flame structures {{at the base of}} the flame and at <b>inner</b> and outer <b>cone</b> tips are discussed. Around the burner rim, the entrainment of air from the surroundings is seen to be the main reason for the activation of chemical reactions by promoting large production of O atoms and OH radicals. As a consequence, the rate of heat release there is very large, allowing the flame temperature to increase steeply and the flame to be held on the burner. At the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> tip, also, chemical reactions proceed with large rates, due to flame stretch and to preferential diffusion of H 2. H 2 is consumed there, so that the fuel burning at the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> tip is composed of a mixture of CH 4 +H 2. CH 3 radicals remain above the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> tip and, around the tip of the outer cone, oxidation via C 1 route leads to formation of CO, which is oxidized into CO 2, as in any other point of the outer cone. H 2, however, is formed by reduction of water above the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> tip.
