30|$|Regarding {{the use of}} {{authoritative}} sources, the <b>ELCD</b> <b>database</b> makes {{extensive use}} of the statistical {{information provided by the}} IEA. This is of course an authoritative source. However, for the European context it seems appropriates the use of data reported by each country to Eurostat. In order to improve precision, it would be advisable to make a more extensive use of Business Associations and Authoritative sources data that have been proposed throughout the analysis.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} of this analysis is to identify areas of potential improvement of the ELCD electricity datasets quality, considering data available in third party life cycle databases and from authoritative bodies and/or business associations. The work has consisted in analysing and comparing electricity datasets from different databases, considering the <b>ELCD</b> <b>database</b> {{as the basis for}} this analysis. This effort has been carried out in two stages: i) Selection of datasets, databases and quality standards, in order to assure the methodology, ii) Analysis and qualitative comparison of the datasets, each selected electricity dataset was analysed according to previously defined quality standards. Then, findings and recommendations were derived in order to identify the potential improvements of ELCD datasets.|$|E
30|$|Concerning the {{different}} technologies analysed, crude oil fuel based ELCD datasets achieve the best scores in all quality criteria. It is acknowledged the {{extensive use of}} Authoritative Sources and Business Associations {{as a source of}} data and the effort to apply an innovative allocation methodology avoiding black box unit scenarios. Natural fuel ELCD dataset performs better than any other database in five quality criteria. It has been modelled in a way that includes the most updated and precise natural gas supply mix in EU- 27. The rapeseed biodiesel ELCD dataset has been analysed using the information provided by PE (2012 a). Some information was missing and therefore, it could not be evaluated. The dataset lacks the raw material imports –rapeseed and rapeseed oil- which {{is considered to be a}} big limitation that should be improved. Regarding the methodology, as mentioned before, there is a lack of harmonization between the methodology used in the <b>ELCD</b> <b>database</b> and the methodology proposed by the EC in the framework of biofuels sustainability verification.|$|E
40|$|The European Reference Life-Cycle Database (ELCD) {{has been}} {{developed}} by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (DG JRC) and provides core Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data from front-running EU-level business associations and, where not available, other sources. Within the ELCD, several energy-related data are provided, being energy a major input for almost all the environmental analyses of products or processes. The work consisted of an analysis and a comparison of bioenergy datasets from different databases, considering the <b>ELCD</b> <b>database</b> {{as the basis for}} this analysis. The evaluation has been based on the six quality indicators developed within the ILCD handbook: Technological representativeness, Geographical representativeness, Time-related representativeness, Completeness, Precision/Uncertainty, and Methodological appropriateness and consistency. They have been redefined in order to identify key aspects that are involved in both quality and methodological aspects of bioenergy related LCI datasets. Results have shown that, in general terms the ELCD dataset analysed showed a very good performance in many of the criteria and especially in those criteria related to technology representativeness, methodology and completeness. Finally, several aspects where improvements are considered necessary are highlighted through the analysis. JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|E
40|$|Enterprises, {{government}}s, {{and government}} agencies have started to publish their data on the Internet, especially {{in the form of}} open structured data sources. The real exploitation of these free, large open data sources is more and more becoming a crucial activity for obtaining information and knowledge (i. e. competitive elements) in several business sectors. In addition, with the proliferation of Web 2. 0 techniques and applications such as blogs, wikis, tagging systems, and mashups, the notion of user-centricity has gained a significant momentum to put ordinary users in the leading role of delivering exciting and personalized content and services. The term "prosumer," coined by the futurist Alvin Toffler in 1980, has been often referenced in business-related contexts to identify this situation. The chapter describes the application of the "prosumer paradigm" to a real data integration system of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). ENEA, the Italian National Agency for new Technologies, Energy, and Sustainable Economic Development, promoted the adoption of such practice in small companies belonging to the industrial and agricultural sector supplying them with a simplified LCA system. In this chapter, the authors show how a domain expert user (the prosumer) can use the framework to easily map the classification of data flows and processes provided by the simplified LCA system into the <b>ELCD</b> <b>database,</b> containing a standard classification provided by the EU. This makes the proposal completely shareable with the whole thematic classification and vision promoted by the European Commission...|$|E
30|$|The latest ELCD version {{includes}} one dataset of European average {{electricity mix}} {{as well as}} electricity mix datasets from each EU- 27 country. However, the unit processes used to build the datasets cannot {{be broken down into}} technologies. This limitation had to be solved, since the final objective of the analysis is to analyse the quality of the different datasets, focusing on the underlying models and data used. These ELCD electricity mix datasets by country have been originated from PE International (GaBi 2012). Taking into account the above mentioned limitation, the use of specific datasets from GaBi for conducting the analysis seemed to be essential. Whenever <b>ELCD</b> <b>database</b> did not provide the required datasets, GaBi datasets from the last updated version were analysed. It must be noticed that GaBi provides these datasets for each EU- 27 country, but does not include datasets for each technology referring to the European context (which are available in the developer’s internal database -PE International-, but so far not in the commercially available databases, i.e. electricity production from hard coal, European Mix). As a first approximation, in order {{to take into account the}} European energy market, the datasets by country were chosen from GaBi database considering only those countries that sum up 60 % of the electricity produced in Europe for each technology (this value has been decided by the leaders of this evaluation as a first approach, and considering that it will be representative enough for the European energy market). Hereinafter, the nomenclature of ELCD energy datasets will refer to GaBi datasets.|$|E
40|$|The European Commission's project "European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment" (EP-LCA) {{supports}} {{life cycle}} thinking in product development {{and in a}} broad range of European policies. It addresses the related needs of industry and of government for recommendations for better LCA practice, and efficient access to high quality LCI and LCIA data towards better acceptance and wider use of LCA. The project is conducted {{in the context of the}} European Commission’s Thematic Strategies on the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources and on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste, as well as the Integrated Product Policy Communication (IPP). The first main deliverable of the project is the European Reference Life Cycle Data System (ELCD). The ELCD is aiming at providing predominantly European industry associations’ based Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data for main commodities, energy carriers, transport, and waste management in a common reference LCA format. The ELCD is published online via the EC’s LCA Info Hub, the first version being online since July 2006. It will be extended in 2007 and 2008 by further core data in close cooperation with industry. The inventory data sets will be accompanied by recommended Life Cycle Impact Assessment factors, which form the other main component of the <b>ELCD</b> <b>database.</b> The second main deliverable is a handbook on recommended LCA practice for goal and scope definition, data collection, modeling, analysis, interpretation, documentation, and review. These deliverables are being developed through a serious of studies, meetings, and workshops. They will be based on the best attainable consensus among stakeholders and a close consulting of National and International LCA projects. As the third main deliverable, the LCA Info Hub hosts an independent and comprehensive directory of LCA services, tools, databases, and providers, which is the basis of a communication and expertise exchange platform for LCA practitioners.

Within the ELCD, several energy-related data are provided, being energy a major input for almost all the environmental analyses of products or processes. The present document summarises {{an analysis of the}} quality of energy data for European markets that are available in 3 rd party life cycle databases and from authoritative sources that are, or could be, used {{in the context of the}} ELCD. This work {{has been developed}} by a joint project with the cooperation of the EC JRC and the Energy Systems Analysis (ASE) Unit of CIEMAT (Public Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology) (Madrid, Spain). The work consisted of an analysis and a comparison of energy datasets from different databases, considering the <b>ELCD</b> <b>database</b> as the basis for this analysis. The current ELCD energy datasets have been to large extent originated from the GaBi database ([URL] Therefore, in order to analyse background information of the ELCD datasets, GaBi datasets from the last updated version (at the time when the study was initiated, i. e. 2009) have been analysed. The other databases that have been analysed are the following: 	Ecoinvent database([URL] 	E 3 database ([URL] 	GEMIS database ([URL] The main criteria for the database selection were based on the availability of EU-related data, the inclusion of wide datasets on energy products and services (specially focusing on those matching the chosen energy patterns), and the broad approval by the scientific community. Up to 24 energy datasets were selected for the analysis with the criteria of selecting a sufficiently representative sample of energy sources in the European context. The evaluation has been based on the quality indicators developed within the ILCD handbook (EC-JRC-IES 2010 a, 2010 b, 2011) : Technological representativeness, Geographical representativeness, Time-related representativeness, Completeness, Precision / Uncertainty, and Methodological appropriateness and consistency. They have been redefined in order to identify key aspects that are involved in both quality and methodological aspects of energy related LCI datasets. This practice facilitates their use in the analysis of energy systems. The quality of each dataset has been estimated for each indicator and then, compared among the different databases. Even though the final results are discussed based on “qualitative” results for each indicator, the individual indicator component and the total DQR have been calculated as a tool for further dataset improvements. Results have shown that, in general terms the ELCD dataset analysed showed a very good performance in many of the criteria and especially in those criteria related to technology representativeness, methodology and Completeness. Several aspects where improvements are considered necessary are highlighted through the analysis. Sources of data and information coming from Authoritative sources not considered, business associations or other sources are identified and proposed to be used. JRC.
