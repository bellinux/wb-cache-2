5|$|Several Scottish clans {{that were}} {{historically}} seated on Lewis {{have traditionally been}} ascribed a <b>descent</b> <b>from</b> Óláfr. The MacLeods claim a <b>descent</b> <b>from</b> Leod (Old Norse Ljótr), who is popularly {{said to have been}} a son of Óláfr. Clan traditions dating to the late 18th century link Leod with Óláfr, and heraldic evidence dating to the late 17th century may be the earliest indication of such a claim; however, recent research into the MacLeods' traditional ancestry has determined such claims of <b>descent</b> <b>from</b> Óláfr are unsupportable. Other Lewis clans have been linked with Óláfr in various traditions, such as the Morrisons of Ness and their adversaries the Macaulays of Uig, although there is no supporting evidence that Óláfr left any descendants on the island.|$|E

5|$|A distant kinsman of the assassin, Henry Bellingham, became Conservative MP for North West Norfolk in 1983, {{and held}} junior {{office in the}} Cameron–Clegg {{coalition}} of 2010–15. When he temporarily lost his seat in 1997—he regained it in 2001—his narrow defeat was widely regarded as arising from the intervention of Roger Percival, the candidate for the Referendum Party whose votes largely came from disgruntled Conservatives.
