40|$|Many low-penetrance {{breast cancer}} {{susceptibility}} loci {{are found to}} be located in non-protein-coding regions, suggesting their involvement in gene expression regulation. We identified the human/rat-conserved breast cancer susceptibility locus MCS 5 A/Mcs 5 a. This locus has been shown to act in a non-mammary cell-autonomous fashion through the immune system. The resistant Mcs 5 a allele from the Wistar–Kyoto (WKy) rat strain consists of two non-protein-coding genetic elements that must be located on the same chromosome to elicit the phenotype. In this study, we show the presence of a conserved higher order chromatin structure in MCS 5 A/Mcs 5 a located in between the synthetically interacting genetic elements. The looped elements are shown to be bound by CTCF and cohesin. We identify the downregulation of Fbxo 10 expression in T cells as a strong candidate mechanism through which the interacting genetic elements of the resistant Mcs 5 a allele modulate mammary carcinoma susceptibility. Finally, we show that the human MCS 5 A polymorphisms associated with breast cancer risk are located at both sides of the looped structure and functionally interact to downregulate transcriptional activity, similar to rat Mcs 5 a. We propose a mechanistic model for MCS 5 a/Mcs 5 a in which a CTCF-mediated <b>insulator</b> <b>loop</b> encompassing the TOMM 5 /Tomm 5 gene, resides in between and brings into closer physical proximity the synthetically and functionally interacting resistant genetic variants...|$|E

40|$|The classic {{model of}} {{eukaryotic}} gene expression requires direct spatial contact between a distal enhancer and a proximal promoter. Recent Chromosome Conformation Capture (3 C) {{studies show that}} enhancers and promoters are embedded in a complex network of looping interactions. Here we use a polymer model of chromatin fiber to investigate whether, and to what extent, looping interactions between elements {{in the vicinity of}} an enhancer-promoter pair can influence their contact frequency. Our equilibrium polymer simulations show that a chromatin loop, formed by elements flanking either an enhancer or a promoter, suppresses enhancer-promoter interactions, working as an <b>insulator.</b> A <b>loop</b> formed by elements located in the region between an enhancer and a promoter, on the contrary, facilitates their interactions. We find that different mechanisms underlie insulation and facilitation; insulation occurs due to steric exclusion by the loop, and is a global effect, while facilitation occurs due to an effective shortening of the enhancer-promoter genomic distance, and is a local effect. Consistently, we find that these effects manifest quite differently for in silico 3 C and microscopy. Our results show that looping interactions that do not directly involve an enhancer-promoter pair can nevertheless significantly modulate their interactions. This phenomenon is analogous to allosteric regulation in proteins, where a conformationa...|$|R
40|$|Transcriptional {{insulators}} are specialized cis-acting {{elements that}} protect promoters from inappropriate activation by distal enhancers. The H 19 imprinting control region (ICR) {{functions as a}} CTCF-dependent, methylation-sensitive transcriptional insulator. We analyzed several insertional mutations and demonstrate that the ICR can function as a methylation-regulated maternal chromosome-specific insulator in novel chromosomal contexts. We used chromosome conformation capture and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to investigate the configuration of cis-acting elements at these several insertion sites. By comparing maternal and paternal organizations on wild-type and mutant chromosomes, we hoped to identify mechanisms for ICR insulator function. We found that promoter and enhancer elements invariably associate to form DNA loop domains at transcriptionally active loci. Conversely, active insulators always prevent these promoter-enhancer interactions. Instead, the ICR <b>insulator</b> forms novel <b>loop</b> domains by associating with the blocked promoters and enhancers. We propose that these associations are fundamental to insulator function...|$|R
40|$|For some {{systems in}} {{critical}} phenomena, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using conven-tional algorithm are inefficient, because of long correlation between successive MC config-urations. Our system in Eq. (1) suffers this difficulty in critical region between superfluid phase and glass <b>insulator</b> phase. The <b>loop</b> algorithm overcomes this difficulty. We try to apply this algorithm {{to the soft}} core boson system, and carry out calculations with random boson Hubbard model. Disorder of the medium influences the critical behavior of physical systems. One of those phenomena is observed at the superfluid transition of 4 He in various porous media. Here, the examples of porous media are Vycor glass, xerogel, aergel, porous gold and so on. In theoretical studies with random boson Hubbard model which is related to such random Boson system, the topology of the phase diagram and the critical exponents have been investigated. 1), 2) Using the conventional world-line MC method and grand-canonical ensemble, we investigated the following model...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} {{interpretation of}} the genome through transcription enables the production of every cell type's distinct gene expression program from a common genome. Transcription takes place within, and is controlled by, highly organized three-dimensional (3 D) chromosome structures. The {{first part of the}} work presented here describes the generation of 3 D chromosome regulatory landscape maps of human naive and primed embryonic stem cells. To create these 3 D chromosome regulatory landscape maps, genome-wide enhancer and insulator locations were mapped and then placed into a 3 D interaction framework formed by cohesin-mediated 3 D chromosome structures. Enhancer (H 3 K 27 ac) and insulator (CTCF) locations were mapped using ChIP-sequencing, whereas 3 D chromosome structures were detected by cohesin-ChIA-PET. 3 D chromosome structures connecting <b>insulators</b> (CTCF-CTCF <b>loops)</b> were shown to form topologically associating domains (TADs) and insulated neighborhoods, which were mostly preserved in the transition between naive and primed states. Insulated neighborhoods are critical for proper gene expression, and their disruption leads to the improper regulation of local gene expression. Changes in enhancer-promoter loops occurred within preserved insulated neighborhoods during cell state transition. The CTCF anchors of CTCF-CTCF loops are conserved across species and are frequently mutated in cancer cells. These 3 D chromosome regulatory landscapes provide a foundation for the future investigation of the relationship between chromosome structure and gene control in human development and disease. The work presented in the second part focuses on developing an approach called "chromatin proteomic profiling" to identify protein factors associated with various active and repressed portions of the genome marked by specific histone modifications. The histone modifications assayed by chromatin proteomic profiling are associated with genomic regions where specific transcriptional activities occur, thus implicating the identified proteins in these activities. This chromatin proteomic profiling study revealed a catalog of known, implicated, and novel proteins associated with these functionally characterized genomic regions. by Daniel Benjamin Dadon.

40|$|Insulators define {{interactions}} between transcriptional control elements in eukaryotic genomes. The gypsy insulator {{found in the}} gypsy retrovirus binds the zinc-finger Suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw) ] protein that associates with hundreds of non-gypsy regions throughout the Drosophila genome. Models of insulator function predict that the gypsy <b>insulator</b> forms chromatin <b>loop</b> domains through interactions with endogenous Su(Hw) insulators (SIs) to limit the action of transcriptional control elements. Here we study SI 62 D and show that interactions occur between two SI 62 D elements, but not between SI 62 D and the gypsy insulator, limiting the scope of genomic gypsy insulator interactions. Enhancer blocking by SI 62 D requires fewer Su(Hw) -binding sites than needed for gypsy insulator function, with these target regions having distinct zinc-finger requirements for in vivo Su(Hw) association. These observations led to {{an investigation of the}} role of the Su(Hw) zinc-finger domain in insulator function. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we find that this domain makes sequence-dependent and -independent contributions to in vivo chromosome association, but is not essential for enhancer or silencer blocking. These studies extend our understanding of the properties of Su(Hw) and the endogenous genomic regions to which this protein localizes...|$|R
