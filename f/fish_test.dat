40|$|A {{significant}} number of patients with intermediate-or high-risk bladder cancer treated with intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy are nonresponders to this treatment.

UroVysion (R) is a multitarget {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (<b>FISH)</b> <b>test</b> for bladder cancer detection. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether FISH can be used to early identify recurrence during treatment with BCG. In a multicenter, prospective study, three bladder washouts at different time points during treatment (t(0) = week 0, pre-BCG, t(1) = 6 weeks following TURB, t(2) = 3 months following TURB) were collected for FISH from patients with bladder cancer treated with BCG between 2008 and 2013. Data on bladder cancer recurrence and duration of BCG maintenance therapy were recorded. Thirty-six (31. 6 %) out of 114 patients developed a recurrence after a median of 6 months (range 2 - 32). No significant association was found between a positive <b>FISH</b> <b>test</b> at t 0 or t 1 and risk of recurrence (p = 0. 79 and p = 0. 29).

40|$|Alternative {{methods in}} {{ecotoxicology}} play {{an increasingly important}} role in chemical and risk assessment. Already in 1986, the Directive 86 / 609 /EEC stated that an alternative method, once it is “practicably and reasonably available”, should replace the corresponding animal method. In 2007, REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) came into force to systematically evaluate the risk to {{human health and the}} environment of approx. 30, 000 chemical substances produced, used or imported in quantities of 1 - 100 t/a. Within the framework of REACH, animal testing should be reduced or even replaced by alternative methods. The 96 h acute <b>fish</b> <b>test,</b> however, is still a mandatory component in the base set of data required for chemical risk assessment. With mortality as the exclusive endpoint, it is not compatible with most current animal welfare legislations in Europe. Furthermore, there is increasing concern that some form of pain perception, similar to what is present in mammals, may be present in bony fish, and adult fish exposed to acute toxic concentrations of chemicals may at least be suspected to suffer severe distress and pain. A promising candidate to replace the acute <b>fish</b> <b>test</b> in chemical assessment is the fish embryo toxicity (FET) test. In Germany, the FET has already replaced the acute <b>fish</b> <b>test</b> in whole effluent testing since 2005. A major advantage of the FET concerning animal welfare is the fact that embryos may have not yet developed the same complex mental processes and may have not pain perception identical to adult fish. Since the correlation between the alternative and the test to be replaced is one of the most important facts to accept a test as alternative, a detailed literature research and a thorough re-evaluation of FET and acute <b>fish</b> <b>test</b> data has been conducted. The analyses resulted in an overall R 2 of 0. 90 for the comparison of FET data and acute <b>fish</b> <b>test</b> data. Restricting the data to zebrafish (Danio rerio) FET data and all fish data, the correlation resulted in an R 2 of 0. 87. In general, all correlations with different restrictions of the complete dataset (e. g. only zebrafish FET and zebrafish acute <b>fish</b> <b>test</b> data, only 48 h FET and 96 h fish toxicity data, etc.) showed no R 2 lower than 0. 81. For comparison between different biotests, these are almost perfect correlations, and compared to correlations of 96 h acute fish data among different fish species, they are in the same range or even better. However, outliers are inevitable. In order to investigate if the static procedure of the FET may be the reason for outliers, a flow-through protocol was developed. The applicability of the flow-through system in chemical assessment was checked by testing four different “outlier chemicals” (hydroquinone, 4 -chlorophenol, pyraclostrobin and α-endosulfan), which were selected according to increasing log Pow. Independent of chemical nature and lipophilicity, the flow-through and the static FET gave almost identical results for all substances. Thus, at least for these chemicals, the differences between the results from the FET and the acute fish toxicity test could not be traced back to reduced bioavailability due to adsorption to the polystyrene plates. Further investigations are necessary to identify reasons for the poor correlation between FET and acute <b>fish</b> <b>test</b> results for specific chemicals. However, the static protocol seems to be a sufficient testing procedure and should definitely be used in further chemical assessment...|$|E

40|$|Conclusion Chromosome missegregation and the {{resulting}} aneuploidy is a common change in neoplasia. The Aurora kinase A (AURKA) gene, which encodes a key regulator of mitosis, is frequently amplified and/or overexpressed in cancer cells, {{and the level of}} AURKA amplification is associated with the level of aneuploidy. We examined whether AURKA gene amplification is a biomarker for the detection of bladder cancer. The effect of ectopic expression of Aurora kinase A (AURKA) using an adenoviral vector in simian virus 40 – immortalized urothelial cells (SV-HUC) on centrosome multiplication and chromosome copy number was measured in vitro by immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively. The <b>FISH</b> <b>test</b> was also used to examine AURKA gene copy number in exfoliated cells in voided urine samples from 23 patients with bladder cancer and 7 healthy control subjects (training set), generating a model for bladder cancer detection that was subsequently validated in an independent set of voided urine samples from 100 bladder cancer patients and 148 control subjects (92 healthy individuals and 56 patients with benign urologic disorders).
