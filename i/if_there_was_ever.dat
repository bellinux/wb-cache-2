It was then the largest BMX race in history at 470 motos. This was by 27 motos larger than the {{previous}} record holder, the 1982 ABA Grand National (the 1989 ABA Grand National would be 467 motos, knocking '82 back to third). This was {{in the teeth of}} a general two year sag in ridership on the racing side of the industry and {{in the face of the}} popularity of BMX Freestyle, skateboarding and the rise of Mountain Biking.|$|E

500|$|Joe Johnston {{had been}} {{interested}} in directing the sequel to Jurassic Park and approached Spielberg, a friend of his, about the project. While Spielberg wanted to direct the first sequel, he agreed that <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> a third film, Johnston could direct. The second film, entitled , included {{the scene of the}} Tyrannosaurus rampaging through San Diego. Spielberg had initially wanted the scene to be saved for a third film, but later decided to add it into the second film after realizing that he would probably not direct another film in the series. After the release of the second film in May 1997, Spielberg was busy with other projects and was asked {{about the possibility of a}} third Jurassic Park film; he responded, [...] "It would give me a tremendous Advil headache just to think about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Encouraged by the success, Manuel {{dreamed of}} {{restoration}} of the Roman Empire, at cost of union between the Orthodox and the Catholic Church, a prospect which would frequently be offered to the Pope during negotiations and plans for alliance. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> a chance of reuniting the eastern and western churches, and coming to reconciliation with the Pope permanently, this {{was probably the most}} favourable moment. The Papacy was never on good terms with the Normans, except when under duress by the threat of direct military action. Having the [...] "civilised" [...] Eastern Roman Empire on its southern border was infinitely preferable to the Papacy than having to constantly deal with the troublesome Normans of Sicily. It was in the interest of Pope Adrian IV to reach a deal if at all possible, since doing so would greatly increase his own influence over the entire Orthodox Christian population. Manuel offered a large sum of money to the Pope for the provision of troops, with the request that the Pope grant the Byzantine emperor lordship of three maritime cities in return for assistance in expelling William from Sicily. Manuel also promised to pay 5,000 pounds of gold to the Pope and the Curia. Negotiations were hurriedly carried out, and an alliance was formed between Manuel and Hadrian.|$|E

50|$|The {{main problem}} with these games falls {{into one of}} two categories: (1) various mixed {{strategies}} of the game are purified by different sequences of perturbed games and (2) some mixed strategies of the game involve weakly dominated strategies. No mixed strategy involving a weakly dominated strategy can be purified using this method because <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>ever</b> any non-negative probability that the opponent will play a strategy for which the weakly dominated strategy is not a best response, then one will never wish to play the weakly dominated strategy. Hence, the limit fails to hold because it involves a discontinuity.|$|R
