2500|$|Broad beans, or [...] "Baghalee" [...] (Persian: باقالی) are {{primarily}} cultivated {{in the central}} and north parts of Iran. The city of Kashan has the highest production of broad beans with high quality {{in terms of the}} taste, cooking periods and color. However, broad beans have a very short season (roughly two weeks). The season is usually in the middle of spring. When people have access to <b>fresh</b> <b>beans</b> in season, they cook them in brine and then add vinegar and Heracleum persicum depending on taste. They also make an extra amount to dry to be used year round. The dried beans can be cooked with rice, which forms {{one of the most famous}} dishes in north of Iran (Gilan) called baghalee polo (Persian: باقالی پلو) which means [...] "rice with broad beans". In Iran broad beans are cooked, served with Golpar-origan and salt and sold on streets in the winter. This food is also available preserved in metal cans.|$|E

40|$|In cacao {{crossing}} process, {{the genetic}} symptoms of direct effect of male parent as a pollen source on pod and beans performances generated from their crossing are called as the xenia effect. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the effect of male parents on characters of pod and bean components generated from the crossing of several genotypes of fine cacao. The research was conducted at Kalikempit Afdeling of PTPN XII, Tulungrejo Village, Glenmore District, Banyuwangi Regency, East Java Province, at an altitude of 340 m asl, Latosol type of soil, and C type of climate, from May until December 2014. Crossing combinations were (1) DR 38 x DR 1, (2) DR 38 x DR 38, (3) DR 2 x DR 1, (4) DR 2 x DR 2, (5) DRC 16 x DR 38, and (6) DRC 16 x DRC 16. Variables observed were the quantitative and qualitative characters of pod and bean component. The results showed that male parent DR 1 crossed with female parent DR 2 contributed in increasing <b>fresh</b> <b>bean</b> weight (34. 70 %), fresh bean/pod weight (44. 32 %), <b>fresh</b> single <b>bean</b> weight (31. 00 %), pod apex and base constriction shapes.

Due to almost 500 years of Ottoman rule, Bosnian food {{is closely related to}} Turkish, Greek, and other former Ottoman and Mediterranean cuisines. However, years of Austrian rule can be detected in the many influences from Central Europe. Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, but usually in very small quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are completely natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish.

The best local wine comes from the southern region of the country, Herzegovina, where the climate is particularly suitable for growing grapes.

40|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry {{was used}} to evaluate the effect of storage at 10 degreesC, 20 degreesC and 30 degreesC, and 40 % and 65 % relative humidity (RH) on adzuki bean starch gelatinisation and protein denaturation temperatures. Storage for 6 months at an elevated storage temperature (30 degreesC) caused increases in the starch gelatinisation onset temperature (T-o) and gelatinisation peak temperature (T-p) for both Bloodwood and Erimo varieties. Storage at 40 % RH resulted in higher T-o and T-p values than storage at 65 % RH. The T-o of starch from Bloodwood and Erimo beans stored for up to 1. 5 months at 10 degreesC and 65 % were similar to those of <b>fresh</b> <b>beans.</b> The changes in the salt-soluble protein component were less clear cut than those of the starch. Nonetheless, protein extracted from beans stored at 40 % RH exhibited significantly lower T-o and T-p values compared with those stored at 65 % RH. This indicates some destabilisation of the protein at the higher RH. These results suggest that detrimental changes occur in starch and, to a lesser extent protein, of adzuki beans stored under unfavourable conditions. On the basis of these results, the best storage conditions to maintain the characteristics of <b>fresh</b> <b>beans</b> are low temperatures (e. g. 10 degreesC) and high RH (e. g. 65 %).

40|$|Twelve {{consumer}} {{retail markets}} in Uganda were studied 1998 in March and June of 1990 {{to determine the}} fresh and dry bean cultivars offered and to determine factors that explain variation in market prices. A total of 33 cultivars were offered in March and 30 in June in both the fresh and dry form. Kanyabwa and Nambale were the most frequently occurring cultivars. The revenue advantage of fresh over dry beans ranged from 30 to 279 percent across the cultivars sold. Farmers thus have a revenue incentive to supply <b>fresh</b> <b>beans.</b> Markets external to Kampala had significantly lower fresh, but not dry bean prices than Kampala markets. The bean grain characteristics size and color were not significant in explaining price variability. The implication for bean breeders in Uganda is that size should not be an important criterion for in a selection program and color should only be used when in conjunction with geographical area. The overall results suggest that preferences for beans, as reflected by consumer-prices paid, are a function of taste and grain size and color were not strong indicators or proxies of tast...|$|E

The nutritional aspect is mainly related to the fatty constituents, whereas xanthine alkaloids are responsible of the CNS excitation, cardiovascular activity and diuretic effect (1, 2). The fatty acids composition of cocoa beans is of enormous interest for processing and quality control during manufacture of the product (3), and the content of saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the omega- 6 and omega- 3 ratio are fundamental for defining the healthy properties of cocoa.

40|$|Favism is a {{potential}} obstacle {{to the use of}} the fava bean in the development of a locally produced, inexpensive weaning food for the Middle East and North Africa. The purposes of this study were to define the epidemiology of favism, to evaluate the advisability of using the fava bean in a weaning food, and to suggest ways of avoiding or eliminating the toxic factor in the bean. Field observations, locally acquired data, and a literature review suggested that the use of the fava bean in a weaning food would be hazardous, but that the hazard might be overcome by using certain strains of the bean or, more particularly, by using old dried beans. The disease is usually directly related in time to the harvesting and availability of <b>fresh</b> <b>beans,</b> but it is also associated with fresh dried beans. On the basis of the age distribution of the disease, patterns of bean consumption, and local food taboos it appears that the toxic factor is concentrated in the skin of the bean, that it is heat-stable, that in dried beans it decreases with age, and that it crosses into the breast milk of lactating mothers. It also appears that disease expression may be a result of the interaction of several host factors, such as nutritional status and the consumption of other foods. These observations are consistent with the results of laboratory studies, which incriminate vicine, divicine, and DOPA in the etiology of favism...|$|E
