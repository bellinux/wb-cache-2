5|$|On October 4, 1957, {{the very}} {{evening of the}} launch of Sputnik, {{students}} and faculty met at the Observatory and constructed an improvised radio interferometer. They published the first precise <b>ephemeris</b> in Nature in November. Their success helped gather momentum and funding for the radio astronomy program.|$|E
5|$|Sources: NASA/NSSDC, Sheppard, et al. 2005. For the {{recently}} discovered outer irregular moons (Francisco through Ferdinand) {{the most accurate}} orbital data can be generated with the Natural Satellites <b>Ephemeris</b> Service. The irregulars are significantly perturbed by the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The first {{accurate}} atomic clock, a caesium standard {{based on}} a certain transition of the caesium-133 atom, was built by Louis Essen in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. Calibration of the caesium standard atomic clock {{was carried out by}} the use of the astronomical time scale <b>ephemeris</b> time (ET).|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 2001, Titania occulted {{a bright}} star (HIP106829) with a visible {{magnitude}} of 7.2; {{this was an}} opportunity to both refine Titania's diameter and <b>ephemeris,</b> and to detect any extant atmosphere. The data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar); if it exists, {{it would have to be}} far thinner than that of Triton or Pluto. This upper limit is still several times higher than the maximum possible surface pressure of the carbon dioxide, meaning that the measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Harrington died in January 1993, {{without having}} found Planet X. Six months before, E. Myles Standish had used data from Voyager 2s 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised the planet's total mass {{downward}} by 0.5%—an amount {{comparable to the}} mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. When Neptune's newly determined mass {{was used in the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental <b>Ephemeris</b> (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a PlanetX, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 that {{can be attributed to the}} gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System. Today, most astronomers agree that PlanetX, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>ephemeris</b> data is {{transmitted}} every 30 seconds, the information itself may {{be up to}} two hours old. Variability in solar radiation pressure has an indirect effect on GPS accuracy due to its effect on <b>ephemeris</b> errors. If a fast time to first fix (TTFF) is needed, {{it is possible to}} upload a valid <b>ephemeris</b> to a receiver, and in addition to setting the time, a position fix can be obtained in under ten seconds. It is feasible to put such <b>ephemeris</b> data on the web so it can be loaded into mobile GPS devices. See also Assisted GPS.|$|E
25|$|While {{the slow}} {{data can be}} updated every minute if necessary, <b>ephemeris</b> errors and {{ionosphere}} errors do not change this frequently, so they are only updated every two minutes and are considered valid {{for up to six}} minutes.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} above {{formulae}} give {{the length of}} the tropical year in <b>ephemeris</b> days (equal to 86,400 SI seconds), not solar days. It is the number of solar days in a tropical year that is important for keeping the calendar in synch with the seasons (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{phase curve}} {{is useful for}} characterizing an object's {{regolith}} (soil) and atmosphere. It is also the basis for computing the geometrical albedo and the Bond albedo of the body. In <b>ephemeris</b> generation, the phase curve is {{used in conjunction with}} the distances from the object to the Sun and the Earth to calculate the apparent magnitude.|$|E
25|$|They {{also used}} {{a form of}} Fourier {{analysis}} to compute <b>ephemeris</b> (tables of astronomical positions), which was discovered in the 1950s by Otto Neugebauer. To make calculations of the movements of celestial bodies, the Babylonians used basic arithmetic and a coordinate system based on the ecliptic, {{the part of the}} heavens that the sun and planets travel through.|$|E
25|$|To {{this the}} Portuguese used the astronomical tables (<b>Ephemeris),</b> {{precious}} tools for oceanic navigation, which {{have experienced a}} remarkable diffusion in the fifteenth century. These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing to calculate latitude. The tables of the Almanach Perpetuum, by astronomer Abraham Zacuto, published in Leiria in 1496, were used along with its improved astrolabe, by Vasco da Gama and Pedro Álvares Cabral.|$|E
25|$|By 1926, South African {{astronomer}} William Stephen Finsen {{calculated the}} approximate orbit elements close to those now accepted for this system. All future positions are now sufficiently accurate for visual observers {{to determine the}} relative places of the stars from a binary star <b>ephemeris.</b> Others, like the Belgian astronomer D. Pourbaix (2002), have regularly refined the precision of any new published orbital elements.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the loss}} of NASA JPL Mars {{spacecraft}} Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), Mars Express team was requested to perform actions {{in the hopes of}} visually identifying the American spacecraft. Based on last <b>ephemeris</b> of MGS provided by JPL, the on-board high definition HRSC camera swept a region of the MGS orbit. Two attempts were made to find the craft, both unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|From these {{estimates}} of the orbital periods of Io and the other Galilean moons, astronomers hoped to generate <b>ephemeris</b> tables predicting the positions of each moon with respect to Jupiter, as well as when each moon would transit the face of Jupiter or be eclipsed by it. One benefit of such predictions, particularly those of satellite eclipses by Jupiter since they were subject to less observer error, would be determining an observer's longitude on Earth {{with respect to the}} prime meridian. By observing an eclipse of a Jovian satellite, an observer could determine the current time at the prime meridian by looking up the eclipse in an <b>ephemeris</b> table. Io was particularly useful for this purpose since its shorter orbital period and closer distance to Jupiter made eclipses more frequent and less affected by Jupiter's axial tilt. Knowing the time at the prime meridian and the local time, the observer's longitude could then be calculated. Galileo attempted to produce a table predicting the positions of the Jovian satellites and eclipse timings after he negotiated first with Spain and then with The Netherlands to create a system for measuring longitude at sea using eclipse timings. However, he was never able to generate accurate predictions far enough ahead in time to be useful so he never published his tables. This left the tables published by Simon Marius in Mundus Iovialis and Giovanni Battista Hodierna in 1654 as the most accurate <b>ephemeris</b> tables available, even though they too were unable to predict the moons' positions with sufficient accuracy.|$|E
25|$|For a year Columbus {{and his men}} {{remained}} {{stranded on}} Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from Hispaniola. The island's governor, Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres, detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime, Columbus mesmerized the natives by correctly predicting a lunar eclipse for February 29, 1504, using the <b>Ephemeris</b> of the German astronomer Regiomontanus.|$|E
25|$|The {{tropical}} {{year in the}} 1960 definition was not measured but calculated from a formula describing a mean {{tropical year}} that decreased linearly over time, hence the curious reference to a specific instantaneous tropical year. This was in conformity with the <b>ephemeris</b> time scale adopted by the IAU in 1952. This definition brings the observed positions of the celestial bodies into accord with Newtonian dynamical theories of their motion. Specifically, those tables used {{for most of the}} 20th century were Newcomb's Tables of the Sun (used from 1900 through 1983) and Brown's Tables of the Moon (used from 1923 through 1983).|$|E
25|$|Fain {{would the}} muse exalt her tuneful lays,And chant in strains sublime Banneker's praise;Fain would the soar on Fame's majestic wing,Thy genius, great Banneker, to sing;Thy talents and thy greatness would I shew,Not in applausive strains to thee undue;..............Long may thou live an {{evidence}} to shew,That Afric's sable race have talents too.

25|$|Finally, the <b>Ephemeris</b> {{attributed}} to Dictys of Crete, {{who claims to}} have been present at the Trojan War, was probably written in the 1st century CE or perhaps a little earlier. It falls into a tradition of anti-Homeric literature, based on the supposition that Homer got most things about the Trojan War wrong by making virtuous people look like villains, and vice versa. It is important because later historians took Dictys as a historical record, including Sisyphus of Cos, John Malalas, George Cedrenus, John of Antioch, and others. Many Western mediaeval writers also accepted Dictys (in the Latin summary by Lucius Septimius) as the definitive account of the Trojan War.|$|E
25|$|The navigational {{message is}} {{modulated}} at 50 bits per second. The superframe {{of the open}} signal is 7500 bits long and consists of 5 frames of 30 seconds, taking 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) to transmit the continuous message. Each frame is 1500 bits long and consists of 15 strings of 100 bits (2 seconds for each string), with 85 bits (1.7 seconds) for data and check-sum bits, and 15 bits (0.3 seconds) for time mark. Strings 1-4 provide immediate data for the transmitting satellite, and are repeated every frame; the data include <b>ephemeris,</b> clock and frequency offsets, and satellite status. Strings 5-15 provide non-immediate data (i.e. almanac) for each satellite in the constellation, with frames I-IV each describing five satellites, and frame V describing remaining four satellites.|$|E
25|$|This {{system was}} {{deployed}} to satisfy {{scientific and technical}} intelligence collection requirements during the Cold War. The first installation (designated AN/FPS-17, XW-1) at Diyarbakir was originally intended to provide surveillance of the USSR's missile test range at Kapustin Yar south of Stalingrad - especially to detect missile launchings. The data it produced, however, exceeded surveillance requirements, permitting the derivation of missile trajectories, the identification of earth satellite launches, the calculation of a satellite's <b>ephemeris</b> (position and orbit), and the synthesis of booster rocket performance. The success achieved by this fixed-beam radar led to the co-location of a tracking radar (AN/FPS-79), beginning in mid-1964. Together, these radars had the capability for estimating the configuration and dimensions of satellites or missiles and observing the reentry of manned or unmanned vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} was {{operated by}} turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via {{a crown gear}} to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible {{on the front of}} fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian <b>ephemeris</b> tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.|$|E
