25|$|During World War Two {{he was a}} {{parachute}} instructor at Ringway during {{the formation of the}} British Airborne Forces, and was then attached to 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, with whom he fought in North Africa, Sicily and Italy. During the attack on Sicily his glider landed in the sea and he swam to shore with 3 other survivors. He was then posted to HQ 1st Airborne Division and ended up at the bridge in Arnhem with 2 Para, where he was eventually taken prisoner.

25|$|World War I badly {{affected}} his financial situation, {{and he had}} a family to take care of, for in 1899 he had married Marguerite Carton de Wiart (1872–1939), and the children had come thick and fast, eight in all. He felt compelled to find a position, and in 1924 he was appointed director of the Municipal Conservatory of Bruges, a function that came with a teaching load. He assumed it with some reluctance, but he discovered that he enjoyed teaching, even “regret that I didn’t enter the teaching profession until I was 54.” He kept on composing, albeit at a slower rate. Also, he ceased composing oratorios, which he considered his major works, but that was at least as much due to the death of Charles Martens (1866–1921), his librettist as well as his Maecenas, the tireless propagandist of his music and above all his friend, whose name <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>mentioned</b> without preceding it with “my good friend” or similar expression.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the week}} of July 7, 2008, Pearls Before Swine parodied the {{tendency}} of Funky Winkerbean towards killing off main characters when it killed off Rat and the strip's own author, Stephan Pastis (the two would later {{be returned to the}} strip via the intervention of United Feature Syndicate), with Tom Batiuk even allowing Pastis to use his representation of the Angel of Death in the second to last strip in the series. A year earlier, as part of a long series featuring multiple storylines, Pastis remarked to Pig that serial strips handle long stories better and featured Funky, Holly, Lisa, and Les in a parody referencing, among other things, Lisa's breast cancer. Pastis was given Batiuk's blessing to run the strip, but just before it was scheduled to run the controversy over the cancer storyline grew to the point where Pastis pulled it from publication as he believed, although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>mentioned</b> the disease by name, anyone who read his strip could infer that he was making light of cancer patients and Pastis did not wish to have Pearls drawn into the controversy.|$|E

500|$|Alfred North Whitehead {{was born}} in Ramsgate, Kent, England, in 1861. [...] His father, Alfred Whitehead, was a {{minister}} and schoolmaster of Chatham House Academy, a school for boys established by Thomas Whitehead, Alfred North's grandfather. [...] Whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful schoolmasters, but that his grandfather was the more extraordinary man. [...] Whitehead's mother was Maria Sarah Whitehead, formerly Maria Sarah Buckmaster. Whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother, as <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>mentioned</b> her in any of his writings, and {{there is evidence that}} Whitehead's wife, Evelyn, had a low opinion of her.|$|E
500|$|Neil Gaiman {{had written}} an episode, {{but it was}} pushed to the next series due to budget {{constraints}} and was replaced with [...] "The Lodger" [...] instead. [...] "The Lodger" [...] was adapted from a comic strip {{of the same name}} writer Gareth Roberts had done for Doctor Who Magazine, although he said most of it started [...] "from scratch" [...] The story was inspired by wishing to see the Doctor in normal, every-day human circumstances, as well as Roberts' enjoyment of stories set on Earth rather than in space. Roberts was interested in doing a television version of the story, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>mentioned</b> it. However, Moffat was a fan of the comic story and immediately asked to adapt it into an episode when he became showrunner.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert Mant, a {{journalist}} who covered the tour, investigated the leak in the mid-1990s. He died in 1997, but had arranged for a summary of his findings {{to be sent to}} David Frith with a request not to publish the information before Bradman died. Mant believed the leak was not a serious crime and pointed out that any of the players except Ponsford and Richardson, who were batting at the time Warner entered the dressing room, could have leaked the story. Bradman, in correspondence with Mant in 1992, continued to blame Fingleton and would never forgive the [...] "dastardly lie he concocted about me" [...] and hoped Mant could clear Bradman's name. As part of his investigations, Mant contacted Corbett's family. Corbett died in 1944, and his son Mac said <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>mentioned</b> the leak. However, his daughter Helen related that Corbett had spoken to his wife about the affair. She had told Helen that Corbett had received the information from Bradman. Mant believed that while Corbett may have played a joke on Fingleton in naming the culprit, he would not have done so with his wife.|$|E

500|$|... l. [...] According to Pausanias, Demosthenes {{himself and}} others had {{declared}} that the orator had taken {{no part of the}} money that Harpalus brought from Asia. He also narrates the following story: Shortly after Harpalus ran away from Athens, he was put to death by the servants who were attending him, though some assert that he was assassinated. The steward of his money fled to Rhodes, and was arrested by a Macedonian officer, Philoxenus. Philoxenus proceeded to examine the slave, [...] "until he learned everything about such as had allowed themselves to accept a bribe from Harpalus." [...] He then sent a dispatch to Athens, in which he gave a list of the persons who had taken a bribe from Harpalus. [...] "Demosthenes, however, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>mentioned</b> at all, although Alexander held him in bitter hatred, and he himself had a private quarrel with him." [...] On the other hand, Plutarch believes that Harpalus sent Demosthenes a cup with twenty talents and that [...] "Demosthenes could not resist the temptation, but admitting the present, ... he surrendered himself up to the interest of Harpalus." [...] Tsatsos defends Demosthenes's innocence, but Irkos Apostolidis underlines the problematic character of the primary sources on this issue—Hypereides and Dinarchus were at the time Demosthenes's political opponents and accusers—and states that, despite the rich bibliography on Harpalus's case, modern scholarship has not yet managed to reach a safe conclusion on whether Demosthenes was bribed or not.|$|E

He declared, [...] "It is only fair that Paul should address the Romans in somewhat better Latin." [...] In the earlier phases of the project, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>mentioned</b> a Greek text: [...] "My mind is so excited at the thought of emending Jerome’s text, with notes, that I seem to myself inspired by some god.

2500|$|Orbison is {{counted as}} a rock and roll pioneer and has been cited by {{numerous}} critics {{as one of the}} genre's most influential musicians, but his style is notable for how it departed from the norm. Rock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving backbeat, heavy guitars, and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellion. Few of Orbison's recordings have these characteristics. The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>mentioned</b> any classical music influences. Author Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, [...] "He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the engine}} was state of the art, it was not novel in many respects. Morey seemed aware of {{contemporary}} internal combustion work – Hardenberg, who wrote a book on Morey’s engine, adeptly noted that in his 1825 draft Morey “stated that he named his invention ‘vapor engine, to distinguish it from the… gas engine.’” However, Hardenberg concludes that Morey could only have known of three engines similar to his. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>mentioned</b> them, and Hardenberg concludes {{that they did not}} influence Morey. His internal combustion engine is the first documented in the United States, and his use of liquid fuel and a heated surface carburetor was world's first. Another interesting feature was the wire mesh used to prevent the combustion from reaching the carburetor. This feature was reinvented and patented again in 1872 because the patent office had lost Morey’s patent in the 1836 patent office fire. The lack of interest in his vapor engine is unfortunate, because the vapor engine was his most farsighted invention. Morey notes in his unpublished 1824 draft that: ...|$|E

2500|$|Another point {{calling the}} map's {{authenticity}} into question was raised at the 1966 Conference: that one caption referred to Bishop Eirik of Greenland [...] "and neighboring regions" [...] (in Latin, [...] "regionumque finitimarum"), a title known previously {{from the work}} of religious scholar Luka Jelic (1863–1922). An essay by British researcher Peter Foote for the Saga Book of the Viking Society (vol. 11, part 1), published shortly after the conference, noted that German researcher Richard Hennig had spent years, before the Vinland Map was revealed, fruitlessly trying to track Jelic's phrase down in medieval texts. It seemed that either Jelic had seen the Vinland Map and promised not to reveal its existence (keeping the promise so rigidly that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>mentioned</b> any of the other new historical information on the map), or that he had invented the phrase as a scholarly description, and the Vinland Map creator copied him. In practice, because Jelic's work had gone through three editions, Foote was able to demonstrate how the first edition (in French) had adopted the concept {{from the work of}} earlier researchers, listed by Jelic, then the later editions had adapted the anachronistic French scholarly phrase [...] "évèque régionnaire des contrées américaines" [...] into Latin.|$|E
