5|$|Such {{recycling}} of revenue from permit auctions could offset {{a significant proportion}} of the economy-wide social costs of a cap and trade scheme. As well as reducing tax distortions, Kerr and Cramton (1998) note that auctions of units are more <b>flexible</b> <b>in</b> distributing costs, they provide more incentives for innovation, and they lessen the political arguments over the allocation of economic rents.|$|E
5|$|The section {{describes}} {{the distribution of}} social behaviour in different taxa. The theme is that evolution is progressive, with four pinnacles of social evolution, namely the colonial invertebrates such as corals, the social insects, mammals other than humans, and finally humans. The last chapter argues that natural selection has made humans far more <b>flexible</b> <b>in</b> social organisation than any other species.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a {{revolution}} in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were <b>flexible</b> <b>in</b> their wage demands. He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. Keynes' magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.|$|E

40|$|Optimizing <b>flexible</b> routing <b>in</b> <b>flexible</b> {{manufacturing}} {{systems is}} one of the aspects that increase the efficiency of flexible manufacturing systems especially in dynamic environment systems. This article presents a multistage approach to solve <b>flexible</b> routing problem <b>in</b> <b>flexible</b> manufacturing systems. Multistage approach includes three stages; the first stage is a production simulation system to find the fitness of the flexible manufacturing systems corresponding to different products’ routes’ groups. The second stage proposes an artificial neural network approach to predict the products’ routes’ group <b>in</b> <b>flexible</b> manufacturing systems. The last stage combines genetic algorithms and artificial neural network to optimize proper routes for all product types <b>in</b> <b>flexible</b> manufacturing systems. Multistage approach proposed in this study aims to reduce the computational time required to obtain and optimize the <b>flexible</b> routes <b>in</b> <b>flexible</b> manufacturing systems. The results of this study show that the artificial neural network can be used efficiently to predict the <b>flexible</b> routes <b>in</b> <b>flexible</b> manufacturing systems and it reduces the computational time for routes’ optimization required with production simulation system. This characteristic improves the flexibility of flexible manufacturing systems since it can be adapted frequently against any change in production ratios...|$|R

5|$|Poetic form is more <b>flexible</b> <b>in</b> modernist and post-modernist poetry, and {{continues}} to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in free verse. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored. Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.|$|E

5|$|The mallard is {{omnivorous}} {{and very}} <b>flexible</b> <b>in</b> its choice of food. Its diet may vary based on several factors, including {{the stage of}} the breeding cycle, short-term variations in available food, nutrient availability, and interspecific and intraspecific competition. The majority of the mallard's diet seems to be made up of gastropods, invertebrates (including beetles, flies, lepidopterans, dragonflies, and caddisflies), crustaceans, worms, many varieties of seeds and plant matter, and roots and tubers. During the breeding season, male birds were recorded to have eaten 37.6% animal matter and 62.4% plant matter, most notably Echinochloa crus-galli, and nonlaying females ate 37.0% animal matter and 63.0% plant matter, while laying females ate 71.9% animal matter and only 28.1% plant matter. Plants generally make up the larger part of a bird's diet, especially during autumn migration and in the winter.|$|E

In the analysis we research the <b>flexible</b> working arrangements <b>in</b> the international comparative perspective.

Consequently we aim to compare the typical features of part-time employment and <b>flexible</b> working policies <b>in</b> the selected countries with the specific situation in the Czech Republic. On the basis of the findings, we will propose policy measures which would lead to better availability of the flexible working arrangements, above all part-time work, same as better conditions for the ones <b>in</b> <b>flexible</b> contracts, <b>in</b> the Czech Republic...|$|R

25|$|Ichneumonids are {{distinguished}} from their sister group Braconidae {{mainly on the}} basis of wing venation. The fore wing of 95% of ichneumonids has vein 2m-cu, which is absent in braconids. Vein 1rs-m of the fore wing is absent in all ichneumonids, but is present in 85% of braconids. In the hind wing of ichneumonids, vein rs-m joins Rs apical to (or rarely opposite) the split between veins Rs and R1. In braconids, vein rs-m joins basal to this split. The taxa also differ {{in the structure of the}} metasoma: about 90% of ichneumonids have a flexible suture between tergites 2 and 3, whereas these tergites are fused in braconids (though the suture is secondarily <b>flexible</b> <b>in</b> Aphidiinae).|$|E
