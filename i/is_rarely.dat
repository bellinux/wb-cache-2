5|$|About 20% are {{affected}} by symptomatic digestive tract lesions, although a higher percentage have lesions that do not cause symptoms. These lesions may bleed intermittently, which <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> significant enough to be noticed (in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool), but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.|$|E
50|$|The {{events of}} {{traditional}} narratives <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> set within realistic chronological frameworks. Time spans measured in years or decades <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> specified. Characters often are conceived and grow to maturity within miraculously short periods.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom {{contractual}} provisions for liquidated damages and other responses to breaches <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> enforced. Payments <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> deducted for poor performance against the contract. Government monitors {{have tended to}} be co-opted or ineffectual.|$|R
50|$|In most European countries, strikebreakers <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> used. Consequently, they <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> if ever {{mentioned}} in most European national labor laws. As mentioned above, it {{is left to}} the European Union member states to determine their own policies.|$|R
5|$|Camouflage is a soft-tissue {{feature that}} <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> {{preserved}} in the fossil record, but rare fossilised skin samples from the Cretaceous period show that some marine reptiles were countershaded. The skins, pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin, reveal that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light bellies.|$|E
5|$|Despite his immense popularity, Como <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> given {{credit for}} what, once you stop and think of it, he so clearly is: {{one of the great}} singers and one of the great artists of our time.|$|E
5|$|Fishermen target many sharks {{for their}} jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game fish in general. The great white shark, however, <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> {{an object of}} {{commercial}} fishing, although its flesh is considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens for example in some tonnare in the Mediterranean), it is misleadingly sold as smooth-hound shark.|$|E

5|$|Most broaches {{are made}} from high speed steel (HSS) or an alloy steel; TiN {{coatings}} are common on HSS to prolong life. Except when broaching cast iron, tungsten carbide <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> used as a tooth material because the cutting edge will crack on the first pass.|$|E
5|$|Much of Fauré's piano {{music is}} {{difficult}} to play, but <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> virtuosic in style. The composer disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano music is a classical restraint and understatement.|$|E
5|$|Mycobacteria infect many {{different}} animals, including birds, rodents, and reptiles. The subspecies Mycobacterium tuberculosis, though, <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> present in wild animals. An effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis from the cattle and deer herds of New Zealand {{has been relatively}} successful. Efforts in Great Britain have been less successful.|$|E

5|$|Outside Taiwan, POJ <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> used. For example, in Fujian, Xiamen University uses a romanization {{known as}} Bbánlám pìngyīm, based on Pinyin. In other areas where Hokkien is spoken, such as Singapore, the Speak Mandarin Campaign is {{underway}} to actively discourage people from speaking Hokkien or other non-Mandarin varieties {{in favour of}} switching to Mandarin instead.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{problems}} due to Wilson's {{disease may}} include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen {{in conjunction with}} neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. These symptoms are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> made when only psychiatric symptoms are present.|$|E
5|$|The Inner Hebrides island Eigg is not {{connected}} to the National Grid, and has an integrated renewable power supply with wind, hydro and solar and battery storage, and diesel backup (which <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> used).|$|E

5|$|The Inter{{national}} Prototype Kilogram (IPK) <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> used or handled. Copies of the IPK kept {{by national}} metrology laboratories {{around the world}} were compared with the IPK in 1889, 1948, and 1989 to provide traceability of measurements of mass {{anywhere in the world}} back to the IPK.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations, this test <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> performed.|$|E
5|$|The nearby tomb of Horemheb, (KV57) <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> open to visitors. But it {{has many}} unique {{features}} and is extensively decorated. The decoration shows {{a transition from}} the pre-Amarna tombs {{to those of the}} 19th dynasty tombs that followed.|$|E

In Europe, it <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> seen from land except in autumn storms.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol V and atomic number 23. It is a hard, silvery grey, ductile, and malleable transition metal. The elemental metal <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> found in nature, but once isolated artificially, {{the formation of}} an oxide layer (passivation) stabilizes the free metal somewhat against further oxidation.|$|E
5|$|A level-number of 66 is used {{to declare}} a re-grouping of {{previously}} defined items, irrespective of how those items are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated , <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> used and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability to ignore the hierarchical and logical structure data meant its use was not recommended and many installations forbade its use.|$|E

The only term which specifically refers to a selkie but which <b>is</b> only <b>rarely</b> encountered <b>is</b> maighdeann-ròin [...] "seal maiden".|$|R
