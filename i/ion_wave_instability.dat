When the plasma density is adjusted to allow the Langmuir wave dispersion to match the difference frequency and wave number of the two beams, amplification factors as high as {times} 2. 5 result. Interpretation of this amplification as scattering of pump beam energy by the Langmuir wave that is produced by the ponderomotive force of the two beams, allows the dependence of Langmuir wave amplitude on ponderomotive force to be measured.

40|$|During {{the grant}} period from August 1, 1994 to October 31, 1995 we have {{continued}} to investigate the effects of plasma <b>wave</b> <b>instabilities</b> on the early stage plasmaspheric refilling. Since ion beams are the primary feature of the interhemispheric plasma flows during the early stage refilling, ion-beam driven <b>instabilities</b> and associated <b>waves</b> are of primary interest. The major findings of this research are briefly summarized here. After a systematic examination of the relevant plasma instabilities, we realized that when the interhemispheric plasma flows begin to interpenetrate at the equator, the most relevant plasma instability is the electrostatic <b>ion</b> cyclotron <b>wave</b> <b>instability.</b> Only at later stages the ion-acoustic instability may be affecting the plasma flow. An interesting property of the electrostatic <b>ion</b> cyclotron <b>wave</b> is that it heats ions perpendicular to the magnetic field. When the ions in the field-aligned flows are transversely heated, they are trapped in the magnetic flux tube, thus affecting the refilling process. The eic <b>wave</b> <b>instability</b> is a microprocess with scale length {{of the order of}} ion Larmor radius and the corresponding time scale is the ion cyclotron period. We have attempted to tackle the problem for the plasmaspheric refilling by incorporating the effects of eic <b>wave</b> <b>instability</b> on the mesoscale plasma flow when the properties of the latter exceeds the critical conditions for the former. We have compared the results on refilling from the model with and without the eic instability effects...|$|R

The presence of dust grain charge fluctuations modifies the dispersion relation for <b>ion</b> cyclotron <b>waves</b> in dusty plasma. It is shown that in the absence of ion beam, the ion cyclotron mode damps due to dust charge fluctuations and an additional damping dust charge fluctuation mode is induced in plasma.

40|$|A general {{introduction}} to pitch-angle diffusion for Earth and Jupiter magnetospheres is given. The instabilities which might limit the trapped fluxes {{in the earth}} magnetosphere are identified as the interchange or ballooning mode, electrostatic loss cone modes, and electromagnetic <b>ion</b> cyclotron <b>wave.</b> The <b>instability</b> theory of the <b>ion</b> cyclotron <b>wave</b> is discussed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the interaction of an intense laser with a plasma (a quasineutral collection of electrons and ions). During this interaction, the laser drives large-amplitude waves through a class of processes known as parametric instabilities. Several such instabilities drive one type of wave, the Langmuir wave, which involves oscillations of the electrons relative to the nearly-stationary ions. There {{are a number of}} mechanisms which limit the amplitude to which Langmuir waves grow. In this dissertation, these mechanisms are examined to identify qualitative features which might be observed in experiments and/or simulations. In addition, a number of experiments are proposed to specifically look for particular saturation mechanisms. In a plasma, a Langmuir wave can decay into an electromagnetic <b>wave</b> and an <b>ion</b> <b>wave.</b> This parametric <b>instability</b> is proposed as a source for electromagnetic emission near half of the incident laser frequency observed from laser-produced plasmas. This interpretation is shown to be consistent with existing experimental data and it is found that one of the previous mechanisms used to explain such emission is not. The scattering version of the electromagnetic decay instability is shown to provide an enhanced noise source of electromagnetic waves near the frequency of the incident laser...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} and explanation of short wavelength antenna interference effects observed in spacecraft plasma wave data have provided an important new method of determining {{limits on the}} wavelength, direction of propagation, and Doppler shift of short wavelength electrostatic waves. Using the ISEE- 1 wideband electric field data, antenna interference effects {{have been identified in}} the <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> upstream of the earth's bow shock. This identification implies that wavelengths of the upstream <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> are shorter than the antenna length.

The drift <b>wave</b> <b>instability</b> has been extensively studied in linear magnetized plasmas in different plasma parameter regimes, including weakly ionized, fully ionized, collisionless and collision plasmas [1]. In the magnetic confinement hot plasmas, there has been considerable interest in the coexistence and the competition between the dissipative instability (such as the collisional drift <b>wave</b> <b>instability)</b> and the reactive instability (such as the flute <b>wave</b> <b>instability)</b> recently.
