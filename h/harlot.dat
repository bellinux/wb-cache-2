5|$|Jacobsen quotes textual {{evidence}} that the Akkadian word eššebu (owl) corresponds to the Sumerian word ninna, and that the Sumerian Dnin-ninna (Divine lady ninna) corresponds to the Akkadian Ishtar. The Sumerian ninna can also be translated as the Akkadian kilili, {{which is also a}} name or epithet for Ishtar. Inanna/Ishtar as <b>harlot</b> or goddess of harlots was a well known theme in Mesopotamian mythology and in one text, Inanna is called kar-kid (<b>harlot)</b> and ab-ba--šú, which in Akkadian would be rendered kilili. Thus {{there appears to be a}} cluster of metaphors linking prostitute and owl and the goddess Inanna/Ishtar; this could match the most enigmatic component of the relief to a well known aspect of Ishtar. Jacobsen concludes that this link would be sufficient to explain talons and wings, and adds that nudity could indicate the relief was originally the house-altar of a bordello.|$|E

5|$|On 5 August 1869, {{shortly after}} The Vicar {{had begun to}} appear in the form of monthly numbers, Dion Boucicault's Formosa; or, The Railroad to Ruin opened at Drury Lane. The title {{character}} of Boucicault's play was a <b>harlot,</b> and her representation on stage provoked an exchange in the pages of The Times. Critics argued that the depiction of a prostitute in the theatre would tarnish the innocence of unmarried girls attending the performance. Supporters, including Boucicault himself, responded that worse women were regularly portrayed in Italian operas such as La traviata and Lucrezia Borgia, which were considered eminently suitable for young women, and in the police and court news of The Times itself.|$|E

5|$|Following Galerius' {{recognition}} of Constantine as caesar, Constantine's portrait {{was brought to}} Rome, as was customary. Maxentius mocked the portrait's subject {{as the son of}} a <b>harlot,</b> and lamented his own powerlessness. Maxentius, envious of Constantine's authority, seized the title of emperor on 28 October 306AD. Galerius refused to recognize him, but failed to unseat him. Galerius sent Severus against Maxentius, but during the campaign, Severus' armies, previously under command of Maxentius' father Maximian, defected, and Severus was seized and imprisoned. Maximian, brought out of retirement by his son's rebellion, left for Gaul to confer with Constantine in late 307AD. He offered to marry his daughter Fausta to Constantine, and elevate him to Augustan rank. In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and offer support to Maxentius' cause in Italy. Constantine accepted, and married Fausta in Trier in late summer 307AD. Constantine now gave Maxentius his meagre support, offering Maxentius political recognition.|$|E
5|$|These dismal {{business}} efforts—and his misadventures in Sardinia—provided {{an appropriate}} milieu {{in which to}} set the two-volume Illusions perdues (Lost Illusions, 1843). The novel concerns Lucien de Rubempré, a young poet {{trying to make a}} name for himself, who becomes trapped in the morass of society's darkest contradictions. Lucien's journalistic work is informed by Balzac's own failed ventures in the field. Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes (The <b>Harlot</b> High and Low, 1847) continues Lucien's story. He is trapped by the Abbé Herrera (Vautrin) in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status. The book undergoes a massive temporal rift; the first part (of four) covers a span of six years, while the final two sections focus on just three days.|$|E

25|$|The Talmud prohibits any {{activity}} which it defines as mesolelot or tribadism (women rubbing genitals together). The main {{concern in the}} Talmud was whether women who carried out acts were eligible to marry {{a member of the}} priesthood. It was doubtful whether this activity removed their status as a virgin or made them a <b>harlot.</b> Maimonides suggests that this behavior should not disqualify a woman from marrying a priest. Talmudic law limits the penalty for lesbianism to flagellation rather than the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|Decades after {{both the}} {{incident}} and her disappearance, Sada Abe continues to draw public interest. In {{addition to the}} documentary in which Abe herself appeared shortly before she disappeared from the public eye, and the 1976 Japanese-language In the Realm of the Senses, at least three successful films have been made based on the story. The 1983 film, Sexy Doll: Abe Sada Sansei, made use of Abe's name in the title. In 1998, a 438-page biography of Abe was published in Japan, and the first full-length book on Abe in English, William Johnston's Geisha, <b>Harlot,</b> Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan, was published in 2005.|$|E

After Enkidu becomes civilized through sexual initiation with a <b>harlot,</b> he travels to Uruk, where he challenges Gilgamesh to a test of strength. Gilgamesh wins and the two become friends. Together, they make a six-day journey to the legendary Cedar Forest, where they plan to slay the Guardian, Humbaba the Terrible, and cut down the sacred Cedar. Later they kill the Bull of Heaven, which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. As a punishment for these actions, the gods sentence Enkidu to death.|$|E

That night, the king of Jericho received word that Israelite men had come to search out the land, and the king sent a demand to Rahab to deliver the men who had come to her house. But Rahab hid the men among stalks of flax on her roof, saying that when it was dark the men had left, and she did not know where they went.

25|$|His final {{departure}} from Rome {{was motivated by}} a solemn weariness of the burdens imposed on him by his social position, and apparently the difficulties of meeting the ordinary expenses {{of living in the}} bustling metropolis (x. 96); and he looks smilingly ever forward to a return to the rosy scenes familiar to his youth, apparently. The well-known epigram addressed to Juvenal (xii. I 8) shows that for a time his ideal was happily realized; but the more trustworthy evidence of the dry prose epistle prefixed to Book XII. proves and that he could not live happily away from the literary and social pleasures of Rome for long. The one consolation of his exile was a lady, Marcella, of whom he writes rather platonically as if she were his patronessand it {{seems to have been a}} necessity of his being to have always a patron or patronessthan his wife or mistress or <b>harlot</b> or muse or shrewish burden.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Cardinale {{featured}} opposite Franco Nero in The Day of the Owl, in a David di Donatello for Best Actress-winning performance. She {{reunited with}} Rock Hudson in the Italian-made criminal comedy A Fine Pair under director Francesco Maselli. She also appeared alongside Rod Taylor in The Hell with Heroes {{and starred in}} one of her best-known roles as former prostitute Jill McBain in Sergio Leone's epic Western Once Upon a Time in the West. Such was the power of her performance as the whore that Leone's biographer Robert C. Cumbow described her as [...] "permanently engraved in cinematic history" [...] and noted how suited to the role she was: [...] "Her sex-goddess appearance combines with her more mystical iconographic associations to ease the progress of Jill from tart to town builder, from <b>harlot</b> to earth mother, from sinner to symbol of America—the apotheosis of the <b>harlot</b> with a heart of gold". In 1969, Cardinale starred opposite Nino Manfredi in Luigi Magni's Nell'anno del Signore, based on the actual story of the capital execution of two carbonari in papal Rome. This was followed by a role as a telephone operator in Certo certissimo ... anzi probabile, and as a nurse opposite Sean Connery and Peter Finch in Mikhail Kalatozov's The Red Tent, based on the story of the mission to rescue Umberto Nobile and the other survivors of the crash of the Airship Italia.|$|E

Lilitu (or the Lilitu spirits) was considered to be an anthropomorphic bird-footed, wind or night demon and was often described as a sexual predator who subsisted on the blood of babies and their mothers. Other Mesopotamian demons such as the Babylonian goddess Lamashtu, (Sumer's Dimme) [...] and Gallu of the Uttuke group are mentioned as having vampiric natures.|$|E
500|$|Four Times of the Day was {{the first}} set of prints that Hogarth {{published}} after his two great successes, A Harlot's Progress (1732) and A Rake's Progress (1735). It was among the first of his prints to be published after the Engraving Copyright Act 1734 (which Hogarth had helped push through Parliament); A Rake's Progress had taken early advantage of the protection afforded by the new law. Unlike <b>Harlot</b> and Rake, the four prints in Times of the Day do not form a consecutive narrative, and none of the characters appears in more than one scene. Hogarth conceived of the series as [...] "representing in a humorous manner, morning, noon, evening and night".|$|E

[...] He banned her poems from publication in the journals Zvezda and Leningrad, accusing her of poisoning the minds of Soviet youth. Her surveillance was increased and she was expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers.|$|E

[...] Norman also likens Jagger in his early performances with the Rolling Stones in the 1960s to a male ballet dancer, with [...] "his conflicting and colliding sexuality: the swan's neck and smeared <b>harlot</b> eyes allied to an overstuffed and straining codpiece".|$|E
500|$|American singer Madonna has {{embarked}} on ten concert tours, nine {{of which have been}} worldwide. Her 1985 debut, The Virgin Tour, was based in North America only and was critically panned but went on to collect more than US $5 million. In 1987 she performed on the worldwide Who's That Girl World Tour, which visited Europe, North America and Japan. It was critically appreciated for Madonna's showmanship and [...] "exquisite" [...] dresses. She embarked on the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, which Don Shewey of Rolling Stone called [...] "the best tour of [...] ". The performances featured Madonna simulating masturbation during [...] "Like a Virgin". Officials in Toronto threatened to arrest her unless she removed the masturbation sequence, and in Italy, the Pope called for a boycott. In 1993, Madonna visited Israel and Turkey for the first time, followed by Latin America and Australia, with The Girlie Show World Tour. Madonna opened the show dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix, surrounded by topless dancers of both sexes. A review in Time by Sam Buckley said: [...] "Madonna, once the Harlow <b>harlot</b> and now a perky harlequin, is the greatest show-off on earth." ...|$|E
500|$|Four Times of the Day was {{the first}} series of prints that Hogarth had issued since {{the success of the}} <b>Harlot</b> and Rake (and would be the only set he would issue until Marriage à-la-mode in 1745), so it was eagerly anticipated. On hearing of its {{imminent}} issue, George Faulkner wrote from Dublin that he would take 50 sets. The series lacks the moral lessons that are found in the earlier series and revisited in Marriage à-la-mode, and its lack of teeth meant it failed to achieve the same success, though it has found an enduring niche as a snapshot of the society of Hogarth's time. At the auction of 1745, the paintings of Four Times of the Day raised more than those of the Rake; and Night, which is generally regarded as the worst of the series, fetched the highest single total. Cunningham commented sarcastically: [...] "Such was the reward then, to which the patrons of genius thought these works entitled". While Horace Walpole praised the accompanying print, Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn, as being the finest of Hogarth's works, he had little to say of Four Times of the Day other than that it did not find itself wanting in comparison with Hogarth's other works.|$|E
