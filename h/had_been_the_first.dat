5|$|After {{returning}} from their travels, the Workmans lectured all over Europe. Fanny lectured in English, German, or French, as the occasion required. At one talk in Lyon, France, 1000 people {{crowded into the}} auditorium and 700 were turned away. In 1905 Fanny became the second woman to address the Royal Geographical Society. (Isabella Bird Bishop <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> in May 1897.) Her talk was mentioned in The Times.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, compact discs were making {{significant}} headway as a storage medium {{for music and}} video games. NEC <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to use compact disc technology in a video game console with their PC Engine CD-ROMÂ² System add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months. That same year, Nintendo announced a partnership with Sony to develop its own CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Commodore International released their CD-based CDTV multimedia system centered in early 1991, while long-in-waiting CD-i from Philips finally arrived {{towards the end of}} that year.|$|E
5|$|Deligiannis mobilized the Hellenic Army, and the British Royal Navy {{blockaded}} Greece. The admiral {{in charge}} of the blockade was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon, whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before. This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties were not always to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 3rd century {{and into the}} 4th, it was held by some churchmen that Philip <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Christian emperor; he was {{described}} as such in Jerome's Chronicon (Chronicle), which was well known during the Middle Ages, and in Orosius' highly popular Historia Adversus Paganos (History Against the Pagans). Most scholars hold that these and other early accounts ultimately derive from Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica (Ecclesiastical History).|$|E

Ramzi <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> athlete from Bahrain to win an Olympic gold medal. His frozen blood sample was re-tested and found to contain traces of Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), a stamina-building blood-booster. Kenyan Asbel Kipruto Kiprop was upgraded to gold, Nicholas Willis of New Zealand was given the silver and Mehdi Baala of France received the bronze.|$|E

5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control.

Her husband, Austin, pleaded guilty to larceny and {{was sent to the}} {{relative}} safety of the state prison in McAlester.

5|$|Only {{four days}} before Galarraga's near-perfect outing, Roy Halladay pitched a perfect game for the Philadelphia Phillies, and just twenty days prior to that, Dallas Braden threw a perfect game for the Oakland Athletics.

5|$|The German group {{suggested}} the name nielsbohrium with symbol Ns {{to honor the}} Danish physicist Niels Bohr. The Soviet scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia had suggested this name be given to element 105 (which was finally called dubnium) and the German team wished to recognise both Bohr {{and the fact that}} the Dubna team <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to propose the cold fusion reaction to solve the controversial problem of the naming of element 105. The Dubna team agreed with the German group's naming proposal for element 107.|$|E

5|$|After {{the heavy}} 4â1 {{defeat in the}} {{previous}} Ashes series, captain and fellow Victorian Jack Ryder was omitted altogether from the 1930 Ashes tour, and Woodfull appointed captain. Ryder {{was one of the}} three selectors and advocated his own retention, but his two colleagues had voted him off. At first, Woodfull was reluctant to accept the job, feeling that it rightfully belonged to Ryder. When he was informed that Ryder was not even touring, Woodfull only agreed after a ballot was organised. He was unanimously selected by the board. Woodfull had limited leadership experience and in his brief captaincy duties <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> captain to declare his team's second innings in Shield history.|$|E
5|$|An earlier fleet <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{to reach}} India by circumnavigating Africa. That {{expedition}} had been led by Vasco da Gama {{and returned to}} Portugal in 1499. For decades Portugal had been searching for an alternate route to the East, in order to bypass the Mediterranean Sea which was {{under the control of}} the Italian Maritime Republics and the Ottoman Empire. Portugal's expansionism would lead first to a route to India, and later to worldwide colonization. A desire to spread Catholic Christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration. There also was a long tradition of pushing back Muslims, which stemmed from Portugal's fight for nationhood against the Moors. The fight expanded first to North Africa and eventually to the Indian subcontinent. An additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical Prester Johnâa powerful Christian king with whom an alliance against Islam could be forged. Finally, the Portuguese Crown sought a share in the lucrative West African trade in slaves and gold, and India's spice trade.|$|E
