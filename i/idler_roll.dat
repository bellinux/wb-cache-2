50|$|Ring rolling is a {{specialized}} type of hot rolling {{that increases the}} diameter of a ring. The starting material is a thick-walled ring. This workpiece is placed between two rolls, an inner <b>idler</b> <b>roll</b> and a driven roll, which presses the ring from the outside. As the rolling occurs the wall thickness decreases as the diameter increases. The rolls may be shaped to form various cross-sectional shapes. The resulting grain structure is circumferential, which gives better mechanical properties. Diameters can be as large as 8 m and face heights as tall as 2 m. Common applications include bearings, gears, rockets, turbines, airplanes, pipes, and pressure vessels.|$|E
40|$|The {{energy loss}} due to {{indentation}} rolling resistance in {{a conveyor belt}} system can account for up to 60 % of the total power usage. It arises due to an asymmetric pressure distribution as a viscoelastic belt cover is indented by a rigid <b>idler</b> <b>roll.</b> This causes a retarding moment on the <b>idler</b> <b>roll,</b> dependent on the load, speed, idler diameter and {{the properties of the}} conveyor belt cover. As pouch conveyor systems become more prevalent in industry, the supporting structure, and thus the indentation rolling resistance of such systems is of importance. These designs typically employ curved belt profiles, or spherical idlers in order to aid belt tracking and closing. From this, a spherical indentation into a generalised Maxwell backing is modelled, and compared with experimental values. In addition to this, the strain dependency across the contact is investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{indentation}} {{rolling resistance}} of conveyor belts {{is an important}} design consideration for long belt conveyors and can also be important for heavily loaded belt conveyors. Indentation rolling resistance {{is dependent on the}} properties of the conveyor belt, including the carcass and bottom cover as well as properties of the belt conveyor including induced loads, belt speed, ambient temperature and <b>idler</b> <b>roll</b> diameter. A purpose built laboratory test facility is described to measure the indentation rolling resistance of conveyor belts. The test facility is designed to accept both fabric and steel cord belts and test over a range of typical operating parameters and conditions. Results are presented for a range of test parameters, including; load, belt speed, <b>idler</b> <b>roll</b> diameter, ambient temperature and bottom cover compound.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of <b>idler</b> <b>rolls</b> in a belt conveyor {{system is to}} support the conveyor belt along its length. Predicting the cumulative resistance of <b>idler</b> <b>rolls</b> is vitally important in calculating the belt tension and therefore power requirements of a system, particularly on long overland conveyors where there are typically more than one thousand <b>idler</b> <b>rolls</b> per kilometer of belt. The rotating resistance occurs due to the friction of the rolling elements in the bearings, the viscous drag of the lubricant, and the friction of the contact lip seals.

40|$|Mining {{and mineral}} {{processing}} industries {{throughout the world}} rely on the efficient transportation of bulk solid. Belt conveyors {{have been used for}} the transportation of bulk solid over relatively short distances for many years, but with significant developments in analytical procedures to describe the dynamic properties of belt conveying systems, the utilisation of belt conveyors for long distance overiand transportation is becoming more economically viable. Belt conveyor installations are becoming progressively longer and belt speeds significantly faster, and as these trends continue it becomes increasingly important that the motion resistances associated with the operation of belt conveyors be minimised for optimum performance and efficiency. In the energy conscious world in which we live, no longer is it acceptable for a belt conveyor to simply transport bulk solid from one point to another, the operation must be economically viable, environmentally friendly and energy efficient. The energy consumed in raising bulk solid from one level to another is typically a parameter that cannot be easily changed, and is usually determined by plant constraints or the terrain over which the conveyor is travelling. As a result the primary area of focus in order to minimise power consumption is the resistances associated with the motion of the belt conveyor. The energy consumed during the operation of a long horizontal belt conveyor is primarily due to the frictional resistance that occurs {{along the length of the}} conveyor. This resistance is known as the main resistance and includes the belt and bulk solid flexure resistance, the rotating resistance of the <b>idler</b> <b>rolls</b> and the indentation rolling resistance of the conveyor belt. This paper will discuss each component of the main resistance and provide details of methods to calculate the contribution of each component. A finite difference solution that applies orthotropic plate mechanics is described to calculate the deflection of the conveyor belt due to the loading induced from the weight of the belt and bulk solid, and the loading induced from the relative movement of the bulk solid. Given the displacement of the belt and bulk solid the flexure resistance of each component can then be calculated. The rotating resistance of the <b>idler</b> <b>rolls</b> is briefly discussed and an apparatus to measure the resistance is presented. A finite element model is then discussed which calculates the indentation rolling resistance occurring at each idler set from the viscoelastic properties of the bottom cover of the conveyor belt...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pseudo {{three dimensional analysis}} to predict the indentation rolling resistance of belt conveyors. Conventional methods used to analyse the indentation rolling resistance problem typically assume a bottom cover of uniform thickness bonded to a rigid substrate with no consideration of the carcass properties. This work aims to analyse {{the influence of the}} carcass construction and configuration for steel cord conveyor belts and predict the influence on the indentation rolling resistance. Due to the presence of steel cords embedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution at the interface between the belt and a conveyor <b>idler</b> <b>roll</b> is not uniform. To solve this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the conveyor <b>idler</b> <b>roll.</b> The reaction loads are then used in a two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model to determine the indentation rolling resistance for the steel cord belt. This paper investigates the influence of the conveyor belt carcass and bottom cover properties on the resulting stress distribution throughout the belt and consequently on the indentation rolling resistance. The influence of the steel cord diameter and pitch, applied load, bottom cover thickness and strain rate is investigated. A finite element method is detailed for the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the belt. A range of carcass configurations is investigated and experimental verification of the calculated stress distribution undertaken using a Tekscan™ pressure measurement system...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{incorporation}} of conveyor systems throughout industry has seen {{an increase in}} demand for systems that exceed the specification of conventional conveyors. This coupled with the demand to convey bulk materials over larger distances, at higher speeds and efficiencies, requires {{the development of a}} versatile design approach. This thesis explores the design aspects associated with modern pouch conveying systems, and how they vary, and can be adapted from theories used with conventional troughed conveyors. In particular, the indentation rolling resistance (IRR) is explored in detail, as this can account for up to 60 % of the drag forces of a system. This is the drag force that arises due to an asymmetric pressure distribution as the <b>idler</b> <b>roll</b> shell indents the bottom cover of the belt. The potential <b>idler</b> <b>roll</b> arrangements for a generic pouch conveying system are analysed, and compared with experimental values. In addition to this, the drive traction attainable from suitable drive stations is analysed. Troughed conveyors typically wrap the conveyor belt around a large drive pulley, generating large amounts of traction. Given the layout of pouch conveying systems, a different approach is required, at multiple locations. As such, pouch conveyors are typically driven through simply supported drive stations, with small areas of contact with the belt. The useable traction from these point contact drives is considered. These theories are then united and applied to a dynamic package capable of handling multiple conveyor designs. This package utilises Finite Element Modelling (FEM) to model the viscoelastic nature of the system, based on the distributed drag forces, and inputs of the conveyor. Lastly, to qualify this theory, experimental analysis is conducted on an on-site installation, and compared with the theoretical results...|$|E
50|$|The diwheel {{design has}} the two large outer wheels {{completely}} encompassing an inner frame. The inner frame {{is free to}} rotate within the wheels, and is typically supported by a common axle or <b>idlers</b> which <b>roll</b> on the wheels (see figure). Diwheels, like their more popular cousins the monowheel, {{have been around for}} almost one and a half centuries. All of these platforms suffer from two common issues affecting driver comfort; slosh and tumbling (also known as gerbilling). Sloshing is when the inner frame oscillates, and it occurs in all monowheels and diwheels where the centre of gravity of the inner frame is offset from the centre line of the wheels. It is very prevalent as these platforms typically have low damping between the wheel and the frame, to minimise power consumption during locomotion. In addition, during severe braking or acceleration the inner frame will tumble relative to the earth centred frame, which affects the ability of the driver to control the platform. Both the sloshing and tumbling issue can be controlled through feedback control, and has been demonstrated successfully. and the equations of motion for the diwheel have been published.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{the process}} or {{manufacturing}} industry, raw materials {{need to be}} transported from one manufacturing stage to another. Material handling equipment are designed such that they facilitate easy, cheap, fast and safe loading and unloading with least human interference.

After a time they came {{on a kind of}} glade, opening upwards though the wood, with one large oak-tree standing alone in the centre, and behold! on the grass below sat or lay a company-—Mrs. Joseph Brownlow in the midst, under the obnoxious mushroom-hat, reading aloud. Radiating from her were five boys, the biggest of all on his back, with his hat over his eyes, fast asleep; another cross-legged, with a basket between his knees, dividing his attention between it and the book; two more lying frog-like, with elbows on the ground, feet erected behind them, chin in hand, devouring the narrative with their eyes; the fifth wriggling restlessly about, evidently in search of opportunities of mischief or of tormenting tricks. Just within earshot, but sketching the picturesque wooden bridge below, sat one girl. The little one, with her youngest brother, was close at their mother's feet, threading flowers to make a garland.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{indentation}} rolling resistance of steel cord conveyor belt and compares the results with those for fabric reinforced conveyor belt. Due to the steel cables imbedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution between the belt and a conveyor <b>idler</b> <b>roll</b> is not uniform. The fluctuating pressure {{means that a}} two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model - which is suitable {{for the analysis of}} fabric belt - cannot be readily applied to the analysis of steel cord belt. To cope with this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the conveyor idler. The pressures determined by the finite element analysis are compared with experimental results found with the Tekscan pressure measurement system, and the reaction loads are used in the two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model developed by Wheeler [2]. The results from Wheeler's model are summed to determine an overall indentation rolling resistance for the steel cord belt...|$|E
40|$|Belt {{conveying}} systems {{operating with}} steel cord conveyor belts are used {{extensively in the}} mining and minerals processing industries to transport bulk material. An accurate analysis of the belt tension distribution {{along the length of}} the system is essential to ensure reliable and efficient operation.

The motion resistances that occur {{along the length of the}} conveyor are known as the main resistances and, for a horizontal conveyor include the belt and bulk solid flexure resistance, the rotational resistance of the idler rolls and the indentation rolling resistance of the conveyor belt. Generally, the indentation rolling resistance component is the major contributor to the motion resistance of long horizontal belt conveyors. This paper will discuss the development of a pseudo 3 -dimensional viscoelastic finite element analysis to calculate the indentation rolling resistance of steel cord conveyor belts. A unique aspect of this model is the ability to incorporate into the viscoelastic rolling contact problem the influence of the steel cords and the variable rubber properties throughout the thickness of the belt. These parameters play a significant role in determining the contact pressure distribution at the belt and <b>idler</b> <b>roll</b> interface and the apparent bottom cover thickness, and therefore the indentation rolling resistance...|$|E
