50|$|In the 1975 {{distributed}} {{artificial intelligence}} emerged as a subfield of artificial intelligence that dealt with interaction of intelligent agents2. Distributed artificial intelligence systems were conceived {{as a group of}} intelligent entities, called agents, that interacted by cooperation, by coexistence or by competition. DAI is categorized into Multi-agent systems and <b>distributed</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> 1. In Multi-agent systems the main focus is how agents coordinate their knowledge and activities.

40|$|The Multiagent Systems {{paradigm}} offers expressively {{rich and}} natural fit mechanisms for modeling and negotiation for <b>solving</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>problems.</b> <b>Solving</b> complex and <b>distributed</b> real world <b>problems</b> in dynamic domains however presents a significant challenge and requires {{the integration of}} technology innovation and domain expertise to create intelligent solutions. Scheduling of patients, staff, and resources for elective surgery in an under-resourced and overburdened public health system presents {{an excellent example of}} this class of problems. In this paper, we discuss the research challenges presented by the problem and outline our efforts of applying distributed constraint optimization, intelligent decision support, and prediction based theater allocation to address these challenges. We also discuss how these technologies can be used to drive better planning and change management in the context of surgery scheduling.

40|$|In <b>Distributed</b> Cooperative <b>Problem</b> <b>Solving,</b> {{an agent}} must {{coordinate}} with other agents. Coordination among agents is realized only when an agent can understand, {{or at least}} predict, actions of the other agents. That is to say, an agent has to have some model of other agents inside itself. To make an agent adaptive in cooperating with others, it should observe other agents and dynamically establish models of others in order to plan its actions. In this paper, we regard an agent as a state transition machine (a finite state automaton) and propose a method of observing other agents and dynamically establishing models of others. A simple experiment of "Moving Robots" {{will be used to}} explain the method. 1 Introduction In the real world, we take action while managing continuous interactions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the efficacy of collaborative evidence based information practice (EBIP) as an organizational effectiveness model. Shared leadership, appreciative inquiry and knowledge creation theoretical frameworks provide the foundation for change toward the implementation of a collaborative EBIP workplace model. Collaborative EBIP reiterates the importance of gathering the best available evidence, but it differs by shifting decision-making authority from "library or employer centric" to "user or employee centric". University of Colorado Denver Auraria Library Technical Services department created a collaborative EBIP environment by flattening workplace hierarchies, <b>distributing</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> and encouraging reflective dialogue. By doing so, participants are empowered to identify problems, create solutions, and become valued and respected leaders and followers. In an environment where library budgets are in jeopardy, recruitment opportunities are limited and the workplace is in constant flux, the Auraria Library case study offers an approach that maximizes the capability of the current workforce and promotes agile responsiveness to industry and organizational challenges. Collaborative EBIP is an organizational model demonstrating a process focusing first on the individual and moving to the collective to develop a responsive and high performing business unit, and in turn, organization...|$|R

40|$|In {{these studies}} I examine {{the role of}} <b>distributed</b> {{cognition}} in <b>problem</b> <b>solving.</b> The major hypothesis explored is that intelligent behavior results from the interaction of internal cognition, external objects, and other people, where a cognitive task can be distributed among a set of representations, some internal and some external. The Tower of Hanoi problem {{is used as a}} concrete example for these studies. In Experiment 1 I examine the effects of the distribution of internal and external representations on <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> behavior. Experiments 2 and 3 focus on the effects of the structural change of a <b>problem</b> on <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> behavior and how these effects depend {{on the nature of the}} representations. The results of all studies show that distributed cognitive activities are produced by the interaction among the internal and external representations. External representations are not simply peripheral aids. They are an indispensable part of cognition. Two of the factors determining the performance of a <b>distributed</b> <b>problem</b> space and the distribution of representations across an internal mind and the external world...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{computing}} environments allow collaborative <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> across {{teams and}} organisations. A fundamental precondition for collaboration {{is the ability}} to find available participants and be able to exchange information. One way to approach this conceptual formulation are central directories or registry services. A major disadvantage of centralized components is, that they limit the flexibility to form ad hoc networks that are targeted to <b>solve</b> a specific <b>problem.</b> To facilitate flexible and dynamic collaborations, ideas from decentralized and self-organising networks can be combined with concepts of service oriented computing. This project aims to investigate potential solutions for dynamic discovery of network participants and outlines how to manage challenges associated with the development of a discovery protocol for distributed systems. During the course of this project a prototypical implementation was created that integrates into the open source <b>distributed,</b> collaborative <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> environment RCE [9].

40|$|Abstract. <b>Distributed</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> {{involves}} the collective effort of multiple problems solvers to combine their knowledge, information, and capabilities {{so as to}} develop solutions to problems that each could not have solved as well (if at all) alone. The challenge in <b>distributed</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> is thus in marshalling the distributed capabilities in the right ways so that the problem solving activities of each agent complement {{the activities of the}} others, so as to lead efficiently to effective solutions. Thus, while working together leads to <b>distributed</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving,</b> there is also the distributed problem of how to work together that must be solved. We consider that problem to be a distributed planning problem, where each agent must formulate plans for what it will do that take into account (sufficiently well) the plans of other agents. In this paper, we characterize the variations of <b>distributed</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> and distributed planning, and summarize some of the basic techniques that have been developed to date. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{contrast}} {{two approaches}} {{to the problem of}} information gathering that may be characterized as distributed processing and <b>distributed</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving.</b> The former is characteristic of most existing information gathering systems, while the latter is central to research in multi-agent systems.

40|$|Constraint logic {{programming}} is a paradigm {{based on the}} notion of constraints and mechanisms for their resolution.

In the constraint {{logic programming}} (CLP) framework, the need for cooperation and combination (i. e. collaboration) of solvers is widely recognized. The general view consists in doing several solvers collaborate in order to process constraints that cannot be solved (or efficiently solved) by a single solver. Some systems, like CoSAc (Monfroy, Rusinowitch, & Schott 1996), have already been proposed for realizing solver cooperation.
