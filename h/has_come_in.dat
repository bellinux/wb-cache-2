5|$|The {{series is}} {{considered}} highly popular in Japan, having sold well and gained a cult following, though {{it appears to}} be a niche series in Western territories. The main games have become noted for their dark storylines and mixture of ground-based and aerial combat, while Nier stood out because of its mixture of gameplay styles. The series has received mixed to positive reception in both Japan and the West: the majority of praise has been given to its story and characters, while the gameplay <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> for criticisms for being repetitive or poorly designed.|$|E

25|$|After the Cultural Revolution, {{official}} {{attempts to}} placate the Miao included a compensatory payment of 1,300 (then $250) to Wang's family. However, the real {{compensation for the}} great suffering of Wang and the other Christians in Wuding <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> church growth. When Wang Zhiming was arrested, there were 2,795 Christians in Wuding. By 1980 the church had grown to about 12,000, and Wuding now has over 30,000 Christians and more than 100 places of worship. Sporadic persecution in Wuding continues.|$|E

He is frustrated by this, but later learns that true love will not stop nor must one sacrifice to it one's personal destiny, since to do so robs it of truth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} and decades {{following}} Executive Order 12564, efforts to begin random drug testing and pre-employment drug screening of truck drivers were not expedited, leaving the change to occur gradually, {{out of concern for}} the dangers of excessively rapid change in economic infrastructure. Since then, a large number of tractor-trailer operators have left the industry in search of other employment, and a new generation of drivers <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>in.</b> Subsequent to the measure it became extremely difficult for truck drivers to engage in drug abuse and remain undetected.|$|E

Allessia comes {{to spread the word}} of Helm and advance to become a high-ranking priest.|$|E
25|$|But {{the main}} source of Raphael's {{popularity}} was not his major works, but his small Florentine pictures of the Madonna and Christ Child. Over and over he painted the same plump calm-faced blonde woman and her succession of chubby babies, the most famous probably being La Belle Jardinière ("The Madonna of the Beautiful Garden"), now in the Louvre. His larger work, the Sistine Madonna, used as a design for countless stained glass windows, <b>has</b> <b>come,</b> <b>in</b> the 21st century, to provide the iconic image of two small cherubs which has been reproduced on everything from paper table napkins to umbrellas.|$|E
25|$|Simeo Ondeto {{is known}} as the Lodvikus or The Glory of God, whose role is to bring the world to {{understand}} the hidden treasures of life after death and dramatise the reality of eternal life. According to Legio Maria the promise by Jesus to return has been fulfilled by the coming of Simeo. Legio Maria also seems not to believe in a final judgement of the whole world. They believe in immediate judgement of individuals immediately after death. This is supported by the long list of adored Legio saints. Some of the official Legio Maria saints include Timotheo Atila, Maria Ombwayo, Tobias Oongo, Petro Otieno, Mumbo Carilus and Angi Clement. Church leaders distinguish Messias Simeo Ondeto's mission as separate from that of Jesus. He was not sent to replace Jesus, for Jesus was a name given to the son of God when he accomplished a second dispensational mission. Instead, Messias Simeo Ondeto is God incarnated in another context, specifically for the third dispensation of the glory of God. Often, 1 John 4:1 is used as biblical support for the confession that God has again come into the flesh through Messias Simeo Ondeto, for “every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the flesh is of God and every Spirit that does not confess Jesus is not of God…Therefore we say that Jesus <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the flesh.|$|E

25|$|One night, Guinevere takes Arthur to {{meet with}} Merlin, {{the leader of the}} Woads and her father. At first, Arthur thinks Guinevere has betrayed him, but Merlin <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> peace. It is {{revealed}} in a flashback that Arthur's mother Igraine had died in a Woad attack when he was a boy. Arthur's famous sword, Excalibur, had belonged to his father, Uther Pendragon, and marked his burial mound. Arthur had pulled it from the mound in an effort to rescue his mother from a burning building. Merlin suggests an alliance between the Woads and the Sarmatian knights against the invading Saxons.|$|E
25|$|The {{newspaper}} {{is a general}} Sunday newspaper, covering news and politics. It is published in five sections: News, Sport, Business, Property, and Living, {{as well as a}} magazine section. In terms of news, while the newspaper maintains a broadsheet outlook, it <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> for much criticism lately due to its increasing emphasis on lifestyle features in the main section. It has also been criticised for regularly tending towards sensationalism, and for the often opinion-focused, rather than news-focused nature of its articles. It is probably better described as a middle-of-the-road newspaper, rather than a newspaper of record. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Deputy Editor was Anne Harris.|$|E
25|$|The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Indian National Congress both {{objected to}} the exoneration of the Gujarat {{government}} by the Commission, citing {{the timing of the}} report (with the general elections months away) as evidence of unfairness. Congress spokesperson Veerappa Moily commented at the strange absolvement of the Gujarat government for complacency for the carnage before the Commission's second and final report had been brought out. The CPI (M) said that the report reinforced communal prejudices. The Commission <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> for heavy criticism from academics such as Christophe Jaffrelot for obstructing the course of justice, supporting the conspiracy theory too quickly, and for allegedly ignoring evidence of governmental complicity in the incident.|$|E

25|$|The bar {{is packed}} with students, artists and flower girls, singing and dancing. Magda enters and attracts the {{attention}} of several young men. She hurries over to a table at which Ruggero is sitting alone. She apologizes for intruding and tells him that she will move away {{as soon as the}} young men at the bar stop watching her. Ruggero, who does not recognize Magda in her disguise, asks her to stay. They chat and Ruggero tells Magda that she reminds him of the quiet and elegant girls from his home town, Montauban. They dance happily together. Prunier and Lisette enter, arguing about Prunier's desire to turn Lisette into a lady and to educate her. Magda and Ruggero return to their table and Magda begins to reminisce about a past love affair. Ruggero asks for her name and she answers 'Pauletta'. She writes the name on the tablecloth and Ruggero adds his own beneath. The attraction between Magda and Ruggero grows as they talk. Lisette and Prunier pass their table and Lisette recognizes Magda. Magda signals to Prunier not to give away her secret and Prunier tells Lisette she is mistaken. To prove his point, he introduces Lisette to Magda, who tries to maintain her disguise, to the puzzlement of Lisette. The two couples sit together and drink a toast to love. Prunier notices that Rambaldo <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> and orders Lisette to take Ruggero out of the room for a few minutes, which she does. Rambaldo demands an explanation from Magda for her behaviour and disguise; she tells him that she has nothing to add to what he has already seen. Rambaldo suggests they leave together but she refuses and declares her love for Ruggero, apologizing for any pain she is causing Rambaldo by her actions. Rambaldo tells her that he cannot prevent her staying with Ruggero. As he leaves, Ruggero returns, and tells Magda that dawn is breaking. They decide to begin a new life together, but Magda secretly worries that she is deceiving Ruggero.|$|E
