The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the manner in which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Hugh LeMessurier and Brian Andrew Hills {{published}} their paper, A thermodynamic approach arising <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> on Torres Strait diving techniques, {{which suggested}} that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in asymptomatic bubble formation which must then be re-dissolved at the decompression stops {{before it can}} be eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase gas for efficient decompression.|$|E

5|$|Primatologist Carel P. van Schaik and {{biological}} anthropologist Cheryl D. Knott further investigated tool use in different wild orangutan populations. They compared geographic variations in tool use {{related to the}} processing of Neesia fruit. The orangutans of Suaq Balimbing (P. abelii) {{were found to be}} avid users of insect and seed-extraction tools when compared to other wild orangutans. The scientists suggested these differences are cultural. The orangutans at Suaq Balimbing live in dense groups and are socially tolerant; this creates good conditions for social transmission. Further evidence that highly social orangutans are more likely to exhibit cultural behaviours came <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> of leaf-carrying behaviours of ex-captive orangutans that were being rehabilitated on the island of Kaja in Borneo.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{analysis is}} presented for the bending problem of finite thick plates with through-the-thickness cracks. A general solution is obtained for Navier's equations {{of the theory}} of elasticity. It is found that the in-plane stresses and the transverse normal stress at the crack front are singular with an inverse square root singularity, while the transverse shear stresses are of the order of unity. Results <b>from</b> <b>a</b> numerical <b>study</b> indicate that the stress intensity factor, which varies across the thickness, is influenced by the thickness ratio in a significant manner.

This argument is rooted in the MSCEIT's use of consensus-based assessment, and in the fact that scores on the MSCEIT are negatively distributed (meaning that its scores differentiate between people with low EI better than people with high EI).|$|E

25|$|All {{the common}} blood types, {{such as the}} ABO blood group system, are genetic polymorphisms.

25|$|Concern {{pertains}} to the potential for cross-resistance or co-resistance to other antimicrobials. Numerous studies have been performed {{and there have been}} results indicating that the use of biocidal agents, such as triclosan, can cause cross-resistance. Results <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> published in The American Journal of Infection Control showed that exposure to triclosan was associated with a high risk of developing resistance and cross-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. This was not observed with exposure to chlorhexidine or a hydrogen peroxide-based agent (during the conditions in said study).|$|E

25|$|In his Stigmata: A Medieval Phenomenon in a Modern Age, Ted Harrison {{suggests}} that there is no single mechanism whereby the marks of stigmata were produced. Harrison found no evidence <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> of contemporary cases that the marks were supernatural in origin. He concluded, however, that marks of natural origin need not be hoaxes. Some stigmatics marked themselves in attempt to suffer with Christ as a form of piety. Others marked themselves accidentally and their marks were noted as stigmata by witnesses. Often marks of human origin produced profound and genuine religious responses.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the {{folic acid}} {{fortification}} regulation in 1996, the projected increase in folic acid intake was 100nbsp&µg/d. Data <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> with 1480 subjects showed that folic acid intake increased by 190µg/d and total folate intake increased by 323µg dietary folate equivalents (DFE)/d. Folic acid intake above the {{upper tolerable intake level}} (1000µg folic acid/d) increased only among those individuals consuming folic acid supplements {{as well as}} folic acid found in fortified grain products. Taken together, folic acid fortification has led to a bigger increase in folic acid intake than first projected.|$|E

If it is also a spectroscopic binary the orbital elements can also be determined, and the mass of the stars can be determined relatively easily, which means that the relative densities of the stars can be determined in this case.|$|E
