5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>{{woodpecker}}</b> {{is similar}} to some other species in its genus. The Syrian woodpecker lacks its relative's black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts, although juvenile great spotted woodpeckers often have an incomplete cheek bar, so can potentially be misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged woodpecker has a far more extensive white wing patch than the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The Sind woodpecker {{is very similar to}} the Syrian species, and can be distinguished from <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> in the same way.|$|E
5|$|The {{call of the}} <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is a sharp kik, {{which may}} be {{repeated}} as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} for the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{is estimated at}} 73.7â€“110.3million individuals, with 35% {{of the population in}} Europe. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable or slightly increasing, especially in Britain, where the population has recently overspilled into Ireland. For this reason the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|<b>Great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and buzzards {{can also}} be seen.|$|R
5000|$|Lesser <b>spotted</b> and <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> easily heard {{drumming}} in the woodland.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{to be seen}} are willow tits, woodcock, <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and willow warblers.|$|R
5|$|The {{woodpeckers}} are {{an ancient}} bird family consisting of three subfamilies, the wrynecks, the piculets {{and the true}} woodpeckers, Picinae. The largest of the six tribes within the Picinae is the pied woodpeckers, a group which includes the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> Within the large genus Dendrocopus the great spotted woodpecker's closest relatives are the Himalayan, Sind, Syrian and white-winged woodpeckers and possibly the Darjeeling woodpecker. The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> has been recorded as hybridising with the Syrian woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted {{woodpeckers}} {{have only}} one brood a year. The survival rates for adults and young are unknown, as is the average lifespan, but the maximum known age for a <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is just over 11 years.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{the primary}} natural enemies of the Sirex woodwasp. The adults are {{frequently}} hunted by swallows (Hirundidae) and swifts (Apodidae), both of which prefer males. The black woodpecker (Dryocopius martius) and <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Dendrocopus major) consume some larvae, but do not specialize on the Sirex woodwasp.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} areas of {{woodland}} and grassland. The steeply sloping chalk meadow has {{many species of}} butterfly, including three scarce blue species, the Adonis, chalkhill and small blue. There are flowers such as common spotted and fragrant orchids. Beech woodland above the chalk bank supports <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> and lower woodland has beech and yews.|$|R
25|$|Birds include {{green and}} <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> {{treecreeper}} and goldcrest and kestrel. Muntjac deer are frequent visitors.|$|R
50|$|The site is wooded, and has typical {{woodland}} birds such as <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and tawny owls. Invertebrates include stag beetles.|$|R
5|$|The fossil {{subspecies}} D. m. submajor lived {{during the}} Middle Pleistocene Riss glaciation (250,000 to 300,000 years ago) {{when it was}} found in Europe south of the ice sheet. It is sometimes treated as a distinct species, but {{did not differ significantly}} from the extant <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> whose European subspecies are probably its direct descendants.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted {{woodpeckers}} are hunted by woodland {{birds of}} prey such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk and the northern goshawk. This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding fly Carnus hemapterus, and its internal parasites may include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transversus. Protozoans also occur, including the potentially fatal Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis. The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is the favoured host of the tapeworm Anomotaenia brevis.|$|E
5|$|Species present {{all year}} round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> {{sparrowhawk}} and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include whimbrel, common, wood and green sandpipers, spotted redshank, common greenshank, avocet, godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart.|$|E
50|$|The main {{ecological}} {{interest is}} the birdlife, including <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> greenfinches, <b>great</b> tits and robins. Frogs breed in the pond.|$|R
50|$|The {{site also}} has areas of woodland, which have <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> {{blackcap}} and chiffchaff. There are common whitethroats in scrub areas.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{most common}} urban birds, the heath holds {{breeding}} sparrowhawks and tawny owls {{as well as}} nuthatchs, treecreepers and <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{is closely}} related to some other members of its genus. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are {{distinctive}} enough to be potential new species. It has a huge range and large population, with no widespread threats, so it is classed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Across {{most of its}} European range, {{the most}} {{important}} predator of the Eurasian nuthatch is the sparrowhawk. Other species known to prey on this nuthatch include the northern goshawk, hobby, tawny owl, pygmy owl and least weasel. A Swedish study showed that 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{excavate}} allows woodpeckers to obtain tree sap, {{an important source}} of food for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus Sphyrapicus) feed in this fashion, but the technique is not restricted to these, and others such as the acorn woodpecker and white-headed woodpecker also feed on sap. It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> also feed in this way.|$|E
50|$|Beeches {{were planted}} on chalky {{farmland}} in the 1840s, and medieval plough terraces are still visible. Birds include green and <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> and nuthatches.|$|R
50|$|Woodland {{birds in}} the reserve include {{nuthatch}} and both the green <b>woodpecker</b> and <b>greater</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> Birds of prey include sparrowhawk, kestrel and tawny owl.|$|R
50|$|With such an {{abundance}} of habitat, the Forest attracts many birds such as nuthatches, treecreepers, mistle thrushes, tawny owls, song thrushes, <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and chaffinches.|$|R
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is omnivorous. It digs beetle larvae {{from trees}} and also takes many other {{invertebrates}} including adult beetles, ants and spiders. Crustaceans, molluscs and carrion may be eaten, and bird feeders are visited for suet and domestic scraps. The nests of other cavity-nesting birds, such as tits, may be raided for their eggs and chicks; nest boxes may be similarly attacked, holes being pecked to admit entrance by the woodpecker where necessary. House martin colonies can be destroyed in repeated visits.|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{occurs in}} {{all types of}} {{woodlands}} and is catholic in its diet, being capable of extracting seeds from pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from wood chips. The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks and keep the nest clean. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{spends much}} of its time {{climbing}} trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.|$|E
50|$|Wrens, buzzards, redstarts, pied flycatchers, and crossbills are {{frequently}} {{seen in the}} reserve, but visitors may also <b>spot</b> <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> nuthatches, redwings, woodcocks and wood warblers.|$|R
50|$|The forest hosts {{various kinds}} of birds such as: woodpigeons, jays, turtledoves, kestrels, thrushs, blackbirds, <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> robins, buzzards, woodcocks, great tits, greenfinches, serins, tits and goldfinches.|$|R
50|$|In the woodlands, {{there are}} jays, treecreepers, <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> siskins and sparrowhawks. In the winter, redpoll and bramblings {{frequent}} the woods, and in summer, redstarts and cuckoos can be found.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} {{subspecies}} of the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> recognised by different authors varies widely from {{as few as}} 14 to nearly 30. This is largely because changes are clinal with many intermediate forms. However, mitochondrial DNA data suggests that the Caspian Sea region's Dendrocopus major poelzami, Japanese D. m. japonicus and Chinese D. m. cabanisi may all merit full species status. Despite its distinctive appearance, D. m. canariensis from Tenerife in the Canary Islands appears to be {{closely related to the}} nominate subspecies D. m. major.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} water birds {{can be seen}} around the lake including: great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocoracidae), mute swan (Cygnus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), duck (Anatidae), shoveller (Anas clypeata) and gadwall (Anas strepera). The common buzzard (Buteo buteo) {{can be seen on}} the surrounding hills and both Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and kestrel breed. Occasional visitors include: osprey ("Pandion haeliatis"), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), nuthatch and <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Dendrocopos major). The ruddy darter dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{treecreeper}} nests {{and young}} include the <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> red squirrel, and small mustelids, and predation {{is about three}} times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation rate increases {{with the amount of}} forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is parasitised in the nest by the moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae. The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eightyears and tenmonths.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} is about 2,000 pairs; the main threats are fire, which destroys the habitat, and predation by <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Since 2010 this bird is {{considered as a}} vulnerable species.|$|R
5|$|According to the London Borough of Hillingdon, {{the most}} common species' of birds found within the woods are mute swan, Canada goose, robin, green woodpecker, jay, nuthatch, lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> <b>greater</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> cuckoo, sparrowhawk, tree creeper, tawny owl, willow tit and woodcock.|$|R
50|$|Fauna include insects such as dark bush-crickets, {{white admiral}} and ringlet butterflies, and bird {{species such as}} sparrowhawks, tawny owls, <b>great</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and European green woodpeckers. Songbirds and sparrowhawks are popular sights.|$|R
