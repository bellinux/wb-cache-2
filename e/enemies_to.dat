5000|$|Robert Neilson Stephens (July 22, 1867 - January 20, 1906) was an American {{novelist and}} playwright. An <b>Enemy</b> <b>to</b> the King, both a play and a novel, {{was one of}} his best known works.

5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|Damage from <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> the player's {{characters}} affect an {{endurance and}} health pool. While endurance regenerates after combat, health {{can only be}} restored by resting. The party can either set up camp, or rest in an inn. If a character in the party has their endurance drained, they are knocked out {{until the end of}} combat. If a companion has their health reduced to zero they die permanently.|$|E
5|$|Euryale– A Gorgon {{and former}} {{servant of the}} Sisters of Fate. Euryale sought revenge against Kratos for killing her sister Medusa, but was killed and decapitated; as with Medusa, Kratos took her head {{to use it as}} a weapon to turn <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> stone. The {{character}} was voiced by Jennifer Martin in God of War II.|$|E

5|$|Historical records {{reveal that}} despite the {{repeated}} attacks by <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> capture the fort, it was not taken, except for a lone one-day occupation by Kamran Mirza. Kamran was the second son of the Mughal Emperor Babur who attacked Bikaner in 1534, which was then ruled by Rao Jait Singh.|$|E

5|$|The {{accession}} of Basil I to {{the throne}} in 867 {{marks the beginning of}} the Macedonian dynasty, which would rule for the next two and a half centuries. This dynasty included some of the most able emperors in Byzantium's history, and the period is one of revival and resurgence. The Empire moved from defending against external <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> reconquest of territories formerly lost.|$|E

5|$|The army of {{the early}} Republic {{continued}} to evolve, and {{although there was a}} tendency among Romans to attribute such changes to great reformers, {{it is more likely that}} changes were the product of slow evolution rather than singular and deliberate policy of reform. The manipular formation was probably copied from Rome's Samnite <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> the south, perhaps as a result of Roman defeats in the Second Samnite War.|$|E
5|$|When {{hiding in}} the dark is a {{gameplay}} element, light and shadow become important parts of the level design. Usually the player is able to disable certain light sources. Stealth games also emphasize the audio design when players {{must be able to}} hear the subtle sound effects that may alert <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> their actions; noise will often vary as the player walks on different surfaces such as wood or metal. Players who move recklessly will make more noise and attract more attention.|$|E
5|$|Word of Sharp's alleged claims soon reached Jereboam Beauchamp, {{reviving}} {{his resolve}} to kill him. Beauchamp abandoned {{the idea of}} killing Sharp honorably in a duel. Instead, he decided to murder him and cast suspicion on his political <b>enemies.</b> <b>To</b> add to the intrigue, Beauchamp plotted to commit the murder {{on the eve of}} the General Assembly's opening session.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but even then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> their front and rear.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Edward I, the new king, Edward II, asked that Winchelsey be restored, which the pope agreed to on 22 January 1308. Soon after his return to England in early 1308 the {{archbishop}} joined the king's enemies. The archbishop, along with the Earl of Warwick, {{were the only people}} to object to the return of the new king's favourite Piers Gaveston to England in 1309. Winchelsey aided the barons in their prosecution of Edward II by sentencing their <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> excommunication. He was appointed an Ordainer in 1310, and died at Otford on 11 May 1313.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player has to take off the runway at an Allied base. Afterwards they can fly around and look for <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> engage. The player can open their Satellite Intelligence Map, which shows a live map of the {{immediate}} coastline with items of interest, such as, friendly bases, enemy positions, and refuelling locations. The player can perform various flight manoeuvres and stunts mid-air, such are loops, rolls, or dummy stalls. Flying, especially at high altitudes, spends the plane's fuel and the player must either return to their base or perform an aerial refueling. To refuel mid-air, the player has to rendezvous with a refuelling plane at the specified coordinates and perform a boom and receptacle refuelling manoeuvre.|$|E

5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E
5|$|Between levels, the Kid {{visits the}} Bastion, where the player can use fragments—the game's form of currency—that they have accrued to buy {{materials}} and upgrade weapons. With each core the player collects, they can add {{one of six}} structures to the Bastion, such as a shrine, an armory, or a distillery, and each shard allows the player to expand a structure. Each structure serves a different purpose; for example, the distillery lets the player select upgrades, and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke, causing the <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> become stronger and giving the player increased experience points and currency. Experience points are {{used to determine the}} Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select.|$|E
5|$|Each {{enemy was}} {{designed}} to exhibit a unique behavior toward the character; random elements were programmed into the enemies' behaviors to make the game more interesting. The first two designed were the simplest: Electrodes and Grunts. Electrodes are stationary objects that are lethal to the in-game characters, and Grunts are simple robots that chase the protagonist by plotting the shortest path to him. Grunts were designed to overwhelm the player with large groups. While testing the game with the new control system and the two enemies, Jarvis and DeMar were impressed by the gameplay's excitement and fun. As a result, they began steadily {{increasing the number of}} on-screen <b>enemies</b> <b>to</b> over a hundred to see if more enemies would generate more enjoyment.|$|E
