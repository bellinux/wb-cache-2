On the first play of the second drive of the second quarter, Boise State quarterback Taylor Tharp threw an interception to defensive back Travis Williams. Williams also recorded eightsolo tackles—the second-highest total for the Pirates–and a <b>forced</b> fumble. The other interception came from defensive back J.J.

In addition to his <b>forced</b> fumble, Chambliss recorded four solo tackles. The Pirates' defense as a whole only gave up threeyards {{in the first quarter}} and did not allow a first down until halfway through the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|Following {{accusations of}} <b>forced</b> labour {{on the large}} American-owned Firestone rubber {{plantation}} and American accusations of slave trading, the Liberian government asked the League to launch an investigation. The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia. In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and <b>forced</b> labour. The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia {{and led to the}} resignation of President Charles D. B. King and his vice-president. The Liberian government outlawed <b>forced</b> labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms.|$|E
