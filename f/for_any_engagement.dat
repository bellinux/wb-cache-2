50|$|For all units, {{operational}} {{direction is}} via Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ). However, It {{should be noted}} that elements within the nine regionally-aligned brigades may also report to another chain of command. When not dealing with operational commitments or mission-specific training (e.g. when conducting routine civilian engagement, ranges, or 'defence contribution to homeland resilience' (homeland defence)) they may report through a Regional Point of Command (RPOC) to Headquarters Regional Command at Andover. Therefore, it may not always be apparent as to which Headquarters a given unit is working to, and care should be taken to establish the correct chain of command <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>engagement.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sir Thomas's return made a {{striking}} {{change in the}} ways of the family, independent of Lovers' Vows. Under his government, Mansfield was an altered place. Some members of their society sent away, and the spirits of many others saddened--it was all sameness and gloom compared with the past--a sombre family party rarely enlivened. There was little intercourse with the Parsonage. Sir Thomas, drawing back from intimacies in general, was particularly disinclined, at this time, <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>engagements</b> but in one quarter.

40|$|Whenever {{it comes}} to {{education}} {{in general and of}} women in India and everywhere else in the world in specific, this topic is coupled with very high expectations and enthusiastic statements. Education seems to provide the solution for all problems that arise on the social and individual level of a society. Such expectations on education of women, especially in India, are related to the so called "development of the nation", to the political and economic empowerment of women, to the improvement of public health and wealth etc. But education, whether for men or women, seen from a social point of view, is not as innocuous as the songs of praise suggest. In the contrary: It can have and has far-reaching consequences in many respects and these consequences are neither assessable in advance nor easy controllable. [...] .

40|$|This paper {{makes the}} {{argument}} that the notion of post-essentialism provides a resource for accommodating the multiple strands of intervention that have been brought to questions of the body and embodiment over the past two decades. Post-essentialism is explored as a multiplicity of theoretical interventions able to raise questions about the materiality of performing bodies, the interconnections between material and somatic bodies, and the larger issues of representation and cultural location. Post-essentialist approaches enable all bodies and identities to be investigated as strategically built and apprehended and interpreted by different people in different ways. The paper will demonstrate how a post-essentialist approach used for theorising, conceptualising and analysing the body in a university course simultaneously advocates a different and diverse pedagogic practice. The notion of post-essentialism pursued emerges from teaching the course “Hot Bodies, Cool Flesh, Sex, Race and the Visual Body” to a relatively liberal and ‘mainstream’ Bachelor and Honours student cohort in a university in a regional city in Australia. This pedagogical approach effects a movement out of disciplinary boundaries and the constraints of their resources and into a broad range of texts and performances. The course engages with sex work and sex workers, death, HIV AIDS, dance and disability, not as curiosity or site of normative and moral assertion, but in terms of pleasure, abjection, desire and potentialities. From this, it is proposed that post-essentialism provides a pedagogical practice and a critical tool of theoretical, conceptual and material intervention <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>engagement</b> beyond the normative, especially so in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary team teaching contexts. ...|$|E
50|$|Order of Battle (O/B) is a {{military}} term for {{a description of the}} strength of an armed force, its composition and particulars. A key factor is the total number involved. Here the count was of communist forces in South Vietnam.

This article addresses the Order of Battle (O/B) not <b>for</b> <b>any</b> single <b>engagement</b> of the war, but rather for the overall strength of communist forces in South Vietnam at the time, e.g., 1967.|$|R

50|$|Sailing {{altogether}} {{along the}} coast of Spain, they were suddenly becalmed upon 24 April in the Straits of Gibraltar, where they immediately saw the six galleys making towards them. Centurion was prepared <b>for</b> <b>any</b> such <b>engagement,</b> having prepared their close quarters in readiness. However, there were only 48 men and boys fit for duty. As the Spanish galleys bore up, the Centurion discharged her ordnance. The other merchant vessels initially lay out of danger, while five of the galleys laid on board the Centurion, which they made themselves fast with their grappling irons, two to a side with a fifth galley on the stern. On both sides of the ship the Spanish were repelled; the ropes and grapples were cut successively and fire was maintained to cripple the Spanish ships. The Centurion was set ablaze several times, but was extinguished each time with little damage.|$|R

40|$|In the Vale of Tears {{brings to}} a {{culmination}} {{the project for}} a renewed and enlivened debate over the interaction between Marxism and religion. It does so by offering the author's own response to that tradition. It simultaneously draws upon the rich insights of {{a significant number of}} Western Marxists and strikes out on its own. Thus, it argues for the crucial role of political myth on the Left; explores the political ambivalence at the heart of Christianity; challenges the bent among many on the Left to favour the unexpected rupture of kairós as a key to revolution; is highly suspicious of the ideological and class alignments of ethics; offers a thorough reassessment of the role of fetishism in the Marxist tradition; and broaches the question of death, unavoidable <b>for</b> <b>any</b> Marxist <b>engagement</b> with religion.

40|$|The {{conduct of}} {{scientific}} research and its architectural expression, in {{both public and private}} institutions, has been caught up in larger political and social changes with curious results and evident contradictions. This paper will focus on the case of the most recent additions to the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory (CSHL) campus on Long Island, constructed in 2009. CSHL {{is one of the most}} prominent centres for genetics research in the world. The observations drawn from CSHL are instructive <b>for</b> <b>any</b> critical <b>engagement</b> with the question of informational transparency, institutional change and the means by which architecture may negotiate actual content and formal expression. This is because CSHL is a significant departure from its type – its location is discrete, its laboratories are opaquely subterranean, its campus residential and its architecture nostalgic. Yet, this organisation is subject to legislation that means its financial dealings and its dependency on philanthropic networks are made transparent...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} one of the most {{important}} conditions that defines democracy as a system of self-governance. This condition is that all individuals in a society must have the right to communicate freely with any other individual or group of individuals in the society. A substantial part of this paper looks at the empirical reality of the public sphere in Karnataka for two basic purposes: (a) as a diagnostic study of the nature of this public sphere, and (b) as facts that need to be looked at <b>for</b> <b>any</b> meaningful <b>engagement</b> with the state’s democratic processes, and for the task of the further democratisation of society. Our study has revealed that the public sphere in contemporary Karnataka is an enormously rich and variegated domain of socio-cultural and political life. While some elements in this sphere are in a state of recession/disintegration, others are well established and efficiently functional, and yet others are still in a state of emergence. But together they offer significant opportunities <b>for</b> <b>any</b> citizen wishing to participate in the processes of the public sphere to do so.
