Through ARM, {{the effect of}} the potential can now be included consistently both during and after ionisation, providing a complete picture for the effects of the long-range potential. We find that the Coulomb effects modify the ionisation dynamics in several ways, including modification of (i) the <b>ionisation</b> (exit) <b>times,</b> (ii) the initial conditions for the electron continuum dynamics, (iii) the "tunnelling angle", at which the electron "enters" the barrier, and (iv) the electron drift momentum. We derive analytical expressions for the Coulomb-corrected <b>ionisation</b> <b>times,</b> initial velocities, momentum shifts and ionisation rates in circularly polarised fields, for arbitrary angular momentum of the initial state.

This behaviour is indicative of the atoms first moving forward into the position z-dimension and then being reflected backwards. Making the appropriate conversion from the mean time-of-flight of the H + ions, to the position of ionisation, the trajectory of the ensemble of Rydberg atoms in the z-dimension could be reconstructed [Fig. 15 (b) filled black circles]. This shows that the atoms were brought from their initial longitudinal speed of 720 m/s, to a standstill ∼ 1.75 mm from their position of photoexcitation in a time of ∼ 4.5 μs. In this process they experience an average acceleration of ∼− 1.5 × 108 m/s 2.|$|R

40|$|Context. The {{surroundings}} of H ii regions {{can have}} a profound influence on their development, morphology, and evolution. This paper explores {{the effect of the}} environment on H ii regions in the MonR 2 molecular cloud. Aims. We aim to investigate the density structure of envelopes surrounding H ii regions and to determine their collapse and ionisation expansion ages. The Mon R 2 molecular cloud is an ideal target since it hosts an H ii region association, which has been imaged by the Herschel PACS and SPIRE cameras as part of the HOBYS key programme. Methods. Column density and temperature images derived from Herschel data were used together to model the structure of H ii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. The resulting observational constraints were used to follow the development of the Mon R 2 ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. Results. The four hot bubbles associated with H ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold, and neutral gas envelopes, which are partly embedded in filaments. The envelope's radial density profiles are reminiscent of those of low-mass protostellar envelopes. The inner parts of envelopes of all four H ii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow density profiles: 3 ̆c 1 (r) 2 r- q with q ≤ 1. 5. As for their outer parts, the two compact H ii regions show a 3 ̆c 1 (r) 2 r- 2 profile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of a singular isothermal sphere. In contrast, the central UCH ii region shows a steeper outer profile, 3 ̆c 1 (r) 2 r- 2. 5, that could be interpreted as material being forced to collapse, where an external agent overwhelms the internal pressure support. Conclusions. The size of the heated bubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initial neutral gas density are used to estimate the <b>ionisation</b> expansion <b>time,</b> texp 0. 1 Myr, for the dense UCH ii and compact H ii regions and 0. 35 Myr for the extended H ii region. Numerical simulations with and without gravity show that the so-called lifetime problem of H ii regions is an artefact of theories that do not take their surrounding neutral envelopes with slowly decreasing density profiles into account. The envelope transition radii between the shallow and steeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since the formation of the first protostellar embryo, tinf 1 Myr, for the ultra-compact, 1. 5 - 3 Myr for the compact, and greater than 6 Myr for the extended H ii regions. These results suggest that the time needed to form a OB-star embryo and to start ionising the cloud, plus the quenching time due to the large gravitational potential amplified by further in-falling material, dominates the <b>ionisation</b> expansion <b>time</b> by a large factor. Accurate determination of the quenching time of H ii regions would require additional small-scale observationnal constraints and numerical simulations including 3 D geometry effects.

Methods: I investigated the presence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) staphylococci in cats, dogs and people in the nursing homes and in the community of four Swiss Cantons (Berne, Ticino, Vaud and Zurich). The study received ethical clearance from the responsible Cantonal Ethical Committees and authorization for animal experimentation from the Cantonal and Federal Veterinary Offices. Between March 2008 and December 2009 I collected nasal swabs from 978 people and nasal and ear swabs from 256 dogs and 277 cats and checked them for the presence of staphylococci.

The position of the dynamical resonance is computed using a high-order perturbation series, and estimate its radius of convergence. We show that {{the position of the}} dynamical resonance does not coincide precisely with the ionisation maxima, and that the field switch-on time can dramatically affect the ionisation signal which, for long switch times, reflects the shape of an incipient homoclinic. Similarly, the resonance <b>ionisation</b> <b>time</b> can reflect the time-scale of the separatrix motion, which is therefore longer than conventional static field Stark ionisation.

30|$|However, more {{detailed}} information on the longitudinal position of the Rydberg atoms at each <b>ionisation</b> <b>time</b> can be extracted from the ion time-of-flight distributions. In {{the case of the}} measurements with the mirror off, it can be seen in Fig. 15 (a) that the flight-time of the H + ions to the MCP detector (i.e., the time interval between each dashed vertical line and the subsequent maximum in the time-of-flight distribution) increases as the delay between excitation and pulsed electric field ionisation increases. This occurs because when the Rydberg atoms move further into the positive z dimension within the mirror electrodes, the H + ions produced by pulsed electric field ionisation are accelerated through a smaller electric potential difference and therefore travel more slowly to the MCP. If the relation between the flight-time of the ions to the MCP and their position of ionisation is calibrated using a beam with a known longitudinal speed, the position of the atoms at the time of ionisation can be determined. With the mirror off, these positions are indicated by the open red circles in Fig. 15 (b).|$|E

The envelope transition radii between the shallow and steeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since the formation of the first proto stellar embryo, Tinf : 1 Myr, for the ultra-compact, 1. 5 / 3 Myr for the compact, and greater than 6 Myr for the extended HII regions...|$|R

40|$|Insects are, as mammals, complex {{multicellular}} organisms. For {{proper functioning}} of these organisms {{there has to}} be a form of communication between the cells building up this multicellular organism. For this communication they are equipped with a neural and a hormonal system. An important part of this dual system is the neuroendocrine system which consists of the hypothalamus-pituitary complex in mammals and its insect counterpart called the pars intercerebralis-corpus cardiacum complex. In these complexes there is a close collaboration between the neural and the hormonal system. We prefer Locusta migratoria as a model since a large number of neuropeptides present in the corpora cardiaca of this insect have already been identified and characterised (adipokinetic hormones, hypertrehalosaemic hormone, diuretic hormone, myotropins, pyrokinins,…). Our aim in this study is to determine the factors that are responsible for the release, or modulation of release, of these neuropeptides into the circulation. Released peptides are trapped on disposable seppak C 18 columns and detected using a size exclusion column and conventional HPLC. The actual identification of these peptides occurs in a second chromatographic run combined with Electrospray <b>Ionisation</b> double Quadrupole <b>Time</b> Of Flight Mass Spectrometry (NanoLC-MS). After administration of melatonin to the tissue we were able, using this method, to identify seven peptides (Adipokinetic hormone Precursor Related Peptides 1 and 2, Neuroparsins A 1, A 2 and B, Insulin Related Peptide C Chain and Diuretic Peptide) in the melatonin induced chromatographic peak. status: publishe...|$|R

Current measures of airways inflammation severity are insensitive or non-specific. MethodsBronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 39 CF children and 38 respiratory disease controls was obtained at bronchoscopy and analysed by surface enhanced laser desorption <b>ionisation</b> <b>time</b> of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Recognized proteins were assessed for CF disease specificity. Individual protein identification of specific peaks was performed. Results 1277 proteins/peptides, > 4  kDa, were detected using 12 different surfaces and binding conditions. 202 proteins/peptides were differentially expressed in the CF samples (p< 0. 001), 167 up-regulated and 35 down-regulated. The most discriminatory biomarker had a mass of 5. 163  kDa. The most abundant, with a mass of 10. 6  kDa, was identified as s 100 A 8 (calgranulin A). ConclusionsThe application of SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry allows evaluation of proteins in BAL fluid avoiding the limitations of only analysing predetermined proteins and potentially identifying proteins not previously appreciated as biomarkers. Its application to {{cystic fibrosis}} should enable appropriate evaluation of evolving illness, of gene therapy and other new therapies...|$|E
40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF, Glomeromycota) are mutualistic symbionts {{associated with}} majority of land plants. These fungi {{play an important}} role in plant growth, but their taxonomic identification remains a challenge for academic research, culture collections and inoculum producers who need to certify their products. Identification of these fungi was traditionally performed based on their spore morphology. DNA sequence data have successfully been used to study the evolutionary relationships of AMF, develop molecular identification tools and assess their diversity in the environment. However, these methods require considerable expertise and are not well-adapted for "routine" quality control of culture collections and inoculum production. Here, we show that Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption <b>Ionisation</b> <b>Time</b> of Flight Mass Spectrometry proteomic-based biotyping is a highly efficient approach for AMF identification. Nineteen isolates belonging to fourteen species, seven genera and five families were clearly differentiated by MALDI biotyping at the species level, and intraspecific differentiation was achieved for the majority. AMF identification by MALDI biotyping could be highly useful, not only for research but also in agricultural and environmental applications. Fast, accurate and inexpensive molecular mass determination and the possibility of automation make MALDI-TOF-MS a real alternative to conventional morphological and molecular methods for AMF identification...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{gel electrophoresis}} (2 -DE) based proteomic approach {{has been used to}} study the Medicago truncatula-Uromyces striatus interaction. The 2 -DE leaf protein profile of three M. truncatula genotypes displaying different phenotypes (susceptible and showing prehaustorial and posthaustorial resistance) in both noninoculated and inoculated plants have been compared. Multivariate statistical analysis identified 63 differential protein spots under the experimental conditions (genotypes/treatments). Variable spots were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption <b>ionisation</b> <b>time</b> of flight, MALDI-TOF/TOF) analysis to identify their possible functions. A total of 27 proteins were identified using a combination of peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and MSMS fragmentation. Most of these observed changes correspond to enzymes involved in photosynthesis, energy metabolic pathways and stress related, whose pattern expression was different in relation to susceptibility/resistance of the genotypes studied. Results obtained in this work suggest that differences observed could be related to efficiency in energy utilisation and the induction of proteins involved in defence mechanism operating during early stages of infection. © 2010 Association of Applied Biologists.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{introduce}} experiments that explore {{the effect of}} different combinations of femtosecond laser fields on the high harmonic generation (HHG) process and its ap- plications to probe ultrafast dynamics. Combining a fundamental driving field with a secondary field allows for control over the HHG process in several ways. The ionisation step of the process can be altered significantly by introducing a secondary field. The elec- tron trajectories in the continuum can be controlled and manipulated by the secondary field. Further, the secondary field {{can be used to}} drive a population transfer between different states of the cation. In a first experiment, we used the fundamental pulses in combination with copies of themselves (ω + ω experiment) to synthesise a field with a new temporal and spectral structure. Using this synthesised field to drive the HHG process results in a shift of the central frequency of the high-order harmonics. We demonstrated very fine control over the harmonic energy with a setup which is significantly simpler and more cost effective than more commonly used setups, and compatible with very high pulse energy sources. In a second experiment, the fundamental field is combined with its second harmonic (ω + 2 ω experiment). The addition of the second frequency results in a harmonic spec- trum consisting of odd and even harmonics, as the symmetry of the combined generating field is broken. We observed below- and above-threshold harmonics in Kr and CO 2 and investigated the effect of the secondary field on the harmonic generation {{as a function of the}} time delay between the fundamental and its second harmonic. We observed harmon- ics generated by the secondary field only, a delayed onset of some even harmonic orders depending on the delay and interesting modulations of the harmonic yield depending on the delay. This experiment served as a proof of principle for the setup used for the more demanding third experiment. The third experiment combined the fundamental with its third harmonic (ω + 3 ω exper- iment). The idea of this experiment is to drive the HHG process with the fundamental field, whilst the third harmonic drives a population transfer between two cation states in CO 2. If the population transfer is timed right, the recombination probability for the short and long trajectory contributions can be controlled separately. Since each trajectory rep- resents a specific <b>ionisation</b> and excursion <b>time,</b> any changes of the state of the system are encoded in the interferences between the contributions of the short and long trajecto- ries. This makes so-called quantum path interferences (QPI), interferences between the short and long trajectory contributions, a useful observable to probe femtosecond and attosecond dynamics.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{for a series}} of experiments investigating effects which call influence the interpretation of data from ionisation-based dust detectors carried oil spacecraft. First, the variation of the impact ionisation yield with angle of impact was Studied for impacts of iron microparticles onto gold at speeds of 1 - 75 km s(- 1). The angle of incidence was from 0 degrees (normal incidence) to 80 degrees (glancing incidence). Little or no variation was observed at angles up to 60 degrees, but at 80 degrees the total impact ionisation signal was around an order of magnitude lower than at smaller angles. In addition, the fast rising component of the <b>ionisation</b> signal rise <b>time</b> showed no variation with impact angle, but the total signal rise time showed a steady decrease. The effect of secondary impact ionisation resulting from particle impacts on detector side walls was also Studied. Iron microparticles were fired oil to an aluminium target Lit various angles, and the impact ionisation signal on a nearby gold target was measured. It was found that ionisation signals were observed oil the gold target, and that these were very similar in appearance to those observed in direct impacts. The effect of reduction in particle charge oil an impact ionisation signal was investigated. Iron microparticles were fired on to a gold target after passing through a thin film which reduced the charge which was used to accelerate them. It was found that there was a measurable drop in ionisation signal in the reduced-charge case. The empirical relation I-IONISATION = 1. 67 x 10 (- 9) Q(PARTICLE) (0. 35) (units of C) was found. This implies there is a component in the observed ionisation signal that is not related to the impact. To test this, charged tungsten carbide particles were dropped at very low velocity onto a replica of a dust detector used in space whilst placed in a vacuum chamber. lonisation signals were frequently recorded by the detector. It was concluded that this signal originated from the incident particle charge. In the final section of work, as all example, the influence of oblique incidence, side-wall impacts and particle charge effects oil data collected by the Gorid dust detector in Earth orbit were investigated. Corrections were applied to the mass and velocity distributions derived from Gorid data. In extremis, oblique incidence effects were found to shift the mass distribution down by an order of magnitude, and the velocity distribution up by a factor of two to three. If all the data had come from unrecognised side-wall impacts, the mass distribution would be shifted downwards to lower masses by three orders of magnitude. and the velocity distribution upwards by a factor of five. Possible particle charge effects were found to shift the mass distribution down by 30 % and did not alter the velocity distribution. Overall we have investigated a variety of impact-related phenomena and conclude that these call affect the interpretation of data from instruments deployed in space...|$|R
40|$|Tungsten (W) is used {{in present}} fusion {{experiments}} and is as well a material choice for future reactors like ITER [4] and DEMO [80]. However, tungsten eroded from the wall leads to high radiation losses in the plasma and the transport to the plasma center to critical plasma cooling [33]. Therefore a detailed investigation {{of the interaction between}} eroded tungsten and the plasma is necessary. The emission of tungsten line radiation in the plasma and thus the shape of the emission profiles is characterised by excitation and ionisation. Quantitatively the ionisation can be described in terms of the ionisation rate coefficients. This knowledge is necessary for the interpretation of spectroscopic data and especially to determine tungsten fluxes into the plasma that are caused by tungsten erosion. Up to now, ionisation rate coefficients for neutral tungsten were not determined except for the plasma temperature range below 20 eV [88]. For higher temperatures only uncertain calculated data (e. g. [22, 89]) or semi-empirical data [54] is available. Therefore, within this thesis for the first <b>time</b> <b>ionisation</b> and emission processes of tungsten originating from tungsten erosion were investigated in the temperature range between (41 ± 8) eV and (81 ± 8) eV at the tokamak TEXTOR and ionisation rate coefficients were determined experimentally. Measured emission profiles of the W i (400. 88 nm) -line show a typical exponential decrease that is caused by the ionisation of the neutral tungsten atoms. But moreover, at a distance of 1 to 2 mm away from the sputtered surface the emission initially increases to a maximum. By introducing a relaxation time between 0. 5 and 1 μs before reaching the equilibrium {{of the population of the}} emitting energy level of this line the increase of the emission profiles can be reproduced. Simulating the emissions profiles through a Monte-Carlo-simulation that was developed in the scope of this thesis results in ionisation rate coefficients that are identical with values calculated through using the semi-empirical Lotz-formula [48, 54]. The necessary extension of the atomic data base regarding neutral tungsten leads to the interest in a tungsten source that can easily be used for calibration purposes. This was realised at TEXTOR through the injection of WF_ 6. The tungsten that was brought into the plasma via WF_ 6 -injection was investigated regarding the comparability to tungsten originating from a sputteringprocess. Moreover was WF_ 6 used for the first time to determine conversion factors—the so-called photon efficiencies—to calculate tungsten fluxes from spectroscopically measured photon fluxes. For the given combinations of temperature and density from (20 ± 5) eV to (82 ± 5) eV and from (2. 2 ± 1) × 10 ^ 12 cm^− 3 to (6. 8 ± 1) × 10 ^ 12 cm^− 3, respectively, for the W i (400. 88 nm) -line a constant average value of 〈 E^Wi(400. 88 nm) _Ph〉= 49 ± 16 is found. To test these values sputtering yields were determined from the amount of eroded tungsten atoms. These sputtering yields are in line with experimental reference values [19] and calculations from [34]. The prevailing investigated plasma conditions are in the range of what can be expected considering the ITER divertor during ELMs [12, 21, 47, 71]. The found experimental results are consistent and confirm the match between WF_ 6 -photon efficiencies and photon efficiencies of sputtered tungsten...|$|R
