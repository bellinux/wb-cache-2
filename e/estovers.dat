50|$|Ancient woods were {{valuable}} {{properties for}} their owners, {{as a source}} of wood fuel, timber (<b>estovers</b> and loppage) and forage for pigs (pannage). In southern England, hazel was particularly important for coppicing, the branches being used for wattle and daub in buildings, for example. Such old coppice stumps are easily recognised for their current overgrown state, now that the practice has largely disappeared. Large boles emerge from a common stump in such overgrown coppice stools. Originally, the term of 'forest' did not refer solely to woodland; it also included parkland, open heathland, upland fells, and any other territory, between or outside of manorial freehold, and was the exclusive hunting preserve of the monarch, or granted to nobility. The ancient woods that were within forests, were frequently Royal Parks, enjoying special protection against poachers and other interlopers, and subject to tolls and fines where trackways passed through them or when firewood was permitted to be collected or other licence granted. The forest law was very strictly enforced, by a hierarchy of foresters, parkers and woodwards. In English land law, it was illegal to assart any part of a royal forest. This was the greatest trespass that could be committed in a forest, being more than a waste: for whereas waste of the forest involves felling trees, they can grow again; assarting involves completely rooting up trees within the woodland of the afforested area.|$|E
40|$|Archaelogical {{research}} has abundantly {{shown that the}} primitive lands of a wide area, of which the Forest of Dean is a survival, were densely wooded. The abundance of wood was eroded through centuries by assarting, industrial activity, neglect, and wanton spoliation. The vicissitudes of Dean from early times to Domesday, through the era of wooden ships, to modern commercial forestry, have not hitherto been fully described. The thesis {{is believed to be}} the first based on research into the records and development of a timber-producing forest. It treats of Dean (a) in its progress from natural woodland, and later hunting preserve, to an example of silviculture including use for recreation, education, and scientific purposes, and (b) as producing timber for multifarioias uses. The course of the Crown's use of the Forest is made clear. Particular attention is given to:- 1. Species of trees, from early times to the present day, and the uses of the cover. 2. Extent of (a) the Forest under forest law and (b) the extent (the lesser) of its woodland cover. Effects of afforesting and deforesting. 3. Forest law as operative in Dean. Its (a) administration; (b) decline in severity; (c) beneficial aspects; and (d) lapse into desuetude. 4. Customs common to forests: pannage, communing, and <b>estovers.</b> 5. Factors in reduction of the cover; assarting, gift, sale, lease, and theft. 6. Reservation, conservation, and replenishment. Changes in growth and quality of the cover. 7. Inadequacy of replenishment when timber was needed for ship-building. 8. Timber and wood for (a) the king's works, (b) gifts, (c) mining of iron-ore and coal, (d) charcoal-burning for smelting and forging, (e) fuel, building, and other local requirements, (f) quarrels for cross-bows, (g) ship-building, and (h) modem wood-processes. 9. Oak bark for tanning. 10. Beginnings of silviculture. Sowing and planting from the mid-seventeenth centuiy. The first planting of conifers in c. 178 l. 11. Attainment of scientific silviculture in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 12. The multiple use of the Forest: commercial timber- production, education, scientific, and recreation. The thesis concludes with an explanation of Dean's present condition, and its function as an important national Forest...|$|E

The dispute was finally settled in 1248. In a final concord William conceded 2 acres of woods in Kingswood in frank almoin; common pasture in his warrens at Lyonshall and his fields; and two mills in Lyonshall, for which he also granted wood for their construction and rights of ingress and egress, along with the suit his men owed to the mills. He also remitted and quitclaimed 6 shillings rent, which he drew from the prior, and gave the prior 2 marks.
