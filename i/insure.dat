5|$|These {{costs are}} {{surprisingly}} high—one agent who represents an unnamed NBA player set to earn $10 {{million in the}} 2010–11 season said the player had received a $400,000 quote to <b>insure</b> his contract for his national team's FIBA qualifier. The Spanish Basketball Federation said that insuring all the NBA players on its national team for EuroBasket 2011, which doubles as the European Olympic qualifiers, could {{cost as much as}} $5.67 million. Basketball Australia announced that Andrew Bogut would not be available for the 2011 FIBA Oceania Championship; his agent indicated that the final deal-breaker was when insurers stated that they would not <b>insure</b> his remaining $39 million in NBA salary unless pre-existing elbow, wrist, and back injuries were excluded from the policy.|$|E
40|$|The sum <b>insured</b> of <b>insured</b> assets {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{significant}} characteristics of insurance policy quality and is the ceiling amount of insurance benefit {{in the case of an}} <b>insured</b> loss. It {{is one of the}} parameters specified in the policy and affects the premium amount. The sum <b>insured</b> relates to the <b>insured</b> value of the asset. It is the highest possible loss which can occur to an <b>insured</b> loss and it is decisive for determining the sum <b>insured.</b> The policy holder determines the sum <b>insured</b> so that it corresponds to the <b>insured</b> value of the <b>insured</b> asset at the time of insurance policy signing. The policy holder is fully liable for setting the sum <b>insured.</b> The aim of this paper was to analyze the quality of the underwritten insurance according to the determined sum <b>insured.</b> Source data for the paper included critical analysis of literature based on valid Czech legislation and on general terms and conditions of insurance of individual insurance companies. The paper contains an analysis and comparison of types of <b>insured</b> values of assets for insurance needs on the Czech insurance market. An induction method applied to a real-life insurance case was used for explanation of the relationship between the sum <b>insured</b> and paid-out insurance benefit. The paper clarifies the significance and characteristics of the sum <b>insured</b> in the Czech Republic. The conclusion is that viewing insurance only from the angle of the premium amount is completely incorrect. Savings on the premium at the expense of reduction of the sum <b>insured</b> implies a risk of not renewing company operations or a living in a family house in case of an <b>insured</b> loss. ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>insured</b> {{must prove}} that an {{insurable}} interest existed {{in order to}} prove loss. The test is whether the <b>insured</b> will incur financial loss, or will fail to derive an anticipated financial benefit, if the event <b>insured</b> against occurs. In principle, the object of insurance must be in existence {{at the time of the}} occurrence of the peril <b>insured</b> against. If the <b>insured</b> has no interest at the time of the occurrence of the event <b>insured</b> against, he cannot suffer any loss or damage. Since the function of insurable interest is to determine whether the <b>insured</b> has suffered a loss, the insured’s interest, by virtue of the terms of the contract, must exist at the time of the materialisation of the peril <b>insured</b> against. If the <b>insured</b> does not possess an interest at that crucial time, there is no object secured by the insurance. Consequently, the <b>insured</b> can bring no claim under the contract for loss suffered.|$|R
5|$|The {{beginning}} of 1970 saw {{the initiation of}} the 18th Engineers Brigade's Operation Last Chance, a program of command emphasis and organization for motivation and success of that year's engineer operations. The goals of the program were to maintain primary missions of the combat support as well as <b>insure</b> {{the completion of the}} many projects planned for the 1970 construction operations.|$|E
5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to <b>insure</b> that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} Soviet opposition, Norway {{attempted to}} move the debate from the political to the specialist scene, {{while at the same}} time establishing a protocol for Norwegian control and operation of the facility. To achieve this, Norwegian authorities worked towards establishing an inspection procedure to <b>insure</b> that the facilities remained solely used for 'peaceful activities'. This would particularly focus on the regular inspection of auxiliary equipment. To depoliticize the issue further, the government appointed the semi-independent NTNF as the operator of the facility. The first oral consultations between the Soviet embassy and the Norwegian government took place in November 1964.|$|E
50|$|Over-insurance {{occurs when}} the sum <b>insured</b> {{is greater than the}} loss that the <b>insured</b> would suffer if the risk materialises. For example, a house is <b>insured</b> for R200,000, but its market value is R150,000. Even here, the <b>insured</b> may not recover more than the loss he {{actually}} suffers.|$|R
50|$|Compulsory <b>insured</b> and {{voluntary}} <b>insured</b> {{people of the}} public health insurance are compulsorily <b>insured</b> in the social insurance. Voluntarily <b>insured</b> people have the possibility to switch to the private care insurance, which also include the fully <b>insured</b> people of the private health insurance. The spouse and children of members of social care insurance are entitled to premium-free family insurance. With this system, a cover for the entire population was introduced.|$|R
25|$|The <b>insured</b> {{receives}} a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and {{circumstances under which}} the <b>insured</b> will be financially compensated. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the <b>insured</b> for the coverage {{set forth in the}} insurance policy is called the premium. If the <b>insured</b> experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the <b>insured</b> submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster.|$|R
5|$|Two further Carry On films {{followed}} for Jacques in 1972: Carry On Matron, {{for which she}} was engaged in the title role, and Carry On Abroad, as Floella, the fiery Spanish cook at a half-finished hotel. As well as the film being Charles Hawtrey's last, it also marked a reduction in Jacques's screen time; she spent only one week filming her scenes. During post-production, the film's insurers became concerned about Jacques's deteriorating health. In {{a letter to the}} series producer Peter Rogers, they expressed their reluctance to <b>insure</b> her on set in any future film.|$|E
5|$|After Burger King Corporation {{lost the}} case, {{it decided to}} {{terminate}} its operations in the country, and in July 2002, the company transferred its assets to its New Zealand franchise group, Trans-Pacific Foods (TPF). The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises {{in the region as}} the Burger King brand's master franchisee. Trans-Pacific Foods administered the chain's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd to re-brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack's and make HJP the sole master franchisee of both brands. An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising support as to <b>insure</b> a common marketing scheme for the company and its products. Trans-Pacific Foods transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd, which subsequently renamed the remaining Burger King locations as Hungry Jack's.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to <b>insure</b> the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
5000|$|For instance, in vehicle {{insurance}} {{a typical}} Personal Auto Policy will cover {{not only the}} original named <b>insured</b> that purchased the auto policy, but will also cover additional persons while they are driving the auto with permission of the named <b>insured.</b> This is a simple type of blanket additional insurance arrangement, {{because it does not}} identify the additional <b>insured</b> by name, but by a [...] "blanket" [...] general description that will automatically apply to many persons. Similarly, in liability insurance, all directors, officers, and employees of a named <b>insured</b> company will also enjoy the status of being an <b>insured,</b> so long as they are acting in their capacity of carrying out the business of the named <b>insured</b> company. These persons enjoy <b>insured</b> status only while they pursue the business of the named <b>insured.</b> If they deviate to pursue their own affairs, they lose this extension of coverage. This extension of coverage to people with a constant and close relationship to the named <b>insured</b> company is accomplished via the [...] "Who Is An Insured" [...] section of the liability policy. In other cases, the original named <b>insured</b> wishes to extend coverage to others who would not come within these standard categories. To extend coverage further, Additional <b>Insured</b> Endorsements are added to the policy.|$|R
40|$|Germany has a {{two-tier system}} of {{statutory}} and primary private health insurance. Both insurance types provide fee-for-service insurance, but chargeable fees for identical services {{are more than}} twice as large for privately <b>insured</b> as for statutorily <b>insured</b> patients. Using German SOEP 2002 data, I analyze the effect of insurance status on the insured's number of doctor visits. Conditional on health, privately <b>insured</b> patients are less likely to contact a physician than publicly <b>insured</b> but more frequently visit a doctor following a first contact. This is indirect evidence for the hypothesis that physicians over-treat privately <b>insured</b> patients at least relative to the statutorily <b>insured.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the season}} started, however, Orr {{underwent}} another surgery on September 20, 1975. The Bruins' contract talks with Orr and Eagleson became difficult. The Bruins' insurer would not <b>insure</b> {{a contract with}} Orr and doctors advised the Bruins that Orr {{would not be able}} to play much longer. Orr returned to the lineup on November 8, 1975, the day after the Bruins traded Esposito to the New York Rangers. Orr was able to play the next ten games for the team but had to stop on November 28 due to pain in his knee. The next day, he underwent another knee surgery. Originally expected to only be out for seven to eight weeks, his knee did not respond to therapy and he returned home to Parry Sound. His season was over after ten games and he would not play again for the Bruins. His impending free agency led to speculation that the Bruins would trade him, but despite his injury, they were negotiating to keep him until the end.|$|E
5|$|Further controversies have {{occurred}} {{because of the}} company's involvement in the Middle East. The opening of a Burger King location in the Israeli-occupied territories led to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise; the dispute eventually erupted into a geopolitical conflagration involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law. The case eventually elicited reactions from {{the members of the}} 22-nation Arab League; the Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King's business licenses within the member states' territories. A second issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of Canon Law, Shariah, regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity, and, with the former example, posed a larger question about the lengths that companies must go to <b>insure</b> the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of capital or non-indemnity insurance, the insurer {{undertakes}} to pay to the <b>insured</b> a specified amount, or periodical amounts, upon the happening of the event <b>insured</b> against: for example, R5,000 if the <b>insured</b> dies or loses a limb.

5|$|Jourdan's {{orders were}} to take the army into Germany and secure {{strategic}} positions, particularly on the roads through Stockach and Schaffhausen, at the western-most border of Lake Constance. Similarly, as commander of the Army of Helvetia, André Masséna would acquire strategic positions in Switzerland, in particular the St. Gotthard Pass, the passes above Feldkirch, particularly Maienfeld (St. Luciensteig), and hold the central plateau in and around Zürich and Winterthur. These positions would prevent the Allies of the Second Coalition from moving troops {{back and forth between}} the northern Italian and German theaters, and <b>insure</b> French access to these strategic passes. Ultimately, this positioning would allow the French to control all western roads leading to and from Vienna. Finally, to complete Vienna's isolation, the army of Mayence would sweep through the north, blocking further access to and from Vienna from any of the northern Provinces, or from Britain.|$|E
5|$|MIGA offers {{insurance}} to cover five types of non-commercial risks: currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction; government expropriation; war, terrorism, and civil disturbance; breaches of contract; and the non-honoring of financial obligations. MIGA will cover investments such as equity, loans, shareholder loans, and shareholder loan guarantees. The agency may also <b>insure</b> investments such as management contracts, asset securitization, bonds, leasing activities, franchise agreements, and license agreements. The agency generally offers insurance coverage lasting up to 15 {{years with a}} possible five-year extension depending on a given project's nature and circumstances. When an event occurs that is protected by the insurance, MIGA can exercise the investor's rights against the host country through subrogation to recover expenses associated with covering the claim. However, the agency's convention does not require member governments to treat foreign investments in any special way. As a multilateral institution, MIGA is also {{in a position to}} attempt to sort out potential disputes before they ever turn into insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} Soviet protest {{was issued}} on 17 February 1965 {{in a letter}} to the Norwegian government. Specifically, it stated that Norway would be violating Article 9 of the Svalbard Treaty, that the installation could be used for intelligence assessment and that Norway should have consulted the Soviet Union before making the decision. The issue was discussed by the Norwegian Cabinet of State six days later. Minister of Justice and acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Oscar Christian Gundersen regarded the protest as moderate and that it fell into a series of Soviet protests against any activity on Svalbard that could remotely be considered a potential cover-up for military activity. An official response was sent on 23 March, which rejected all the Soviet objections. It stated that Norwegian authorities had made agreements with ESRO that Norway would make sufficient inspections to <b>insure</b> that Article 9 was followed, it pointed out the open and civil nature of ESRO and rejected the Soviet claims that they had the right to be consulted in advance.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, {{after paying}} out under {{a policy of}} {{indemnity}} insurance, an insurer may be entitled to sue the <b>insured</b> where the <b>insured</b> has already made good his loss. That is, the insurer has a claim against the <b>insured</b> so as {{to ensure that the}} <b>insured</b> does not get double recovery. This situation might arise if, for example, an <b>insured</b> claimed in full under the policy, but then started proceedings against the third party tortfeasor, and recovered substantial damages. Strictly speaking, this is not a case of subrogation; it is a case of recoupment.|$|R
50|$|The {{individual}} or legal entity is authorized to represent an <b>insured</b> {{party in the}} purchase, servicing, and maintenance of insurance coverage with a designated insurer. The majority of insurance companies will not disclose any information or discuss an <b>insured</b> party's account with any agent other than the duly appointed agent of record. An <b>insured</b> party wishing to change insurance agent(s) must submit a revised agent of record letter to the respective insurer authorizing said insurer to release the <b>insured</b> party's information and to discuss the <b>insured</b> party's coverage with the newly appointed agent.|$|R

5|$|We {{shall not}} feel that the generalization, {{unqualified}} and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its context {{to compete with the}} scientific and philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' has precisely the same status, and the same justification as Shakespeare's 'Ripeness is all.' It is a speech 'in character' and supported by a dramatic context. To conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair to the complexity of the problem of truth in art nor fair to Keats's little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least <b>insure</b> our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which it is really relevant to literature.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1990, the U.S. {{intervened in}} the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm. During that intervention, Fort Lewis {{deployed}} 34 active and 25 reserve component units to Saudi Arabia. I Corps {{also contributed to}} the command structure, with the I Corps Commander, LTG Calvin A. H. Waller and the Deputy I Corps Commander, MG Paul R. Schwartz, assisting General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the Commander of the American Forces. I Corps expanded its contingency missions and became a quick-response corps. For several months, I Corps was the nation's worldwide contingency corps, while the XVIII Airborne Corps was engaged in the Gulf War. This caused a good deal of activity on Fort Lewis, as the post restructured itself to support the corps' new mission, and to <b>insure</b> that it had a smooth, rapid departure in case they were needed anywhere in the world. This duty was returned to XVIII Airborne Corps upon its return to the United States. The corps then began to convert to a permanently structured, no-mobilization contingency corps and was placed under the operational control of the United States Army Forces Command. This entailed the addition of a number of active component corps units.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1999, Color Air {{terminated}} all {{flights and}} ceased operations. Sunde {{stated that he}} regretted having started the airline, {{and said that he}} had overestimated the synergies between his ferry company and the airline, but also underestimated the price elasticity for business travel. In particular, the frequent flyer programs that SAS and Braathens had made it difficult to convince corporate travelers to switch to Color Air. Sunde believed that the company would continue to lose money in 2000. 220 employees lost their jobs, while Color Group estimated it lost NOK400 million on the airline. There were discussions concerning cooperation with, or a take-over by, British Airways, but these discussions did not lead to an agreement. In total, Color Air flew 430,000 passengers, effectively subsidizing each passenger with almost NOK1000. The company was not declared bankrupt, as Sunde wanted to <b>insure</b> his good reputation by paying everyone he owed money. While this was about NOK10 million in airport fees and smaller sums to other parties, the largest creditors were the two aircraft leasing companies, to whom NOK270 million was owed {{for the rest of the}} rental period. The 20,000 people who had tickets with Color Air were all rebooked onto Braathens flights. After NOK170 million in debt was registered by the company, and assets were only worth NOK17 million, Color Air was declared bankrupt on 10 November 1999.|$|E
