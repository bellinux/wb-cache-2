50|$|Shellite (known as Tridite in US service) is an {{explosive}} mixture of Picric acid and Dinitrophenol or Picric acid and <b>Hexanitrodiphenylamine</b> in {{a ratio of}} 70/30.

50|$|Hexanit was a {{castable}} German military explosive developed {{early in}} the 20th century before the First World War for the Kaiserliche Marine, intended to augment supplies of trinitrotoluene (TNT), which were then in short supply. Hexanite is significantly more powerful than TNT on its own. The most common hexanite formula (by weight) was 60% TNT and 40% <b>hexanitrodiphenylamine.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis gives a {{literature}} {{survey of the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of dipicrylamine (2, 4, 6, 2 ', 4 ', 6 ' <b>hexanitrodiphenylamine),</b> its synthesis and analysis, and its use in a process for the recovery of potassium from seawater and brines. Where data is not available in the literature it is obtained by experiment. The published and experimental data are used for the design of a process using dipicrylamine for the recovery of potassium and an analysis of its economic viability. Four process steps are identified and examined. These are (i) the precipitation of the potassium salt of dipicrylamine (KDPA) from seawater or brines, (ii) the recovery of dipicrylamine from the spent seawater or brine, (iii) the conversion of KDPA to produce a potassium salt and the insoluble hydrogen form of dipicrylamine (HDPA) by reaction with an acid and (iv) the conversion of HDPA to a soluble form for recycling and reuse. It is concluded that the recovery of potassium from seawater and brines is technically viable. While the brine process is economically viable at present, the large flowrates found in process step (ii) limit the viability of the seawater process...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} {{technical}} process for the remediation of soil contaminated with the explosives Hexyl (<b>Hexanitrodiphenylamine),</b> RDX (Hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -Triazine) and 2, 4, 6 -TNT for the former ammunition plant - WASAG-Torgau/Elsnig in Saxony. Methods were developed for the chemical analyses of the explosives Hexyl and RDX in contaminated water and soil samples. Existing ecotoxicological test methods were proofed to describe the ecotoxic potential of Hexyl and RDS. The high sensitive luminescent test with Vibrio fischeri was selected to complement the chemical analyses and can be used for risk assesment and remediation control. The developed technology of bioremediation is based on a combination of aerobic/anaerobic stages. The infiltration of nutrients - especially molasses -into contaminated soil is a necessity, because Hexyl and RDX did not serve as solely energy and carbon source. The high with different explosives contaminated soil (#SIGMA# explosives 5 500 mg/kg) was bioremediated. Under optimized conditions the original concentrations of TNT, Hexyl and RDX were reduced by 95 %, 77 % and 82 % within 10 months. The remediation is not specifically for one substance. The clean-up capacity is correlated with the concentration of the molasses. Bioremediation is attended by a reduction of ecotoxicological effects. (orig.)
