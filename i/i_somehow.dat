500|$|Marcel Proust knew Fauré, and the Ballade {{is thought}} to have been the {{inspiration}} for the sonata by Proust's character Vinteuil that haunts Swann in In Search of Lost Time. [...] Debussy, reviewing an early performance of the Ballade, compared the music with the attractive soloist, straightening her shoulder-straps during the performance: [...] "I don't know why, but <b>I</b> <b>somehow</b> associated the charm of these gestures with the music of Fauré himself. The play of fleeting curves that is its essence can be compared to the movements of a beautiful woman without either suffering from the comparison." [...] Morrison describes the Ballade as [...] "a reminder of halcyon, half-remembered summer days and bird-haunted forests".|$|E
500|$|As the Rangers {{designated}} hitter, {{he led the}} AL in on-base plus slugging with a [...]999 mark. He {{was third}} in batting average (.321), and {{led the league in}} on-base percentage (.443). On making the All-Star game, he stated, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>somehow</b> miraculously made it to the All-Star Game, I would be floored. I'd really be totally humbled by that. I'm just happy right now to play, to produce and to be with a good group of guys." [...] He was selected to play in his first All-Star Game in 2008 as a designated hitter (DH) after being officially selected as a DH reserve, but due to an injury to David Ortiz he became the starting DH in the 2008 MLB All-Star Game.|$|E
2500|$|In For Love Not Money former Australian flanker Simon Poidevin recalls that, [...] "Campo made {{a sensational}} midfield break, gave {{to me and}} [...] Burke loomed up {{alongside}} me with their fullback Hugo MacNeill the only guy to beat. Burke was on my right, my bad passing side, and as I drew MacNeill <b>I</b> <b>somehow</b> threw the ball forward to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{was above}} all {{influenced}} by Odd Man Out (1947) - [...] "I still {{consider it as}} one of the best movies I've ever seen and a film which made me want to pursue this career more than anything else... I always dreamt of doing things of this sort or that style. To a certain extent I must say that <b>I</b> <b>somehow</b> perpetuate the ideas of that movie in what I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{had avoided}} taking on {{official}} posts which would take valuable time, turning down William Whewell's request that he become Secretary of the Geological Society with excuses including [...] "anything which flurries me completely knocks me up afterwards and brings {{on a bad}} palpitation of the heart", but in January 1838 he accepted the post. On 7 March he read to the Society his longest paper yet, which explained the earthquake he had witnessed at Concepción, Chile, in terms of gradual crustal movements, {{to the delight of}} Lyell. Despite hours of practice, as he later recalled; [...] "I was so nervous at first, <b>I</b> <b>somehow</b> could see nothing all around me, & felt as if my body was gone, & only my head left".|$|E
2500|$|I {{find that}} I am [...] "intermediate" [...] between God and nothingness, between the supreme entity and nonentity. Insofar as I am the {{creation}} of the supreme entity, there's nothing in me to account for my being deceived or led into error, but, inasmuch as <b>I</b> <b>somehow</b> participate in nothing or nonentity — that is, insofar as I am distinct from the supreme entity itself and lack many things — it's not surprising that I go wrong. I thus understand that, in itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I understand that I can err without God's having given me a special ability to do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the truth is not infinite. [...] (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. We can. I can. But I {{wanted to}} see you,--before <b>I</b> did. <b>Somehow</b> <b>I</b> don't feel lonely with you. I had to see you.... It's good to see you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sometime {{between the}} ages of seven and nine, Handel {{accompanied}} his father to Weissenfels where he came under the notice of one whom Handel thereafter always regarded throughout life as his benefactor, Duke Johann Adolf <b>I.</b> <b>Somehow</b> Handel {{made his way to the}} court organ, where he surprised everyone with his playing. Overhearing this performance and noting the youth of the performer caused the Duke (whose suggestions were not to be disregarded by a burgher, especially an ambitious court appointee) to recommend to Georg Händel that Handel be given musical instruction. Handel's father engaged the organist at the Halle parish church, the young Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow, to instruct Handel. Zachow would be the only teacher that Handel ever had. Because of his church employment, Zachow was an organist [...] "of the old school", reveling in fugues, canons and counterpoint. But he was also familiar with developments in music across Europe and his own compositions [...] "embraced the new concerted, dramatic style". When Zachow discovered the talent of Handel, he introduced him [...] "to a vast collection of German and Italian music, which he possessed, sacred and profane, vocal and instrumental compositions of different schools, different styles, and of every master". Many traits considered [...] "Handelian" [...] can be traced back to Zachow's music. At the same time Handel continued practice on the harpsichord, learned violin and organ, but according to Burney his special affection was for the hautbois (oboe). Schoelcher speculates that his youthful devotion to the instrument explains the large number of pieces he composed for oboe.|$|E

6000|$|... "'It is no joke,' Kaluna said abruptly. I looked murder at him, and I felt murder, too. But I {{dared not}} speak or strike. That would have precipitated the {{catastrophe}} which <b>I</b> <b>somehow</b> had a mad hope of still averting.|$|E
