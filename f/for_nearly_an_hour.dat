5|$|The A-10's {{durability}} {{was shown}} on 7 April 2003 when Captain Kim Campbell, while flying over Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, suffered extensive flak damage. Iraqi fire damaged {{one of her}} engines and crippled the hydraulic system, requiring the aircraft's stabilizer and flight controls to be operated via the 'manual reversion mode'. Despite this damage, Campbell flew the aircraft <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and landed safely.|$|E
5|$|The most {{destructive}} {{of the weather}} events, an EF4 tornado, traveled <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> through four counties in Oklahoma during the evening of February10. It destroyed 114residences in Lone Grove alone. All casualties (8 deaths and 46 injuries) from the outbreak were due to the tornado in the Lone Grove area in Carter County. It was the deadliest tornado to hit Oklahoma since May3, 1999 and the strongest tornado {{during the month of}} February in Oklahoma since 1950.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{withering}} fire, Klenau's force reached Essling's edge, {{where his}} men set up 64 artillery pieces and bombarded the French <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Taking the village by storm, Austrian cavalry {{poured into the}} village from the north, and the French were pushed out in a methodical advance. Klenau's batteries were able to fire on the French-held bridges south of the village, over which the French had to retreat. In bitter house-to-house fighting, the Austrians entered the village. Combat at the granary was especially brutal, as Hungarian grenadiers battled unsuccessfully to dislodge the French from their positions {{in the second and}} third floors. The battle resumed at dawn of 22 April. Masséna cleared Aspern of Austrians, but while he did so, Rosenberg's force stormed Jean Lannes' position at Essling. Lannes, reinforced by Vincent Saint-Hilaire's division, subsequently drove Rosenberg out of Essling. At Aspern, Masséna was driven out by Hiller and Bellegarde's counter-attacks.|$|E

5|$|The BPF {{returned}} to action on 12 May and no Japanese aircraft were seen or detected that {{day or the}} next. One of Formidables Avengers made a successful landing aboard Indomitable with only one landing gear leg extended and no flaps on 13 May. The BPF continued its routine of two days of operations alternating {{with one or two}} days to replenish its ships for the next several days with minimal interference by the Japanese. On the morning of 18 May, armourers were loading ammunition into aircraft when a Corsair's guns were accidentally fired into an Avenger, which caught fire. The overhead fire sprinklers were immediately turned on, but the fire could not be extinguished <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> not least because the electric motors driving the steel fire curtains had been damaged in the first kamikaze attack and could only be repaired by a dockyard. Twenty-one Corsairs and seven Avengers were either damaged or destroyed in the incident. Rawlings decided to detach Formidable early to give her extra time for repairs in Sydney and she was ordered to depart on 22 May.|$|E
5|$|While Smith was {{attending}} junior high school, his parents divorced. Continuing {{to pursue his}} interest in baseball, he would ride the bus <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to reach Dodger Stadium, cheering for the Los Angeles Dodgers at about 25 games a year. Upon becoming a student at Locke High School, Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams. Smith was a teammate of future National Basketball Association player Marques Johnson on the basketball team, and a teammate of future fellow Hall-of-Fame player Eddie Murray on the baseball side. After high school Smith attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to walk-on to the baseball team. In addition to his academic education, he learned to switch-hit from Cal Poly coach Berdy Harr. When Cal Poly's starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith subsequently took over the starting role. Later named an All-American athlete, he established school records in career at bats (754) and career stolen bases (110) before graduating in 1977.|$|E
25|$|On May 11, 2007, {{authorities}} {{released a}} surveillance video from the Orlando International Airport terminal purporting to show Nowak waiting <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> {{standing near the}} baggage claim, then donning a trench coat and later following Shipman after she retrieved her bags.|$|E

25|$|At this point, Washington and Greene {{arrived with}} {{reinforcements}} {{to try to}} hold off the British, who now occupied Meeting House Hill. The remains of Sullivan's men held off the pursuing British <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> but were eventually forced to retreat. The Americans were also forced to leave behind most of their cannon on Meeting House Hill {{because most of the}} artillery horses were killed.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{few days}} later on the early morning of April 29, while the entire nation was {{watching}} the Cricket World Cup Final a Tiger aircraft bombed two fuel storage facilities outside Colombo. Chaos followed and electricity in the capital was shut off <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> There were no casualties and minimal damage.

25|$|Air traffic {{controllers}} {{had not noticed}} the disappearance from radar. Emergency services only {{became aware of the}} accident after 15minutes and did not know the circumstances <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> First on the scene was a nurse living nearby, who had been alerted by the boys, and an ambulance crew that happened to be driving past. A male passenger who had survived the accident was discovered in the aircraft cabin, but died on arrival at Ashford Hospital without recovering consciousness. A young girl was also found alive but died at the scene; there were no other survivors. Altogether, 30 ambulances and 25 fire engines attended the accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} {{company had}} anticipated {{the possibility of}} a robbery, and had moved the gold to another train, putting in its place several armed messengers to guard the express car including Bud Ledbetter, Paden Tolbert, Sid Johnson, Frank Jones. When Reed and the others approached the express car, he called for the messengers to leave the car. When they refused, Reed and Root took cover behind some trees and began shooting into the car. The messengers returned fire, resulting in a gunfight that lasted <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Eventually one of Reed's men was killed; Reed jumped onto the train and went through the passenger cars forcing passengers to put their valuables into a sack before he and his gang fled.|$|E
25|$|The SWAT team {{started to}} {{surround}} the bus at 7:37pm. The policemen attempted <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> {{to enter the}} bus, first by breaking its Plexi glass windows with sledgehammers, pulling {{the door with a}} rope attached to a police vehicle but it snapped. After running out of choices, they threw two canisters of tear gas inside and Mendoza stepped out of the bus. Snipers, who had taken positions earlier in the day, ultimately shot Mendoza in the head after he exited the bus, killing him instantly. By that time, however, four more hostages were confirmed dead, while only six hostages were confirmed alive and not seriously injured. Two other people outside the bus — 47-year-old TVB news crew engineer Wen Ming, and child bystander Mike Ladrillo y Campanero — were wounded by stray bullets.|$|E

25|$|Amritsar — At 17:45 hrs, four Mirages {{flying from}} Sargodha {{and led by}} Wing Commander Hakimullah {{attacked}} Amritsar AB. Hakimullah's flight was armed with two 500kg bombs each, which the strike used efficiently hitting the first 300m of the runway and cratering it enough to leave it nonoperational for several hours. However, the Amritsar runway was repaired within the same night to receive detachments of Mig 21s and Su-7 that flew against Rafiqui AB the next morning. A second strike of two F-104 Starfighters, led by Wing Commander Amjad H Khan hit the P-35 radar station at Amritsar, rendering it inoperational <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Two Sukhois then took off from the one remaining serviceable lane of the runway, moments before it was bombed by a passing B-57.|$|E
25|$|The 33rd Alabama {{began its}} advance about 10:00am in {{conjunction}} with the nearby 16th Alabama; when the latter regiment hit the ground after the first volley from the Union line, the 33rd continued to advance until they reached a small ravine, where they took cover <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> from the murderous Federal fire until ordered to move forward again. The two regiments moved to a point about 275yards from the Union line, when the 33rd was suddenly hit with horrendous artillery and rifle fire from its right flank. Completely bereft of support from either side, the 33rd continued to advance, ultimately doing something no other Confederate regiment in that sector managed to do: it crossed the La Fayette Road, General Bragg's main objective. However, it was forced to retreat almost as soon as it had done so, having lost 16 killed and 133 wounded out of the 219 men who had started the assault.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{fell across}} {{parts of the}} circuit in the second hour of the race and several cars were caught out by the change in conditions. The KCMG Oreca-Nissan driven by Richard Bradley, which had been trading the LMP2 lead with Jota Sport, hydroplaned into the first Mulsanne chicane and {{impacted}} the tire barriers heavily, while further up the Mulsanne several contenders in multiple classes {{were involved in a}} heavy accident. A group of LMGTE cars as well as the No. 3 Audi were slow on the course when they were approached by the No. 8 Toyota of Lapierre at a high rate of speed. Aquaplaning under braking, Lapierre spun amongst the group of cars and impacted the barriers head on. This was followed by Bird in the LMGTE Am-leading AF Corse Ferrari who drove into the rear of Bonanomi. The accident led to a safety car intervention, during which Lapierre was able to limp the Toyota back to the pit lane for repairs that lasted <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Bonanomi and Bird were unable to get their cars moving again and retired. Bradley was able to drive back to the pit lane for repairs and kept second place in LMP2.|$|E
