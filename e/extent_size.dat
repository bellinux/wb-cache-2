We show that many Formal Concept Analysis operations, computing the contingent and <b>extent</b> <b>sizes</b> {{as well as}} listing the matching objects, enjoy improved performance {{with the use of}} spatial indexing structures such as the RD-Tree. Speed improvements can vary up to eighty times faster depending on the data and query. The motivation for our study is the application of Formal Concept Analysis to Semantic File Systems. In such applications millions of formal objects must be dealt with. It has been found that spatial indexing also provides an effective indexing technique for more general purpose applications requiring scalability in Formal Concept Analysis systems. The coverage and benchmarking are presented with general applications in mind. ...|$|R

An {{alternative}} is to construct the hybrid structure where a small SSD partition is combined with the large HDD partition, to expand the file system space to HDD storage capacity while exploiting the performance advantage of SSD. In such a hybrid structure, increasing the space utilization of SSD partition is the critical aspect in generating high I/O performance. In this paper, we present HFM (Hybrid File Mapping) that has been implemented for the hybrid file system integrated with SSD. HFM enables to divide SSD partition into several, logical data sections with each composed of the different <b>extent</b> <b>size.</b> To minimize fragmentation overhead, HFM defines three different ways of partitioning functions based on the <b>extent</b> <b>size</b> of each data section. Furthermore, file allocations on the extent are performed on the partitioned unit (segment) of extents to reuse the remaining free space as much as possible. The experimental result of HFM using three public benchmarks shows that HFM can be effective in increasing the usage of SSD partition and enables to contribute to provide better I/O throughput...|$|E

40|$|Title of work: Model of {{cerebral}} focal cortical ischemia and its parametrization Work objectives: The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was {{to apply}} modified model of focal cortical brain ischemia induced by phototrombosis and subsequently determinate its parameters. Methods: Intravenous application of photosensitive Rose Bengal dye was followed by continual illumination of green laser beam over the left sensorimotocortex for 10 minutes. Following illumination, the dye is activated and produces singlet oxygen that damages components of endothelial cell membranes, with subsequent platelet aggregation and thrombin formation, which eventually determines the interruption of local blood flow. This approach, initially proposed by Rosenblum and El-Sabban in 1977, was later improved by Watson in 1985 in rat brain. For histological evaluation of ischemic brain damage, animals were overdosed with urethane and transcardially perfused. Results: Histological examination of brains showed significant ischemic damage in all experimental animals.

Their prognostic value, however, was much more meaningful when the three pathological factors were considered in relation to each other. As a matter of fact, the size of the tumour showed no predictive value when lymph node metastasis was present.

40|$|Stoichiometric {{relationships}} between consumers and resources in detritus-based ecosystems have received little attention, despite {{the importance of}} detritus in most food webs. We analysed carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) content of invertebrate consumers, and basal food resources in two forested headwater streams (one reference and the other nutrient-enriched). We found large elemental imbalances between consumers and food resources compared with living plant-based systems, particularly in regard to P content, which were reduced with enrichment. Enrichment significantly increased nutrient content of food resources (consistent with uptake of N and P by detritus-associated microbes). P content of some invertebrates also increased in the enriched vs. reference stream, suggesting deviation from strict homeostasis. Nutrient content varied significantly among invertebrate functional feeding groups, orders and, to some <b>extent,</b> <b>size</b> classes. Future application of stoichiometric theory to detritus-based systems should consider the potential for relatively large consumer-resource elemental imbalances and P storage by insect consumers...|$|E

The results indicate that banks suffer from relatively high cost and profit inefficiencies and that there are noticeable differences in the efficiency levels across countries.
