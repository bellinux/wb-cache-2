40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we use {{a simple}} {{discrete}} dynamical system to study integers partitions and their lattice. The set of reachable configurations <b>equiped</b> with the order induced by the transitions {{of the system is}} exactly the lattice of integer partitions <b>equiped</b> with the dominance ordering. We first explain how this lattice can be constructed, by showing its self-similarity property. Then, we define a natural extension of the system to infinity. Using a self-similar tree, we obtain an efficient coding of the obtained lattice. This approach gives an interesting recursive formula for the number of partitions of an integer, where no closed formula have ever been found. It also gives informations on special sets of partitions, such as length bounded partitions. ...|$|E

In which, the system kinetic energy and potential energy are used as information source to makeup information entropy function, then, a theoretical analysis of system transient stability is conducted. Based on this, simulations are carried out in IEEE 5 -machine 14 -bus system compared with the time domain’s, which verified the consistency of information entropy energy function (IEEF) method and time domain analysis.
