60|$|All {{this had}} {{happened}} with such swiftness that I had stood motionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise.</b> But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Barker, I {{thank you}} for what you said to me last night. You were right and I was wrong. I was ungrateful, and ungenerous. I can only say that it was a very sore subject, and that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> I thought of the past, and not the present. Believe me, I am very sorry for what I said." ...|$|E
6000|$|I scanned it <b>in</b> haste. To <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> and delight, a pencilled entry half-way {{down the}} list gave the name, [...] "Professor Sebastian." ...|$|R
60|$|James Ballantyne came <b>in,</b> to <b>my</b> <b>surprise,</b> {{about twelve}} o'clock. He was very serious, and spoke {{as if he}} had some idea of sudden and speedy death. He {{mentioned}} that he had named Cadell, Cowan, young Hughes, and his brother to be his trustees with myself. He has settled to go to the country, poor fellow, to Timpendean, as I think.|$|R
6000|$|We {{had taken}} the last turn. <b>My</b> cottage was <b>in</b> sight. To <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> a man was {{standing}} there as though waiting. He turned round as we approached. His face was very pale, {{and the back of}} his head was bandaged. He carried his arm, too, in a sling. It was Colonel Mostyn Ray! ...|$|R
6000|$|His appearance, as I saw {{him then}} and on many other {{occasions}} in the furze-flowering season, is fully {{described in a}} chapter in this book; but on this particular occasion while watching my bird I saw it {{in a new and}} unexpected aspect, and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> and delight I exclaimed mentally, [...] "Now I have seen the furze wren at his very best!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> I {{almost forgot}} the Mexican. Then I {{thought that if}} Dick were there the Mexican {{would be likely to}} have {{troubles}} of his own. I remembered Dick's reputation as a fighter. But suppose I did not find Dick at the sawmill? This part of the forest was probably owned by private individuals, for I couldn't imagine Government timber being cut in this fashion. So I tied Hal and the pony amidst a thick clump of young pines, and, leaving all my outfit except my revolver, I struck out across the slash.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} I stood transfixed. Then I made a hasty step {{to look over}} the verge of the rock. But <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> at his {{disappearance}} I forgot once more that we were on the moon. The thrust of my foot that I made in striding would have carried me a yard on earth; on the moon it carried me six--a good five yards over the edge. For the moment the thing had something of the effect of those nightmares when one falls and falls. For while one falls sixteen feet in the first second of a fall on earth, on the moon one falls two, and with only a sixth of one's weight. I fell, or rather I jumped down, about ten yards I suppose. It seemed to take quite a long time, five or six seconds, I should think. I floated through the air and fell like a feather, knee-deep in a snow-drift {{in the bottom of a}} gully of blue-gray, white-veined rock.|$|E
6000|$|A quiet little laugh, with a [...] "That'll be all right, Captain," [...] was his answer. All this, words, intonation, the glimpsed {{attitude}} {{of the man in}} the cuddy, had an unexpected character, a something friendly <b>in</b> it--propitiatory. And <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> was not diminished thereby. What did this call mean? Was it the sign of some dark design against my commercial innocence? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>my</b> rooms a <b>surprise</b> awaited me. Felicia was there, walking nervously up {{and down}} my little sitting-room She stopped short as I entered and came swiftly towards me. In the joy of seeing her so {{unexpectedly}} I would have taken her into my arms, but she shrank back.|$|R
60|$|So great was my delight {{at seeing}} Jacob slowly {{working his way}} into the lodge, that there was no room <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart for <b>surprise.</b> I entirely forgot to be {{astonished}} because after so long a time he had returned, or to question why it was he dared venture within the encampment.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood on}} the boxes while I faced the trunk, and was gently raising me when Challenger sprang forward and gave me such a thrust with his huge hand that he fairly shot me into the tree. With both arms {{clasping}} the branch, I scrambled hard with my feet until I had worked, first my body, and then my knees, onto it. There were three excellent off-shoots, like huge rungs of a ladder, above my head, and a tangle of convenient branches beyond, so that I clambered onwards with such speed that I soon {{lost sight of the}} ground and had nothing but foliage beneath me. Now and then I encountered a check, and once I had to shin up a creeper for eight or ten feet, but I made excellent progress, and the booming of Challenger's voice seemed to be a great distance beneath me. The tree was, however, enormous, and, looking upwards, I could see no thinning of the leaves above my head. There was some thick, bush-like clump which seemed to be a parasite upon a branch up which I was swarming. I leaned my head round it in order to see what was beyond, and I nearly fell out of the tree <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> and horror at what I saw.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{service was}} by no means a slight one," [...] the young count said, {{returning}} a deep salute that Agnes and Charlie made to him, [...] "unless indeed you consider that my life is a valueless one, for assuredly without his aid and that of your tall retainer, my father would have been childless this morning. I was indeed in sore plight when they arrived; my arm was tiring, and I could not have defended myself very much longer against such odds, and as I had exasperated them by killing two of their comrades, I should have received no mercy at their hands. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> at being so suddenly attacked I even forgot to raise a shout for the watch, though it is hardly likely that they would have heard me had I done so; the lazy knaves are never on the spot when they are wanted. However, we gave the ruffians a lesson that those of them who escaped are not likely to forget readily, for out of the fourteen who attacked me we accounted for ten, of whom your retainer levelled no less than six with that staff of his, and I doubt whether any of the other four came off scatheless. I imagine that those levelled by your retainer got up and made off,--that is, if they recovered their senses before the watch came,--but I am sure that the other four will never steal pouch or cut throat in future. 'Tis a shame that these rascals are suffered to interfere with honest men, and it would be far better if the city authorities would turn their attention to ridding the streets of these pests instead of meddling with things that in no way concern them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am glad, then, I didn’t laugh. And I am also glad I {{said nothing}} more. I was feeling so little generous that if I had known {{something}} then of his mother’s allusion to ‘white geese’ I would have {{advised him to}} get one of them and lead it away on a beautiful blue ribbon. Mrs. Blunt was wrong, you know, to be so scornful. A white goose is exactly what her son wants. But look how badly the world is arranged. Such white birds cannot be got for nothing and he has not enough money even to buy a ribbon. Who knows! Maybe it was this which gave that tragic quality to his pose by the mantelpiece over there. Yes, that was it. Though no doubt I didn’t see it then. As he didn’t offer to move after I had done speaking I became quite unaffectedly sorry and advised him very gently to dismiss me from his mind definitely. He moved forward then and said to me in his usual voice and with his usual smile {{that it would have been}} excellent advice but unfortunately I was one of those women who can’t be dismissed at will. And as I shook my head he insisted rather darkly: ‘Oh, yes, Doña Rita, it is so. Cherish no illusions about that fact.’ It sounded so threatening that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> I didn’t even acknowledge his parting bow. He went out of that false situation like a wounded man retreating after a fight. No, I have nothing to reproach myself with. I did nothing. I led him into nothing. Whatever illusions have passed through my head I kept my distance, and he was so loyal to what he seemed to think the redeeming proprieties of the situation that he has gone from me for good without so much as kissing the tips of my fingers. He must have felt like a man who had betrayed himself for nothing. It’s horrible. It’s the fault of that enormous fortune of mine, and I wish with all my heart that I could give it to him; for he couldn’t help his hatred of the thing that is: and as to his love, which is just as real, well—could I have rushed away from him to shut myself up in a convent? Could I? After all I have a right to my share of daylight.” ...|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (joyously). No--not long--now that I'm {{happy for}} once <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. I'll <b>surprise</b> you, Stephen, the way I'll {{pick up and}} grow fat and healthy. You won't know me in a month. How can you ever love such a skinny homely thing as I am now! (With a laugh.) I couldn't if I was a man--love such a fright.|$|R

"I {{had never}} heard of it," [...] she acknowledged, [...] "but I am not <b>in</b> anyway <b>surprised.</b> <b>My</b> father spends at least an hour of every day, when he is down at Hatch End, amongst the horses, and every time a fresh crock is brought down, he is as {{interested}} {{as though it were a}} new toy." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{described}} the match with great interest, for my heart warmed towards the chief actor and his family, and as I proceeded with the narration I observed with some satisfaction {{that the road}} we were following led {{in the direction of}} the cottage of Dobri Petroff. As we drew near to the path that diverged to it I resolved, if possible, to give Nicholas, who was evidently interested <b>in</b> <b>my</b> narrative, a <b>surprise</b> by confronting him unexpectedly with the blacksmith and his family.|$|R
6000|$|There was an {{instantaneous}} convulsion <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cousin's face, and I distinctly {{heard him}} gnash his teeth at this reply; but, to <b>my</b> <b>surprise,</b> he resumed <b>in</b> tones of almost good-humour: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>surprise</b> at hearing <b>my</b> {{own name}} {{correctly}} given was only equaled by the admiration I also felt for my companion's complete and absolute assurance. Mr. Cullen and I exchanged a perfunctory handshake, which left me without any change <b>in</b> <b>my</b> feelings toward him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Frenchman," [...] said he. He {{held his}} blood-stained {{knife in his}} great, hairy hand, and I read in his fierce eyes that he only looked for some excuse in order to plunge it into my heart. Resistance was useless. I {{followed}} without a word. I was led up the stone stair and back into that gorgeous chamber in which I had left the secret tribunal. I was ushered <b>in,</b> but to <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> it was not on me that their attention was fixed. One of their own number, a tall, dark young man, was standing before them and was pleading with them in low, earnest tones. His voice quivered with anxiety and his hands darted in and out or writhed together in an agony of entreaty. [...] "You cannot do it! You cannot do it!" [...] he cried.|$|R
6000|$|Remember me to all. I will {{endeavour}} to bear my miseries patiently. A person <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{state of}} health should not have such miseries to bear. Write a short note to my sister, saying you have heard from me. Severn is very well. If I were in better health I would urge your coming to Rome. I fear {{there is no one}} can give me any comfort. Is there any news of George? O that something fortunate had ever happened to me or my brothers!--then I might hope,--but despair is forced upon me as a habit. My dear Brown, for my sake be her advocate for ever. I cannot say a word about Naples; I do not feel at all concerned in the thousand novelties around me. I am afraid to write to her--I should like her to know that I do not forget her. Oh, Brown I have coals of fire <b>in</b> <b>my</b> breast--It <b>surprises</b> me that the human heart is capable of containing and bearing so much misery. Was I born for this end? God bless her, and her mother, and my sister, and George, and his wife, and you, and all! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have always}} {{considered}} {{the power of}} self-control {{as one of the}} strongest points <b>in</b> <b>my</b> character. For the future I shall be more humble. When I heard that name, <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> so completely mastered me that I sat self-betrayed to Dr. Wybrow as the man who could answer his question.|$|R
60|$|There {{was little}} sleep {{for me that}} night. I passed {{most of the time}} in smoking and walking up and down the room. My one relief was afforded by Traveler--he begged so hard to go to London with me, I could not resist him. The dog always sleeps <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room. His <b>surprise</b> at <b>my</b> {{extraordinary}} restlessness (ending in downright anxiety and alarm) was expressed in his eyes, and in his little whinings and cries, quite as intelligibly as if he had put his meaning into words. Who first called a dog a dumb creature? It must have been a man, I think--and a thoroughly unlovable man, too, from a dog's point of view.|$|R

If I make any mistake correct me at once. Well, this is the story, Hawtrey. I need not tell you it would never have passed my lips, except at Dorothy's request. A short time since, a {{fortnight}} or three weeks, I cannot tell you the day exactly, my servant brought me up word that a lady wished to see me. She had given no name, but I supposed it was one of these charity collecting women, so I told her to show her <b>in.</b> To <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> it was Miss Dorothy. After shaking hands she sat down, and to my astonishment burst into tears. It was some time before I could pacify her, and get her to tell me what was the matter; then {{she told me that she}} had got into a dreadful scrape, that she dared not tell you, that it would be ruin to her, and that she had come to me as one of her oldest friends, to ask me if I could help her to get out of it.|$|R
60|$|We met {{as usual}} at the breakfast-table. <b>My</b> {{housekeeper}} brought <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{letters of the}} morning.

The Executive Secretary was the widely respected Charles L. Goodell. Dr Goodell saw in Jesse a successor {{for himself in}} his retirement so proposed that he be invited to become his associate. Samuel McCrea Cavert, General Secretary of the Federal Council was {{to discuss it with}} Jesse and writes of his surprise at Jesse's hesitation. [...] "I still have vivid memories of my conversation with him at a long-drawn-out breakfast in the Severin Hotel <b>in</b> Indianapolis. To <b>my</b> <b>surprise,</b> he had some hesitation in accepting the invitation. He needed assurance that the Federal Council would give evangelism enough emphasis to provide the best base for his enthusiasm. He was, however, quick to see the future possibilities in the united program that the Council could develop as an official agency of cooperating churches.' (Herald of the Evangel, p 18.) ...|$|R
60|$|Much to <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> {{he pressed}} eagerly for {{permission}} to go as messenger, saying that above all else he desired to see the encampment so he might compare our troops with those {{under the command of}} General Gage, and, knowing he could make the journey as well or even better than I, there was no reason <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind why he should not undertake the venture.|$|R
