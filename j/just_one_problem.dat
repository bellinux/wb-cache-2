40|$|Fluorides and arsenic {{are part}} of a group of {{necessary}} elements for life, but founded in excess may be harmful for health. At low levels are required to maintain the resistance of teeth and perform the physiological functions of living beings. The fact of being chemical elements of easy obtainment and required for industries, has nowadays originated that many countries have troubles with the presence of both chemical substances in big drinking water concentrations. This fact, added to the natural existence of these elements in the crust, has caused endemic illnesses in countries such as Tanzania, China or Taiwan, among others. To try to counteract these health problems, OMS recommended not to exceed 1, 5 ppm and 100 ppb in the fluorides and arsenic concentration for water intake. The project proposal is the research of a titanium dioxide sorbent, named by the commercial classification of Adsorbsia As 600, for the decrease of both analytes in waters with concentration higher than the recommended. The adsorption proves show a high efficiency in the elimination of fluorides, As (III) and As (V). This refers to a quite selective removal technique, with <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>problem</b> generated by the interferences of bicarbonate and silicates in the titanium dioxide particles, that consequently decrease the adsorption capacity of fluorides by the sorbent.

40|$|AbstractThe {{plane stress}} sectorial domain is {{analysed}} {{according to a}} state-space formulation of the linear theory of elasticity. When loading {{is applied to the}} straight radial edges (flanks), with the circular arcs free of traction, one has the curved beam; when loading is applied to the circular arcs, with the flanks free of traction, one has the elastic wedge. A complete treatment of <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>problem</b> (the elastic wedge, say) requires two state-space formulations; the first describes radial evolution for the transmission of the stress resultants (force and moment), while the second describes circumferential evolution for determination of the rates of decay of self-equilibrated loading on the circular arcs, as anticipated by Saint-Venant’s principle. These two formulations can be employed subsequently for the curved beam, where now radial evolution is employed for the Saint-Venant decay problem, and circumferential evolution for the transmission modes. Power-law radial dependence is employed for the wedge, and is quite adequate except for treatment of the so-called wedge paradox; for this, and the curved beam, the formulations are modified so that lnr takes the place of the radial coordinate r. The analysis is characterised by a preponderance of repeating eigenvalues for the transmission modes, and the state-space formulation allows a systematic approach for determination of the eigen- and principal vectors. The so-called wedge paradox is related to accidental eigenvalue degeneracy for a particular angle, and its resolution involves a principal vector describing the bending moment coupled to a decay eigenvector. Restrictions on repeating eigenvalues and possible Jordan canonical forms are developed. Finally, symplectic orthogonality relationships are derived from the reciprocal theorem...|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century the pulp industry in Sweden faced major problems with waste. Pine and spruce contain at the best 40 % cellulose. The remainder was released into the air and water, causing major environmental problems. In 1909 two Swedish engineers patented a method to ferment sulphite lye into alcohol. Apart for consumption, the alcohol could be used as fuel. The rest of the lye, reduced of it’s saccariferous contents, was expected to become the basis of a new chemical industry, producing dyestuffs etc. Within two years three sulphite alcohol factories were established in Sweden and the method was also used in other countries. There was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>problem.</b> In Sweden, ever since {{the beginning}} of the 17 th century, the production of liquor had been intensely regulated by the state. And the law concerning the production was adapted to agrarian interests, producing alcohol from products like corn or potatoes. Organized temperance and the agrarians acted against the pulp producers and argued that it’s better to use “natural” products instead of dirty lye. Then came the First World War and the import of petrol decreased. At the same time food supply became critical. It seemed unreasonable to produce alcohol out of food, but reasonable to compensate the lack of petrol with sulphite alcohol- The number of plants producing sulphite alcohol grew rapidly and an industry producing car engines fuelled by sulphite alcohol was emerging. This came to an end after the war when the price of imported petrol gave sulphite alcohol problems to compete and agrarian and temperance interests once again acted against the production. But the story was repeated during the Second World War and is also of contemporary interest since many countries and companies are trying to substitute oil for ethanol, bio-alcoho...|$|E

40|$|Despite last-minute amendments, {{the federal}} government’s ASIO {{legislation}} {{is bad for}} human rights, argues Jenny Hocking LATE in June the Labor Senator John Faulkner rose in the Senate to give the Labor Party’s imprimatur to the much amended ASIO Bill. In a sudden and unexpected capitulation, the Labor Party announced it was now prepared to support a bill which would grant ASIO the power to detain non-suspects for seven days and to question them {{for a total of}} 24 hours within that seven-day period, a bill which would reverse the onus of proof, remove the right to silence and severely restrict access to independent legal advice while in detention. The intense debate surrounding this bill has been characterised by widespread dissembling, deliberate obfuscation and incompetence. The government’s initial description of the bill as a ‘ 48 -hour’ detention bill {{set the tone for the}} confusion and uncertainty that followed. From the government’s continued references to ‘suspects’ and even to ‘terrorist sympathisers’ it has been not unreasonably assumed that the bill allowed only for the questioning of ‘suspects’ (an error repeated by journalists). What was particularly unsettling in the reintroduction of the bill was to see Senator Faulkner continuing the government’s pattern of dissembling and joining with them in urging the passage of this bill which would trammel our rights so comprehensively. The core concerns over indefinite detention and the erosion of established political and legal rights had, Senator Faulkner claimed, now been dealt with: ‘Gone is the denial of legal representation. Gone is the capacity for ASIO to hold someone indefinitely. Gone is the capacity for ASIO to hold someone in secret. ’ There was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>problem</b> with Senator Faulkner’s triumphant recitation - it was incorrect. It has since been revealed, following questions in the Senate by Greens Senator Bob Brown, that the amended bill could indeed still allow for indefinite detention through a series of rolling warrants each of seven days duration. It is simply extraordinary that somehow this had not been noticed, either by the government or by the Opposition - it had, after all, been one of the core concerns expressed by each of the several extensive parliamentary inquiries into the bill. Further claims made by the Government and Opposition in relation to their agreed amendments must surely now be questioned. It is already clear that Faulkner’s claim that, in the amended bill, ‘gone is the denial of legal representation’ is likewise incorrect. The government’s own description of the amended bill’s provisions for access to legal representation contains the oxymoron that ‘questioning can commence in the absence of a lawyer but the person has a right to a lawyer at all times’. The legal adviser, moreover, could be ejected from the interrogation proceedings by the prescribed authority. Furthermore, there is no indication that the lawyer would be present throughout the entire detention period. Nor does this constitute recognition of a right to independent legal advice since the lawyer would not be of one’s choice since ASIO can apply for ‘particular lawyers’ to be disallowed. There now remains a serious concern that the remaining claim for the amended bill - ‘gone is the capacity for ASIO to hold someone in secret’ - ought to be further examined. Indeed the government’s proposals at this stage specifically indicate that lawyers could be charged with an offence if they communicate information relating to the interrogation process to a third person. It would appear that incommunicado detention may well remain with the latest amendments merely widening by one the limited circle of those aware of the detention but with no one outside that circle able to communicate to family or friends that the detention is taking place. Finally, the amendments in relation to children also require further clarification. In particular, the claim that detained children will have the right to a parent, guardian or other representative must now be fully detailed. What is meant by ‘other representative’ and under what circumstances will this ‘other representative’ be present rather than a parent? The fear of being seen as ‘soft on security’, in a rerun of the older ‘soft on communism’ claim against the Labor Party during the Cold War, was clear when the Prime Minister accused the opposition of endangering Australia’s security following the breakdown of renewed negotiations over these amendments in the last parliamentary sitting day of last year. It was a view reiterated by the Attorney-General on Monday, hinting at a double dissolution trigger ‘if Labor doesn’t pass the bill. The question will be raised about whether they are really genuine about national security’. Equally disturbing was the revelation that the government and opposition alike were apparently unaware that the bill may allow for indefinite detention, highlights the need for further scrutiny of its far-reaching provisions. From its early lack of precision and through its many amendments, this bill has become impenetrable even to its supporters. The Australian people simply deserve better from its major parties.
