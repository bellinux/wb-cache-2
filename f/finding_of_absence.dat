40|$|When a {{positive}} correlation occurs between g-loadedness of a cognitive test and variable X, the result is termed a "Jensen effect. " Virtually all Dutch studies comparing immigrants with Dutch show that the differences in mean scores on intelligence tests are dependent on the g loading of the tests and are therefore clear Jensen effects. However, Helms-Lorenz, van de Vijver, and Poortinga [Intelligence 31 (2003) 9] challenge the overwhelming finding of Jensen effects and suggest that group differences on measures of phenotypic intelligence are more strongly caused by cultural differences than by g. We attempted to replicate Helms-Lorenz et al. 's <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>absence</b> of Jensen effects on two large samples that took both culture-loaded and culture-reduced tests. We found proof of Jensen effects, a very large language bias effect in one specific intelligence test, and quite small cultural bias effects in the remaining intelligence tests. It appears that Helms-Lorenz et al. 's findings are an outlier among all empirical studies, which {{may be caused by}} the use of an unrepresentative set of tests. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|The {{results of}} total knee {{arthroplasty}} are inferior in younger patients. The challenge today is therefore to develop designs and concepts {{that will last}} at least 25 years. This thesis has evaluated the fixation to bone of modern designs of knee prostheses uring RSA analysis. Coating implant surfaces with hydroxy-apatite have proven to enhance fixation to bone. Addition of screws for fixation of the tibial component enhances the fixation, but has negative side effects such as osteolysis around the screws, in turn leading to {{a higher risk of}} component loosening. The magnitude and pattern of migration was studied in a randomized study of uncemented tibial implants coated with hydroxy-apatite with and without additional screw fixation in patients younger than 65 years. The uncemented implants migrated initially more than the cemented implants that constituted the control group. Both uncemented groups stabilized at 3 monthes with no further migration, while the cemented implants showed a continuous migration up to the 2 year follow-up, indicating continuous bone resorption at the implant-bone interface, a fact that might lead to an increased risk of late implant loosening. This may not be a problem in older patients, but may have consequences for long-term fixation in younger patients. There was no difference between the two uncemented groups indicating that screws do not improve fixation. Hydroxy-apatite coated knee implants might be well suited for younger patients. Mobile bearing total knee arthroplasty theoretically uncouples the forces at the implant-bone interface, thus improving fixation of the implant to bone. The magnitude and pattern of migration of a cemented mobile bearing knee arthroplasty and a fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty was compared in a randomized study. The results showed that mobile bearings did not improve fixation. Trabecular metal, a new material recently introduced for total knee arthroplasty, has several theoretical advantages. Trabecular metal tibial implants were evaluated in a randomized study in patients younger than 60 years. The implants displayed the typical migration pattern for uncemented implants with greater migration initially followed by early stabilization. The majority of the trabecular metal implants subsided into the bone with no lift-off. Lift-off has the potential of exposing the interface to joint fluid with the potential risk of bone resorption and late loosening, and is commonly seen in metal-backed implants. The <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>absence</b> of lift-off is regarded beneficial for uncemented fixation. Trabecular metal tibial implants might be suited for younger patients. The optimal mode of fixation of the femoral component is yet to be established. Comparing cemented femoral components with uncemented femoral components in a randomized study in patients younger than 60 years revealed no differences of the magnitude or the pattern of migration. Uncemented femoral component seems equally as good as cemented components in younger patients...|$|E

A schwannoma may also mimic PNS by causing thickening and enhancement of the affected nerve.

In lymphoblasts, the early-replicating allele of SNRPN was identified as the paternal one based on the properties of maternal allele-specific methylation and paternal allele-specific expression.

40|$|Methane-producing {{freshwater}} lake sediment {{was found}} to dehalogenate chloro-, bromo-, and iodobenzoates by a reductive reaction in which the halogen {{was replaced by a}} hydrogen atom. The identity of the dehalogenated products was confirmed by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, or cochromatography. Removal of the halogens to produce benzoate was necessary before mineralization to CH 4 + CO 2 could occur. The dehalogenation occurred after a lag period which lasted from 1 week to more than 6 months, depending on the chemical. Dehalogenation was not observed in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> CH 4 production, and it was inhibited by the addition of 20 % O 2. Once sediment was acclimated to halobenzoate dehalogenation, new additions of the halobenzoate were degraded without lag. Acclimation was observed regardless of whether the parent substrates were eventually mineralized to CH 4 + CO 2. Sediment acclimated to bromo- and chlorobenzoate degradation generally metabolized bromo- and chlorobenzoates, but sediment acclimated to iodobenzoate degradation only metabolized iodobenzoate. Prior acclimation of sediment to benzoate decomposition did not alter the pattern of dehalogenation, and sediment acclimated to dehalogenation was not concurrently acclimated to benzoate degradation. The presence of this apparent specificity, the lag period, and subsequent acclimation, together with our <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> dehalogenation in sterile sediments and by sediments previously incubated at ≥ 39 °C, suggests that this reaction was biologically catalyzed.

To test this hypothesis we examined sera from 35 patients with bancroftian filariasis (an infection known to induce very high levels of IgG 4 antibodies to the parasite and known to be associated with repeated streptococcal infections) as well as from 15 normal individuals for their IgG and IgG subclass responses to streptococcal protein [streptolysin-O (SO), deoxyribonuclease B (DB) ] and carbohydrate [group A carbohydrate (GAC) ] antigens. Levels of IgG antibodies to all three antigens were found to be significantly higher in the filariasis patients compared to normals (P less than 0. 01), and the subclass composition of these antibodies proved heterogenous. Although responses to all three antigens included IgG 1, IgG 2 and IgG 3 antibodies and although IgG 4 responses to the proteins SO and DB were significantly higher in the filariasis patients than in normals (P less than 0. 001), more importantly there were no detectable anti-GAC IgG 4 antibodies in either study group. These observations, coupled with our earlier <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> IgG 4 responses to phosphocholine (PC) in patients with lymphatic filariasis, suggest that even the chronic antigenic stimulation of filarial helminth infection, which leads to very prominent IgG 4 responses to protein antigens, cannot overcome the genetic restriction in humans for making IgG 4 antibodies to carbohydrate antigens, whether of parasite or non-parasite origin...|$|R
