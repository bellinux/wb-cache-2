5|$|The <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> an {{individual}}'s age by anthropologists {{depends on}} whether or not the individual was an adult or a child. The <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the windspeed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or wind shear. This demanded an accurate <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the wind in the general area of the target, and would normally be highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods of determining the wind. In the case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method of determining the wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.|$|E
