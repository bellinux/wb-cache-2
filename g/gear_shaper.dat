50|$|A <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> is {{a machine}} tool for cutting {{the teeth of}} {{internal}} or external gears. The name shaper relates {{to the fact that}} the cutter engages the part on the forward stroke and pulls away from the part on the return stroke, just like the clapper box on a planer shaper.|$|E

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the herringbone gear {{is that it}} cannot be cut by simple gear hobbing machines, as the cutter would run into {{the other half of}} the gear. Solutions to this have included assembling small gears by stacking two helical gears together, cutting the gears with a central groove to provide clearance, and (particularly in the early days) by casting the gears to an accurate pattern and without further machining. With the older method of fabrication, herringbone gears had a central channel separating the two oppositely-angled courses of teeth. This was necessary to permit the shaving tool to run out of the groove. The development of the Sykes <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> made it possible to have continuous teeth with no central gap. Sunderland, also in England, also produced a herringbone cutting machine. The Sykes uses cylindrical guides and round cutters; the Sunderland uses straight guides and rack-type cutters. The W. E. Sykes Co. dissolved in 1983-84. Since then it has been common practice to obtain an older machine and rebuild it if necessary to create this unique type of gear. Recently, the Bourn and Koch company has developed a CNC-controlled derivation of the W. E. Sykes design called the HDS1600-300. This machine, like the Sykes <b>gear</b> <b>shaper,</b> has the ability to generate a true apex without the need for a clearance groove cut around the gear. This allows the gears to be used in positive displacement pumping applications, as well as power transmission. Helical gears with low weight, accuracy and strength may be 3D printed.|$|E

After two years in Vero Beach, Treadway sold his shares in the inn to his father and left the hotel business to become an instructor at St. Lawrence University. In 1941, Treadway left SLU to manage the cafeteria of the Fellows <b>Gear</b> <b>Shaper</b> Company in Springfield, Vermont. Treadway later served in the United States Marine Corps for two years during World War II. He was stationed at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, where he managed the camp's mess halls. After the War, Treadway was the owner and manager of the Publick House in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. In 1949 he succeeded his father as President of Treadway Inns.

50|$|In 1888, the Jones and Lamson Machine Tool Company (J&L) {{moved to}} Springfield from Windsor, Vermont under the {{successful}} leadership of James Hartness. Gaining international renown for precision and innovation, J&L {{ushered in a}} new era of precision manufacturing in the area. Edwin R. Fellows co-founded the Fellows <b>Gear</b> <b>Shaper</b> Company here in 1896. As knowledge and infrastructure grew to support precision machining, other companies such as the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company and Lovejoy Tool formed, grew, and provided much of the economic engine. Springfield Telescope Makers, the oldest amateur telescope makers' club in the United States, has been headquartered in Springfield since its inception in 1920. The club's clubhouse, Stellafane, located on the campus of Stellafane Observatory has hosted a convention for the geographically scattered club since 1927. During World War II, Springfield's production of machine tools was of such importance to the American war effort that the US government ranked Springfield (together with the Cone at Windsor) as the seventh most important bombing target in the country.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, Connecticut {{industry}} became {{well known}} in allied fields. Hardware and tools continue to be manufactured by Stanley Corporation in New Britain, despite having almost moved elsewhere for financial reasons. Connecticut was a major area for development and manufacture of machine tools. In 1818, Simeon North designed America's first milling machine. Machinist Elisha Root first designed machinery for the Collins Company of Collinsville which manufactured axes which became world-famous, then was hired by Colt in 1849 to modernize firearm production by designing precision drop hammers, boring machines, gauges, jigs, etc., and improving the milling machines designed by Francis A. Pratt for the George S. Lincoln company in Hartford; the resulting Lincoln miller became world-famous, selling over 150,000 machines. Another Colt engineer, William Mason, patented 125 inventions for manufacture of firearms, as well as steam pumps and power looms. Christopher Spencer invented the automatic turret lathe (which in its small- to medium-sized form {{is known as a}} screw machine) for machining screws, as well as the variable cam cylinder used to control the turret. Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney invented a thread milling machine in 1865; Whitney also perfected various measurement instruments, and Pratt designed the aforementioned original milling machine manufactured by the George S. Lincoln company of Hartford. Simon Fairman invented the lathe chuck in West Stafford in 1830, and his son-in-law, Austin F. Cushman, invented the self-centering Cushman Universal Chuck in 1862. Edward P. Bullard designed the vertical boring mill in 1883. Charles E. Billings perfected the drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator central to the operation of electrical generators and motors. Edwin R. Fellows of Torrington in 1896 designed and built a new type of <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> and founded the Fellows <b>Gear</b> <b>Shaper</b> Company, which made a vital contribution to the manufacture of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the nascent automotive industry. The name Bridgeport on machine tools continues to be a guarantee of high quality around the world, for people who have no idea that the machinery is named after a city in Connecticut. Even the world of toys was dominated by the A. C. Gilbert Company, manufacturers of Erector Sets as well as other educational toys such as chemistry sets, microscopes, toy trains, etc.|$|E
40|$|The {{global market}} {{competition}} {{has put a}} pressure on the industry to reduce lead time and increase quality of parts. In particular, the area of gear cutting tool design requires capability to rapidly produce tool designs with increased tool geometry precision. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore the field of <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> cutter design and produce a model and software that would enable creation of more precise cutter designs, faster. A literature survey of involute cylindrical gearing geometry highlights deficiencies in addressing industry requirements of tool manufacturing, as most of the research in the area is focused on problems of gear design, but not tool design. This research, therefore, focuses on the process of gear manufacturing using the <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> cutters. It attempts to develop an analytical model and a set of tools that are able to aid the design process of <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> cutter. With cylindrical gear being essentially " at" and therefore easier to express an- alytically, the focus of recent papers has shifted to non-cylindrical and non-involute gear trains. Yet the geometry of the tools used to produce cylindrical gears remains largely untapped area, in particular the geometry of <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> cutters. The knowl- edge about the profile of the cutter teeth and the profile cut by the cutter in the gear blank are essential for high precision gear manufacturing. The <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> cutter is a metal cutting tool and therefore should be re-sharpened on a regular basis. These re-sharpening operations change the profile of the tool and, consequently, the profile of the gear it cuts. The changes in the cutter and gear geometry are analysed in this thesis and a way to calculate the life span of the tool is suggested. <b>Gear</b> <b>shaper</b> cutter profiles usually have one or more modifications to the theoret- ical ideal involute profile applied. Some of these modifications are used to produce a better cutter profile, while other should in turn produce modifications to the gear profile, and, finally, some are used to overcome generated gear profile constraints. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> cutter design should be able to show the profile of the cutter and the profile cut by the cutter with arbitrary modifications applied. The analysis and visualisation of <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> cutters profiles cut by these cutters is impossible without a clear understanding of the principles of operation of gear generation hardware, generating motion and different machine geometry, all being covered in this thesis. In order to verify the analytical model and the CAD software case studies of the real-life <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> cutter designs were performed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an Electronic Helical Guide Controller (EHGC) is proposed, for {{helical gear}} shaping processes. In most {{traditional}} <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> machines, the cutter's reciprocating movement {{is driven by}} a crank-connecting rod mechanism. Therefore, this study adopts this kind of <b>gear</b> <b>shaper</b> as the machine platform to establish an accurate mathematical model. The control algorithm {{is embedded in the}} interpolation module of the CNC system using electronic gearbox techniques to realize special multi-axis linkage control requirements. The crankshaft's angular position is measured and the rotational speed is calculated in each control cycle. The actual position and velocity of the cutter along the Z-axis can be calculated using the geometric relations of the crank-connecting mechanism, and motion in the other axes can be controlled by the electronic gearbox. A special G code with parameters (G 83) is also designed and the EHGC control through NC programming is realized in an improvised gear shaping CNC machine. The proposed EHGC is low cost and easy to implement in practice since it does not need a linear grating ruler and a probe on the Z-axis. Furthermore, EHGC allows the flexibility to change a part's helix angle to compensate for distortions caused by heat treatment. Simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed EHGC...|$|E

40|$|In the {{machining}} industry, {{there is a}} constant need to increase productivity while also maintaining dimensional tolerances and good surface quality. For many classical machining operations (e. g. milling, turning, and broaching), research has been established that is able to predict the part quality based on process parameters, workpiece material, and the machine’s dynamic characteristics. This allows process planners to design their programs virtually to maximize productivity while meeting the specified part quality. To accomplish this, it is necessary to predict the cutting forces during {{the machining}} operation. This can be done using analytical equations for a lot of operations; however, in more recent research for complicated processes (e. g. 5 -axis milling, gear hobbing), this is done by calculating the cutter-workpiece engagement with geometric CAD modellers and calculating incremental cutting forces along the cutting edge. With knowledge of the cutting forces, static deflections and dynamic vibrations of the tool and workpiece can be calculated {{which is one of the}} most prominent contributors to dimensional part inaccuracies and poor surface quality in machining. The research presented in this thesis aims to achieve similar goals for the gear shaping process. Gear shaping is one of the most prominent methods of machining cylindrical gears. More specifically, it is the most prominent method for generating internal gears which are a major component in planetary gear boxes. The gear shaping process uses a modified external gear as a cutting tool which reciprocates up and down to cut the teeth in the workpiece. Simultaneously, the tool and workpiece are also rotating proportionally to their gear ratio which emulate the rolling of two gears. During the beginning of each gear shaping pass, the tool is radially fed into the workpiece until the desired depth of cut is reached. In this study, the three kinematic components (reciprocating feed, rotary feed, and radial feed) are mathematically modelled using analytical equations and experimentally verified using captured CNC signals from the controller of a Liebherr LSE 500 gear shaping machine. To predict cutting forces in gear shaping, the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) is calculated at discrete time steps using a discrete solid modeller called ModuleWorks. From the CWE in dexel form, the two-dimensional chip geometry is reconstructed using Delaunay triangulation and alpha shape reconstruction which is then used to determine the undeformed chip area along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is discretized into nodes with varying cutting directions (tangential, feed, and radial), inclination angle, and rake angle. If engaged in cutting during a time step, each node contributes an incremental three dimensional force vector calculated with the oblique cutting force model. Using a 3 -axis dynamometer, the cutting force prediction algorithm was experimentally verified on a variety of processes and gears which included an internal spur gear, external spur gear, and external helical gear. The simulated and measured force profiles correlate very closely (about 3 - 10 % RMS error) with the most error occurring in the external helical gear case. These errors may be attributable due to rubbing of the tool which is evident through visible gouges on the finished workpiece, tool wear on the helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaper,</b> and different cutting speed than the process for which the cutting coefficients were calibrated. More experiments are needed to verify the sources of error in the helical gear case. To simulate elastic tool deflection in gear shaping, the tool’s static stiffness is estimated from impact hammer testing. Then, based on the predicted cutting force, the elastic deflection of the tool is calculated at each time step. To examine the affect of tool deflection on the final quality of the gear, a virtual gear measurement module is developed and used to predict the involute profile deviations in the virtually machined part. Simulated and measured profile deviations were compared for a one-pass external spur gear process and a two-pass external spur gear process. The simulated profile errors correlate very well with the measured profiles on the left flank of the workpiece, however additional research is needed to improve the accuracy of the model on the right flank. Furthermore, the model also serves as a basis for future research in dyamic vibrations in gear shaping. The above-mentioned algorithms have been implemented into a tool called ShapePRO (developed in C++). The software is meant for process planners to be able to simulate the gear shaping operation virtually and inspect the resulting quality of the gear. Accordingly, the user may iterate the process parameters to maximize productivity while meeting the customer’s desired gear quality...|$|E
