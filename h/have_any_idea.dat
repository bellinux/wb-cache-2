500|$|Chilembwe's aims {{have also}} come under scrutiny. According to Robert I. Rotberg, Chilembwe's speech of 23 January {{appeared}} {{to stress the}} importance and inevitability of martyrdom as a principal motivation. The same speech depicted the uprising {{as a manifestation of}} desperation but because of his desire to [...] "strike a blow and die", he did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of what he would replace colonialism with if the revolt succeeded. Rotberg concludes that Chilembwe planned to seize power in the Shire Highlands or perhaps in all of Nyasaland. John McCracken attacks the idea that the revolt could be considered nationalist, arguing that Chilembwe's ideology was instead fundamentally utopian and created in opposition to localised abuses of the colonial system, particularly thangata. According to McCracken, the uprising failed because Chilembwe was over-reliant on a small Europeanised petite bourgeoisie and did not gain enough mass support. Rotberg's examination the Chilembwe revolt from a psychoanalytical perspective concludes that Chilembwe's personal situation, his psychosomatic asthma and financial debt may have been contributory factors in his decision to plot the rebellion.|$|E

[...] Nick Levine, writing for The National, relegated the track as a [...] "lighter pop morsel". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media panned the song, saying that Solveig's production on the track was paired with equally [...] "bland lyrics".

500|$|To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay {{registered}} her as {{his wife}} in 1793, {{even though they were}} not married. After declaring war on Britain, France was blockaded by the Royal Navy, which caused shortages that worsened the problem of inflation. Imlay engaged in blockade-running, chartering ships to be bring in food and soap from America into France, which explained why both he and Wollstonecraft were not arrested during the Reign of Terror. As the Terror began in France with arrests and executions occurring daily, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion as someone from a nation that was at war with France and who was known to be a friend of leading Girondins, which led Imlay to make a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her into an American citizen, in order to protect her from arrest. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined (Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned). Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins [...] "nightmarish" [...] with gigantic parades in the day where everyone had to cheer, lest they fall under suspicion of not being committed to the republic, and police raids at night to arrest [...] "enemies of the republic". In a letter to her sister Everina, written in March 1794, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "It is impossible for you to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind...death and misery, in every shape of terror, haunted this devoted country – I certainly am glad that I came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded." ...|$|E

[...] Harmonix had to modify the track list throughout development as certain songs were introduced or removed based on licensing issues, requiring the team to repeatedly balance difficulty and popularity of the track list. [...] WaveGroup Sound were used to create the covers of the licensed songs provided in the game. Marcus Henderson of the band Drist provided many of the lead guitar tracks for the covers. WaveGroup Sound also went to efforts to try to recreate effects for some songs. [...] In the case of Black Sabbaths [...] "Iron Man", the team learned that the vocal effects were created by having Ozzy Osbourne sing from behind a metal fan. [...] The team sought out the same model of fan through Craigslist to generate the same effect in the game's cover. Many of the bonus songs were from groups that Harmonix employees were part of or knew. Additionally, a [...] "Be a Guitar Hero" [...] contest was held allowing bands to submit their own song {{to be included in the}} game. [...] The winning song was [...] "Cheat on the Church" [...] by Graveyard BBQ.

I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here."

I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist.
