40|$|In Kenya, the {{government}} is promoting high-value and drought resistant crop varieties {{in an effort to}} reduce poverty in rural areas. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is one such crop. This study was conducted with two objectives: 1) to assess the opportunities and challenges for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation and adoption in the Nyandarua district of Kenya and 2) to assess whether <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> adoption can offer an opportunity for escaping poverty for smallholder farmers in the district. The factors favoring <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation and adoption in the district include: adequate land area suitable for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation and the high <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> yield that can be attained per unit suitable land area, farmers' awareness of the positive aspects of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation, and the willingness of many farmers to grow the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> crop. Notwithstanding these favorable conditions, some socio-economic factors-mainly the affordability of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production and possible lack of appropriate farming technologies, will present challenges to widespread <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> adoption, particularly to those farmers in the low-and medium-income categories. The <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> profit analysis showed that depending on the market price, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> can potentially increase household net income. However, since the majority of households are in the low-and medium-income categories, for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> to pull the smallholder farmers out of poverty, interventions from government and other stakeholders is of vital necessity. The impact of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> adoption and cultivation will vary from household to household. Those households within the high-income category who can raise the required start up capital are likely to benefit, while the low-and medium-income households may not, which is true for any new crop with high start up costs. Alternative agriculture alone is therefore not a sufficient strategy to address the problems of poverty and unemployment. Any successful strategy to address these issues must be broad-based, and include alternative agriculture and other growth and development strategies.

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} {{intensive}} transformation {{to which the}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> market in the European Union has been subject {{in recent years in}} order to meet the external obligations set by the WTO Panel, has had a severe impact on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production in Poland. Two major observations have been reported, namely a significant decrease of number of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> farms and a reduction in those areas of tillage surfaces intended for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation. It is worth mentioning that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is highly important to crop rotation and hardly any other plant in European agriculture can replace it. There is therefore both a strong need and a great opportunity for the further support and development of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production. As the interna-tional obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emission became effective, interest in biomass us-age as a viable alternative to fossil fuels increased. This study thus set out to perform an eco-nomic comparison in respect of the use of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> for traditional purposes and for energy, and to conduct an economic analysis of the income obtained from the sale of electrical energy sale by a biogas facility where <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were used for biogas production.

Since <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> yield is affected by climate and soils, the results of Nyandarua and Butere Mumias <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> trials are not adequate to propose that comparable yields can be obtained elsewhere in the country and other tropical regions. Physical land evaluations assessing the potentials and constraints for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production are therefore essential.

The TSBLES accounts for physical conditions of land i. e. climatic, edaphic and topographic conditions. According to the assessment results 27 % of the land area in Kenya is suitable for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation. Of this area, 5 % is highly suitable, another 5 % is moderately suitable and 17 % is marginally suitable. Most of the highly suitable land area is concentrated in Rift Valley, Central and Nyanza provinces. The Rift Valley has the highest share of the suitable land area...|$|R

40|$|The United States {{produces}} about 1. 8 {{million tons}} of sugar annually. Approximately 75 per cent of this production is derived from <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> The importance of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> crop in national and world economy is justification for research effort {{as a means to}} more economical production. It is desirable that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> processing be carried out in the most efficient manner. More effective utilization of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> and its by-products will add stability to the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry. For the past 170 years, since Achard found that sugar could be used for human consumption and that pulp might be fed to cattle, sugar processors have made limited use of the non-sugar constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet.</b> These materials have been disposed of almost exclusively as livestock ration supplements. The non-sugar constituents have been largely responsible for failure to extract all of the <b>sugar</b> from the <b>beet</b> (13). As a result they have been viewed with suspicion by most <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> processors. However, recent development suggest that the utilization of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> by-products will constitute a more important phase of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry in the future. At this critical period in the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry, it is difficult to overemphasize the need for {{a better understanding of the}} chemical constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> and the effects of various physiological factors upon them. One of the non-sugar constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> which has recently received attention is glutamic acid. This has been brought about primarily by the discovery that the salt, monosodium glutamate, has an enhancing effect upon the flavor and palatability of many foods. Using the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> as almost the exclusive source of glutamic acid, a new industry (utilizing over 100 tons of beet molasses daily) has developed to manufacture and market this food seasoner (28). Preliminary investigations at the Utah Experiment Station (14) showed that of all the chemical constituents determined, glutamic acid was the most variable. This agreed with earlier work in this field (16, 42). Being highly variable this constituent is a chief contributor to difficulties in sugar processing. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of some of the major agronomic factors, such as moisture, fertility, variety, and sampling date, upon the glutamic acid content of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> {{production}} {{was responsible for}} 56. 6 percent of all U. S. sugar production in 2014. 82 percent of this production came from the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, Idaho, and Michigan. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beets</b> are an important crop for growers in these states so {{research in this area}} could be of great value to them. Current U. S. sugar policy protects domestic sugar prices from falling below set target rates. However, there has been very little research that describes the relationship of changing <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> prices above these target rates, with different economic variables. This study explores the potential relationship U. S. <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> prices have with domestic <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production, world <b>sugar</b> prices, incomes, and U. S. sugar imports. With the results, U. S. <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> producers might make better pre-plant decisions such as acreage allotments. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> processors might have more information available to them for pricing of their sugar products and interest groups might see the possible impacts of proposed policy changes for the U. S. sugar industry...|$|R
