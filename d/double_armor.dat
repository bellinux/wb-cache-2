40|$|International audienceArmored {{interfaces}} {{refer to}} fluid interfaces {{on which a}} compact monolayer of particles is adsorbed. In this paper, we probe their robustness under impact. For such an investigation, {{the impact of a}} drop (covered or not by particles) on a flat armored interface is considered. Two regimes are observed: small drops impacting at low velocities do not coalesce, while bigger drops falling at higher velocities lead to coalescence. The coalescence which occurs when the impacting drop has just reached its maximum extension directly results from the formation of bare regions within the armor. We therefore propose a geometric criterion to describe this transition. This simple modeling is able to capture the dependence of the measured velocity threshold with particle size and drop diameter. The additional robustness experienced by <b>double</b> <b>armors</b> (both drop and puddle covered) results in an increase of the measured velocity threshold, which is quantitatively predicted. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R
50|$|The name dissorphus {{was used}} by Edward Drinker Cope to {{describe}} the first dissorophid, Dissorophus multicinctus. He did not formulate a standing definition as of this name, however, upon examination, he commented that it was “a veritable bratrachian armadillo” which translates to looking like an amphibian armadillo. On the same context,DeMar http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-05-21/news/0705200372_1_uic-post-polio-fossils mentions that Boulenger's interpretation on dissorophus is “remarkable for an extraordinary exo- and endo-skeletal carapace", thus the name dissorophus is inferred to do the most prominent feature of dissorphus multicinctus, a <b>double</b> layered <b>armor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Discovery of dissorophid {{material}} {{was made possible}} with collected specimens since 1930s by the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College and the University of Chicago. Williston, Case and Romer, each assessed different specimens and the general concept of the family still stays the same. Williston (1914) divides the family into two sub families; Aspodosaurinae and Dissorophinae. This separation was based on Aspodosaurinae having an open otic notch and single layered armor (one armor segment per vertebral segment), and Dissorophinae having a closed otic notch and <b>double</b> layered <b>armor</b> (two armor segments per vertebral segment).|$|R
50|$|In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy {{role-playing}} game, the cyclops is a giant. There are {{two types}} of cyclopes present in the game; the smaller cyclopskin and the massive cyclops. The cyclopskin resemble 7+1/2 ft, ugly humanoids with a single bloodshot eye in the center of their foreheads. They are burly and muscular and are covered in hairs, scars, and scabs and smell of dirt and dung. Their tough, ruddy brown skin is thick and <b>doubles</b> as <b>armor.</b> Many cyclops also bear a stubby horn. The cyclops resembles closely its cyclopskin cousins but is much larger, growing up to forty feet tall. It is also much more savage and bestial.|$|R
5000|$|For {{mid-range}} weapons the blunderbuss {{was tested}} against the halberd. The blunderbuss, despite a misfire, {{was able to}} put a hole through a layer of <b>double</b> plate <b>armor</b> with one of its pellets. The [...] "halberd" [...] (actually a poleaxe) was a shown to be a deadly and versatile weapon, as it tore of the back of a ballistic gel torso's skull with one strike to the temple with the axe blade (exposing a large amount of brain matter), pierced the abdomen and the throat with the pike end, and tore the skull in half with two more swings of the axe blade. However, because of the blunderbuss' power of penetration, range, and concussion, it was given the edge.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the design}} proved under service conditions, the Idflieg issued a {{contract}} on 1 April for series production to Gothaer Waggonfabrik AG, which acquired a license from Ursinus, {{who held the}} patent to the design. Gothaer chief engineer Hans Burkhard simplified and refined the design, which was originally known as the Gotha-Ursinus-Heeresflugzeug (Gotha Ursinus Army Aircraft), or [...] "GUH," [...] later known as the Gotha G.I or Gotha-Ursinus G.I. The first production aircraft was completed on 27 July 1915. These aircraft were powered by two 110kW (150hp) Benz Bz.III engines. Gothaer Waggonfabrik built 18G.I aircraft in three batches of six before production ceased {{at the end of}} the year. The final batch was powered by 120kW (160hp) Mercedes D.III engines and featured an extra defensive machine gun and nearly <b>double</b> the <b>armor</b> of previous examples.|$|R

5|$|To {{minimize}} the drawbacks of the inclined belt, it sloped {{outward from the}} keel, then back in towards the armored deck. This meant that shells fired at relatively close range would hit the upper portion of the belt at an angle, which maximized armor protection. However, {{the effectiveness of the}} upper portion of the belt was degraded at longer ranges, because plunging shells would strike it at an angle closer to the perpendicular, increasing their ability to penetrate the armor. It did reduce the area that needed to be covered by the armored deck, which saved additional weight. This enabled the upper belt to be thicker, which to an extent ameliorated the vulnerability to plunging fire. Because the belt was internal, it provided the opportunity to extend it to the inner portion of the double bottom, which gave the ship better underwater protection than the North Carolinas. Ultimately, the complex <b>double</b> incline belt <b>armor</b> was abandoned when it became apparent that a single slanted belt could provide similar protection, and save several hundred tons of weight.|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} the helmets of the Crimean Tatar nobility stored in the Museum of Topkapi Palace (Istanbul, Republic of Turkey). Based on the analysis of design and system design determined that hats were made of Circassian masters of the XVIII century. Helmet No. 1 / 810 in shape of the dome relates {{to the type of}} bevel. Forged a gilded crown complemented by ornamented Hoop, pads, conical pommel, and ringed barmitsa Persian type. In Cherkessia similar hats were known as Tang (from the Arab. "the Taj", i. e. "crown"). It is most likely that the owner of the helmet was the last Noureddine Crimean khanate, Bahadir Giray (1789 - 1792) was the son of MuminGirei (?- 1747) and grandson of Khan Saadet Giray IV (1717 - 1724). Helmet No. 1 / 812 по the shape of a dome refers to the type of conal. Forged iron gilded crown complemented by ornamented Hoop, plates and funnel-shaped topping. Dome placed on the manufacture date of the helmet – " 1180 of the Hijra" (i. e., 1766 - 1767 in the Gregorian calendar), as well as the inscription: "Owner Sultan Ali", "Muhammad Giray", "Mansour". Helmet No. 1 / 811 по the shape of a dome refers to the type of cylindrical. Faceted iron supplemented gilt crown ornamented Hoop, conical pommel and Aventail Persian type. On the front of hats placed the inscription, "Sultan Mohammed Ibn AdilGiray". This suggests that the owner of the helmet could be the son of Nureddin (1718), serasker Budjaka and Editcol (1727 - 1728) Adil Ibn Selim I Giray or seraskier EditcolAdil Ibn Selim III Giray (1766 - 1767). In the framework of the interdisciplinary research were made copies of these helmets, which have become the object of scientific experiments aimed at the study of the functional properties of the considered hats. According to the results of the experimental tests it was found that all three of the helmet provide very reliable protection {{of the head and neck}} of the warrior from the cutting and cut-and-cutting blows of the enemy. The saber blade slips and falls from the smooth crown of agolove. In this case, the high dome of the helmet No. 1 / 810 absorbs shock and convex faces helmet No. 1 / 811 perform the function of reinforcing ribs. In some cases, the blade is sliding by inertia at the clavicle the defending warrior, but brings them no significant harm, as the blade meets the <b>double</b> layer segmented <b>armor</b> (blade aventails and shoulder part of the vessel shell ring). ...|$|R
