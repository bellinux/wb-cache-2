5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact {{a variation in the}} thin and thick <b>disk</b> <b>and</b> spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of the}} Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick <b>disk,</b> <b>and</b> instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, imaging of {{the system}} with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys {{revealed}} {{the presence of a}} secondary dust disk inclined at an angle of about 5° to the main <b>disk</b> <b>and</b> extending at least 130 AU from the star. The secondary disk is asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less inclined than the northeast. The imaging was not good enough to distinguish between the main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust disk is predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU from the star. The secondary disk may be produced by a massive planet in an inclined orbit removing matter from the primary <b>disk</b> <b>and</b> causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.|$|E

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this <b>disk</b> <b>and</b> that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|One {{hypothesis}} is formation by the gravitational instability. Particles several centimeters in size or larger slowly settle {{near the middle}} plane of the disk, forming a very thin—less than 100km—and dense layer. This layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps, which in turn collapse into planetesimals. However, the differing velocities of the gas <b>disk</b> <b>and</b> the solids near the mid-plane can generate turbulence which prevents the layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to gravitational instability. This may limit the formation of planetesimals via gravitational instabilities to specific locations in the disk where the concentration of solids is enhanced.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{photometric}} and spectroscopic {{observations from}} 2005 to 2007 {{indicate that a}} new disk has formed around the equatorthus constituting a double disk phenomenon with disks at different angles. The inclination angle of the new disk is estimated at 60° whereas the previous disk was inclined at around 30°. Such a misaligned double-disk structure has never been observed before among Be stars.

5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{suggestion is}} that dEs could be the remnants of low-mass spiral galaxies that obtained a rounder shape through the action of repeated gravitational interactions with giant galaxies within a cluster.

Under this alternative hypothesis the <b>disks</b> <b>and</b> arms are modified version of the original stellar disk of the transformed spiral galaxy, and similarly, small remnants of <b>disks</b> <b>and</b> arms are embedded within [...] "harassed" [...] dEs.|$|R

5|$|Although no star {{systems in}} Telescopium have {{confirmed}} planets, several {{have been found}} to have brown dwarf companions. A member of the 12-million-year-old Beta Pictoris moving group of stars that share a common proper motion through space, Eta Telescopii is a young white main sequence star of magnitude 5.0 and spectral type A0V. It has a debris <b>disk</b> <b>and</b> brown dwarf companion of spectral type M7V or M8V that is between 20 and 50 times as massive as Jupiter. The system is complex, as it has a common proper motion with (and is gravitationally bound to) the star HD 181327, which has its own debris disk. This latter star is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F6V of magnitude 7.0. PZ Telescopii is another young star with a debris <b>disk</b> <b>and</b> substellar brown dwarf companion, though at 24 million years of age appears too old {{to be part of the}} Beta Pictoris moving group. HD 191760 is a yellow subgiant—a star that is cooling and expanding off the main sequence—of spectral type G3IV/V. Estimated to be just over four billion years old, it is slightly (1.1 to 1.3 times) more massive as the Sun, 2.69 times as luminous, and has around 1.62 times its radius. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument on the ESO 3.6 m Telescope, it was found to have a brown dwarf around 38 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting at an average distance of 1.35 AU with a period of 505 days. This is an unusually close distance from the star, within a range that has been termed the brown-dwarf desert.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 1925, John Logie Baird {{was able}} to {{demonstrate}} the transmission of moving pictures at the London department store Selfridges. Baird's device relied upon the Nipkow <b>disk</b> <b>and</b> thus {{became known as the}} mechanical television. It formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the British Broadcasting Corporation beginning 30 September 1929. However, for most of the twentieth century televisions depended upon the cathode ray tube invented by Karl Braun. The first version of such a television to show promise was produced by Philo Farnsworth and demonstrated to his family on 7 September 1927. After World War II, the experiments in television that had been interrupted were resumed, and it also became an important home entertainment broadcast medium.|$|E
5|$|South of the Eagle Nebula on {{the border}} with Sagittarius is the eclipsing binary W Serpentis, whose primary is a white giant that is {{interacting}} with the secondary. The system has been found to contain an accretion <b>disk,</b> <b>and</b> {{was one of the first}} discovered Serpentids, which are eclipsing binaries containing exceptionally strong far-ultraviolet spectral lines. It is suspected that such Serpentids are in an earlier evolutionary phase, and will evolve first into double periodic variables and then classical Algol variables. Also near the Eagle Nebula is the eclipsing Wolf–Rayet binary CV Serpentis, consisting of a Wolf–Rayet star and a hot O-type subgiant. The system is surrounded by a ring-shaped nebula, likely formed during the Wolf–Rayet phase of the primary. The eclipses of the system vary erratically, and although there are two theories as to why, neither of them is completely consistent with current understanding of stars.|$|E
