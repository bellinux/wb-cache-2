BP changes versus baseline and rates of normalized office systolic blood pressure (SBP) = 20 mm Hg and office DBP = 10 mrn Hg, were calculated. In the intention-to-treat population (n= 296), office SBP and DBP reductions were more notable with 30 mg twice daily (15. 6 / 11. 5 mm Hg) and 15 mg twice daily 14. 8 / 12. 5 mm Hg) than with other <b>delapril</b> regimens (30 mg once daily: 11. 8 / 10. 5 mrn Hg; 7. 5 mg twice daily: 12. 9 / 10. 1 mm Hg) and placebo (P <. 05 for DBP; P <. 01 for SBP). The same was true for frequency of responders (63. 8 % and 60. 3 %; P <=. 05 vs placebo) and normalized patients (58. 6 % and 53. 4 %; P <. 05 vs placebo). Analysis of ambulatory BPs confirmed the accuracy of office BPS. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 3. 4 % to 6. 7 % of patients given <b>delapril</b> and in 6. 5 % of those given placebo.

40|$|Background : It is {{not clear}} whether the {{administration}} of an angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor consisitently slows the progression of disease in patients with renal disease. We investigated the usefulness of the furosemide test in predicting the efficacy of <b>delapril,</b> an ACE inhibitor, in patients with chronic renal insuffi- clency. Methods : <b>Delapril</b> (7. 5 mg to 15 mg) was administered daily to 24 patients with chronic renal insufficiency as indicated by a serum concentration of creatinine (Scr) between 1. 2 mg/dl and 3. 0 mg/dl. Patients were classified into improved, unchanged, and worsened groups based on the effect of <b>delapril</b> on the Scr. We measured the following parameters before the administration of <b>delapril</b> for a mean of 9 months blood pressure, Scr, urinary protein excretion, urinary sodium excretion, and changes in the renin and aldosterone response (the PRA ratio and PAC ratio) to a furosemide test. Results : Renal function was improved in 6 patients, unchanged in 8 patients, and worsend in 10 patients after <b>delapril</b> treatment. Urinary protein excretion was decreased, but not significantly, in all three groups. No significant differences in baseline parameters were observed among the groups before treatment. The PRA ratio was significantly higher in the group showing improvement vs. the groups showing either no improvement or a worsening of renal function. Conclusions : <b>Delapril</b> tended to reduce the urinary excretion of protein in patients with chronic renal insufficienty. However, <b>delapril</b> did not consistently reduce the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate. The protective effect of this drug on renal function appeared {{to be related to the}} renin response to furosemide test...|$|E
40|$|Combined {{treatment}} with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>delapril</b> and the diuretic indapamide prevented vascular damage in vital organs of salt-loaded stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp). Whether the changes occurring after long-term hypertension {{could also be}} modulated in large arteries was investigated. Two-month-old SHRsp were salt loaded and treated with the drug regimen until they reached 50 +/- 10 mortality or around midlife. In a first experiment, <b>delapril</b> (12 mg/kg) and indapamide (1 mg/kg) were administered daily separately or in combination. In the second dose-finding experiment, <b>delapril</b> (6, 3, 1. 5 mg/kg) and indapamide (0. 5, 0. 25, 0. 125 mg/kg) in decreasing dose combinations were analyzed. Ultrastructural, histomorphometric, and biochemical studies were performed on the thoracic aorta. When compared with <b>delapril</b> (12 mg/kg) or indapamide (1 mg/kg) administered individually for 5 months, the combination 12 + 1 mg/kg was able to prevent the increase in extracellular matrix deposition observed in other treatment groups, as assessed by histomorphometry or 4 -OH-proline biochemical determination. In the second experiment, a half-dose (<b>delapril</b> 6 mg/kg + indapamide 0. 5 mg/kg) combination was similarly effective in counteracting fibrosis, but the other doses progressively failed. In the first experiment, the combination had a stabilizing effect on hypertension and stimulated diuresis. In the second experiment, arterial blood pressure values and sodium balance were not consistently affected by the treatments that antagonized fibrosis (i. e., <b>delapril</b> 6 mg/kg + indapamide 0. 5 mg/kg and, less efficiently, <b>delapril</b> 3 mg/kg + indapamide 0. 25 mg/kg).

40|$|International audiencePrevention {{of adverse}} cardiac {{remodeling}} after myocardial infarction (MI) remains a therapeutic challenge. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are a well-established first-line treatment. ACE-I delay fibrosis, but {{little is known}} about their molecular effects on cardiomyocytes. We investigated the effects of the ACE-I <b>delapril</b> on cardiomyocytes in a mouse model of heart failure (HF) after MI. Mice were randomly assigned to three groups: Sham, MI, and MI-D (6 weeks of treatment with a non-hypotensive dose of <b>delapril</b> started 24 h after MI). Echocardiography and pressure-volume loops revealed that MI induced hypertrophy and dilation, and altered both contraction and relaxation of the left ventricle. At the cellular level, MI cardiomyocytes exhibited reduced contraction, slowed relaxation, increased diastolic Ca 2 + levels, decreased Ca 2 +-transient amplitude, and diminished Ca 2 + sensitivity of myofilaments. In MI-D mice, however, both mortality and cardiac remodeling were decreased when compared to non-treated MI mice. <b>Delapril</b> maintained cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation, prevented diastolic Ca 2 + overload and retained the normal Ca 2 + sensitivity of contractile proteins. <b>Delapril</b> maintained SERCA 2 a activity through normalization of P-PLB/PLB (for both Ser 16 - PLB and Thr 17 -PLB) and PLB/SERCA 2 a ratios in cardiomyocytes, favoring normal reuptake of Ca 2 + in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, <b>delapril</b> prevented defective cTnI function by normalizing the expression of PKC, enhanced in MI mice. In conclusion, early therapy with <b>delapril</b> after MI preserved the normal contraction/relaxation cycle of surviving cardiomyocytes with multiple direct effects on key intracellular mechanisms contributing to preserve cardiac function...|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} articles, we {{have shown}} that the combination of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>delapril</b> (12 mg/kg/day) and the diuretic indapamide (1 mg/kg/day) was able to prolong the life span significantly in salt-loaded stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp). Because this finding was partly dependent on the antagonism of salt-loading effects by pharmacologic induction of diuresis, which prevented any increase in blood pressure values, we decided to evaluate whether lower doses of the combination could be equally protective without changing the progression of hypertension. Thus, we studied several treatments with progressively lower doses of <b>delapril</b> (6, 3, or 1. 5 mg/kg/day) combined with indapamide (0. 5, 0. 25, or 0. 125 mg/kg/day) or hydrochlorothiazide (2. 5, 1. 25, or 0. 625 mg/kg/day) in salt-loaded SHRsp. Salt-loaded untreated animals were considered to be the control group. In agreement with previous experiments, control rats reached 50 % mortality similar to 7 weeks after the beginning of salt loading. The combination of <b>delapril</b> and hydrochlorothiazide at the two lowest doses was nor able to delay animal death significantly, whereas treatment with april and indapamide at the lowest dose was effective (50 % survival rate, 15 weeks). The groups treated with the highest dose of <b>delapril</b> and hydrochlorothiazide or with the intermediate or highest dose of <b>delapril</b> and indapamide did not reach 50 % mortality {{by the end of the}} experiment, at 44 weeks of treatment (i. e., when animals reached age 1 year). Only the highest <b>delapril</b> and indapamide doses were able to increase diuresis, but for a relatively short period. None of the treatments was able to lower or control blood pressure levels adequately. Therefore, blood pressure levels by themselves were not predictive of rat mortality. In contrast, the maximal value of proteinuria in the weeks preceding death was inversely correlated with the survival time. In conclusion, this study shows that low doses of an ACE inhibitor in combination with a diuretic can be effectively protective in a model of severe hypertension, independent of any change in blood pressure levels...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the mechanism in which {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) inhibition increases insulin dependent glucose disposal (insulin sensitivity) in essential hypertension, we examined the effect of ACE inhibitor (<b>delapril)</b> and angiotensin II receptor antagonist (TCV- 116) on insulin sensitivity in essential hypertensives (EHT). Effects of these drugs on the sodium retaining action and activation of pressor system by hyperinsulinemia, which might relate to pressor mechanisms in EHT, were also investigated in this study. Fifteen EHT and 18 age- and body mass index- matched normotensive controls (NT) were all hospitalized and 2 -hour euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp (GC) was performed in a fasting condition. After 2 weeks' control period, 7 EHT were treated with <b>delapril</b> (120 mg/day) and 8 EHT, with TCV- 116 (8 mg/day) for 2 weeks. At {{the end of the}} treatment period, GC was repeated in these two groups. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated as M-value calculated from the infusion rate of glucose during hyperinsulinemia by GC. Blood and urine samples were collected before and during the hyperinsulinemia. In the control period, M value was lower in EHT than in NT. Hyperinsulinemia by GC decreased urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), and increased plasma norepinephrine (PNE) and plasma renin activity (PRA) in EHT. Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) tended to increase during hyperinsulinemia. After <b>delapril</b> or TCV- 116 treatment in EHT, mean blood pressure (MBP) significantly decreased and M-value significantly increased to the ranges of those parameters in NT. No significant difference was observed in MBP and M value between the <b>delapril</b> treated group and the TCV- 116 treated group either before or after the treatments. In addition, under both treatments, the decreases in UNaV and FENa during the hyperinsulinemia were significantly suppressed. The increases in PNE and PRA during the hyperinsulinemia were observed even under these treatments; the rises of PRA tended to increase, but the rises of PAC tended to decrease comparing to those before the treatments. There {{was no significant difference in}} UNaV, FENa, PNE, PRA or PAC between the <b>delapril</b> treated group and the TCV- 116 treated group either before or after the treatments. Furthermore, these changes during hyperinsulinemia were not significantly different between the two groups. In summary, (1) both <b>delapril</b> and TCV- 116 improve insulin sensitivity in EHT to the level of that in NT, (2) both the treatments attenuate the sodium retaining action of hyperinsulinemia and (3) there were no statistically significant differences in these effects between <b>delapril</b> treatment and TCV- 116 treatment. These findings suggest that inhibition of angiotensin II production by ACE inhibitor can play a major role in improvement of insulin sensitivity and inhibit sodium retaining action by hyperinsulinemia in EHT...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease {{management}} and prevention represent the leading cost driver in Italian healthcare expenditure. In {{order to reach}} the target blood pressure, {{a large majority of}} patients require simultaneous administration of multiple antihypertensive agents. OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic impact of the use of fixed dose combinations of antihypertensive agents, compared to the extemporary combination of the same principles. METHODS: A cost minimization analysis was conducted to determine the pharmaceutical daily cost of five fixed dose combinations (olmesartan 20 mg + amlodipine 5 mg, perindopril 5 mg + amlodipine 5 mg, enalapril 20 mg + lercanidipine 10 mg, felodipine 5 mg + ramipril 5 mg, and <b>delapril</b> 30 mg + manidipine 10 mg) compared with extemporary combination of the same principles in the perspective of the Italian NHS. Daily acquisition costs are estimated based on current Italian prices and tariffs. RESULTS: In three cases the use of fixed‑dose combination instead of extemporary combination induces a lower daily cost. Fixed combination treatment with <b>delapril</b> 30 mg + manidipine 10 mg induces greater cost savings for the National Health System (95, 47 €/pts/year), as compared to free drugs combination therapy.

40|$|Manuel Luque OteroHypertension Unit, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Complutense University, Madrid, SpainAbstract: High blood {{pressure}} (BP) {{is the major}} cardiovascular risk factor and {{the main cause of}} death around the world. Control of {{blood pressure}} reduces the high mortality associated with hypertension and the most recent guidelines recommend reducing arterial BP values below 140 / 90 mmHg for all hypertensive patients (130 / 80 in diabetics) as a necessary step to reduce global cardiovascular risk, which is the fundamental objective of the treatment. To achieve these target BP goals frequently requires combination therapy with two or more antihypertensive agents. Although the combination of a diuretic and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is the most commonly used in the clinical practice, the combination of an ACEI and a calcium channel blocker may have an additive antihypertensive effect, a favorable effect on the metabolic profile, and an increased target organ damage protection. The new oral fixed combination manidipine 10 mg/delapril 30 mg has a greater antihypertensive effect than both components of the combination separately, and in non-responders to monotherapy with manidipine or <b>delapril</b> the average reduction of systolic and diastolic BP is 16 / 10 mmHg.

A secondary objective was to examine the safety of these two combinations. Studies comparing the efficacy of D+I to ACEi+HCTZ combinations in hypertensive patients and published on computerized databases (1974 &ndash; 2010) were considered. Endpoints included percentage of normalized patients, of responders, change in diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP/SBP) at different time-points, percentage of adverse events (AEs), and percentage of withdrawal. Four head-to-head randomized controlled trials (D+I-treated, n = 643; ACEi+HCTZ-treated, n = 629) were included. Meta-analysis indicated that D+I-treated patients had a higher proportion with normalized blood pressure (P = 0. 024) or responders (P = 0. 002) compared to ACEi+HCTZ-treated patients. No difference was observed between treatments on absolute values of DBP and SBP at different time-points. Although the rate of patients reporting at least one AE was similar in both groups (10. 4 % versus 9. 9 %), events leading to study withdrawal were lower in the D+I group versus the ACEi+HCTZ group (2. 3 % versus 4. 8 %, respectively; P = 0. 018).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypertension {{markedly}} {{increases the}} already {{high risk for}} cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. Less than one in eight patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes have adequately controlled blood pressure. As a result, antihypertensive combinations are now widely used in management of hypertension associated with diabetes. METHODS: This double-blind study investigated efficacy of a new fixed dose combination of a calcium antagonist, manidipine 10 mg, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, <b>delapril</b> 30 mg, compared {{with a combination of}} an angiotensin receptor blocker, losartan 50 mg, and a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide 12. 5 mg. Patients with hypertension (blood pressure > or = 130 / 80 mmHg) with controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA 1 c < or = 7. 5 %) were randomized to manidipine/delapril (n = 153) or losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (n = 161), administered once daily for 12 weeks. Patients underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitor evaluation at baseline and end of treatment. RESULTS: Mean decreases in 24 -h systolic blood pressure were seen with both manidipine/delapril (- 9. 3 mmHg) and losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (- 10. 7 mmHg) combinations. The mean (95 % confidence interval) treatment difference was - 1. 4 (- 4. 5 / 1. 8) mmHg, demonstrating noninferiority of the manidipine/delapril combination.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} augmentation of insulin sensitivity by angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), <b>delapril</b> was used {{and its effects on}} the insulin resistance in fructose-fed rats (FFR) were evaluated with or without the administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonist (TCV- 116) and bradykinin receptor antagonist (Hoe 140). Moreover, to clarify the contribution of improvement of insulin sensitivity through the use of ACEI to its anti-hypertensive effect in FFR, the effects of insulin sensitivity improving agent, CS- 045, on blood pressure were evaluated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed on standard chow (control; n= 11) or fructose rich chow (FFR; n= 76) for 4 weeks. Then, FFR were treated with 10 mg/kg/day of <b>delapril</b> (n= 9), 1 mg/kg/day of TCV- 116 (n= 14), or vehicle (n= 11) in study 1; treated with 10 mg/kg/day of <b>delapril</b> with Hoe 140 (0. 5 mg/kg/day; n= 9) or vehicle (n= 11) in study 2, and treated with either CS- 045 (200 mg/kg/day; n= 12) or vehicle (n= 10) in study 3, for an additional 2 weeks. Steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) levels were evaluated {{at the end of the}} experiment while the rats were conscious. SSPG method was performed with simultaneous infusion of 2. 5 mU/kg/min of insulin and 8 mg/kg/min of glucose. In study 1, mean blood pressure (MBP) was significantly higher in FFR (142 ± 6 mmHg, p< 0. 05) than in control (128 ± 3 mmHg), and was significantly lower in FFR+delapril (113 ± 8 mmHg, p< 0. 01) and in FFR+TCV- 116 (117 ± 4 mmHg, p< 0. 01) than in FFR+vehicle (142 ± 6 mmHg). SSPG was significantly higher in FFR (207 ± 6 mg/dl, p< 0. 01) than in control (137 ± 10 mg/d/), and was significantly lower in FFR+delapril (171 ± 4 mg/dl, p< 0. 01) and in FFR+ TCV- 116 (172 ± 7 mg/dl, p< 0. 01) than in FFR+vehicle (207 ± 6 mg/dl). In study 2, there was no difference in MBP between FFR+delapril+Hoe 140 (129 ± 3 mmHg) and FFR+delapril+vehicle (130 ± 4 mmHg). Moreover, no difference was found in SSPG between FFR+delapril+Hoe 140 (158 ± 5 mg/dl) and FFR+delapril+vehicle (172 ± 8 mg/dl). In study 3, SSPG was significantly lower in FFR+CS- 045 (161 ± 6 mg/dn, p< 0. 05) than FFR+vehicle (186 ± 7 mg/dl), while there was no difference in MBP between FFR+CS- 045 (135 ± 7 mmHg) and FFR+vehicle (142 ± 5 mmHg). From these results, we concluded that, 1) The main mechanisms of improving the insulin sensitivity through use of ACEI may occur as a result of the suppression of angiotensin II but not because of the enhancement of kinins, 2) The improvement of insulin sensitivity through use of ACEI may not contribute to a depressor effect of this agent, and 3) Improvement of insulin sensitivity through the use of CS- 045 does not necessarily cause a depressor effect...|$|E

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the abundance of mRNAs encoding angiotensinogen, cathepsin D, and angiotensin-converting enzyme was greater in VSMC from SHR than in cells from WKY rats. The abundance of cathepsin D protein by Western blotting was greater in VSMC from SHR than in cells from WKY rats. Ang I-generating and acid protease activities were detected in VSMC from SHR, but not in cells from WKY rats. These results suggest that SHR-derived VSMC generate Ang II with increases in angiotensinogen, cathepsin D, and angiotensin-converting enzyme, which contribute to the basal growth. Production of Ang II by homogeneous cultures of VSMC is considered as a new mechanism of hypertensive vascular disease. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 1999; 19 : 1210 - 1217. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVEdTo {{describe}} the prevalence and determinants of hyperfiltration (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] $ 120 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2), GFR decline, and nephropathy onset or progres-sion in {{type 2 diabetic}} patients with normo- or microalbuminuria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdWe longitudinally studied 600 hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with albuminuria, 200 mg/min and who were retrieved from two randomized trials testing the renal effect of trandolapril and <b>delapril.</b> Target blood pressure (BP) was, 120 / 80 mmHg, and HbA 1 c was, 7 %. GFR, albuminuria, and glucose disposal rate (GDR) were centrally measured by iohexol plasma clearance, nephelometry in three consecutive overnight urine collections, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, respectively. RESULTSdOver a median (range) follow-up of 4. 0 (1. 7 – 8. 1) years, GFR declined by 3. 37 (5. 71 – 1. 31) mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 per year. GFR change was bimodal over time: a larger reduction at 6 months significantly predicted slower subsequent decline (coefficient: 20. 0054; SE: 0. 0009), particularly among hyperfiltering patients. A total of 90 subjects (15 %) were hyperfiltering at inclusion, and 11 of 47 (23. 4 %) patients with persistent hyperfiltration progressed to micro- or macroalbuminuria versus 53 (10. 6 %) of the 502 who had their hyperfiltration ameliorated at 6 months or were nonhyperfiltering since inclusion (hazard ratio 2. 16 [95 % CI 1. 13 – 4. 14]). Amelioration of hyperfiltration was independent of baseline characteristics or ACE inhibition. It {{was significantly associated with}} improved BP and metabolic control, amelioration of GDR, and slower long-term GFR decline on follow-up. CONCLUSIONSdDespite intensified treatment, patients with type 2 diabetes have a fast GFR decline. Hyperfiltration affects a subgroup of patients and may contribute to renal function loss and nephropathy onset or progression. Whether amelioration of hyperfiltration is renopro-tective is worth investigating...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{long-term}} tolerability and efficacy of a fixed combination of manidipine 10 mg and <b>delapril</b> 30 mg (M+D) as an antihypertensive treatment in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Study design: This was a multicentre open study, with a two-week placebo run-in period, followed by a 50 -week active treatment period. Three hundred and nine patients with a mean age of 56. 4 years and a sitting (Si) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 95 mm Hg and ≤ 110 mm Hg were enrolled. During the treatment period systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were assessed by conventional sphygmomanometry. Results: The decreases in SiSBP and SiDBP were clinically relevant after 4 weeks of treatment, with a mean reduction of 16. 6 mm Hg (95 % confidence interval [CI] - 18. 2; - 15) and 9. 3 mm Hg (95 % CI - 10. 2; - 8. 4), respectively. At the end of treatment, SiSBP and SiDBP were significantly decreased by 21. 8 mm Hg [95 % CI - 23. 4; - 20. 2) and 14. 3 mm Hg (95 % CI - 15. 3; - 13. 4), respectively. Pulse pressure (PP) was 61. 4 ± 9. 8 mm Hg at baseline and was reduced to 54. 2 ± 10. 8 mm Hg after the first month of treatment (- 7. 3 mm Hg, 95 % CI - 8. 5; - 6); at 50 weeks of treatment the PP was 54 ± 11 mm Hg (- 7. 5 mm Hg, 95 % CI - 8. 8; - 6. 1). The success rate (reduction of SiDBP ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline or SiDBP ≤ 90 mm Hg) was 86. 4 %, the normalisation rate (SiDBP ≤ 90 mm Hg) was 80. 6 %. Forty-four patients (14. 2 %) reported adverse drug-related events. No clinically significant changes in heart rate, ECG or laboratory tests were found. Conclusion: The fixed combination M+D is effective in reducing blood pressure levels in patients with hypertension and in maintaining the reduction throughout the study period, with a good tolerability profile...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the renin-angiotensin system and sodium in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis, I examined the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) on blood pressure and renal function in rat with glomerulosclerosis, Milan normotensive rats (MNS). Method: Experiment 1 : Twenty-four 8 -week old MNS were divided into three groups as follows (1) Normal-salt diet group (0. 5 ％NaCl), (2) Low-salt diet group (0. 1 ％NaCl), and (3) High-salt diet group (6. 0 ％NaCl). Each diet was given for 32 weeks. Experiment 2 : Twenty-four 8 -week old MNS were divided into three groups as follows (1) ACEI treated group (<b>Delapril</b> 10 mg/kg/day), (2) ARB treated group (CV- 116 3 mg/kg/day), and (3) placebo treated group (control). Each of these antihypertensive drug was administrated per os for 32 weeks. In both studies, during the experiment, body weight, blood pressure and urinary excretion of protein were measured every four weeks. At the end of study, after measurement of plasma angiotensin I, angiotensin II, aldosterone and renin activity, renal tissues were obtained for light microscopic examination and for measurements of AT 1 a receptor, AT 2 receptor, ecNOS and HO- 1 mRNA by using RT-PCR. Results: Experiment 1 : During the experiment, renin-angiotensin system was high level in normal salt-diet group and it was more activated in low salt-diet. There {{were no significant differences in}} blood pressure in three groups. Marked glomerulosclerosis and interstitial cell infiltration, which were found in MNS were significantly aggravated by low-salt diet. On the contrary, glomerular changes were significantly ameliorated by high-salt diet. Experiment 2 : Systolic blood pressure and urinary excretion of protein in MNS was significantly reduced by administration of ACEI. ACEI treatment induced significant elevation of the expression of AT 2 receptor, ecNOS and HO- 1 mRNA in the kidney. ARB treatment induced significant reduction of the expression of ecNOS and HO- 1 mRNA in the kidney. Marked glomerulosclerosis and interstitial cell infiltration, which were found in the control group were significantly ameliorated by treatment of ACEI. On the contrary, there was no significant improvement in ARB treated group. Conclusion: From these data, I concluded that histopathological change in the kidney in MNS was determined by the activation of renin-angiotensin system. On the contrary, nitric oxide and heme-oxygenase plays as the protective role in the renal insufficiency. Furthermore, ACEI and ARB were different from renalprotective effect in rat with glomerulosclerosis...|$|E
