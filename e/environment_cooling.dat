40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{a preliminary}} design study to explore the plausibility of using pulse tube refrigeration to cool instruments in a hot down-hole environment. The original motivation was to maintain Dave Reagor`s high-temperature superconducting electronics at 75 K, but the study has evolved to include three target design criteria: cooling at 30 C in a 300 C <b>environment,</b> <b>cooling</b> at 75 K in a 50 C <b>environment,</b> <b>cooling</b> at both 75 K and 30 C in a 250 C environment. These specific temperatures were chosen arbitrarily, as representative of what is possible. The primary goals are low cost, reliability, and small package diameter. Pulse-tube refrigeration is a rapidly growing sub-field of cryogenic refrigeration. The pulse tube refrigerator has recently become the simplest, cheapest, most rugged and reliable low-power cryocooler. The authors expect this technology will be applicable downhole because of the ratio of hot to cold temperatures (in absolute units, such as Kelvin) of interest in deep drilling {{is comparable to the}} ratios routinely achieved with cryogenic pulse-tube refrigerators...|$|E
40|$|Gravitational phenomena, {{including}} convection, sedimentation, {{and interactions}} of materials with their containers all affect the crystal growth process. If {{they are not}} taken into consideration they can have adverse effects on {{the quantity and quality}} of crystals produced. As a practical matter, convection, and sedimentation can be completely eliminated only under conditions of low gravity attained during orbital flight. There is, then, an advantage to effecting crystallization in space. In the absence of convection in a microgravity <b>environment</b> <b>cooling</b> proceeds by thermal diffusion from the walls to the center of the solution chamber. This renders control of nucleation difficult. Accordingly, there is a need for a new improved nucleation process in space.

25|$|Two common {{environments that}} tend to favor neoteny are high-altitude and <b>cool</b> <b>environments</b> because neotenous {{individuals}} have a higher fitness than those that metamorphose into the adult form. This is because the energy required for metamorphosis is too costly for the individual’s fitness, also the conditions favor neoteny due {{to the ability of}} neotenous individuals to utilize the available resources more easily. This trend {{can be seen in the}} comparison of salamander species of lower and higher altitudes. The neotenous individuals have higher survivorship as well as higher fecundity than the salamanders that had gone to the adult form in the higher altitude and <b>cooler</b> <b>environment.</b> Insects in <b>cooler</b> <b>environments</b> tend to show neoteny in flight because wings have a high surface area and lose heat quickly, thus it is not advantageous for insects in that environment to metamorphose into adults.|$|R
40|$|Background: Dressing {{changes during}} the {{management}} of chronic wounds are often associated with pain, yet little qualitative research has been completed to {{gain an understanding of}} the impact of this on patients. Aims: This study aimed to involve patients in discussions about their wound pain in order to inform the development of a questionnaire based on their views. Methods: A purposeful sample of six participants with chronic venous ulceration was recruited {{to take part in a}} focus group discussion about pain. Free-flowing conversation was encouraged so that participants could discuss issues that were important to them. Results: The participants described two distinct types of pain — acute and constant. The impact of pain on everyday life led to isolation, loss of independence and sleep deprivation. The participants described a tendency towards habitual behaviour that led to a sense of vulnerability in the clinical <b>environment.</b> <b>Cooling</b> of the surrounding skin, having a support network and the use of medication were perceived to improve the experience. Conclusions: It is clear that living with a chronic wound has a huge impact on a person’s life. Healing is often a lengthy and uncomfortable process, yet the issue of patients’ perceptions of pain is still an area in which relatively little research has been conducted.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Lactating sows {{generally}} have problems dissipating their body heat to the <b>environment.</b> <b>Cooling</b> the floor under the sow’s shoulder, called the cool-sow system, {{is a method}} to increase body heat removal by conduction, thereby contributing to the thermal comfort of the sow. In this study, {{the effect of the}} cool-sow system on the performance of the sow and her piglets in the farrowing room and on the position of the sow in the farrowing crate was determined. In total, 60 sows (parity between 2 and 5) were included in the study. One room with 12 pens was used during five batches in autumn, spring, and summer. During each batch, the floors were cooled in six randomly chosen pens, while the other six pens were used as reference pens. The sows on the cool-sow system had 0. 6 kg higher average daily feed intake (P < 0. 001). These sow’s piglets grew 20 g per day per piglet faster (P < 0. 001). There was no effect on the loss of bodyweight of the sow or on piglet mortality. The sows on the cool-sow system showed a higher feed intake during all five batches, not only during summer batches. Sow position and location in the crate was hardly affected by the cool-sow system. The cool-sow system removed on average 107 W of heat per pen, of which approximately 58 W was directly removed from the sow’s body...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{minerals}} (calcite, chalcedony, quartz, opal, fl uorite, heulandite, strontianite) {{residing in}} open cavities in the Miocene rhyolite tuffs of Yucca Mountain, Nevada have been interpreted by some researchers as 2 ̆ 2 speleothemic 2 ̆ 2 formations, deposited {{as a result}} of downward infi ltration of meteoric waters (DOE, 2001, Whelan et al., 2002). The major mineral of the paragenesis, calcite, shows spectacular trend of the textural and crystal morphology change: from anhedral granular occurrences, through (optional) platelet, bladed and scepter varieties, to euhedral blocky morphologies. The trend is consistent with the overall decrease in the supesaturation of the mineral forming solution. Stable isotope properties of calcite evolve from 13 C-enriched (δ 13 C = + 4 to + 9 ‰ PDB) at early stages of growth to 13 C-depleted (- 5 to - 10 ‰) at late stages. The non-cyclic character of the isotope record and extreme variations of isotopic values argue against the meteoric origin of mineral forming fl uids. The δ 13 C 3 ̆e 4 ‰ PDB require isotope partitioning between dissolved CO 2 and CH 4, which is only possible in reducing anoxic environment, but not in aerated vadose zone. Fluid inclusions studied in calcite, quartz and fluorite revealed that the minerals were deposited from thermal solutions. The temperatures were higher at early stages of mineral growth (60 to 85 °C) and declined with time. Most late-stage calcites contain only all-liquid inclusions, suggesting temperatures less than ca. 35 - 50 °C. Minerals collected close to the major fault show the highest temperatures. Gases trapped in fluid inclusions are dominated by CO 2 and CH 4; Raman spectrometry results suggest the presence of aromatic/cyclic hydrocarbon gases. The gas chemistry, thus, also indicates reduced (anoxic) character of the mineral forming fluids. Secondary minerals at Yucca Mountain have likely formed during the short-term invasion(s) of the deep-seated aqueous fluids into the vadose zone. Following the invasion, fluids, initially equilibrated with the deep (reduced, anoxic) environment, evolved toward equilibrium with the new <b>environment</b> (<b>cooling,</b> degassing, mixing with shallow oxidizing waters, etc.). While some features of mineralization are compatible with the 2 ̆ 2 speleothemic 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 meteoric infiltration 2 ̆ 2 model, most of the evidence does not lend itself to rational explanation within this model...|$|E

30|$|Logging images reveal {{numerous}} features, between other breakouts and induced fractures. From {{the drilling}} operation without any return of fluid to surface (for depths beyond around 3300  m) {{we can assume}} that the pressure in the wellbore during drilling was very close to the pressure in the fluid-filled fracture systems intersected by the well.

40|$|Strategies to {{mitigate}} climate change can protect {{different types of}} <b>cool</b> <b>environments.</b> Two are receiving much attention: protection of ephemeral refuges (i. e., places with low maximum temperatures) and of stable refugia (i. e., places that are cool, have a stable environment, and are isolated). Problematically, they are often treated as equivalents. Careful delineation of their qualities is needed to prevent misdirected conservation initiatives; yet, no one has determined whether protecting one protects the other. We mapped both types of <b>cool</b> <b>environments</b> across a large (∼ 3. 4 M ha) mixed-use landscape with a geographic information system and conducted a patch analysis to compare their spatial distributions; examine relations between land use and their size and shape; and assess their current protection status. With a modest, but arbitrary, threshold for demarcating both types of <b>cool</b> <b>environments</b> (i. e., values below the 0. 025 quantile) there were 146, 523 ha of ephemeral refuge (62, 208 ha) and stable refugia (62, 319 ha). Ephemeral refuges were generally aggregated at high elevation, and more refuge area occurred in protected areas (55, 184 ha) than in unprotected areas (7, 024 ha). In contrast, stable refugia were scattered across the landscape, and more stable-refugium area occurred on unprotected (40, 135 ha) than on protected land (22, 184 ha). Although sensitivity analysis showed that varying the thresholds that define <b>cool</b> <b>environments</b> affected outcomes, it also exposed the challenge of choosing a threshold for strategies to address climate change; {{there is no single}} value that is appropriate for all of biodiversity. The degree of overlap between ephemeral refuges and stable refugia revealed that targeting only the former for protection on currently unprotected land would capture ∼ 17 % of stable refugia.
