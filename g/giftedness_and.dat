40|$|Dabrowski {{presents}} {{a theory of}} personality development based on a multilevel, hierarchical view of life. The theory suggests individual developmental potentials are important factors in determining the course of personality growth. Developmental potential includes three aspects; special talents and abilities, a physiological measure of neural reactivity Dabrowski called overexcitability (OE) and a factor describing an inner motivation to develop. Individuals with strong developmental potential tend to experience frequent and intense crises (positive disintegrations) that create opportunities {{for the development of}} an autonomous, self-crafted personality. Dabrowski observed that gifted and creative populations tend to exhibit increased levels of developmental potential and thus may be predisposed to experience the process of positive disintegration. While recent work has focussed on the link between overexcitability <b>and</b> <b>giftedness,</b> developmental potential <b>and</b> <b>giftedness</b> are not synonymous, indeed, many (most) with developmental potential will not be classified as gifted, and many gifted will display little overall developmental potential. A brief overview of Dabrowski's theory and its relevance for gifted individuals are presented. Pape...|$|R

Principal components analysis, as well as analyses of correlations between scores on the Ksiazak Adult <b>Giftedness</b> Scale <b>and</b> other measures, were performed to answer three research questions: 1) Can a reliable measure of characteristics of adult giftedness be developed? 2) Can a valid measure of characteristics of adult <b>giftedness</b> be developed? <b>and</b> 3) What is the factor structure of a measure of characteristics of adult giftedness? Results indicated that the Ksiazak Adult Giftedness Scale has adequate reliability and validity and appears to have a unifactorial structure.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} {{from a range}} of sources that indicates that South and East Asian background students are academically outperforming their peers in Australian primary and secondary schools (see, for example, Khoo and Birrell, 2002; Marks et al., 2000; Mcinerney, 2008; Paar and Mok, 1995). Th{{is evidence}} ranges from tertiary enrolment figures and the enrolment statistics of academically selective programs, through to school achievement records and research studies. Several explanations for the superior academic outcomes have been posited by researchers. These have included their work ethic, motivation and aspirations, and the support and expectations of their parents. While these explanations have some appeal for educators, they have not been brought together into one theoretical construct. Therefore, this chapter will examine these differences between the South and East Asian background students and their peers in Australian schools through the analytical lenses of the actiotope model of <b>giftedness</b> (Ziegler, 2005) <b>and</b> its logical companion, a systemic approach to <b>giftedness</b> (Ziegler <b>and</b> Phillipson, 2012) ...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{believe that}} the {{isolation}} experienced by gifted individuals is not caused by giftedness itself, but by society's response to <b>giftedness.</b> Plucker <b>and</b> Levy have noted that, [...] "in this culture, {{there appears to be}} a great pressure for people to be 'normal' with a considerable stigma associated with giftedness or talent." [...] To counteract this problem, gifted education professionals recommend creating a peer group based on common interests and abilities. The earlier this occurs, the more effective it is likely to be in preventing isolation.|$|R
50|$|Formerly {{known as}} a patriarchal blessing, the evangelist's blessing serves as an {{opportunity}} for God to affirm and support persons in their life ventures. It is an experience of laying on of hands and prayer focusing on God’s accepting and creative love {{in the life of the}} person, family, or congregation. The blessing is a defining experience to help persons know who they are, their value <b>and</b> <b>giftedness,</b> purpose <b>and</b> meanings of life. It helps persons to refocus their lives according to the purposes of God and God’s call to them. The sacrament may be extended to individuals, families, or congregations. There are no age, race, gender, membership, or life conditions that restrict persons from sharing in this sacrament. Recording of the blessing is optional. An evangelist's blessing may be requested more than once, at different junctures of a person’s life. Sharing with the evangelist as a spiritual companion is an integral part of the total blessing experience. This sacrament is performed by members of the Order of Evangelists.|$|R

5000|$|Francoy Gagne's (2000) Differentiated Model of <b>Giftedness</b> <b>and</b> Talent (DMGT) is a {{developmental}} theory that distinguishes giftedness from talent, offering explanation on how outstanding natural abilities (gifts) develop into specific expert skills (talents).

40|$|Within disciplines, certain theoretical, ontological, and {{heuristic}} frameworks evolve toward axiomatic status over time. This evolution {{can limit}} disciplinary growth.

This theoretical essay provides educators with new ways of thinking about teaching disadvantaged gifted youth. Differentiation, an educational philosophy, is reconceptualized as a form of critical pedagogy termed critical differentiation. The concept of the twice oppressed is presented. This concept suggests that it is possible for children to be oppressed based on social category as well as gifted classification. As {{in the case of the}} twice exceptional child who may struggle in classrooms with both dyslexia <b>and</b> <b>giftedness,</b> the twice oppressed child may struggle with both poverty <b>and</b> <b>giftedness.</b> Critical differentiation, or a merger of critical pedagogy and differentiation, may become a step toward resolving this conundrum.
