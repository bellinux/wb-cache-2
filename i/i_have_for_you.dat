500|$|It {{was then}} an annual custom for the Pope {{to receive a}} {{delegation}} from Rome's Jewish community shortly after the New Year. The meeting on 2 February 1859 quickly descended into a heated argument, with Pope Pius berating the Jewish visitors for [...] "stirring up a storm all over Europe about this Mortara case". When the delegation denied that the Jews of Rome had had any hand in the anti-clerical articles, the Pope dismissed Scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish, then shouted: [...] "The newspapers can write all they want. I couldn't care less what the world thinks!" [...] The Pope then calmed down somewhat: [...] "So strong is the pity <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> that I pardon you, indeed, I must pardon you." [...] One of the delegates proposed that the Church should not give so much credence to Morisi's testimony, given her spurious morals—the Pope countered that regardless of her character, so {{far as he could}} see the servant had no reason to invent such a story, and in any case Momolo Mortara should not have employed a Catholic in the first place.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good God!" [...] {{he burst}} out at last, [...] "what a miserable thing a woman's love is to a man's! I could commit crimes for you,--and you can balance and choose in that way.

Now, my dear, I'll tell you fairly what I think, and what all the world is saying. He ought {{not to think of}} Parliament. He ought not, indeed, my dear. I speak for your sake, and your child's. He is not a man of fortune, and he ought not to think of Parliament. He has a very fine situation, and he really should be contented.' ...|$|E
60|$|Miss N. To pursue me; and if {{they find}} me alone, by chance to {{compliment}} me with such speeches as you make? That would be pleasure indeed! Answer me here in return, Clive. Have I ever disguised from any of my friends the regard <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>you?</b> Why should I? Have not I taken your part when you were maligned? In former days, when--when Lord Kew asked me, as he {{had a right to}} do then--I said it was as a brother I held you; and always would. If I have been wrong, it has been for two or three times in seeing you at all--or seeing you thus; in letting you speak to me as you do--injure me as you do. Do you think I have not hard enough words said to me about you, but that you must attack me too in turn? Last night only, because you were at the ball,--it was very, very wrong of me to tell you I was going there,--as we went home, Lady Kew--Go, sir. I never thought you would have seen in me this humiliation.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile here we are--and when do {{you mean}} to come to see us, pray? Mind, I hold by the skirts of the vision for next winter. Why, surely you won't talk of 'disturbances' and 'revolutions,' and the like disloyal reasons which send our brave countrymen flying on all sides, as if every {{separate}} individual expected to be bombarded per se. Now, mind you come; dear dear Mr. Kenyon, how delighted past expression we should be to see you! Ah, do you fancy that I have no regret for our delightful gossips? If I have the feeling I told you of for Balzac and George Sand, what must <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>you?</b> Now come, and let us see you! And still sooner, if you please, write to us--and write of yourself and in detail--and tell us particularly, first if the winter has left no sign of a cough with you, and next, what you mean by something which suggests to my fancy that you have a book in the course of printing. Is that true? Tell me all about it--all! Who can be interested, pray, if I am not? For your and Mr. Chorley's and Mr. Forster's kind dealings with Robert's poems I thank you gratefully; and as a third volume can bring up the rear quickly in the case of success, I make no wailing for my 'Luria,' however dear it may be.[175] ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{have seen}} this letter in which you tell me {{there is so much}} [...] galimatias, and I assure you that I have not found any at all. On [...] the contrary, I find {{everything}} very plainly expressed, and among [...] others, one which is too explicit for my satisfaction—namely, what [...] you have said to Madame de Rambouillet, that if you tried to imagine [...] a perfectly happy life for yourself, it would be to pass it all alone [...] with Mademoiselle de Rambouillet. You know whether any one can be [...] more persuaded than I am of her merit; but I confess to you that that [...] has not prevented me from being surprised that you could entertain a [...] thought which did so great an injury to our friendship. As to [...] believing that you said this to one, and wrote it to the other, [...] simply for the sake of paying them an agreeable compliment, I have [...] too high an esteem for your courage to be able to imagine that [...] complaisance would cause you thus to betray the sentiments of your [...] heart, especially on a subject in which, as they were unfavorable to [...] me, I think you would have the more reason for concealing them, the [...] affection which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> being so well known to every one, and [...] especially to Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, so that I doubt whether [...] she will not have been more sensible of the wrong you have done me, [...] than of the advantage you have given her. The circumstance of this [...] letter falling into my hands has forcibly reminded me of these lines [...] of Bertaut: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do lack courage. That's just it," [...] said Mrs. Gresham, still {{giving a}} twist {{here and a}} set there {{to some of the}} small sprigs which {{constituted}} the background of her bouquet. [...] "I do lack courage--to have ill motives imputed to me. I was thinking of saying something, and I am afraid, and therefore I will not say it. And now, if you like, I will be ready to take you out in ten minutes." [...] But Miss Dunstable {{was not going to be}} put off in this way. And to tell the truth, I must admit that her friend Mrs. Gresham was not using her altogether well. She should either have held her peace on the matter altogether--which would probably have been her wiser course--or she should have declared her own ideas boldly, feeling secure in her own conscience as to her own motives. [...] "I shall not stir from this room," [...] said Miss Dunstable, [...] "till I have had this matter out with you. And as for imputations--my imputing bad motives to you--I don't know how far you may be joking, and saying what you call sharp things to me; but you have no right to think that I should think evil of you. If you really do think so, it is treason to the love <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> If I thought that you thought so, I could not remain in the house with you. What, you are not able to know the difference which one makes between one's real friends and one's mock friends! I don't believe it of you, and I know you are only striving to bully me." [...] And Miss Dunstable now took her turn of walking up and down the room.|$|E
