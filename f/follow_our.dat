500|$|A {{letter to}} Hagenauer dated 16 August {{indicated}} that Leopold wished {{to proceed to}} Turin, then across northern Italy to Venice, and home via the Tyrol. [...] "Our own interest and love of travel should have induced us to <b>follow</b> <b>our</b> noses", he wrote, but added: [...] "...I have said I shall go [...] home and I shall keep my word". The family took a shorter route through Switzerland, arriving in Geneva on 20 August, where the children gave two concerts, and were received by the distinguished composer André-Ernest-Modeste Grétry. Many years later Grétry wrote of this encounter: [...] "I wrote for him [...] an Allegro in E flat, difficult but without pretension; he played it, and everyone, except myself, {{thought it was a}} miracle. The child had never broken off, but following the modulations, he had substituted a number of passages for those I had written". This claim, that Wolfgang improvised when faced with passages he could not play, appears to be the only adverse comment from all those called upon to test him.|$|E

2500|$|However, in the 1950s {{the critics}} who heralded {{the arrival of}} the French New Wave, {{especially}} those associated with Cahiers du Cinéma, found Clair's work old-fashioned and academic. François Truffaut wrote harshly of him after seeing The Flame of New Orleans: [...] "We don't <b>follow</b> <b>our</b> elders in paying the same tribute to Renoir and Clair. There is no film by Clair which matches the invention and wit of Renoir's Tire au flanc.... Clair makes films for old ladies who go to the cinema twice a year." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sandé {{said she}} wanted her music {{to be remembered as}} that of Nina Simone, one of her {{favourite}} artists. She {{went on to say that}} Nina Simone achieved this for herself and writing her own songs is the best way possible. She also said [...] "These days nothing lasts, music is like fast food, you're in then you're out. She said, as much as she would like, she would never play the piano as well as Simone, but she would give it her best shot. She loves the songs Simone produced, including [...] "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free" [...] and Simone's version of [...] "I Think It's Going to Rain Today". She said that Simone's original songs are very poetic and she said [...] "So when I listen to commercial stuff at the moment, I'm just thinking 'haven't you heard Nina Simone, haven't you heard how a song should be written?" [...] She went on to say [...] "We choose and consume, feast and forget, then rush on to the next hot thing. There's no point chasing that kind of success because it's so transient. Far better to <b>follow</b> (<b>our)</b> own paths and be true to (ourselves)." ...|$|E

"Mabel," [...] Lunn wrote, [...] "was invincibly English and I {{was much}} consoled during the dark days of 1940 {{by the fact}} that her {{confidence}} in final victory was never shaken." [...] Lunn once said something nice to their daughter Jaqueta about the latter's courage during an air raid. For this he was later reproved by Mabel. [...] "I want Jaqueta to feel," [...] she said, [...] "that the only thing which calls for comment in war time is cowardice." [...] Lunn was an agnostic when they married, and Mabel a devout Anglican, which she remained all her life. Lunn wrote: [...] "Mabel's husband, brother and three children became Catholics, but I never expected her to <b>follow</b> <b>our</b> example. Humanly speaking, she was bound to remain a member of the Church of England." [...] An Anglican vicar once asked Lunn to preach in his church. [...] "I asked you," [...] he said, [...] "because you have never written anything unpleasant about Anglicanism since you became a Roman Catholic." [...] But Lunn could never have written [...] "anything unpleasant" [...] about Mabel's Church, and when the first shock of his conversion was over, [...] "Mabel soon yielded not merely notional but real assent to the belief that the doctrinal differences which separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the Catholic were infinitely, yes infinitely, less than those which had separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the agnostic." ...|$|E
