40|$|Abstract Background In the Global Strategy for Malaria Control, one of {{the basic}} {{elements}} is early detection and prompt treatment of malaria cases, especially in areas where health care facilities are inadequate. Establishing or reviving the existing drug distribution centers (DDC) at the peripheral levels of health care can achieve this. The DDCs should be operationally feasible, acceptable by community and technical efficient, particularly in remote hard-core malaria endemic areas. Methods Volunteers from villages were selected for distribution of chloroquine and the selection was made either by villagers or head of the village. The services of the volunteers were absolutely free and voluntary in nature. Chloroquine was provided free of charge to all fever cases. The impact was evaluated based on the changes observed in fever days, fever incidence, parasite incidence and parasite prevalence (proportion of persons harbouring malaria parasite) in the community. Comparisons were made between 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd year of operation in the <b>experimental</b> <b>villages</b> and between the experimental and check areas. Results A total of 411 village volunteers in 378 <b>villages</b> in the <b>experimental</b> community health center with a population of 125, 439 treated 88, 575 fever cases with a mean annual incidence of 331. 8 cases per 1, 000 population during the three-year study period. The average morbid days due to fever (AFD) was reduced to 1. 6 ± 0. 1 from 5. 9 ± 2. 1 in the <b>experimental</b> <b>villages</b> while it remained at 5. 0 ± 1. 0 in the check villages. There was a significant reduction, (p 0. 05). In plain villages that were low endemic, the reductions in AFI and API in <b>experimental</b> <b>villages</b> were statistically significant (p nd and 3 rd year when compared with the check area (p 0. 0. 5). Mortality due to malaria declined by 75 % in the <b>experimental</b> <b>villages</b> in the adult age group whereas there was an increasing trend in check villages. Conclusion The study demonstrated that a passive chloroquine distribution system operated by village volunteers in tribal areas is feasible and effective in reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{a number}} of {{indigenous}} villages in Orissa, India, the possibility was explored that teaching of a new definition of health, the Meikirch model, might improve health behavior of inhabitants beyond what {{can be achieved by}} ordinary teaching. Methods: For this purpose, teaching about the Meikirch model was given in twenty <b>experimental</b> <b>villages</b> and conventional teaching about health in twenty control villages. Results: After 2 ½ years, health behavior in the two groups of villages was compared. Improvement of nutrition, wearing of slippers during use of latrines, washing of hands before meals, availability of latrines, childhood vaccination, use of mosquito nets, and attention to mother/child care were much better in experimental than in control villages (all P< 0. 001). Yet, in several aspects of the <b>experimental</b> <b>villages,</b> there was room for further improvement. Conclusion: It is concluded that the Meikirch model was understood by the inhabitants of the villages and they improved their health behavior.

Also, the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum between the 4 -week and 10 -week surveys was significantly lower among the 0 - 4 -year olds in villages with impregnated nets than in those with unimpregnated nets, leading to reduced prevalence of P. falciparum in this age group.

40|$|A U. S. National Institutes of Health-sponsored {{study was}} {{initiated}} in 1998, ending in 2002, {{to examine the}} hypothesis that bovines, buffaloes in particular, {{were responsible for the}} persistence of schistosomiasis in human populations living in and around Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, P. R. China. The two villages are the focus of this paper, the experimental Jishan Village and the control Hexi Village. The prevalence and intensity of infection of humans and buffaloes were determined. Then, all inhabitants of all the villages were treated with praziquantel, while only the buffaloes of the experimental (intervention) village were treated. Following treatment, rates of re-infection of people in the two villages and buffaloes in the <b>experimental</b> <b>village,</b> as well as the ongoing prevalence of infections in the buffaloes of the control village were monitored annually. Quantitative collections of snails were made pre- and post-flood for a total of nine seasons to determine the density of snails, density of infected snails, and prevalence of infected snails. Collections were made from ecologically different village zones and from hot spots for persistent snail infections within zones. The hypothesis was that treatments in the <b>experimental</b> <b>village</b> would drive down snail infections to 80 % or more below pre-trial levels. This paper makes the case that the intervention did not achieve reducing snail infections village-wide by even 50 % or more. The probable reasons for this failure are discussed. The significant findings of this longitudinal study are several: (1) Foremost, the intervention did not achieve the goal of significantly reducing snail infections in Jishan. (2) To understand the dynamics of Schistosoma japonicum transmission throughout large areas, such as the administrative villages of Hexi and Jishan, it is important to partition the area into clearly definable ecological zones. (3) We have found that the greatest risk of infection is in very small areas within zones that we call hot spots. (4) The most important indicator for risk of infection is the density of infected snails, not the prevalence. (5) There are very significantly more infected snails per area in hot spots than in non-hot spots. (6) Density of infected snails is not correlated with density of snails overall. (7) The sampling strategy of zones, squares, and random selection of 20 4 m(2) cells within squares has enabled robust statistical analyses of snail populations that have a strong negative binomial distribution. Sampling twice a year (before the floods and after the floods) for at least 8 or 9 seasons has provided a time series enabling a robust assessment of trends in the experimental and control villages.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{described}} {{the first part of}} an experimental study of the epidemiology of mouse typhoid. One set of data has been presented on the basis of which little or no analysis has been attempted. The immediate object has been rather to collect materials than to undertake to account for the phenomena encountered. It is obvious that the factors involved in the inquiry are intricate, but it is believed that they are not necessarily or all beyond disentanglement. About 500 mice in all have been studied in an <b>experimental</b> <b>village,</b> brought together in increments among a population in which mouse typhoid experimentally induced was prevailing. The results have been presented according to two phenomena; namely, mortality or death rate, and bacillus carriage rate. The material does not lend itself to consideration according to morbidity rates. If it were established that every instance of attack, when not fatal, was attended by carrier production for the bacillus of mouse typhoid, reliable morbidity tables could be constructed. In the absence of this certain criterion, the materials here presented can be dealt with only as mortality data. This fact is attended with obvious disadvantages in respect to the epidemiological material assembled regarding infectious disease in man. In spite, however, of the drawbacks, it is already evident that the results obtained by the sort of inquiry here described may come to throw no inconsiderable light on moot problems on the origin, mode of spread, and manner of decline of epidemic diseases in general. The analysis of the strains by selecting single cells and thus establishing substrains has yielded results which may eventually have value in explaining fluctuations in virulence. Among the positive data arising from the experiments with such cultures are, first, that there have been obtained by mechanical means from the ordinary bacteriologically pure culture, single cell strains exhibiting slightly different pathogenic activity, whether administered by mouth or parenterally, and second, that more regular results are obtained with intraperitoneal injections of these strains than with the parent strain. Among the negative results to be recorded are the failures of two single cell strains to incite an epidemic among mice under conditions known to be suitable when the parent strain is used...|$|E

40|$|Digital Green is a {{research}} project that seeks to disseminate targeted agricul-tural information to small and marginal farmers in India using digital video. The unique components of Digital Green are: (1) a participatory process for content production; (2) a locally generated digital video database; (3) a hu-man-mediated instruction model for dissemination and training; and (4) regi-mented sequencing to initiate new communities. Unlike some systems that ex-pect information or communication technology alone to deliver useful knowledge to marginal farmers, Digital Green works with existing, people-based extension systems and aims to amplify their effectiveness. While video provides a point of focus, it is people and social dynamics that ultimately make Digital Green work. Local social networks are tapped to connect farmers with experts, the thrill of appearing “on TV ” motivates farmers, and homophily is exploited to minimize the distance between teacher and learner.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addressed the}} issue of sustainable development at the level of individual behaviors. Environmental perceptions were obtained from people living around the biosphere reserve Chamela-Cuixmala in Jalisco, Mexico. Several environmental issues were identified by the people, such as garbage and grey water on the streets, burning plastics, and the lack of usage of recreational areas. All these issues could be addressed with a change in behavior by the villagers. Familiarization activities were conducted to gain people's trust in order to conduct a community forum. These activities included giving talks to school children and organizing workshops. Four different methodologies were generated using memetics and participation to test which would ameliorate those environmental issues identified by the people through a change in behavior. The methodologies were 1) Memes; 2) Participation and Memes; 3) Participation; 4) Neither Participation nor Memes. A meme is an idea expressed within a linguistic structure or architecture that provides it with self-disseminating and self-protecting characteristics within and among the minds of individuals congruent with their values, beliefs and filters. Four villages were chosen as the treatments, and one as the control, for a total of five <b>experimental</b> <b>villages.</b> A different behavior was addressed in each treatment village (garbage, grey-water, burning plastics, recreation.) A nonequivalent control-group design was established. A pretest was conducted in all five villages; the methodologies were tested in the four treatment villages; a posttest was conducted on the five villages. The pretest and posttest consisted in measuring sensory specific indicators which are manifestations of behavior that can either be seen, smelled, touched, heard or tasted. Statistically significant differences in behavior from the control were found for two of the methodologies 1) Memes (p= 0. 0403) and 2) Participation and Memes (p= 0. 0064). For the methodologies of 3) Participation alone and 4) Neither, the differences were not significant (p= 0. 8827, p= 0. 5627 respectively). When using memes, people's behavior improved when compared to the control. Participation alone did not generate a significant difference. Participation aided in the generation of the memes.

Burton is unusual for a musician in that her work is ephemeral, in-the-moment, and therefore recordings of her work are rare. She has collaborated with many notable experimental musicians and dancers, including LaDonna Smith, Davey Williams, Jane Scarpantoni, Judy Dunaway, David First, Rain Worthington, Gino Robair, Jack Wright, and Scott Walton.|$|R
40|$|Background: Partial mosquito-proofing {{of houses}} with screens and {{ceilings}} {{has the potential}} to reduce indoor densities of malaria mosquitoes. We wish to measure whether it will also reduce indoor densities of vectors of neglected tropical diseases. Methodology: The main house entry points preferred by anopheline and culicine vectors were determined through controlled experiments using specially designed <b>experimental</b> huts and <b>village</b> houses in Lupiro village, southern Tanzania. The benefit of screening different entry points (eaves, windows and doors) using PVC-coated fibre glass netting material in terms of reduced indoor densities of mosquitoes was evaluated compared to the control. Findings: 23, 027 mosquitoes were caught with CDC light traps; 77. 9 % (17, 929) were Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, of which 66. 2 % were An. arabiensis and 33. 8 % An. gambiae sensu stricto.

Chinese and Tibetan literature says he born in Vaideha desh(Vidarbha) and then was migrated to near by Satvahana dynesty. There much confusion in history between Mahayana sect founder Nagarjuna and alchemist Nagarjuna. There are evidences found of his <b>experimental</b> laboratory in <b>village</b> Nagalwadi in Maharashtra state. According to some evidences he has working on immortality and knows extraction of iron and mercury. There is much confusion about this author in the secondary literature. A 1984 study of manuscripts and printed editions connected with the alchemist Nāgārjuna found that his name is associated with a work titled Rasendramaṅgala but that the manuscripts of the Rasaratnākara are uniformly ascribed to a different author, Nityanātha Siddha.|$|R

From September 2007 to September 2009, during two year-period, measurements were done in Dallıca <b>village</b> <b>experimental</b> area in Bartın province. In this study, six field plots with a width of 1. 87 m were used. Three of them were 5. 5 m long (short plots) and remaining three were 11. 05 m long (long plots). Plots were located on bare soil surface that has no conservative vegetation. During the period of experimentation, a total of 158 rainy days were registered and average annual rainfall amount was 1194. 8 mm. Average annual runoff per square meter was 270. 81 mm, and 311. 27 mm in long and short plots, respectively. Average annual suspended sediment was 809. 68 g m- 2, and 766. 53 g m- 2 from long and short plots, respectively. While statistically {{significant differences were found}} in runoff amount from plots with different lengths, there were no statistically significant differences in terms of the amount of eroded sediment...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the question}} whether households in India’s semi-arid tropics {{can be expected to}} voluntarily maintain semi-public investments in soil and water conservation. Increasingly, public investment programs decentralise project planning, implementation and management to local communities, whereas it is unclear whether local communities can be expected to effectively manage these investments in the long run. The analysis in this dissertation suggests that to maintain a socially efficient level of soil and water conservation investments it is important that a strategic coalition of cooperative households exists. Also, the external environment plays an important role. Emerging labour markets, market access and resource scarcity all help determine whether individual households have an incentive to cooperate in semi-public good provision or not. Using <b>experimental</b> data on <b>village</b> trust levels, the analysis suggests that targeting investments at homogeneous communities might help improve project effectiveness, since communities with higher trust levels are more likely to maintain public investments than communities where trust is low. Finally, the analysis suggests that decentralising decision-making can also have a negative effect. When water is scarce, upstream investments in soil and water conservation might negatively affect farmers downstream. Hence, for community-based interventions to be welfare enhancing it is crucial that the potential externalities of decentralised decision-making are sufficiently addressed. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1960 s, video {{recorders}} became portable, leaving the television studio {{for the art}} gallery, the psychiatric hospital, and the streets. The technology of recording moving images on magnetic tape, previously of use only to broadcasters, became a tool for artistic expression, psychological experimentation, and political revolution. Video became portable not only materially but also culturally; it could be carried by an individual, {{but it could also}} be carried into institutions from the RAND Corporation to the Black Panther Party, from psychiatrists’ offices to art galleries, and from prisons to state-funded media access centers. Between 1967 and 1973, American videographers across many of these institutional contexts participated in a common discourse, sharing not only practical knowledge about the uses and maintenance of video equipment, but visions of its social significance, psychological effects, and utopian future. For many, video was a technology which would bring about a new kind of awareness, the communal consiousness that—influenced by the evolutionary philosophy of Henri Bergson—Pierre Teilhard de Chardin referred to as the noosphere and Marshall McLuhan as the global <b>village.</b> <b>Experimental</b> videographers across several fields were also influenced by the psychedelic research of the 1950 s and early 1960 s, by the development of cybernetics as a science of both social systems and interactions between humans and machines, by anthropology and humanistic psychology, and by revolutionary political movements in the United States and around the world. ...|$|R

(Relative ratio (RR) = 0. 91; 95 % CI = 0. 84, 0. 98; P = 0. 01); Mansonia africana (RR = 0. 43; 95 % CI = 0. 26, 0. 76; P< 0. 001) and Mansonia uniformis (RR = 0. 37; 95 % CI = 0. 25, 0. 56; P< 0. 001) but not Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. univittatus or Cx. theileri. Numbers of these species were reduced by screening windows and doors but this was not significant. This study confirms that across Africa, screening eaves protects households against important mosquito vectors of filariasis, Rift Valley Fever and O'Nyong nyong as well as malaria. While full house screening is required to exclude Culex species mosquitoes, screening of eaves alone or fitting ceilings has considerable potential for integrated control of other vectors of filariasis, arbovirus and malaria...|$|R
40|$|EVERY morning, Perumal Raja {{sets off}} to lay his nets, {{sitting on a}} boat made of a few {{rough-hewn}} logs lashed together. At first glance {{it looks like a}} piece of driftwood. But while his boat may be low-tech, he is armed with information from a thoroughly high-tech source. Unlike the thousands of other Indian fishermen who venture into the Bay of Bengal, Raja knows the latest weather forecasts and wave-height predictions, downloaded from a US Navy website. Raja lives in Veerinpattinam, a village of a hundred or so brick and palm-leaf houses on the lush coast outside Pondicherry, just south of Chennai (formerly Madras). The people here are partners in an <b>experimental</b> network of <b>village</b> centres that share information via computer. The aim is to show that giving rural people access to information, both local and global, can really make a difference to their lives. The information comes from the hub in nearby Villianur. Here, four full-time staff gather information, translate it into Tamil and send it to the villages, each of which has two or three computers. The weather reports are relayed to the fishermen every morning and evening via a loudspeaker perched on the knowledge centre´s roof. Villagers also go to the centres to find out the going rates for fish, rice and other produce in local markets, as well as what government benefits they´re entitled to and how to tackle crop diseases. They can even find adverts for brides and bridegrooms. "It is very useful for all kinds of things," Raja tells me through an interpreter. "I can find out the times of buses, and how much they cost. If I´m not feeling well, I can call a doctor. " Such information can save people a lot of time, which is important when you have to work long hours to make ends meet. Half the households here earn less than 1220 rupees (? 17. 50) a month. The centres also offer computer courses for just 50 rupees a month?about 70 pence. Villagers can also print out letters, say, for just 10 rupees, or surf the Net for 30 rupees a month. Volunteers have few problems acquiring computer skills. "I knew nothing about computers," says Boobathi Kasthuri, one of eight women volunteers who run the knowledge centre at the nearby farming village of Embalam. "Now I can type and operate them. " One of the keys to the network´s success is that although the PCs run Windows in English, the volunteers are taught in Tamil. At a meeting with local government officials, Kasthuri showed them how to type in Tamil script using a QWERTY keyboard. They offered her a job on the spot, but she didn´t have time to take it up. In Embalam, the centre was filled with barefooted children. The computers here occupy one room of the Hindu temple, and brightly painted gods look down from above. The teacher, Muthukrishna Reddiar Sunder, uses CD-ROMs to show the children things like cell division and the workings of the heart. "I couldn´t explain these things before," he says. "Now I can show them an animation. It is easy to understand. " It´s not just education that´s changing. The knowledge centres are challenging the ancient Indian divides of sex and caste. "Three out of the 10 centres were failures," admits Santhanakrishnan Sethilkumaran, a researcher at the M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) in Chennai, who helped to set up the project. They failed because they were in buildings owned by high caste families who wouldn´t let people of low caste enter. In Embalam, however, the people chose to devote a room of the temple to the project and allow everyone to enter, even though only high castes are usually allowed into Hindu temples. MSSRF also wanted women to run the centres, because {{women are more likely to}} pass on knowledge to others, especially children. But in a country where many women are not allowed to leave their villages, this idea didn´t always go down well. Two villages insisted that most of the volunteers be men. Despite these setbacks, the project is transforming lives. Working at the centres has given the volunteers confidence and earned them the respect of local officials. Now when they visit the local government office, the director sees them straight away and is much more willing to help. There are also plenty of small success stories, from people getting jobs they found out about through the centres, to groups of villagers discovering how to set up cooperatives to raise money for new businesses. But could it work elsewhere? Trying to get similar schemes off the ground in less developed countries would be difficult. India has the advantage of a high literacy rate. Yet even in India, where there are 600, 000 villages, the problem is finding someone to pay for the centres. The Pondicherry project, which is part-funded by the International Development Research Centre in Canada, was intended only to show that the concept works, says Subbiah Arunachalam, an information scientist at the MSSRF. "Success lies in convincing funding agencies to take it further. " In northern India, a group called Technology in Action for Rural Development is taking a radically different approach that owes more to McDonalds than to Gandhi. For the past year or so, a branch of TARA called TARAhaat has been setting up franchised knowledge centres called "tarakendras". The organisation is setting up centres around Bathinda in Punjab and Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. The idea is to make money by selling cheap services to villagers, including computer courses, Internet access and even children´s computer games. "We´re following the ´sachet model´," says Rakesh Kanna, chief operation officer of TARAhaat. When people tried to sell villagers bottles of shampoo for 40 rupees, nobody bought them, he explains. When they sold sachets for 5 rupees, it was a huge success. To set up a centre, local people must raise the money, so TARAhaat helps them obtain loans and computers and provides support. The hope is that as centres become profitable, they will provide money for new centres. In Punjab on a dry, dusty plain near the village of Lehra Mohabbat, 15 -year-old Jagsir Singh creates a PowerPoint presentation at breakneck speed. It´s hard to believe it´s only four months since he first touched a computer. "My family sent me here to learn," he says. The centre is a shop in a small arcade next to a power plant. Getting people to come was a problem, admits Sarjinder Sethi of TARAhaat. Villagers had to be tempted with free sewing classes or movies. But after a year things picked up. Those who come find it a real confidence builder, Sethi says. "They used to think only city people could learn computers," he says. "Now they can do better than the city people. " It has mainly helped girls, Sethi adds. Most could not leave their villages, so the tarakendras opened up a new world to them. There is no doubt that information centres are changing people´s lives. In every village, some are benefiting already and, given time, more should gain. And once people get the hang of the Internet, the only limit will be their imaginations. In Pondicherry, some villagers value the centres so much they´ve volunteered to pay some of their costs. Aid agencies and governments are unlikely to be able to fund centres in every village. And it´s doubtful that big bureaucracies can ensure the centres stay responsive to local needs?one reason for their success. By contrast, Tarahaat´s model might just let centres flourish on a grand scale. Not everyone is convinced. While Arunachalam wishes TARAhaat well, he is sceptical. "The business model won´t work," he says. "People in these villages have been poor for too long. " Indeed, some of the centres are struggling. Even so, the McDonalds approach seems to offer the best chance yet to bridge the digital divide between rich and poor.
