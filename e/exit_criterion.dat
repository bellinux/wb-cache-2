In addition, they typically formulate expectations regarding the creation and use of traceability in the project. For example, depending upon the criticality level of a requirement, the US Federal Aviation Authority guideline DO-178B/C requires traceability from requirements to design, and from requirements to source code and executable object code for software components of a system. Thereby, higher quality traceability information can simplify the certification process and help to establish trust in the maturity of the applied development process.|$|E

30|$|The third {{question}} of the second questionnaire addressed the Define <b>exit</b> <b>criteria</b> practice (# 7 in Fig. 7), since it was not identified as mandatory after the first data analysis. Subjects were asked whether {{it is possible to}} run a test process without explicit <b>exit</b> <b>criteria</b> (i.e. information about when test should stop). Based on 9 negative answers (i.e. 65 %), this practice was also included in the reduced set.|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we start}} by {{investigating}} the monotonicity {{of the proposed}} algorithm. Then we provide a specific <b>exit</b> <b>criterion</b> which certifies that algorithm converged to a fixed power and subcarrier allocation followed by a simple graphical illustration.|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Klein-Gordon equa- tion with an asymmetric double-well potential in spherical symmetry. <b>Exit</b> <b>criteria</b> are defined for the simulations {{that are used}} to help understand the boundaries of the basins of attraction for Gaussian "bubble" initial data. The first <b>exit</b> <b>criteria,</b> based on the immediate collapse or expan- sion of bubble radius, is used to observe the departure of the scalar field from a static intermediate attractor solution. The boundary separating these two behaviors in parameter space is smooth and demonstrates a time-scaling law with an exponent that depends on the asymmetry of the potential. The second <b>exit</b> <b>criteria</b> differentiates between the creation of an expanding true-vacuum bubble and dispersion of the field leaving the false vacuum; the boundary separating these basins of attraction is shown to demonstrate fractal behavior. The basins are defined by the number of bounces that the field undergoes before inducing a phase transition. A third, hybrid <b>exit</b> <b>criteria</b> is used to determine the location of the boundary to arbitrary precision and to characterize the threshold behavior. The possible effects this behavior might have on cosmological phase transitions are briefly discussed. Comment: 10 pages, 13 figures, 1 movie, resubmitted with additional paragraph.

30|$|Within this nested {{iterative}} regime, {{the software}} is optimised to spend no longer than necessary performing each stage. To achieve this, an <b>exit</b> <b>criterion</b> {{has been added to}} the inner most loop (the distortion diagnosis) to exit when a certain precision of registration has been achieved. If the mean of the incremental offset maps falls below some certain threshold, we can say that the registration has converged. In general, a value of 0.01 pixels represents a balance between computational speed and precision. In the accompanying code, the user may vary this parameter freely but is recommended not to go below 0.001 pixels as excessive computational time may result for no image quality benefit.|$|E

Although they outperformed the JPEG 2000 algorithm, the partitioning problem persists. In this paper, we present a segmentation based image compression technique which is based on Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) and Geometric wavelets. By using Binary Space partitioning technique the image is segmented recursively into a number of segments until an <b>exit</b> <b>criterion</b> is met and a tree is formed with all these segments.

For the 512 [*]×[*] 512 pixel raw data shown in Figs.  3 and 4 with 31 and 57 frames, respectively (three passes, 0.01 -pixel <b>exit</b> <b>criterion),</b> the total calculation times are shown alongside each condition.

As an extreme test of the MatLab™ code, a series of ten 4 k STEM images (4096 [*]×[*] 4096 pixel) were registered to an exit target of 0.05 pixels with three outermost update iterations. The total processing time was 1872  s (~ 31  min). For the STM data presented later, the equivalent processing time was 66  s. All times correspond to an Intel™ i 7 - 870 at 2.93  GHz personal computer. Further speed improvements could likely be realised if the MatLab™ code were migrated to a multi-core or GPU deployment.|$|E

The notions of conceptual overlap and facet are defined, together with their relation to scenarios of multiple inheritance in ontology models. Starting from the notion of a value partition, a terminology of ontology modelling constructs is introduced that allows the characterization of two types of conceptual overlap with respect to the domain concept being examined: internal and external. These considerations make explicit some of the implicit modelling decisions taken previously in the field of ontology modelling.

Because of the storage and memory capacity of the computer, research directed toward automated optimizing of individualized motor skills training is possible. Two studies that examined various training models in motor learning are presented. These models include the linear adaptive model, a learner-centered model. a shifting-difficulty model, and a fixed-difficulty model. Each of these training models was evaluated using a two-dimensional pursuit tracking task with an isometric controller. Feedback in terms of level of task difficulty and level of tracking performance was provided during training. The transfer task involved one seven-minute tracking session in which task difficulty shifted {{to one of three}} levels after each minute of tracking. Results for each training model are discussed in terms of training time required to reach the <b>exit</b> <b>criterion</b> and in terms of root-mean-square tracking error exhibited during the transfer task.

However, little research on reviewer assignment of software peer review has been found. In this study, an optimization approach is proposed based on students' preference matrix {{and the model}} of asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). Due to the most critical role of rule matrix in this approach, we conduct a questionnaire to obtain students' preference matrices and convert them to rule matrices. With the help of software ILOG CPLEX, the approach is accomplished by controlling the <b>exit</b> <b>criterion</b> of ATSP model. The comparative study shows that the assignment strategies with both reviewers' preference matrix and authors' preference matrix get better performance than the random assignment. Especially, {{it is found that}} the performance is just a little better than that of random assignment when the reviewers' and authors' preference matrices are merged.

40|$|Information on the {{existence}} of written <b>exit</b> <b>criteria,</b> as well as descriptions of existing criteria, was obtained from 178 surveys completed by early childhood education programs for handicapped children across the United States. Approximately half of the programs had formal written <b>exit</b> <b>criteria.</b> The most commonly cited criterion was chronological age. Other factors, such as formal test results, team staffing decisions, and the child’s developmental skill level, also played a role. Significant differences appeared between <b>exit</b> <b>criteria</b> listed by programs with formal written <b>exit</b> <b>criteria</b> and those of programs without. The basis for dismissing children from preschool special education programs varies widely across and within states. S With the enactment of Public Law 94 - 142, appropriate educational placement and ser-vice became the right of all children. Baker and Gottlieb (1980) believe that the principal concern of Public Law 94 - 142 is the notion that children be mainstreamed and served in the least restrictive environment. However, the extent to which children who are receiv-ing special services exit from special educa-tion programs into mainstream classrooms is uncertain. Much {{has been written about the}} early identification of children with handicaps and subsequent interventions (Caldwell, 1970; Hobbs, 1975; Lichtenstein & Ireton, 1984). In fact, all states have special education rules and regulations that specify eligibility criteria for receiving special education services. A major assumption of early identification and placement is that early intervention produces a significant positive effect (Lichtenstein & Ireton, 1984; Lidz, 1983). Longitudinal stud-ies have documented several benefits of early intervention, including higher rates of high school graduation and employment, as well as favorable cost/benefit analyse...|$|R

40|$|Cold water {{immersion}} (CWI) {{is the most}} effective known cooling treatment against exercise-induced hyperthermia. However, sex differences related to body composition (i. e. body fat, muscle mass, surface area, etc.) may affect core cooling rates in hyperthermic males and females. Purpose. To determine sex related differences in core cooling rates during CWI after exercise-induced hyperthermia. Methods. Ten male (M) and nine female (F) participants matched for body surface area to mass ratio took part in this study. Participants exercised at 65 % V˙O 2 max at an ambient temperature of 40 °C until rectal temperature (Tre) increased to 39. 5 °C. Following exercise, subjects were immersed in a 2 °C circulated water bath until Tre decreased to 37. 5 °C. Results. Females had a significantly greater core cooling rate compared to males. This was paralleled by a lower skin temperature and a shorter time to reach the <b>exit</b> <b>criterion.</b> Conclusion. We conclude that previously hyperthermic females have a 1. 7 times greater Tre cooling rate compared to males.

40|$|To date, perceptual errors {{occur in}} {{determining}} descent rate from a computer-generated image in flight simulation. Pilots tend {{to touch down}} twice as hard in simulation than in flight, and more training time is needed in simulation before reaching steady-state performance. Barnes suggested that recognition of range may be the culprit, and he cited that problems such as collimated objects, binocular vision, and poor resolution lead to poor estimation of the velocity vector. Brown's study essentially ruled out {{that the lack of}} binocular vision is the problem. Dorfel added specificity to the problem by showing that pilots underestimated range in simulated scenes by 50 % when 800 ft from the runway threshold. Palmer and Petitt showed that pilots are able to distinguish between a 1. 7 ft/sec and 2. 9 ft/sec sink rate when passively observing sink rates in a night scene. Platform motion also plays a role, as previous research has shown that the addition of substantial platform motion improves pilot estimates of vertical velocity and results in simulated touchdown rates more closely resembling flight. This experiment examined how some specific variations in the visual scene properties affect a pilot's perception of sink rate. It extended another experiment that focused on the visual and motion cues necessary for helicopter autorotations. In that experiment, pilots performed steep approaches to a runway. The visual content of the runway and its surroundings varied in two ways: texture and rectangular grid spacing. Four textures, included a no-texture case, were evaluated. Three grid spacings, including a no-grid case, were evaluated. The results showed that pilot better controlled their vertical descent rates when good texture cues were present. No significant differences were found for the grid manipulation. Using those visual scenes a simple psychophysics, experiment was performed. The purpose was to determine if the variations in the visual scenes allowed pilots to better perceive vertical velocity. To determine that answer, pilots passively viewed a particular visual scene in which the vehicle was descending at two different rates. Pilots had to select which of the two rates they thought was the fastest rate. The difference between the two rates changed using a staircase method, depending on whether or not the pilot was correct, until a minimum threshold between the two descent rates was reached. This process was repeated for all of the visual scenes {{to decide whether or not}} the visual scenes did allow pilots to perceive vertical velocity better among them. All of the data have yet to be analyzed; however, neither the effects of grid nor texture revealed any statistically significant trends. On further examination of the staircase method employed, a possibility exists that the lack of an evident trend may be due to the <b>exit</b> <b>criterion</b> used during the study. As such, the experiment will be repeated with an improved <b>exit</b> <b>criterion</b> in February. Results of this study will be presented in the submitted paper...|$|E

However, evidence concerning its effectiveness in grade I to III vesicoureteral reflux is lacking. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of urinary tract infection in young children with low grade vesicoureteral reflux. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children 1 month to 3 years old with grade I to III vesicoureteral reflux were assigned randomly to receive daily cotrimoxazole or no treatment, and followed for 18 months. A urinary tract infection constituted an <b>exit</b> <b>criterion.</b> Infection-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. RESULTS: A total of 225 children were enrolled in the study. Distribution of gender, age at inclusion and reflux grade were similar between the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of urinary tract infection between the 2 groups (17 % vs 26 %, p = 0. 2). However, a significant association was found between treatment and patient gender (p = 0. 017). Prophylaxis significantly reduced urinary tract infection in boys (p = 0. 013), most notably in boys with grade III vesicoureteral reflux (p = 0. 042). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce the overall incidence of urinary tract infection in children with low grade vesicoureteral reflux.

40|$|Aims: In {{the first}} place, to {{demonstrate}} that the economic behavior that neoclassical theory attributes to competitive firms is technically inefficient since it does not correspond to the highest possible internal rate of return, which implies the violation of the first theorem of welfare. Secondly, overcoming error in the economic behavior of competitive firms gives rise to the basic results of the theory of nonexistence of the labor market (TNLM), on which the theorem of superiority, a basic element of its construction, is finally proved. Methodology: The demonstration is carried out through a theorem based on the free entry and <b>exit</b> <b>criterion,</b> fully respecting the initial conditions and hypotheses of neoclassical theory. For all these effects the mathematics of restricted maximization and some concepts of convex optimization are used. Results: We show that with any internal rate of return higher than the one inherent to the maximization of profits and the same amount of resources determined by current walrasian prices, it is possible to produce more in a more competitive industry, which in turn means higher financing levels for consumers and therefore better situations in the sense of Pareto. Conclusion: It thus implies that neoclassical theory explains the operation of a market economy in which firms operate inefficiently even though they could overcome their own results; that is acting irrationally. Since efficient theoretical explanations are a prerequisite to efficient predictions, and the latter, necessary to establish efficient criteria to control explained phenomena, the evidence of explanatory inefficiencies shown in this research, have exposed the need to build efficient explanations of the functioning of a market economy. To that end seeks to contribute the theory of nonexistence of the labor market, whose pillars are the criticism and reconstruction of the theory of producer...|$|E
