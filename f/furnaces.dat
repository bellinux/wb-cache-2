5|$|Blast <b>furnaces</b> are {{currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast <b>furnaces</b> are much shorter than iron blast <b>furnaces</b> and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast <b>furnaces</b> {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast <b>furnaces</b> are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast <b>furnaces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling <b>furnaces,</b> Bessemer converters, open hearth <b>furnaces,</b> basic oxygen <b>furnaces,</b> and electric arc <b>furnaces.</b> In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|Blast <b>furnaces</b> {{used in the}} ISP have a {{more intense}} {{operation}} than standard lead blast <b>furnaces,</b> with higher air blast rates per m2 of hearth area and a higher coke consumption.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effective}} {{thermal conductivity}} coefficient of silicon carbide (SiC) synthesis materials and graphitization <b>furnace</b> insulation material {{were obtained by}} applying heat percolation theory and thermal coefficient equation of various layer-compositors. This paper proposed a further numerical analysis on the temperature distribution of SiC <b>furnace,</b> lengthwise graphitization (LWG) <b>furnace</b> and Co-production <b>furnace</b> by open source finite element software FEPG. The {{results show that the}} Co-production <b>furnace</b> can produce SiC after finishing graphitization production and Co-production <b>furnace’s</b> energy consumption subtract energy consumption of LWG <b>furnace,</b> SiC production energy consumption of Co-production <b>furnace</b> is half and SiC yield of Co-production <b>furnace</b> is 57 - 73 percent of same type of SiC <b>furnace.</b> Besides, applying Co-production process could reduce the exhaust of whole LWG <b>furnace...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{conveyor}} belt <b>furnace</b> is a <b>furnace</b> uses a conveyor or belt to carry process parts or material through the primary heating chamber for rapid thermal processing. It {{is designed for}} fast drying and curing of products and is nowadays widely used in the firing process of thick film and metallization process of solar cell manufacturing.

5|$|In contrast, air <b>furnaces</b> (such as reverberatory <b>furnaces)</b> are {{naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast <b>furnaces.</b> However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft <b>furnaces</b> used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E
5|$|Coal was {{the almost}} {{exclusive}} {{fuel for the}} pre-dreadnought period, though navies made the first experiments with oil propulsion in the late 1890s. An extra knot or two of speed could be gained by applying a 'forced draught' to the <b>furnaces,</b> where air was pumped into the <b>furnaces,</b> but this risked damage to the boilers.|$|E
5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{the demands for}} {{charcoal}} used in the blast and cupola <b>furnaces</b> of the iron industry led to large amounts of deforestation of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese began using coke made from bituminous coal as fuel for their metallurgic <b>furnaces</b> instead of charcoal derived from wood.|$|E
50|$|Mt. Hope <b>Furnace,</b> aka Hopewell <b>Furnace,</b> was a coke-burning <b>furnace</b> {{located at}} one time behind the caretaker's house at the {{original}} Camp Aliquippa.

5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating <b>furnaces</b> of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The <b>furnaces</b> had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the <b>furnaces</b> ran up {{the walls of the}} basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.|$|E
5|$|The blast <b>furnaces</b> {{used in the}} Imperial Smelting Process ("ISP") were {{developed}} from the standard lead blast furnace, but are fully sealed. This is because the zinc produced by these <b>furnaces</b> is recovered as metal from the vapor phase, {{and the presence of}} oxygen in the off-gas would result in the formation of zinc oxide.|$|E

50|$|The <b>furnace</b> {{was first}} put into blast on January 31, 1888, in a {{ceremony}} attended by Bellefonte native and ex-governor Andrew Curtin. Two months later, Valentine <b>Furnace,</b> another hot blast iron <b>furnace,</b> had also gone into blast {{on the south side}} of Bellefonte. While Valentine <b>Furnace</b> was operated separately from Bellefonte <b>Furnace,</b> Shoemaker and the Collins brothers had engineered and built the Nittany Valley Railroad, which supplied ore to Valentine <b>Furnace.</b>|$|R
40|$|In reactor <b>furnace,</b> {{due to high}} {{temperature}} and high pressure, data can be measured only near the <b>furnace</b> wall. In this paper, the way to estimate temperature distribution in a reactor <b>furnace</b> using measured data near the <b>furnace</b> walls and to control temperature distribution to the desired temperature distribution was studied. In the estimation, SQP method is employed using measured data near the <b>furnace</b> walls. As the result, the whole temperature distribution in a <b>furnace</b> could be obtained from such limited data. Furthermore, to control the temperature distribution in a reactor <b>furnace,</b> gas flow from multiple tuyeres and supplying material for controlling temperature distribution in a reactor <b>furnace</b> were determined by the SQP method. It was shown that temperature distribution in a <b>furnace</b> was regulated to achieve various desired distribution.

5|$|The oldest known blast <b>furnaces</b> in the West {{were built}} in Dürstel in Switzerland, the Märkische Sauerland in Germany, and at Lapphyttan in Sweden, where the complex was active between 1205 and 1300. At Noraskog in the Swedish parish of Järnboås, {{there have also been}} found traces of blast <b>furnaces</b> dated even earlier, {{possibly}} to around 1100. These early blast <b>furnaces,</b> like the Chinese examples, were very inefficient compared to those used today. The iron from the Lapphyttan complex was used to produce balls of wrought iron known as osmonds, and these were traded internationally – a possible reference occurs in a treaty with Novgorod from 1203 and several certain references in accounts of English customs from the 1250s and 1320s. Other <b>furnaces</b> of the 13th to 15th centuries have been identified in Westphalia.|$|E
5|$|After {{four and}} a half months of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service in Naples. He was surprised to find seven small glass factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration <b>furnaces</b> that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The <b>furnaces</b> would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E

This paper aims to construct mathematical description for control of a reactor <b>furnace.</b> Further, the linear-quadratic-gaussian control system for a reactor <b>furnace</b> is proposed, which estimates inner <b>furnace</b> temperature distribution using measured data near <b>furnace</b> wall. Temperature distribution of a <b>furnace</b> is controlled based on the estimated inner temperature distribution changing of boundary conditions of a <b>furnace.</b> The practicability of the proposed control method was checked through numerical experiments...|$|R

5|$|Characteristic of the Roman times iron {{industry}} were huge centers of metallurgy. One such concentration of ironworks, in Świętokrzyskie Mountains, which already produced iron on an industrial {{scale in the}} 1st century AD, in the 2nd and 3rd centuries became Barbaricum's largest. It may {{have been responsible for}} the majority of the iron supplied for barbarian weapon production during the Marcomannic Wars. The iron product was obtained in rather small, single-use smelting <b>furnaces.</b> One furnace's iron output was from a few to 20kg, which required 10 to 200kg of ore and the same amount of charcoal. The satisfaction of so much need for charcoal caused significant deforestation of the areas surrounding the iron centers. Not only turf, but also hematite ores were utilized, which involved building mines and shafts to provide access. The <b>furnaces</b> in Świętokrzyskie Mountains were grouped into large complexes, located in forested areas, away from human settlements. There could have had been as many as 700,000 smelting <b>furnaces</b> built in that area; one big concentration of the Przeworsk culture's spent <b>furnaces</b> (2nd-3rd centuries) was located in Nowa Słupia, Kielce County. The second largest iron production center functioned at that time in Masovia, west of Warsaw, with the total number of <b>furnaces</b> there, in which only turf ores were used, estimated at up to 200,000. They were operated as very large complexes, with several thousand <b>furnaces</b> at a time located near populated areas, where intermediate products were processed further. Those two great concentrations of metallurgical industry produced iron largely for long distance trade; to fulfill local requirements and on smaller scale iron was obtained at a number of other locations.|$|E

5|$|The oldest extant blast <b>furnaces</b> {{were built}} during the Han Dynasty of China in the 1st century AD. However, cast iron farm tools and weapons were {{widespread}} in China by the 5th century BC, while 3rd century BC iron smelters employed an average workforce of {{over two hundred}} men. These early <b>furnaces</b> had clay walls and used phosphorus-containing minerals as a flux. The effectiveness of the Chinese blast furnace was enhanced during this period by the engineer Du Shi (c.31AD), who applied the power of waterwheels to piston-bellows in forging cast iron.|$|E
5|$|Those {{tending the}} <b>furnaces</b> were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the <b>furnaces</b> open, more oxygen was drawn into the <b>furnaces,</b> which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been {{weakened}} over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E
5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast <b>furnaces</b> date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast <b>furnaces</b> during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola <b>furnaces</b> utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E
