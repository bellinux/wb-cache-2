40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} pro-active comparable worth legislation, covering {{both the public and}} private sectors, on wages, employment and the gender gap. Our focus is the pay equity initiative adopted by the Canadian province of Ontario in the early 1990 s. Our preliminary finding is that the law fell short of its goal of reducing gender based wage differentials. Firm surveys indicate that the effect of the legislation was blunted by lack of compliance in small private firms, the low incidence of undervalued female work in larger firms, and more generally the lack of male comparators for <b>female</b> <b>jobs.</b> These sorts of problems would appear endemic to any attempt to extend comparable worth to the private sector of a decentralized labor market. Our analysis of individual level data, which uses difference [...] in [...] difference models, kernel regressions and kernel density estimations, suggests that even in those sectors where the legislation had ``bite'' (among non-unionized workers in larger establishments), any positive effects on the wages of <b>females</b> in <b>female</b> <b>jobs</b> were very modest. Our most consistently estimated effects of the law on wages are negative: slower wage growth for <b>females</b> in male <b>jobs</b> and for males in <b>female</b> <b>jobs.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This study explores how {{warmth and}} {{competence}} perceptions affect hireability of a <b>female</b> <b>job</b> candidate. The mixed model of stereotype content identifies warmth and competence {{as the two}} basic dimensions of person-perception, and research has shown a compensatory relationship between these two dimensions, especially for women. This study explores this compensatory effect for women in a hiring situation. Two samples, one of college students (n = 301) and another of MTurk participants (n = 256), read {{a description of a}} <b>female</b> <b>job</b> candidate of either high or low competence and either high, low, or no mention of warmth, and then rated her hireability. Candidates had the greatest hireability when high in competence, and competence had a greater effect on hireability than warmth. Warmth and competence perceptions were positively related, reflecting a halo effect, such that higher warmth was inferred from higher competence. Implications for hiring decisions of female professionals are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{discrimination}} and oppression, women have utilized self-protective strategies to maintain a positive sense of self. These strategies include attributing negative feedback, when possible, to discrimination {{rather than to the}} self. The present study expands understanding of the relationship between stigma and cognitive processes by focusing on reconstructive memory. Female undergraduate students (N= 34) completed the Women and Stigma Scale. One week later, subjects read and recalled a story about a <b>female</b> <b>job</b> candidate which included some positive and negative comments about her academic credentials. Regression analyses indicated that as expected, the more stigmatized a woman is, the more negative versus positive reconstructive errors she makes when recalling a story about a job applicant. This study has serious implications for how stigmatization can negatively affect a woman's way of viewing the world. Highly stigmatized women tend to reconstruct more negative pieces of information about a <b>female</b> <b>job</b> applicant than those women who are destigmatized. Future research will explore how this phenomenon might extend to information processing about the self.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{determine}} the constraints to and opportunities for organising the gendered home-based care sector in post apartheid South Africa. Also the gender aspect of care work has been closely examined and the study has revealed that societal stereotypes that view care work as women work in the private sphere have to a greater extent contributed to the devaluation of care work in both society and as a form of paid care work. Qualitative research methodology was used in the form of documentary analysis, interviews and participant observation. The research findings demonstrate that unions themselves, resources and legislation/ policy issues pose as major barriers to organising these atypical workers. Generally, most unions are not yet ready to embrace informal workers into the mainstream as it entails innovation of new organising strategies that could be out of their comfort zone, the pumping out of a vast amount of resources and the avoidance of the huge obligation of breaking through legal barriers. Grassroot mobilising around gender needs has been proposed as the most appropriate strategy for organising the newly emerging mobile and precarious workforce which comprises principally of women. An undeniable link between the formal and informal economy has also been confirmed as formal institutions such as NGOs, hospital, clinics and private companies through the Expanded Public Works Programme here in South Africa make use of informal labour to execute their obligations in the HBC sector. From a gender perspective, this study argues that <b>female</b> <b>jobs</b> are despised by society let alone trade unions where democracy and gender sensitivity should be practiced. Devaluation of <b>female</b> <b>jobs</b> herein care work could be the reason why NEHAWU has taken too long to organise the HBC sector. Finally, results of the study have demistified the societal stereotypes that <b>female</b> <b>jobs</b> are difficult to organise as HBC workers were more than willing to join NEHAWU...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} some of the factors that influence outside reviewers and search committee members when they are reviewing curricula vitae, particularly with respect to the gender of the name on the vitae. The participants in this study were 238 male and female academic psychologists who listed a university address in the 1997 Directory of the American Psychological Association. They were each sent one of four versions of a curriculum vitae (i. e., <b>female</b> <b>job</b> applicant, male <b>job</b> applicant, <b>female</b> tenure candidate, and male tenure candidate), along with a questionnaire and a self-addressed stamped envelope. All the curricula vitae actually came from a real-life scientist at two different stages in her career, but the names were changed to traditional male and female names. Although an exclusively between-groups design was used to avoid sparking gender conscious responding, the results indicate that the participants were clearly able to distinguish between the qualifications of the job applicants versus the tenure candidates, as evidenced by suggesting higher starting salaries, increased likelihood of offering the tenure candidates a job,granting them tenure, and greater respect for their teaching, research, and service records. Both men and women were more likely to vote to hire a male job applicant than a <b>female</b> <b>job</b> applicant with an identical record. Similarly, both sexes reported that the male job applicant had done adequate teaching,research, and service experience compared to the <b>female</b> <b>job</b> applicant with an identical record. In contrast,when men and women examined the highly competitive curriculum vitae of the real-life scientist who had gotten early tenure, they were equally likely to tenure the male and female tenure candidates and there was no difference in their ratings of their teaching, research, and service experience. There was no significant main effect for the quality of the institution or professional rank on selectivity in hiring and tenuring decisions. The results of this study indicate a gender bias for both men and women in preference for male job applicants...|$|R
5000|$|The {{disparate}} {{impact theory}} of liability is controversial for several reasons. First, it labels certain unintended effects as [...] "discriminatory," [...] although discrimination {{is not an}} intentional act. Second, the theory is in tension with disparate treatment provisions under civil rights laws {{as well as the}} U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. For example, if the hypothetical fire department discussed above used the 100-pound requirement, that policy might disproportionately exclude <b>female</b> <b>job</b> applicants from employment. Under the 80% rule mentioned above, unsuccessful <b>female</b> <b>job</b> applicants would have a prima facie case of disparate impact [...] "discrimination" [...] against the department if they passed the 100-pound test at a rate less than 80% of the rate at which men passed the test. In order to avoid a lawsuit by the <b>female</b> <b>job</b> applicants, the department might refuse to hire anyone from its applicant pool—in other words, the department may refuse to hire anyone because too many of the successful job applicants were male. Thus, the employer would have intentionally discriminated against the successful male job applicants because of their gender, and that likely amounts to illegal disparate treatment and a violation of the Constitution's right to equal protection. In the 2009 case Ricci v. DeStefano, the U.S. Supreme Court did rule that a fire department committed illegal disparate treatment by refusing to promote white firefighters, in an effort to avoid disparate impact liability in a potential lawsuit by black and Hispanic firefighters who disproportionately failed the required tests for promotion. Although the Court in that case did not reach the constitutional issue, Justice Scalia's concurring opinion suggested the fire department also violated the constitutional right to equal protection. Even before Ricci, lower federal courts have ruled that actions taken to avoid potential disparate impact liability violate the constitutional right to equal protection. One such case is Biondo v. City of Chicago, Illinois, from the Seventh Circuit.|$|R
