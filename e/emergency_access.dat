25|$|There are two {{hospitals}} on {{the island}} of Maui. The first, Maui Memorial Medical Center, is the only acute care hospital in Maui County. It is centrally located in the town of Wailuku approximately 4 miles from Kahului Airport. The second, Kula Hospital, is a critical access hospital located on the southern half {{on the island}} in the rural town of Kula. Kula Hospital, along with Lanai Community Hospital (which is located in Maui County but on the neighboring island of Lanai), are affiliates of Maui Memorial Medical Center. All three hospitals are open 24/7 for <b>emergency</b> <b>access.</b> Although not technically a hospital or emergency room, Hana Health Clinic (or Hana Medical Center), located in the remote town of Hana on the southeastern side of the island, works in cooperation with American Medical Response and Maui Memorial Medical Center to stabilize and transport patients with emergent medical conditions. It too is open 24/7 for urgent care and <b>emergency</b> <b>access.</b>|$|E

25|$|From 1913 to 1916, a {{lake was}} {{constructed}} in a shallow part of Coal Harbour, a project that was not without its detractors. The lake was named Lost Lagoon due to its history of ‘disappearing’ at low tide. The lake and a causeway into the park were designed by Thomas Mawson, who also designed a lighthouse for Brockton Point around the same time. Before the Causeway, a wooden footbridge provided the only access route into the park from Coal Harbour. Construction of the causeway (and new roads within the park for <b>emergency</b> <b>access)</b> was completed by 1926.|$|E
500|$|The yakata was {{designed}} {{along the lines}} of Edo period tenement housing (...) , but modernized with reinforced walls, multiple stories, and balconies for <b>emergency</b> <b>access.</b> The result is a fusion between Western and Japanese architecture. Gaps were purposefully left in the ground floors for pedestrians, making the yakata a walkable space. The balconies and rooftops were also designed to please the eye at the ground level. At the same time, the roofs are visible from Oyasama's gravesite north of the city.|$|E

500|$|The {{main road}} {{into the village}} is close to sea level and there is risk that a flood could cut off access for {{emergency}} services. Many roads, particularly around Brooklands, are unadopted without any public funding, hindering <b>emergency</b> <b>access</b> and giving the area a [...] "run down" [...] look. Because properties are sited on marshland, road improvements {{tend to have a}} short lifespan and are quickly damaged in bad weather. In December 2013, due to a severe flood risk, all residents in Jaywick were asked by Essex Police to temporarily leave the area, to be homed in school buildings around Clacton. A similar exercise happened in January 2017 following a threat of coastal flooding, involving the potential evacuation of 2,500 homes in Jaywick and nearby Lee-over-Sands.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} sent to OTA in March 1990, USACE {{identified}} {{issues with the}} Creek Turnpike project, such as modifications to Polecat Creek's channel, impacts on the Arkansas River floodplain and levee system near Jenks, and loss of [...] of wetlands. In two other letters sent in May 1990, USACE requested alterations to the project, detailing further concerns about destruction of a unique type of wetland near the turnpike's planned intersection with Yale Avenue, OTA's plan to temporarily drain Mill Creek Bridge Pond, and <b>emergency</b> <b>access</b> to homes only accessible by crossing the pond on a wooden bridge. USACE warned that, should the changes the corps requested not be made, the turnpike plans may violate federal law, which would result in USACE withholding the necessary permits. The corps also required [...] "absolute assurance" [...] that new wetlands constructed {{as part of the}} project's mitigation efforts would not be built on land that was formerly the site of a landfill. On March 29, USACE held a public hearing as part of the permit process. The hearing had around 500 attendees, with over fifty of them giving five-minute speeches against the turnpike. One speaker compared the highway's environmental impact to that of the wreck of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez. No citizens spoke out in favor of the project.|$|E
2500|$|A {{boilerplate}} spacecraft, {{also known}} as a mass simulator, is a nonfunctional craft or payload which is used to test various configurations and basic size, load, and handling characteristics of rocket launch vehicles. [...] It is far less expensive to build multiple, full-scale, non-functional boilerplate spacecraft than it is to develop the full system (design, test, redesign, and launch). In this way, boilerplate spacecraft allow components and aspects of cutting-edge aerospace projects to be tested while detailed contracts for the final project are being negotiated. [...] These tests may be used to develop procedures for mating a spacecraft to its launch vehicle, <b>emergency</b> <b>access</b> and egress, maintenance support activities, and various transportation processes.|$|E

In times of <b>emergencies</b> <b>access</b> was limited and the Queen’s Road was closed off. In peace time these were open once again, until 1980, when Gordon Gardens were taken over to the President’s House. Following the Central Bank bombing the Janadhipathi Mawatha (formally Queen’s Road) was permanently closed off for vehicular traffic up to Old Colombo Lighthouse and further extended to Bank of Ceylon Mawatha. It was reopen in early 2015, and in June 2016 the President’s House was {{opened to the public}} for a week.|$|R
2500|$|Kensington and Chelsea Council {{was warned}} in 2010 that {{building}} a new secondary school very near Grenfell Tower could block access by emergency vehicles. A 2013 blog post by Grenfell Action Group stated, [...] "There is barely adequate room to manoeuvre for fire engines responding to emergency calls, and any obstruction of this <b>emergency</b> <b>access</b> zone could have lethal consequences {{in the event of}} a serious fire or similar emergency in Grenfell Tower or the adjacent blocks." [...] The council demolished a multi-storey car park to build the school. This added to congestion and parked cars in streets around Grenfell Tower that were already narrow and made it hard for fire engines to get to the fire.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{box section}} {{comprised}} two 9.8-metre wide dual lane traffic tubes and a 1.35 metres wide twin walled central tube for services and <b>emergency</b> <b>access.</b> The 1.2-metre thick base slab was cast first, {{followed by the}} 50cm thick central walls. [...] The outer walls and roof were cast together in a single operation, in six nominal 20-metre lengths, using special travelling formwork. [...] This was struck inside the formed section, moved along to the next length and then jacked up into position, each within a 72-hour cycle. [...] Each 1000 cubic metre pour required approximately 1500 square metres of formwork. The inside shutters for the outer walls were vertical steel section panels and Alform Beam walers, which were attached to the top slab of the special steel traveller, while the outer shutters were crane handled vertical steel section panels with Alform Beam or steel channel walers.|$|E
