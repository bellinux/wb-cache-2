40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} compressed working week with high cognitive and emotional work demands within the population of Dutch Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) pilots. Work stressors were measured and levels of well-being were examined before, during and after a series of <b>day</b> and night <b>shifts.</b> Results revealed that (i) the start of a series of <b>day</b> <b>shifts</b> was more taxing for wellbeing than the start of a series of night shifts, (ii) there were no differences in the decrease in well-being during <b>day</b> and night <b>shifts,</b> (iii) distress during shifts was more strongly related to a decrease in wellbeing during night than during <b>day</b> <b>shifts</b> and (iv) it took HEMS pilots more time to recover from a series of night shifts than from a series of <b>day</b> <b>shifts.</b> It is concluded that HEMS pilots should not start earlier during <b>day</b> <b>shifts,</b> nor have longer series of night shifts...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{physical}} workload, electromyography (EMG) of the trapezius muscle, neck pain and mental well-being at work between night and <b>day</b> <b>shifts</b> in twenty Swiss nurses. Work pulse (average increase of heart rate over resting heart rate) was lower during night (27  bpm) compared to <b>day</b> <b>shifts</b> (34  bpm; p <  0. 01). Relative arm acceleration also indicated less physical activity during night (82 % of average) compared to <b>day</b> <b>shifts</b> (110 %; p <  0. 01). Rest periods were significantly longer during night shifts. Trapezius muscle rest time was longer during night (13 % of <b>shift</b> duration) than <b>day</b> <b>shifts</b> (7 %; p <  0. 01) and the 50 th percentile of EMG activity was smaller (p =  0. 02), indicating more opportunities for muscle relaxation during night shifts. Neck pain and mental well-being at work were similar between shifts. Subjective perception of burden was similar between shifts despite less physical burden at night, suggesting there are other contributing factors...|$|R
25|$|The school {{began with}} only one study session, known as the Morning shift which {{operates}} from 8:00a.m. to 12:45p.m. In March 1993, another session known as the <b>Day</b> <b>shift</b> was added, according to the education expansion policy of the government, {{to cope with the}} growing number of students. The <b>day</b> <b>shift</b> session operates from 1:00p.m. to 5:45p.m. Measures were taken to build a gymnasium, park, swimming pool, auditorium, mosque, administrative building and residences for the principal, vice-principal and school staff. The school opened eleventh and twelfth grades in 1967. In 1978, another dormitory named Lalon Shah House was built for students in grades 11–12. In 1999, it had about 600 students and 90 teachers, of which 20 were women. In 2008, a four-storied house named Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah was built for students of the <b>day</b> <b>shift.</b> As of 2010, the number of non-resident students is substantially larger than that of resident students.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine a regular {{rotating}} 12 -h shift system (2 D 2 N 4 Off) at an Australian Smelter. Sleep behavior, subjective fatigue and neurobehavioral performance were investigated over a 14 -day period for 20 employees. Activity monitors, sleep/wake diaries, and 5 -min psychomotor vigilance tasks were used. Sleep data showed differences between <b>day</b> and night <b>shifts.</b> While sleep prior to night 1 was increased relative to <b>day</b> <b>shifts,</b> a reduced sleep length carried into the period leading to night 2. Total wakefulness at the end of shift, and subjective fatigue were increased for night shifts, particularly night 1. Decrements in performance data supported these findings. Both prior wakefulness and prior sleep are important in a 12 -h shift system. Employees may “sleep in” after <b>day</b> <b>shifts,</b> rather than taking extra sleep prior to night work. Thus, sleep between <b>day</b> and night <b>shifts</b> is based on recovery rather than preparation. ...|$|R
