50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that postage stamps are {{official}}ly a 'business card' of the issuing country, one of its official media symbols, and therefore sexual motives in their design are traditionally rare (and {{this is especially true}} for the first half of the 20th century), depicting naked flesh (both female and male) on postage stamps of that time was, strictly speaking, no news.Images of ancient statues or their imitations were quite common elements of design of both postage <b>stamps</b> and various <b>fiscal</b> <b>stamps,</b> vouchers, cheques, banknotes, and securities, i. e. any government and corporate securities that needed security printing against counterfeiting using aesthetically acceptable complication of the design. In addition, the stamps of African colonies often featured African women with naked breast. It was the La Maja Desnuda, however, that became the world's first case of open image of the body of a worldly woman (not a goddess) with pubic hair, thus opening a new popular topic in philately: nude.|$|R
