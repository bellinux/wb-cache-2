2500|$|The {{first series}} {{occasionally}} includes darker humour, reflecting that, especially {{early in the}} war, the Home Guard was woefully under-equipped but was still willing to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> the Wehrmacht. For instance, in the episode [...] "The Battle of Godfrey’s Cottage", the platoon believes the enemy have invaded Britain. Mainwaring, Godfrey, Frazer and Jones (along with Godfrey's sisters, who are completely unaware of the invasion) decide {{to stay at the}} cottage to delay the German advance, to allow the regular army time to arrive with reinforcements; [...] "It'll probably be the end of us, but we're ready for that, aren't we, men?", says Mainwaring. [...] "Of course", replies Frazer.|$|E
2500|$|Halsey's skin {{condition}} was so serious, {{he was sent}} on the light cruiser [...] to San Francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment. [...] The {{skin condition}} soon receded but Halsey was ordered to stand down for the next 6 weeks and relax. While detached stateside during his convalescence, he visited family and travelled to Washington D.C. In late August, he accepted a speaking engagement at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Prior to the discussion of his raids against the Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, Halsey informed the midshipmen before him, [...] "Missing the Battle of Midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career, but I am {{going back to the}} Pacific where I intend personally to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> those yellow-bellied sons of bitches and their carriers," [...] which was received with loud applause.|$|E
2500|$|Critic website Stereo Board {{stated that}} [...] "Alesha's fearlessly {{powerful}} vocals with an unforgettable, anthemic chorus that {{is set to}} make it a sure-fire radio sensation." [...] Female First gave the single four out of five stars, stating there were [...] "in love with it". Others criticised the song, saying it sounded like [...] "Dixon [...] unknowingly sample Robyn's 'Dancing on My Own'". Another positive review, came from Robert Copsey from Digital Spy who gave 4/5 stars for the song, saying [...] "Upon further listening, the reason for her apathetic approach towards ear candy becomes all too clear. [...] "I'm turning up the radio / I'll drown you out / 'Cause I don't want to let you go," [...] she mourns over a combination of jagged beats and throbbing synths that sounds suspiciously like Robyn's own weepy club ballad 'Dancing on My Own'. Nonetheless, the result is Dixon's sturdiest effort since 'Breathe Slow' - and if you're going to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> sad-pop, you may as well look to the Commander in Chief, right?".|$|E

60|$|<b>As</b> I <b>have</b> already said, we Minute Boys had {{but little}} {{opportunity}} to show our skill after the first hour, because the savages kept so close within their lodges; but now and then we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> painted figure, and seldom missed our aim.|$|R
2500|$|Perhaps {{the climax}} of the feud came during Fred Allen's parody of popular quiz-and-prize show Queen for a Day, which was barely a year old when Allen decided to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> it on The Fred Allen Show—an episode that has survived for today's {{listeners}} to appreciate. Calling the sketch [...] "King for a Day", Allen played the host and Benny a contestant who sneaked onto the show using the alias Myron Proudfoot. Benny answered the prize-winning question correctly and Allen crowned him [...] "king" [...] and showered him with a passel of almost meaningless prizes. Allen proudly announced, [...] "Tomorrow night, in your ermine robe, you will be whisked by bicycle to Orange, New Jersey, where you will be the judge in a chicken-cleaning contest," [...] to which Benny joyously declared, [...] "I'm king for a day!" [...] At this point a professional pressing-iron was wheeled on stage, to press Benny's suit properly. It didn't matter that Benny was still in the suit. Allen instructed his aides to remove Benny's suit, one item at a time, ending with his trousers, each garment's removal provoking louder laughter from the studio audience. As his trousers began to come off, Benny howled, [...] "Allen, you haven't seen the end of me!" [...] At once Allen shot back, [...] "It won't be long now!" ...|$|E

50|$|As late as 1956, Olson <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> another radio quiz, the {{short-lived}} Second Chance, somewhat {{similar to the}} earlier hit Queen for a Day in that this show, too, focused on guest contestants' tribulations, {{in this case a}} chance at rectifying a mistake or a loss in life.|$|R
50|$|Burns next <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> the British title {{almost exactly}} {{a year later}} when in February 2007, he met reigning {{champion}} Carl Johanneson at the Town Hall in Leeds. The fight ended once again in defeat with Burns losing a 12-round decision to the experienced champion. Johanneson intent on winning well before his home crowd hounded Burns throughout the fight and managed to knock Burns down three times.|$|R

I found that the dismissal from my mind of all conjectures regarding the personality of my secretary was of great service to me, and I was able to compose much faster than she could write.|$|E

I believe I must put an advertisement in the London Gazette, calling that amphibious soldier to an account If he be a true man, he will not hide himself under his incognito, but will give me a meeting. If that should fail, damme, I'll ride across to Yarmouth, and call out the first of the mongrel breed that I fall in with. 'Sdeath! Was ever such an insult practised on a gentleman and a soldier before? Would that I only knew his name! Why, if the tale should get abroad, I shall be the standing joke of the mess- table, until some greater fool than myself can be found. It would cost me at least six duels to get rid of it. No, no; not a trigger will I pull in my own regiment about the silly affair: but I'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> some marine in very revenge; for that is no more than reasonable. That Peters! if the scoundrel should dare whisper anything of the manner in which he was stamped with the breech of the musket!

50|$|Altheim was {{reluctant}} at first {{as he had}} already spent time {{on the development of}} the racquet game which he had imported from Aruba in the US.

50|$|According to one account, Maloney's {{career as}} a {{documentary}} filmmaker began when he “confronted Moore outside his Manhattan apartment in autumn 2003 with charges that he had shamelessly used his public platform to promote liberal causes.” Moore “was charm itself” and pleaded guilty, adding “that if Maloney felt so strongly, he should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> his own film project. So Maloney used his online video of the exchange to put out an appeal for funding.” He received support from entrepreneur Stuart Browning.|$|E
60|$|It appears {{they were}} at their wits' end what to do, the stores being so low that we must have been starved into {{surrender}} long before help came. But our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA. From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded, and one at least--the man shot beside the gun--severely wounded, if he were not dead. Every time we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> them, we were to take it, saving our own lives, with the extremest care. And besides that, we had two able allies--rum and the climate.|$|R
5000|$|Graham Lee {{took over}} from Haynes when Quiet the filly {{was sent to}} Scotland for the Listed Harry Rosebery Stakes at Ayr Racecourse on 18 September. Easton Angel, who had {{finished}} third in the Lowther Stakes was made the odds-on favourite with Quiet Reflection the 8/1 second choice in a sixteen-runner field. Field of Vision set the pace before Quiet Reflection took the lead inside the final furlong and quickly drew away to win by four lengths. Karl Burke commented [...] "She's a good filly. She was knocked over after 100 yards which not many people picked up on in the Lowther... Unfortunately I took her out of the Cheveley Park after the Lowther and I wouldn't <b>have</b> minded <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> that after today." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "I'm {{not in a}} {{caretaker}} role to try to further my career for next year. If {{you look at the}} history of caretaker coaches, they all wanted to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> it for the next year. I'm there to help out. It gives the club time to look for someone who's been there and done that and then I can go off on my merry way. If we win every game for the rest of the year I still won't be the senior coach next year." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My own {{children}} ganged {{up on me}} and came with the request that since I wrote books for adults, I could write them for children too. (Of course their assumption was incorrect!)

5000|$|Alex Clark of The Guardian {{was more}} positive, [...] "In her third novel, Kate Atkinson <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> the none-too-subtle {{business}} of metafiction. Emotionally Weird - an unexplained and inexplicably grotty title that suggests a rather {{different kind of}} book - is teeming with various fictions; the book itself boasts a bewildering array of typefaces. A more insidious by-product of this carnival of confabulation is that, after a while, the reader has no idea what's true and what isn't. By that point, Atkinson is relying, rather too heavily at times, {{on the fact that}} we won't care, so beguiled are we by her narrative exuberance and comic invention...Take out the typefaces and banish the overly ponderous outer reaches of this book and it's just a series of gags; but they're pretty good gags, and it's none the worse for that." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{incident}} and subsequent court hearing {{led to a}} clarification by the FIA, saying that drivers must wait one further corner after cutting a chicane before attempting another overtaking manoeuvre. Formula One driver and {{a director of the}} Grand Prix Drivers' Association Mark Webber said that the clarification had made the issue much clearer: Lewis would probably never ever <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> Kimi around the outside at {{the first part of the}} Bus Stop without knowing he had the option of going onto the asphalt part. I think we've got to get on top of the chicanes going forward, and we're not too far away from that at the moment, where drivers know that if you gain a position or gain <b>an</b> advantage, you <b>have</b> to give it back a bit more.

He had a magnificent start at Aggborough with a 4-1 thrashing of Grays Athletic on his home début. This was the first game of an 8-game unbeaten streak as his side made an unlikely bid for the play-offs and progressed to the semi-finals of the FA Trophy. This earned him the division's Manager of the Month title for February 2010 but this was to be the last accolade of the season for Burr and the Harriers as they went out of the FA Trophy to eventual finalists and Conference champions, Stevenage Borough, and a drop in form saw them finish 13th in the league.|$|E

50|$|Charlesworth {{was born}} in Simmondley, Derbyshire, the son of John Charlesworth, a stonemason, and his wife Ann. In 1881 {{at the age of}} 16, Charlesworth was a clerk. Charlesworth played three matches for Derbyshire in the 1888 season, the first of the seasons when they lost first class status and made little impression. Charlesworth reappeared for Derbyshire in the 1898 season, making his {{first-class}} debut against Essex. Despite being absent hurt in the first innings, he returned during Derbyshire's attempt at bowling out a high-scoring Essex team, in which every player but wicket-keeper Solomon Hardy and opener Sydney Evershed <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> bowling, in many cases economical but unsuccessful. Charlesworth played six more first-class matches for the club in the season. He only bowled again in a draw against Nottinghamshire. His last match was against Yorkshire in what remains the highest score against Derbyshire. He was absent hurt again in this match, this time in the second innings.|$|R
40|$|A bar of {{circular}} cross-section is modelled with two-dimensional plane-stress finite elements. The bar <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> its edge, the front {{of which is a}} circular arc. The ends of the bar remote from the crack are subjected to either an axial load or a bending moment in the plane of symmetry of the cracked section. The strain energy release rate of the crack is determined from a finite element model as the rate of change of elastic energy in the bar for successive positions of the circular arc crack front. The values of strain energy release rate so determined are found to be comparable with existing results obtained from three-dimensional finite element analyses. The effect of curvature is found to cause a reduction in the strain energy release rate compared to that for <b>a</b> straight fronted <b>crack</b> of the same maximum depth in a bar under the same loading conditions. The results obtained are superimposed to obtain strain energy release rates for the circular arc crack edge subjected to a combined tensile load and a bending moment. ...|$|R
