50|$|The body {{typically}} provides one {{passenger seat}} {{and a small}} trunk compartment behind. In some case the sidecar has a removable soft top. In some modifications, the sidecar's body is used for carrying cargo or tools, like a truck's platform. The sidecar is typically mounted so that the motorcycle {{is closer to the}} centre of the road, i.e. with the sidecar on the right <b>for</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|The updated {{model has}} more rounded and curved styling {{in the rear}} bumper area, in the {{asymmetrical}} rear window which wraps around to the passenger side, and in the driver and front passenger windows. The tailgate is side-hinged to swing open like a door, rather than upward like a hatch. The hatch hinge {{is on the right}} side for countries with left-hand traffic such as Japan and the UK; on the left side <b>for</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> markets such as North America.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, in 1963 the Riksdag passed {{legislation}} ordering {{the switch to}} <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic.</b> The changeover took place on a Sunday morning at 5am on September 3, 1967, which was known in Swedish as Dagen H (H-Day), the 'H' standing <b>for</b> Högertrafik or <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many black cabs have {{a turning}} circle of only 25 ft. One {{reason for this}} is the {{configuration}} of the famed Savoy Hotel: The hotel entrance's small roundabout meant that vehicles needed the small turning circle in order to navigate it. That requirement became the legally required turning circles for all London cabs, while the custom of a passenger's sitting on the right, behind the driver, provided a reason <b>for</b> the <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> in Savoy Court, allowing hotel patrons to board and alight from the driver's side.|$|R
5000|$|... same gauge - {{voltage change}} 15kVAC/25kVAC - other {{protection}} system. Only custom made locomotives or EMUs can cross the border. Bridges {{to make the}} transition from left- to <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic,</b> are located north of Malmö, so all traffic south of Malmö is in <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{switch to}} <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> in Czechoslovakia {{describes}} {{changes in the}} rules of the road in 1938-1939.|$|R
5000|$|Before 1938, Czechoslovakia {{drove on}} the left. In about 1925, Czechoslovakia {{accepted}} the Paris convention and undertook {{to change to}} <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> [...] "within a reasonable time frame". In 1931, the government decreed to change over within five years, which did not happen. The main obstacles were financial cost and widespread opposition in rural areas. In November 1938, parliament finally decided to change to <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> with effect from 1 May 1939.|$|R
50|$|This {{is one of}} the {{international}} borders where left-hand traffic (Pakistan - administered Gilgit-Baltistan) changes to <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> (China) and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Cambodia {{follows the}} <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic.</b> There is no {{formally}} adopted road and road transport policy in Cambodia, and this particularly affects urban road transport.|$|R
50|$|As in the United Kingdom, traffic drives on the left, {{meaning that}} {{visitors}} from countries with <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> must {{take special care}} on Bermuda's roads.|$|R
5000|$|Northbound, {{the runway}} (Runway 35) has a {{powerline}} near its end, and requires a <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> pattern, minimizing interference with Wichita Eisenhower Airport traffic to the west.|$|R
25|$|On 3 September 1967, Sweden was {{the last}} country in {{continental}} Europe to introduce <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic.</b> This was done on Dagen H, {{in spite of the}} negative result of a referendum in 1955.|$|R
50|$|Road {{signs in}} Argentina {{are similar to}} those of other South American countries. They are {{something}} of a compromise between the Vienna Convention signs used in Europe and the U.S. system. Argentina has <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Australian Road Rules {{set out the}} {{procedure}} for performing a hook turn in Australia, {{as well as other}} jurisdictions with left-hand traffic. In jurisdictions with <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> the lane of the turning vehicle is reversed.|$|R
50|$|When Sweden's {{switch to}} <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> in 1967 made {{existing}} unidirectional trams obsolete, Gothenburg {{was one of}} only two cities in Sweden to maintain its city-centre tramway, the other such network to survive being the Norrköping tramway.|$|R
5000|$|... 2 {{countries}} {{consist of}} islands and have left-hand traffic (Japan and the United Kingdom; in the US Virgin Islands, they have left-hand traffic to remain {{compatible with the}} British Virgin Islands, {{but the rest of}} the United States has <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic).</b>|$|R
5000|$|... same gauge - same voltage - same {{protection}} system. Most Swedish and Norwegian rail vehicles {{can cross}} the border. As {{there is only}} single-track at all border crossings, {{there is no need}} for bridges to make the transition from left- to <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On Line 1, <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> is organized, on the Line 2 - {{left-hand}} traffic. This {{method of}} motion {{is due to}} the branching of the rails at the [...] "Moskovskaya" [...] station, {{due to the lack of}} a full-length tunnel of the Line 2.|$|R
50|$|The Ma On Shan Line is {{specifically}} designed to follow <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> rules unlike other railway lines in Hong Kong to enable a single-direction cross-platform interchange at Tai Wai Station to the East Rail Line while keeping all platforms {{at roughly the same}} height.|$|R
5000|$|On Line 1, <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> is organized, on the Line 2 - {{left-hand}} traffic. This {{method of}} motion {{is due to}} the branching of the rails at the [...] "Moskovskaya" [...] station, {{due to the lack of}} a full-length tunnel of the Line 2.|$|R
30|$|All driving was {{executed}} in <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> {{and the speed}} limit throughout the drive was set to 90  km/h. Participants were requested to drive as they normally would in comparable conditions. The simulated scenario had low traffic density to ensure that drivers were not distracted by surrounding traffic.|$|R
50|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Evergreen Extension is the section between Lougheed Town Centre Station and Burquitlam Station: trains runs in the {{direction}} of left-hand traffic instead of the standard <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic,</b> and utilize two switches just to the south of Burquitlam station to return to normal travelling direction.|$|R
50|$|Some free-flow {{interchange}} bring additional {{problems such}} as weaving or passing lane/fast lane exits (i.e. left exits in areas with <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic,</b> and vice versa) that {{may be necessary to}} avoid additional costs, but lead to congestion and accidents and ultimately to an upgrade to another type of interchange.|$|R
25|$|Most Caribbean {{countries}} with <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{such as the}} Dominican Republic, allow right turn on red unless a sign prohibits it. Some vehicles, such as those carrying hazardous materials and school buses, {{are not allowed to}} turn on red under any circumstance and must wait for a green light or arrow.|$|R
50|$|Cars {{drive on}} the left hand side of the road, but nearly all the {{automobiles}} on the island have left side steering columns. This has proven difficult for new residents and visitors from <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> locales such as the mainland United States, the French and Dutch West Indies, and Puerto Rico.|$|R
50|$|Another {{alternative}} to the four-level stack interchange is the turbine interchange (also known as a whirlpool). The turbine/whirlpool interchange requires fewer levels (usually two or three) while retaining semi-directional ramps throughout, and has its left-turning ramps sweep around {{the center of the}} interchange in a spiral pattern in <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most Caribbean {{countries}} with <b>right-hand</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{such as the}} Dominican Republic, allow right turn on red unless a sign prohibits it. Some vehicles, such as those carrying hazardous materials and school buses, {{are not allowed to}} turn on red under any circumstance and must wait for a green light or arrow.|$|R
