The town's development and growth have been intimately connected with the technological advances of the industrial revolution, and <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>with</b> the hot blast process. Coatbridge was a major Scottish centre for iron works and coal mining during the 19th century and in this period was described as 'the industrial heartland of Scotland' and the 'Iron Burgh'.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for natural family planning, and contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty. The Church's rejection of condom use is widely criticized, <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>with</b> regard to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone.|$|E

5|$|The Yaghnobi {{people living}} in the Sughd {{province}} of Tajikistan still speak a dialect of the Sogdian language. Yaghnobi is largely a continuation of the medieval Sogdian dialect from the Osrushana region of the western Fergana Valley. The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>with</b> Persians and came to speak Persian. In 819 the Persians founded the Samanid Empire in the region. They are among the ancestors of the modern Tajiks.

5|$|As {{a result}} of their support of Truman, the Joint Chiefs became viewed as {{politically}} tainted. Senator Taft regarded Bradley <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>with</b> suspicion, due to Bradley's focus on Europe at the expense of Asia. Taft urged Eisenhower to replace the chiefs as soon as possible. First to go was Vandenberg, who had terminal cancer and had already announced plans to retire. On 7 May 1953, Eisenhower announced that he would be replaced by General Nathan Twining. Soon after it was announced that Bradley would be replaced by Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Command, Collins would be succeeded by Ridgway, and Admiral William Fechteler, who had become CNO on the death of Sherman in July 1951, by Admiral Robert B. Carney.|$|E
5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>with</b> its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>with</b> their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E

5|$|In 1924 Tippett {{became the}} {{conductor}} of an amateur choir in the Surrey village of Oxted. Although {{he saw this}} initially {{as a means of}} advancing his knowledge of English madrigals, his association with the choir lasted many years. Under his direction it combined with a local theatrical group, the Oxted and Limpsfield Players, to give performances of Vaughan Williams's opera The Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains and of Tippett's own adaptation of an 18th-century ballad opera, The Village Opera. He passed his Bachelor of Music (BMus) exams, at his second attempt, in December 1928. Rather than continuing to study for a doctorate, Tippett decided to leave the academic environment. The RCM years had brought him intense and lasting friendships with members of both sexes, <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>with</b> Francesca Allinson and David Ayerst.|$|E
5|$|Llywelyn ap Gruffudd enjoyed an {{advantageous}} {{situation in}} the aftermath of the Barons' War. Through the 1267 Treaty of Montgomery, he officially obtained land he had conquered in the Four Cantrefs of Perfeddwlad and was recognised in his title of Prince of Wales. Armed conflicts nevertheless continued, <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>with</b> certain dissatisfied Marcher Lords, such as Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, Roger Mortimer and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. Problems were exacerbated when Llywelyn's younger brother Dafydd and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of Powys, after failing in an assassination attempt against Llywelyn, defected to the English in 1274. Citing ongoing hostilities and the English king's harbouring of his enemies, Llywelyn refused to do homage to Edward. For Edward, a further provocation came from Llywelyn's planned marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Simon de Montfort.|$|E
5|$|Many {{argue that}} the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century Florence, <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>with</b> the {{writings}} of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), {{as well as the}} paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance. Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.|$|E

5|$|Samarium is a {{rare earth}} metal having a {{hardness}} and density {{similar to those of}} zinc. With the boiling point of 1794°C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, samarium normally assumes a rhombohedral structure (α form). Upon heating to 731°C, its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally close-packed (hcp), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922°C transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase. Heating to 300°C combined with compression to 40kbar results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (dhcp). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>with</b> a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900kbar. In one study, the dhcp phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700°C, confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{six feet}} tall, O'Neill was {{compared}} to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because {{of his ability to}} score at a high pace, <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>with</b> his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings.|$|E
