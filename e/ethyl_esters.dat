25|$|The wort is {{then placed}} in a tank to undergo {{fermentation}}. These fermentation tanks can be of several types: oak, cement coated with epoxy, stainless or enamelled steel, or epoxy resin. For large volume tanks the control of temperature, which typically is around 18°C, becomes necessary. The majority of aromatic components (acetates of alcohol and <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> of fatty acids) are synthesized by the yeast during fermentation of light juice below 18°C. However, clarity and low temperatures are factors which slow fermentation. Recourse to the addition of selected yeasts for these difficult working conditions becomes crucial. In contrast some producers grow their vines organically or biodynamically: the lees are of good quality without synthetic chemicals harmful to yeast so they are kept in the wine. Turbidity of the must ensures a good supply of yeasts and fermentation in small tanks or in barrels then does not require mastery of cold.|$|E

Benzoylformic acid <b>ethyl</b> <b>ester</b> was also formed in the reaction, but in a nonlinear fashion, indicating a lag phase.

2500|$|Biodiesel is {{the most}} common biofuel in Europe. It is {{produced}} from oils or fats using transesterification and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or <b>ethyl)</b> <b>esters</b> (FAMEs). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, soy, rapeseed, jatropha, mahua, mustard, flax, sunflower, palm oil, hemp, field pennycress, Pongamia pinnata and algae.

Dean published the findings without giving credit to Ball, and renamed the technique the Dean Method, until Hollmann spoke out about this. In 1918, a Hawaii physician reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association that a total of 78 patients were released from Kalihi Hospital by the board of health examiners after treatment with injections. The isolated ethyl ester remained the preferred treatment for Hansen's disease until sulfonamide drugs were developed in the 1940s.|$|E

2500|$|Fatty-acid {{methyl ester}} (FAME), more widely known as biodiesel, is {{obtained}} from vegetable oil or animal fats (biolipids) {{which have been}} transesterified with methanol. It can be produced from many types of oils, the most common being rapeseed oil (rapeseed methyl ester, RME) in Europe and soybean oil (soy methyl ester, SME) in the US. [...] Methanol can also be replaced with ethanol for the transesterification process, which results {{in the production of}} <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters.</b> The transesterification processes use catalysts, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, to convert vegetable oil and methanol into FAME and the undesirable byproducts glycerine and water, which will need to be removed from the fuel along with methanol traces. FAME can be used pure (B100) in engines where the manufacturer approves such use, but it is more often used as a mix with diesel, BXX where XX is the biodiesel content in percent.|$|E

To {{explore the}} {{possible}} role of proteolytic step(s) in receptor-mediated endocytosis of insulin, {{the effects of}} inhibitors of various classes of proteases on the internalization process were studied in isolated rat adipocytes. Intracellular accumulation of receptorbound 125 I-insulin at 37 °C was quantitated after rapidly dissociating surface-bound insulin with an acidic buffer (pH 3. 0). Of the 23 protease inhibitors tested, only chymotrypsin substrate analogues inhibited insulin internalization.
