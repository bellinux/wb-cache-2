The guest presenters who {{appeared}} included; Jeremy Vine, Sophie Raworth, James Landale, Eddie Mair, Sian Williams, Susanna Reid and Nick Robinson. From 9 June, Vine and Raworth became the regular presenters and began to alternate presenting duties each week. Vine presented the final programme before Marr's return on 28 July, confirming Marr's return for the new series on 1 September. Vine sat in again on 15 December due to family commitments.|$|E
50|$|Designed by Fritz Fiedler, the 326 {{featured}} a box-section frame that could readily be adapted for derivative models. Also innovative were the torsion bar rear suspension, {{inspired by the}} dead axle suspension of the Citroën Traction Avant, and the hydraulic braking system, {{the first to be}} used on a BMW car. Styled by Peter Schimanowski, the 326 was offered as a four-door sedan and as a two- or four-door cabriolet. The 326 sedan was the first BMW available with four doors. The BMW 320, BMW 321, BMW 327, and BMW 335 were based on the 326. The streamlined form of the body contrasted with previous relatively upright BMWs: drag was presumably reduced further by including a <b>fixed</b> <b>cover</b> over the spare wheel at the back.|$|E

In a frame-and-prong buckle the prong {{attaches}} to {{one end of}} the frame and extends [...] "away" [...] from the wearer {{through a hole in the}} belt, where it anchors against the opposite side of the frame.

40|$|Field {{observations}} indicate ice covers {{significantly affect}} sediment transport processes in rivers, especially scour at bridge piers. To establish {{the sensitivity of}} various parameters affecting sediment transport processes under ice, twenty tests were conducted in a refrigerated flume at the United States Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory. All tests were conducted using a 5. 08 -cm-diameter circular bridge pier and sand with d 50 = 0. 13 mm with various discharges. Flow velocities were selected to focus primarily on clear-water scour using both smooth and rough simulated ice covers for three surface conditions: open water, floating cover where the ice was free to respond to changes in water level, and a <b>fixed</b> <b>cover</b> simulating ice frozen to the pier and banks with a hydrostatic head created by an upstream ice jam. The cover roughness and pressure flow condition both alter velocity distribution and caused live-bed scour even when the mean flow velocity, Vavg, was less than the critical velocity for bed movement, Vc. The combination of increased cover roughness and pressure flow resulted in the largest scour depth. This paper presents {{a summary of the}} field investigations and laboratory experiments, and discusses both the velocity distributions and shear stress analysis. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEffect of {{flat plate}} {{collectors}} (FPCs) in {{series on the}} distillate output and performance of solar still have been studied in active mode. The solar still has an effective basin area of 1 m 2 and <b>fixed</b> <b>cover</b> inclination of 30 °. Each FPC with an effective area of 2 m 2 is attached with solar still. For the present study, experiments have been conducted for 24 h {{during the summer months}} for active solar distillation system. An effective collector inclination of 5 ° is used. Outdoor experiments were conducted at Kakinada (16 °. 93 ′N/ 83 °. 33 ′E), A. P., India, which has coastal climatic conditions. The aim of the present work is to study the effect of FPCs connected in series on the yield and distillation efficiency of an active solar still for the selected location. The results show that solar still, with two FPCs connected in series, provides 41 % more distillate yield when compared to still with single FPC and the still efficiency is 0. 47 % more with two FPCs connected in series. The still with three FPCs connected in series has produced 89 % more distillate yield when compared to still with single FPC. However, the still efficiency is 0. 48 % less with three collectors in series due to increase in area for radiation. The increase in distillate yield for the still with FPCs in series is due to the attainment of high water temperature...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this system}} {{is to provide a}} {{location}} based alarm system through which customers can broadcast their last known position in emergency situations. Imagine that you are hiking in the forest alone and don’t know how to get back to your car, or you get lost driving to your friend’s home. At times like these, how can you ask for help? With push of single button or pull off the hands free cord on this system, it will notify your friends with your latest locations immediately. The system is divided into two parts, the client side and the server side. The client side works on the iPhone and other mobile phone platforms and is implemented in Objective C and Java ME. The server side supports more than one server while running on the Linux platform and isimplemented using Java EE. There are two problems that need to be solved before we start. First, how can we get the users' location if their mobile phone does not have a GPS device or they are in an area without GPS signals. As we all know, the mobile phone signal comes from the cell tower and every cell tower has a <b>fixed</b> <b>cover</b> area, The user’s approximate location can be calculated by the cell tower’s location if the tower’s location which the mobile phone gets the signal from is known. Second, since we have more than one server running, how do we synchronize the data on different servers? If we treat this problem as another kind of server/client communication, it can easily be solved. In this thesis report, this system will be described based on the software development process, and how problems encountered during the system development are solved...|$|E

40|$|We {{test the}} early {{anthropogenic}} hypothesis that {{greenhouse gas emissions}} produced by early agricultural activities in recent millennia kept the climate warmer than its natural level and offset an incipient glaciation. We use versions of the NCAR’s Community Climate System Model to investigate the natural climate that might exist today if CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations had fallen to their average levels reached during previous interglaciations (while ignoring the effects of aerosol changes). The model is run in a coupled atmosphere-slab ocean configuration with <b>fixed</b> land <b>cover</b> in one experiment and interactive vegetation changes in the other. With lowered greenhouse gas concentrations, global mean temperature falls by 2. 75 K under <b>fixed</b> land <b>cover</b> and by 3. 0 K with vegetation feedbacks included.

The large-scale cooling is amplified in polar regions, where mean-annual temperatures fall by up to 9 K and sea ice area more than doubles in the Southern Hemisphere. In high latitudes, boreal forest is replaced by tundra and tundra by polar desert, causing a higher surface albedo that amplifies regional Arctic cooling by up to 2 K annually and 5 K during spring.

40|$|With {{the recent}} onset of drought {{conditions}} throughout many regions of Australia {{and across the}} world, a greater amount of interest {{has been placed on}} the measurement and modelling of evaporation rates in real world environments such as agricultural dams and drinking water reserves. Coinciding with this, substantial amounts of research work have been carried out detailing increasingly accurate methods to both measure and predict evaporative losses from water reserves along with the development of innovative techniques and technologies to suppress and mitigate water evaporation. Some examples of these techniques include <b>fixed</b> <b>covers,</b> floating covers, wind breaks along with chemical films and monolayers. The following practical exercise aims to give senior high school Physics and multi-strand science students an insight into how evaporation measurements can be made and compared with modelled data to verify their accuracy by employing local wind velocity, temperature (air and water) and water vapour (humidity) information. In addition to this, this exercise shows how publicly available chemical films based on substances such as silicon, cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol can be utilised to reduce evaporation. An analysis of film performance under varying wind velocities will be detailed for replication by students in the laboratory. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
