5|$|A Herdwick's grey fleece is {{not easily}} dyed, and is coarse, and so is best suited to use as carpet wool. The wool is also an {{excellent}} natural insulator; {{it is possible to}} buy sheets of fireproofed wool to <b>fit</b> <b>as</b> loft insulation. Herdwick lamb and mutton has a very distinct taste, and was even eaten at Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation banquet. Herdwick ewes also commonly produce desirable market lambs and mules by cross-breeding with Suffolk, Cheviot, Charollais and Texel sheep.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album. They noted the high production values {{and the quality of}} the original compositions and the performance of the orchestra. They also felt that the later tracks in the album were notably weaker than the early tracks, that the arrangements in general did not stray far from the source material, and that several of the track choices did not seem to <b>fit</b> <b>as</b> well as orchestral renditions as others.|$|E
5|$|The Il-32 was an aluminum-bodied, high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a fixed {{tricycle undercarriage}} whose fuselage was square in cross-section to <b>fit</b> <b>as</b> much cargo as possible. The two-spar wings had a moderate aspect ratio. It {{was regarded as}} expendable and was built very simply to facilitate large-scale manufacture. The nose and tail sections swung up to 95° to starboard to facilitate loading.|$|E

5|$|The M9 Half-track was a {{half-track}} {{produced by}} International Harvester in the United States in World War II for lend-lease supply to Allies. It {{was designed to}} provide a similar vehicle to the M2 Half Track Car. It had the same body and chassis as the M5 Half-track (also built by International Harvester for lend-lease) but had the same stowage and radio <b>fit</b> <b>as</b> the M2 Half Track.|$|E
5|$|After leaving West Ham, Greaves put {{on weight}} and did not attend a match as either a player or a spectator for two years. Drinking formed {{a large part of}} his life and he became an alcoholic; at times he was {{drinking}} 20 pints of lager during the day and consuming a bottle of vodka in the evening. He later admitted that he was also regularly driving whilst drunk during this period. Seeking an answer to his alcoholism, Greaves decided to return to football at a lower level where he would not be required to be as <b>fit</b> <b>as</b> he had been whilst playing in the Football League. He started playing for his local side, Brentwood, and made his debut on 27 December 1975 in a 2–0 defeat to Witham Town.|$|E
5|$|Black Swan is a 2010 American {{psychological}} horror film {{directed by}} Darren Aronofsky. The screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin {{is from a}} story by Heinz. It stars Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder. The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet by a prestigious New York City ballet company. The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina (Portman) is a perfect <b>fit,</b> <b>as</b> well as the dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities better embodied by the new arrival Lily (Kunis). Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, {{causing her to lose}} her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare.|$|E

5|$|Physically, Britten {{was never}} robust. He walked and swam {{regularly}} and kept himself as <b>fit</b> <b>as</b> he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, {{a few of}} them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world. He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from anybody else.|$|E
5|$|When Obsidian were {{preparing}} to present Knights of the Old Republic II at E3 2004, they tried to <b>fit</b> <b>as</b> much information as they could, saying that it {{would need to be}} a duration of 30 minutes as it was the only E3 event it would be showcased at; however, due to the limited time frame, they would have to cut it down to a five- to ten-minute presentation. During this time, none of the levels Obsidian designed were ready to be shown, so they picked three levels, and put them through a schedule to finish them on time. The demo was finished {{a few days before the}} event, and the game was presented in May 2004. The first trailer for Knights of the Old Republic II was later unveiled in July 2004, and the official website was launched in October.|$|E

25|$|Hetmans {{were very}} independent; they could {{maintain}} their own foreign {{contacts with the}} Ottoman Empire, Russia and the Tatars.

25|$|In the {{presence}} of a single stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, the DNA 5' flaps become too long, and the nicks no longer <b>fit</b> <b>as</b> substrate for FEN1. This prevents the FEN1 from removing the 5′-flaps. Thus, Dna2's role is to reduce the 3′ end of these fragments, making it possible for FEN1 to cut the flaps, and the Okazaki fragment maturation more efficient.|$|E

25|$|Overall, these results, {{along with}} similar results from Medina et al., {{indicate}} that word meanings {{may not be}} learned through a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, which ask participants to hypothesize a mapping even on the first occurrence (i.e., not cross-situationally).
