You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
5|$|Several {{individuals}} have consistently scored highly and/or earned medals on the IMO: As of July 2015 Zhuo Qun Song (Canada) {{is the most}} successful participant with five gold medals (including one perfect score in 2015) and one bronze medal. Reid Barton (United States) was the first participant to win a gold medal four times (1998-2001). Barton {{is also one of}} only eight four-time Putnam Fellow (2001–04). Christian Reiher (Germany), Lisa Sauermann (Germany), Teodor von Burg (Serbia), and Nipun Pitimanaaree (Thailand) are the only other participants to have won four gold medals (2000–03, 2008–11, 2009–12, 2010–13, and 2011–14 respectively); Reiher also received a bronze medal (1999), Sauermann a silver medal (2007), von Burg a silver medal (2008) and a bronze medal (2007), and Pitimanaaree a silver medal (2009). Wolfgang Burmeister (East Germany), Martin Härterich (West Germany), Iurie Boreico (Moldova), and Lim Jeck (Singapore) are the only other participants besides Reiher, Sauermann, von Burg, and Pitimanaaree to win five medals with at least three of them gold. Ciprian Manolescu (Romania) managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for gold medal more times than anybody else {{in the history of the}} competition, <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> three times he participated in the IMO (1995, 1996, 1997). Manolescu is also a three-time Putnam Fellow (1997, 1998, 2000). Eugenia Malinnikova (Soviet Union) is the highest-scoring female contestant in IMO history. She has 3 gold medals in IMO 1989 (41 points), IMO 1990 (42) and IMO 1991 (42), missing only 1 point in 1989 to precede Manolescu's achievement.|$|E

500|$|Syro is an {{electronic}} music album. All 12songs {{on the album}} were written by James in-studio. According to James, the songs were written over an extended period; Syro features both archived and more recent compositions, with the album's oldest track around [...] "six or seven years old". The album was recorded in six different studios, including James' own studio in Scotland, which he spent three years building and which was completed in 2006. One audio engineer spent three months with James, helping him wire together patch panels and [...] "then [...] realized he was <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> wrong and had to start again". Describing the overall process as [...] "brutal", James referred to the in-studio technical issues as the catalyst for writing new music that would be featured on Syro.|$|E
500|$|Curtis asked Moffat to criticise [...] "anything and everything" [...] {{and later}} {{said he was}} very honest. Executive {{producer}} Piers Wenger and director Jonny Campbell also critiqued the script. Moffat told Curtis that it needed to [...] "start quicker" [...] and that the meeting with the Doctor and Vincent was [...] "dull" [...] {{and needed to be}} something [...] "cute" [...] like Curtis had done in his films. He also noted that the Doctor did not talk as much as Curtis had written and recommended Curtis watch some episodes to see he was [...] "rather efficient in the way that he talked". Curtis enjoyed the experience, commenting that it was [...] "fun" [...] to work within boundaries rather than <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> himself. After seeing a read-through performed by leads Matt Smith and Karen Gillan, Curtis made more changes. He commented that it was easy to write for them as they were [...] "so delightful and modern and relaxed". Curtis's original title for the episode was [...] "Eyes that See the Darkness", but he said this was vetoed.|$|E
500|$|... "Office Olympics" [...] {{was written}} by Michael Schur. This episode was the first episode of the series {{directed}} by Paul Feig. Producer Greg Daniels said {{the idea for the}} actual Office Olympics stemmed from The King of the Hill Office Olympics, which were created and ran by Daniel's former assistant Tim Croston and the show's two production assistants at the time: Tony Gennaro and Seranie Manoogian. The games were held in the King of the Hill offices, where Daniel served as executive producer. Daniels later elaborated on the types of games they played, stating [...] "Like, who’s going to get off the elevator first and races in chairs. The funny thing is then it became a TV episode and it has now gone full circle and I hear offices are <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> over." [...] After the episode aired, other [...] "Office Olympics" [...] were organized in actual offices across the country. The Chicago Tribune organized an interview with a majority of The Office cast members who—in character—explained the rules to the various games. The Yogurt Lid Medals reappear in the third season finale, [...] "The Job": Receiving the lid and a note from Pam is the catalyst for Jim's decision between Pam and Karen.|$|E

500|$|Following his San Francisco sojourn, Divine {{returned}} to Baltimore {{and participated in}} Waters's next film Pink Flamingos. Designed by Waters to be [...] "an exercise in poor taste," [...] the film featured Divine as Babs Johnson, a woman who claims to be [...] "the filthiest person alive" [...] and who is forced to prove her right to the title from challengers, Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond Marble (David Lochary). In one scene, the Marbles send Babs a turd in a box as a birthday present, {{and in order to}} enact this scene, Divine defecated into the box the night before. Filmed in a hippie commune in Phoenix, Maryland, the cast members spent much of the time smoking cigarettes and marijuana and taking amphetamines, although all of the scenes had been heavily rehearsed beforehand. The final scene in the film proved particularly infamous, involving Babs eating fresh dog feces; Divine later told a reporter, [...] "I followed that dog around for three hours just zooming in on its asshole," [...] waiting for it to empty its bowels so that they could film the scene. The scene {{became one of the most}} notable moments of Divine's acting career, and he later complained of people thinking that [...] "I run around <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the time. I've received boxes of dog shit– plastic dog shit. I have gone to parties where people just sit around and talk about dog shit because they think it's what I want to talk about." [...] In reality, he remarked, he was not a coprophile but only ate excrement that one time because it was in the script.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 2009 {{with regard}} to Warnings lackluster {{commercial}} performance, James Montgomery of MTV News called the record [...] "unjustly overlooked" [...] and applauded Armstrong's [...] "super strong" [...] songwriting on the album. In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rolling Stone journalist Nick Catucci gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and wrote that the band [...] "fully focus on the textures that have always differentiated their sturdy grooves and simple melodies". Catucci called the songs [...] "speedy, neatly packaged reinterpretations of pop-rock history, from the Beatles to Creedence Clearwater Revival to the Ramones themselves". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it [...] "gleeful, unabashed fun" [...] and complimented Green Day for [...] "embracing their fondness for pop and making the best damn album they'd ever made". Erlewine expressed that the band displays [...] "melodic ingenuity and imaginative arrangements" [...] and elaborated on its musical significance, stating [...] "Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying; it finds the band at a peak of songcraft and performance, <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> without a trace of self-consciousness. It's the first great pure pop album of the new millennium". Dom Passantino of Stylus Magazine cited it as [...] "the most influential album on the British pop landscape since 1996 (Spice, naturally)", noting it as a significant influence on [...] "the two biggest bands in the UK at the moment, and indeed for the past few years, Busted and McFly". Passantino called Warning [...] "a great album" [...] and viewed that Green Day [...] "seemed to be bored with their genre-medium, but simultaneously knowledgeable that any attempt to boundary-hop will end with them falling on their face".|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{mastered}} the guitar, being considered today {{one of the}} all-time greats on the instrument. His approach was complex and musically advanced. When Keith Richards was first introduced to Johnson's music by his bandmate Brian Jones, he asked, [...] "Who is the other guy playing with him?", not realizing it was Johnson playing one guitar. [...] "I was hearing two guitars, and {{it took a long time}} to actually realise he was <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> by himself," [...] said Richards, who later stated that [...] "Robert Johnson was like an orchestra all by himself." [...] "As for his guitar technique, it's politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic—moving effortlessly from hen-picking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chucka-chucka rhythm figures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore's {{conception}} of Saint Nicholas was borrowed from his friend Washington Irving (see below), but Moore portrayed his [...] "jolly old elf" [...] as arriving on Christmas Eve rather than Christmas Day. [...] At {{the time that}} Moore wrote the poem, Christmas Day was overtaking New Year's Day as the preferred [...] family holiday of the season, but some [...] Protestants viewed Christmas {{as the result of}} [...] "Catholic ignorance and deception" [...] and still had reservations. [...] By having Saint Nicholas arrive the night before, Moore [...] "deftly shifted the focus away from Christmas Day with its still-problematic religious associations." [...] As a result, [...] "New Yorkers embraced Moore's child-centered version of Christmas {{as if they had been}} <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> their lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of Smile, the Beach Boys relocated to a studio situated {{in the living room}} of Brian Wilson's new mansion in Bel Air (once the home of Edgar Rice Burroughs), where the band would primarily record until 1972. This has been perceived by some commentators as [...] "the moment when the Beach Boys first started slipping from the vanguard to nostalgia." [...] Throughout mid-to-late 1967, Wilson oversaw the production of only a few heavily orchestrated songs holding continuity with his Pet Sounds and Smile work, such as [...] "Can't Wait Too Long" [...] and [...] "Time to Get Alone". Wilson's interest in the Beach Boys began to wane. Carl explained: [...] "When we did Wild Honey, Brian asked me to get more involved in the recording end. He wanted a break. He was tired. He had been <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> too long." ...|$|E

During the course of the season, the Redskins raised more than $700,000. [...] They finished the season with an 8–8 record and Schottenheimer was fired after the final game. Snyder later said in a 2013 interview on the firing of Schottenheimer, [...] "I like Marty and still do to this day, we are good friends, he'd still be here if he didn't want to do it all. He was insistent on <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> that was something that I don't think works, one guy can't do everything, he was a machine on that front.
