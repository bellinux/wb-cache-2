40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the crucial}} factors determining the <b>foreign</b> <b>direct</b> investment (FDI) {{going to the}} privatized glass sector in the Czech Republic.

Our econometrical analysis, using original panel data from 1990 to 2006, gives strong evidence that <b>foreign</b> <b>direct</b> <b>investors</b> in the glass sector in the Czech Republic have chosen larger and more profitable firms that were intensively restructured and privatized at the beginning of the transition.

40|$|Do profit-seeking <b>foreign</b> <b>direct</b> <b>investors</b> value a country's {{transition}} to democracy? If they do, they should vote with their pocketbooks, {{resulting in a}} post-transition increase in <b>foreign</b> <b>direct</b> investment flows. This study attempts to uncover links between {{transition to}} democracy and <b>foreign</b> <b>direct</b> investment (FDI) in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. In doing so, it addresses existing arguments about connections between democracy and investor behavior. The regions examined have not only experienced democratic transitions, they also account {{for the majority of}} the increasing flow of FDI to the developing world. This research employs time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) economic and political data, using ordinary least squares with panel corrected standard errors. The central finding is that transition to democracy has a negative effect on FDI.

In this paper we study the perceptions of some Romanian <b>foreign</b> <b>direct</b> <b>investors</b> using an own investigation realized at more than a year from the adhesion.

40|$|The {{transition}} from socialism to capitalism in Russia {{is both a}} political and an economic process. An {{important aspect of the}} latter is the possibility of integration into the world economy (through trade and capital flows) is a crucial and related element of the former. <b>Foreign</b> <b>direct</b> investment (FDI) is a particularly important element of the transition process itself and economic integration, because it opens not only possibilities for accelerated growth, technical innovation and enterprise restructuring, but also for capital account relief (Bevan and Estrin, 2000). There is growing evidence that enterprise productivity, R&D expenditure, innovation and company performance are higher in foreign owned firms — both in the transition economies and in the West. However, the inflows of <b>foreign</b> <b>direct</b> investment to Russia up until now were at the low level in comparison with the FDI to other country with transitional economies such as, for example, Poland or Hungary.
