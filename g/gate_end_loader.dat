It appeared on Timelines: The Intergenerational Music Project, a compilation album by various artists which paired young bands with artists over 60 to celebrate 1999 as the International Year of Older Persons. At {{the end of that}} year Kostic, while still a member of Front <b>End</b> <b>Loader,</b> joined Regurgitator to replace Martin Lee on drums.|$|R
40|$|Long term {{storage of}} wet distillers’ grains is {{important}} in order for small beef producers to effectively utilize these feeds due to their short shelf life. Many smaller beef producers {{do not have access}} to mixing equipment to produce mixtures of wet distillers’ grains and forages. This study measured the variation in feed mixtures mixed with a mixer wagon or a front <b>end</b> <b>loader.</b> Variation was reduced by approximately one half by mixing though a mixer wagon. Using the front <b>end</b> <b>loader</b> to mix the feeds resulted in variation that would be considered acceptable for many production situations...|$|R
40|$|Attached is a {{checklist}} and sample specifications for purchasing front <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> {{for use in}} the maintenance of Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s local roads and streets. This checklist and the sample specifications provide for individual preferences. They are not intended to dictate decisions or restrict bidding. If followed, they will assure a durable piece of maintenance equipment well suited for the uses placed on front <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> by Indiana Counties, Cities and Towns. A general observation of those with experience is that reducing specification requirements to obtain a lower first cost is nearly always a poor economic decision...|$|R

50|$|Assembling the HESCO bastion entails {{unfolding}} it {{and filling}} it with sand, soil or gravel, usually using a front <b>end</b> <b>loader.</b> The placement of the barrier is generally {{very similar to the}} placement of a sandbag barrier or earth berm except that room must generally be allowed for the equipment used to fill the barrier. The main advantage of HESCO barriers, strongly contributing to their popularity with troops and flood fighters, is the quick and easy setup. Previously, people had to fill sandbags, a slow undertaking, with one worker filling about 20 sandbags per hour. Workers using HESCO barriers and a front <b>end</b> <b>loader</b> can do ten times the work of those using sandbags.|$|R
5000|$|The 900 digger {{incorporated}} a pump system {{run from the}} tractor PTO {{as part of its}} design. Steelfab also manufactured front <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> for fitment to many different tractor marques and models under the brand name [...] "Horndraulic" [...] originally under license from the USA. For some time Steelfab manufactured front <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> for Ford and Leyland tractor which were marketed under the Ford and Leyland brand names by their dealers. The designer of the 800 and 900 digger who had joined Steelfab from the HyMac company later went on to design a scissor design tipper trailer known as the Power X System and later left Steelfab and set up business building mini excavators known as Powerfab.|$|R
50|$|LHD (Load, Haul, Dump machine) {{is also a}} front <b>end</b> <b>loader</b> but {{meant to}} be used for mine compact conditions, can handle various range of loads with varying size of buckets, and can be driven with {{electric}} motors as well as diesel engines.|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} control of hydraulic front <b>end</b> <b>loader</b> while dealing with unknown external load disturbances {{is the focus}} of this paper. The simulation results obtained show that the type- 2 fuzzy controller is capable of minimizing the position error of a front <b>end</b> <b>loader’s</b> bucket under load variations. This kind of hydraulic system is highly nonlinear due to factors such as leakage and friction. There are uncertainties in this system due to temperature dependence of bulk modulus and fluid viscosity. Such uncertainties together with the load variations cause chattering of the bucket position. Simulation results show for positional error of boom cylinder while varying the load in the bucket and also 50 to 150 % of variation in the nominal value of bulk modulus...|$|R

The 930G, with 149 hp of net flywheel power at 2300 rpm, it {{is classified as}} a small wheeled loader {{in the line of}} Caterpillar's excavators. The MSRP of a standard 930G is $145,400.|$|R
50|$|Early {{years of}} the castle were built entirely of blocks of snow. Firm snow from snowdrifts was {{collected}} by snowmobile and toboggan and brought to the building site. Later, front <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> were used to pile snow that could be quarried from the mound using large cross-cut saws.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1993 Front <b>End</b> <b>Loader</b> {{appeared}} at the Sydney venue of the Big Day Out concert series. In the next month they issued their debut single, [...] "Weak as Piss". The group signed with Survival Records and released their first extended play, Fraid Knot, in May. Their first album was the self-titled, Front <b>End</b> <b>Loader,</b> {{which appeared in the}} following month, and included the tracks [...] "Weak as Piss", [...] "'Fraid Knot" [...] and [...] "All Star Jam". It was recorded at Powerhouse Studios, in the previous November, and was produced by the group with Paul Tagg. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt it [...] "highlighted the band's sense of humour and gritty, unrestrained brand of thrash rock". In September that year they supported an Australian tour by Canadian group, No Means No.|$|R
50|$|A shear grab or {{also known}} as a silo grab or block cutter, is an {{implement}} used to cut blocks of silage from a silage pit/clamp. It is connected to a tractor via the three-point linkage or some are connected to a front <b>end</b> <b>loader.</b> It is powered by the tractors hydraulic system.|$|R
50|$|Normally {{powered by}} hydraulics, compactors take many shapes and sizes. In {{landfill}} sites for example, a large tractor (typically a converted front <b>end</b> <b>loader</b> with some variant of a bulldozer blade attached) with spiked steel wheels called a landfill compactor {{is used to}} drive over waste deposited by waste collection vehicles (WCVs).|$|R
50|$|The Impossibles is an Australian rock band, {{started by}} Bow Campbell of Front <b>End</b> <b>Loader,</b> Dave Aston of Trout Fishing in Quebec, Brendan Smyly of The Andy 500 and Geoff Martin of Imp as a gentler outlet of musical expression. The band's album was called Blanket Show and was {{released}} in 1998.|$|R
50|$|During the sixties, CSG were {{pioneers in}} the South with the Front <b>End</b> <b>Loader</b> - a tool now common {{place within the}} waste industry. More recently, Cleansing Service Group has won {{innovation}} awards {{for the treatment of}} various hazardous wastes in the both Hampshire Business Awards, (2009) and in the Salford Business Award, (2010).|$|R
50|$|LHD loaders {{are similar}} to {{conventional}} front <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> but developed for the toughest of hard rock mining applications, with overall production economy, safety and reliability in mind. They are extremely rugged, highly maneuverable and exceptionally productive. More than 75% of world's underground metal mines use LHD for handling the muck of their excavations.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1994 Front <b>End</b> <b>Loader</b> {{released}} {{their second}} EP, Adolescent Fantasy World, and {{followed with a}} split single, [...] "Heightened State of Awareness" [...] backed by a track from Melbourne-based psychobilly band, Fireballs. In October that year Front <b>End</b> <b>Loader</b> toured Europe supporting No Means No. Their second album, Let's Ride!, {{as well as its}} lead single, [...] "Be Jesus", were released in March 1995 by Shagpile Records and distributed by Shock Records. They had been recorded in September 1994 at Q Studios and mixed at Eclipse Studios with David Price and the group producing. Together the material [...] "mixed brawn with irony, complex riffs with eccentric humour" [...] according to McFarlane. Rachel Hill of The Canberra Times felt the album [...] "deserves a second hearing ... it takes the fearless on a ... full-strength adventure of emotion and power". In November 1995 they supported No Means No on an Australian tour.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the level}} of {{resource}} recovery, material can be put through an air classifier which separates light organic material from heavy organic material. The separate streams are then loaded, by front <b>end</b> <b>loaders,</b> onto trucks either for further processing or for sale. Further manual processing can be done on site if processing facilities are too far away to justify the transportation costs.|$|R
