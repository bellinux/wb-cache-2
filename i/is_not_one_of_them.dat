25|$|After the war, Eglin {{became a}} pioneer in {{developing}} the techniques for missile launching and handling; {{and the development of}} drone or pilotless aircraft beginning with the Republic-Ford JB-2 Loon, an American copy of the V-1. The 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group was activated at Eglin Field, Florida, on 6 February 1946, operating out of Auxiliary Field 3. Pursuant to an order from the War Department, dated 25 January 1946, the Commanding General of the Army Air Forces Center at Eglin Field was directed to activate the Headquarters, 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group, the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Squadron and the 1st Experimental Air Service Squadron. The total authorized strength for the three organizations was 130 officers, one warrant officer and 714 enlisted men. Eglin's commander was directed to supply manpower for the units from his own resources, but, given the recent postwar demobilization, his ability to do so was extremely limited. Operations were conducted out of Auxiliary Field 3 (Duke Field). On 13 January 1947, a successful drone flight from Eglin to Washington, D.C. was conducted utilizing a QB-17 Flying Fortress. A QB-17G, 44-85648, was utilized in a ditching test program at Eglin in 1948 when it was landed in the water by radio control. Ironically, although nine of the approximately 43 surviving intact B-17s in the world were assigned to the 3200th and 3205th Drone Groups at Eglin, the example displayed at the Air Force Armament Museum <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> having been a former U.S. Navy PB-1W patrol model.|$|E
500|$|One {{of the key}} {{differences}} between Wollstonecraft's novels and her philosophical treatises, as feminist critic Cora Kaplan has argued, is that her fiction values female emotion while her treatises present it as [...] "reactionary and regressive, almost counter-revolutionary". The Rights of Woman [...] portrays sexuality as a masculine characteristic, and while Wollstonecraft argues that some masculine characteristics are universal, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In The Wrongs of Woman, however, she accepts, relishes, and uses the sexualized female body as a medium of communication: Maria embraces her lust for Darnford and establishes a relationship with him. While in the Rights of Woman she had emphasized companioniate relationships, arguing that passions should cool between lovers, in The Wrongs of Woman, she celebrates those passions. Challenging contemporary moralists such as John Gregory and Rousseau, Wollstonecraft claimed that women could be fully sexualized beings.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} differences in the operation of waveguide filters compared to transmission line designs concerns the mode of transmission of the electromagnetic wave carrying the signal. [...] In a transmission line, the wave is associated with electric currents on a pair of conductors. [...] The conductors constrain the currents to be parallel to the line, and consequently both the magnetic and electric components of the electromagnetic field are perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave. [...] This transverse mode is designated TEM (transverse electromagnetic). [...] On the other hand, there are infinitely many modes that any completely hollow waveguide can support, but the TEM mode <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Waveguide modes are designated either TE (transverse electric) or TM (transverse magnetic), followed by a pair of suffixes identifying the precise mode.|$|E
500|$|Maxim Osipov of ISKCON {{argued in}} The Sydney Morning Herald that [...] "Avatar" [...] is a [...] "downright misnomer" [...] {{for the film}} because [...] "the movie reverses the very concept [...] the term 'avatar'—literally, in Sanskrit, 'descent'—is based on. [...] So much for a {{descending}} 'avatar', Jake becomes a refugee among the aborigines." [...] Vern Barnet in Charlotte Observer likewise thought that the title insults traditional Hindu usage of the term since it is a human, not a god, who descends in the film. [...] However, Rishi Bhutada, Houston coordinator of the Hindu American Foundation, stated that while there are certain sacred terms that would offend Hindus if used improperly, 'avatar' <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Texas-based filmmaker Ashok Rao added that 'avatar' does not always mean a representative of God on Earth, but simply one being in another form—especially in literature, moviemaking, poetry {{and other forms of}} art.|$|E

2500|$|Thirdly, Justice Ritchie also {{disagreed}} with the respondent's interpretation of Justice Laskin's opinion in Curr that a provision of a statute is inoperative purely {{on the basis of}} discrimination and that a violation of one of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by Section 1 of the Canadian Bill of Rights need not be established. Ritchie contends that Justice Laskin merely stated in his majority opinion that the rights guaranteed in paragraphs (a) to (f) (of Section 1) are guaranteed [...] "irrespective of race, national origin, colour or sex." [...] In other words, Section 1 rights are universal, which he argues is supported by the locution of the French version of the Bill of Rights. Furthermore, Ritchie held that the notion that the Bill of Rights prohibits discrimination alone does not comport with the purposes of the Bill of Rights, which are to guarantee that the rights and freedoms that are 'recognized and declared.'

2500|$|Some historians {{disagree}} that genocide, {{defined as a}} crime of intent, {{should be used to}} describe the colonization experience. Stafford Poole, a research historian, wrote: [...] "There are other terms to describe what happened in the Western Hemisphere, but genocide <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> It is a good propaganda term in an age where slogans and shouting have replaced reflection and learning, but to use it in this context is to cheapen both the word itself and the appalling experiences of the Jews and Armenians, to mention but two of the major victims of this century." [...] Political scientist Guenter Lewy says the label genocide is not applicable and he views the [...] "sad fate" [...] of the Native Americans as [...] "not a crime but a tragedy, involving an irreconcilable collision of cultures and values. [...] The new Americans, convinced of their cultural and racial superiority, were unwilling to grant the original inhabitants of the continent the vast preserve of land required by the Indians’ way of life." [...] Noble David Cook, writing about the Black Legend and the conquest of the Americas wrote, [...] "There were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact." [...] Cook acknowledged that [...] "it is impossible to factor out and weigh precisely each of the causes that led to the collapse of Amerindian society. We might ask, Did the Spanish lance lead to the death of 2 percent of the Indians, the arquebus 5 percent, the dog 12? ... Almost all sources provide that sickness made conquest and foreign domination easier, not just for the Spanish but for all European states." [...] Native American Studies professor Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz says, [...] "Proponents of the default position emphasize attrition by disease despite other causes equally deadly, if not more so. In doing so they refuse to accept that the colonization of America was genocidal by plan, not simply the tragic fate of populations lacking immunity to disease. In the case of the Jewish Holocaust, no one denies that more Jews died of starvation, overwork, and disease under Nazi incarceration than died in gas ovens, yet the acts of creating and maintaining the conditions that led to those deaths clearly constitute genocide." ...|$|E
