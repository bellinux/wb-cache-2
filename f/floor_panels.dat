25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} natural {{frequency}} and damping coefficient of Profiled Steel Sheet Dry Board (PSSDB) composite <b>flooring</b> <b>panel</b> system. The PSSDB composite <b>flooring</b> <b>panel</b> consists of dry board {{attached to the}} top surface of profiled steel sheet by self-drilling and self-tapping screws. This PSSDB composite panel has been used successfully as flooring system in few construction projects within Malaysia. As a lightweight flooring system, human induced vibration is becoming increasingly vital serviceability and safety issues for such panel when it is covering relatively longer span or area. Therefore, {{it is important to}} evaluate the factors affecting the serviceability performance and hence, to consider the effects of vibration in building such flooring system. This research is focused mainly on the fundamental frequency and damping coefficient of such <b>floor</b> <b>panel.</b> The influence of span length, board thickness, and connectors spacing on fundamental frequency are evaluated. It is shown that for the panels considered in this paper; up to the span length of 3. 5 m the fundamental frequency is above the limiting minimum value of 8 Hz and hence, it can be concluded that such composite <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> with practical span length will be comfortable to the occupants of building in terms of human induced vibration...|$|R

In the overworld and in dungeons, the game replaces the traditional item interface of the handheld Zelda games with pictures associating items or actions with buttons, similar to the item interface in 3D titles like [...] and [...] Enemies include familiar creatures from the Zelda universe. Link can also perform special actions present in the 3D Zelda games, such as rolling while running. Along with returning items such as Bombs, Arrows and Pegasus Boots, The Minish Cap introduces three new items: the Mole Mitts, the Gust Jar, and the Cane of Pacci. The Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through dirt barriers to explore new areas, the Gust Jar can suck in nearby items and substances and can be used to suck up certain enemies and fire them as projectiles, and the Cane of Pacci can flip certain objects over and allow Link to launch himself out of holes in the ground. The game advances the combat system from previous handheld installments by allowing Link to learn new sword techniques throughout the game, some of which are techniques from previous games and some of which are new. As the game progresses, Link will collect Elements that fuse with his sword, allowing him to make copies of himself using glowing <b>floor</b> <b>panels,</b> used to solve puzzles such as pushing large blocks or hitting multiple switches simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|In Korea, {{there is}} growing {{interest}} in the remodeling of aged apartment buildings. Traditionally, the heating panel in Korea is a wet type <b>floor</b> heating <b>panel</b> that utilizes radiation. But if a wet type <b>floor</b> heating <b>panel</b> is installed in an aged apartment during its remodeling, some problems may occur. They include failure to secure enough ceiling height, to reduce level of floor impact noise and possibility that the load on the existing structure is increased. In other words, a wet type <b>floor</b> heating <b>panel</b> {{may not be in}} compliance with the Korea building codes when it is used in remodeling of such apartment structures. Therefore, a prefabricated floor heating system which is thin and lightweight is suggested as an alternative to a wet type <b>floor</b> heating <b>panel.</b> In this research, first, the building codes that restrict, directly and indirectly, the prefabricated <b>floor</b> heating <b>panel</b> for an apartment remodeling were investigated. Second, the available thickness of panel was calculated so that it complies with the building code, and it was found {{that there is a need}} to develop a new prefabricated <b>floor</b> heating <b>panel</b> that can be installed in an aged apartment to be remodeled. Third, the design parameters of a <b>floor</b> heating <b>panel</b> were classified and determined according to their role to design reasonably within the available thickness by studying the standards and technical documents...|$|R

The optional cast aluminum wheels were finally made available, which reduced the unsprung weight of the car by 32pounds. Nearly 15% of the cars were ordered with the new wheels at a cost of $299.
