5|$|According to sinologists Denis C. Twitchett and Klaus-Peter Tietze, it is {{generally}} held that the Khitans emerged from the Yuwen branch of the Xianbei people. Following a defeat {{at the hands of}} another branch of the Xianbei in 345, the Yuwen split into three tribes, one of which was called the Kumo Xi. In 388 the Kumo Xi itself split, with one group remaining under the name Kumo Xi and the other group becoming the Khitans. This view is partially backed up by the Book of Wei, which describes the Khitans as being of Xianbei origins. There are also several competing theories on the origin of the Khitans. Beginning in the Song dynasty, some Chinese scholars suggested that the Khitans might have descended from the Xiongnu people. While modern historians have rejected the idea that the Khitan were solely Xiongnu <b>in</b> <b>origin,</b> there is some support for the claim that they are of mixed Xianbei and Xiongnu origin. Beginning with Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in the fourteenth century, several Western scholars have theorized that the Khitans were Mongolic <b>in</b> <b>origin,</b> and in the late 19th century Western scholars made the claim that the Khitans were Tungusic in origin—modern linguistic analysis has discredited this claim.|$|E
5|$|After Marius, {{the legions}} were drawn largely from {{volunteer}} citizens rather than citizens conscripted for duty. Volunteers {{came forward and}} were accepted not from citizens {{of the city of}} Rome itself but from the surrounding countryside and smaller towns falling under Roman control. Whereas some long-term military professionals were classed as veterans, they were outnumbered by civilians with limited military experience who were in active service perhaps only for a few campaigns. The legions of the late Republic remained, unlike the legions of the later Empire, predominantly Roman <b>in</b> <b>origin,</b> although some small number of ex-auxiliary troops were probably incorporated. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{a symbol}} of the Punic-Phoenician goddess Tanit, all {{pavement}} motifs are typically Hellenistic Greek <b>in</b> <b>origin,</b> although some pavement mortars used with tesserae designs betray some Italian influence. Although the three major ethnic groups of Delos included Greeks (largely of Athenian origin), Syrians/Phoenicians, and Italians/Romans, it is very likely that many of these Italians were Italiotes, Greek-speaking natives of Magna Graecia in what is now southern Italy. Delian inhabitants of either Greek, Italian, and Syrian origins owned mosaics in their private households, but Vincent J. Bruno asserts that the designs of their mosaic artworks were indebted entirely to Greek artistic traditions.|$|E

5|$|Beeston crag {{is one of}} a {{chain of}} rocky hills {{stretching}} across the Cheshire Plain. Pits dating from the 4thmillennium BC indicate the site of Beeston Castle may have been inhabited or used as a communal gathering place during the Neolithic period. Archaeologists have discovered Neolithic flint arrow heads on the crag, as well as the remains of a Bronze Age community, and of an Iron Age hill fort. The rampart associated with the Bronze Age activity on the crag has been dated to around 1270–830 BC; seven circular buildings were identified as being either late Bronze Age or early Iron Age <b>in</b> <b>origin.</b> It may have been a specialist metalworking site.|$|E
