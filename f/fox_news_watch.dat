50|$|Left-wing media {{critics and}} bloggers argue that <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>Watch</b> perpetuates {{the myth of}} liberal bias in the {{mainstream}} media while ignoring conservative bias by Fox News. <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>Watch</b> has also been accused of ignoring or dismissing controversies concerning Fox News' parent company, News Corporation, such as when an outtake was leaked online showing the program's panelists refusing to discuss News Corp's phone hacking scandal.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Johnson began {{indicating}} {{interest in}} {{running for president}} in the 2012 election. In the April 20, 2009 edition of The American Conservative magazine, Bill Kauffman told readers to [...] "keep an eye out" [...] for a Johnson presidential campaign in 2012, reporting that Johnson {{had told him that}} [...] "he was keeping his options open for 2012" [...] and that [...] "he may take a shot at the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 as an antiwar, anti-Fed, pro-personal liberties, slash-government-spending candidate—in other words, a Ron Paul libertarian". [...] During a June 24, 2009 appearance on <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> Freedom <b>Watch,</b> host Judge Andrew Napolitano asked Johnson if he would run for president in 2012, to which Johnson responded that {{he thought it would be}} inappropriate to openly express his desires before President Obama is given the opportunity to prove himself, but he followed up that statement by saying [...] "it appears personal freedoms are being shoveled out the window more and more." ...|$|R
40|$|Too often critics treat <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist {{brand and}} voice, {{its claim to}} stick up for the little guy as a gimmicky type of charlatanism {{that is used to}} convey simple and {{misleading}} news stories. However, in this dissertation, I demonstrate how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist journalistic style is in fact a sophisticated and complex form of political communication, one that requires great performative skill to embody, a deep knowledge of traditional political discourses, and an astute awareness of the key social and cultural cleavages active in a given historical moment. To capture the complexity of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist mode of address, in this study, I conduct a critical-textual analysis of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top three programs during the late- 2000 s Recession : Glenn Beck, Hannity, and The O'Reilly Factor. This involves a close reading of the "imagined community" <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> style is designed to address and how its style is crafted to create a political identity for viewers. While partisan identification with the Republican Party and political conservatism defines the broadest parameters of Fox's imagined community, the real power and ideological utility of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> mode of address, I argue, derive from its cultural referents, particularly, how it aligns deep moral values and social archetypes from the American populist rhetorical tradition with the political right, marking populism as conservative. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for interpreting <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> unique populist address, which includes an analysis of how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs attempt to draw symbolic linkages between political conservatism and the white working- class. In the second half of the dissertation, I demonstrate the power of this rhetorical approach by showing how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs framed news about the late- 2000 s Recession to fashion a conservative economic agend...|$|R
