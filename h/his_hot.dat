5|$|Born in Watts, Los Angeles, to {{a middle-class}} African-American family, Sylvester {{developed}} {{a love of}} singing through the gospel choir of his Pentecostal church. Leaving the church after the congregation expressed disapproval of his homosexuality, he found friendship {{among a group of}} black cross-dressers and transgender women who called themselves The Disquotays. Moving to San Francisco in 1970 at the age of 22, Sylvester embraced the counterculture and joined the avant-garde drag troupe The Cockettes, producing solo segments of their shows which were heavily influenced by female blues and jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. During the Cockettes' critically panned tour of New York City, Sylvester left them to pursue his career elsewhere.

5|$|Schafer {{stated that}} they began the {{development}} with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what he should be doing in the game—specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving <b>his</b> <b>hot</b> rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, {{they were able to}} expand {{out the rest of the}} game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.|$|E
5|$|The gardens {{were used}} daily for promenades and public breakfasts which were {{attended}} by Jane Austen among others. At public breakfasts tea, coffee, rolls and Sally Lunn buns were served at about midday, followed by dancing.

During these galas the gardens were lit with thousands of lamps and the guests took supper accompanied by music and fireworks. Breakfasts, coffee-drinking, newspaper-reading and card-playing took place in the ground floor of the Hotel and dancing in a ballroom on the first floor. All the rooms could be hired for private parties and meetings. In September 1802 André-Jacques Garnerin took off from the gardens in <b>his</b> <b>hot</b> air balloon.|$|E

5|$|Van Grunsven {{first met}} Bonfire {{when he was}} {{two and a half}} years old, having been under saddle for only a week. He was later {{purchased}} by Van Grunsven's father. At first it appeared that the young horse would be a poor prospect, as <b>his</b> <b>hot</b> temperament led to poor gaits. However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on May 24 {{for a series}} against the St. Louis Cardinals amid media speculation that Manager Don Mattingly {{was in danger of}} losing his job.

25|$|On the June 14 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Bryan (with Kane and Orton as his tag team partners) ended The Shield's unpinned and unsubmitted streak in a {{televised}} six-man tag match by forcing Rollins to submit. Two days later at Payback, Bryan and Orton's poor teamwork resulted in an unsuccessful challenge for Rollins and Reigns' WWE Tag Team Championship. The following night on Raw, while the status of Team Hell No was left {{up in the air}} after both members considered individual pursuits, Bryan and Orton faced off in a no disqualification match that Orton won via referee stoppage after Bryan suffered a legit nerve injury, which was a stinger resulting in Bryan being unable to feel both his arms {{for the rest of the}} match. Four days later on SmackDown, Bryan defeated Orton, but to Bryan's dismay, it was via countout. On the next Raw, Bryan decisively defeated Orton via submission in a street fight, and later continued <b>his</b> <b>hot</b> streak by picking up wins over Sheamus and Christian. On July 14 at Money in the Bank, Bryan competed in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match; during the match, Bryan was attacked by Curtis Axel, a non-participant, which ultimately prevented Bryan from winning the match that was won by Orton.|$|E

Following the midweek win over the Crew, United traveled to Toronto, where they faced a Toronto F.C. squad that had struggled since their star Giovinco was injured. Jozy Altidore, however, continued <b>his</b> <b>hot</b> streak. as he dribbled past both Birnbaum and Hamid and scored to stake the home team to a lead in the 36th minute. But, Neagle scored on a header three minutes later to level the score, when a goalmouth scramble forced a saved by the Toronto goalie that {{found its way to}} Neagle in front of the goal. Neagle made it two in the second half when he got {{on the end of a}} Sam pass and touched it beyond the keeper's reach. Pending the next day's Montreal Impact match, the win catapulted D.C. at least temporarily into 4th place in the Eastern Conference. The Toronto match was followed by a break for international games, and both Birnbaum and Hamid were called into the national team. Birnbaum made the trip to Cuba where he was a second-half substitute, but a kick to the face left him bloody and needing stitches.|$|E
