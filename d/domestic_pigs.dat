They include (2011) around 1.4 billion cattle, 1.2 billion sheep, 1 billion <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs,</b> and (1985) over 700 million rabbits. Working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, pack animals continue to transport goods.|$|E

[...] However, in 1777, Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben classified the <b>domestic</b> <b>pig</b> as a separate species from the wild boar.

50|$|The <b>domestic</b> <b>pig</b> (Sus scrofa domesticus or Sus domesticus), {{often called}} swine, hog, or pig {{when there is}} no need to {{distinguish}} it from other pigs, is a large, even-toed ungulate. It is variously considered a subspecies of the wild boar or a distinct species. The <b>domestic</b> <b>pig's</b> head-plus-body-length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m, and the adult can weigh between 50 to 350 kg. Compared to other artiodactyls, its head is relatively long, pointed, and free of warts. Even-toed ungulates are generally herbivorous, but the <b>domestic</b> <b>pig</b> is an omnivore, like its wild relative.|$|R

25|$|As Buru {{is located}} at the {{boundary}} between the biogeographic zones of Australia and Asia, its flora and fauna are unique and are the subject of national and international scientific research. Of 25 species of mammals found on the island, at least four are endemic to Buru and closest to it islands. The local species of the wild pig named Buru babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa) is distinguished from the other Babyrousa species by having relatively long and thick body-hair. It also has very low fat content in their meat (only 1.27% compared to 5–15% for <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs)</b> and is regarded as a delicacy among the local population, which favours it to other wild pigs or deer in terms of texture and flavour. Also endemic to Buru are three types of bats: Moluccan flying fox (Pteropus chrysoproctus), Ceram fruit bat Pteropus ocularis and lesser tube-nosed bat (Nyctimene minutus).|$|E

40|$|Aim: Identification of wild <b>pig</b> and <b>domestic</b> <b>pig</b> is {{essential}} to prevent illegal poaching of wild pig and to implement Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. PCR-RFLP was used to differentiate Wild pig (Sus scrofa cristatus) from <b>Domestic</b> <b>pig</b> (Sus scrofa domestica) meat. Materials and Methods: DNA was isolated from meat samples of both the sub species and a fragment of Cytochrome b gene was amplified using universal primers and the PCR products were subjected to restriction digestion. Results: All the known samples {{of each of the}} sub-species amplified 474 bp fragment successfully using b 1 and b 2 primers. To differentiate between wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>pig</b> meat, restriction digestion of the PCR products was carried out to produce characteristic PCR-RFLP patterns for each species. StuI digestion yielded a RFLP pattern which distinguished the closely related sub species. The alignment of sequences of Wild pigs with sequences of local <b>domestic</b> <b>pig,</b> European wild pig and exotic breeds revealed 7 intra-species polymorphic sites within Cytochrome b gene fragment. Conclusion: This study showed that The PCR-RFLP is a simple and very effective tool for differentiating the samples of both the sub species and could prove to be a useful tool in forensic identification of wild <b>pig</b> and <b>domestic</b> <b>pig...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2015, a study {{looked at}} over 100 pig genome {{sequences}} to ascertain their process of domestication. The process of domestication {{was assumed to}} have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms, but {{the study found that}} the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported. The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe where they crossed with wild boar. A model that fitted the data included admixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the Pleistocene. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> have strong signatures of selection at genetic loci that affect behavior and morphology.

500|$|While {{all forms}} of wild game were popular among those who could obtain it, most meat came from {{domestic}} animals. [...] Domestic working animals that were {{no longer able to}} work were slaughtered but not particularly appetizing and therefore were less valued as meat. [...] Beef was not as common as today because raising cattle was labor-intensive, requiring pastures and feed, and oxen and cows were much more valuable as draught animals and for producing milk. [...] Mutton and lamb were fairly common, especially in areas with a sizeable wool industry, as was veal. [...] Far more common was pork, as <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> required less attention and cheaper feed. <b>Domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> often ran freely even in towns and could be fed on just about any organic waste, and suckling pig was a sought-after delicacy. [...] Just about every part of the pig was eaten, including ears, snout, tail, tongue, and womb. [...] Intestines, bladder and stomach could be used as casings for sausage or even illusion food such as giant eggs. Among the meats that today are rare or even considered inappropriate for human consumption are the hedgehog and porcupine, occasionally mentioned in late medieval recipe collections. Rabbits remained a rare and highly prized commodity. In England, they were deliberately introduced by the 13th century and their colonies were carefully protected. Further south, domesticated rabbits were commonly raised and bred both for their meat and fur. They were of particular value for monasteries, because newborn rabbits were allegedly declared fish (or, at least, not-meat) by the church and therefore they could be eaten during Lent.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> in Timor and Papua New Guinea (which appear to be of Sulawesi warty pig stock), the wild boar is the ancestor of most pig breeds. [...] Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar as early as 13,000–12,700 BC in the Near East in the Tigris Basin being managed in the wild in a way {{similar to the way}} they are managed by some modern New Guineans. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 BC in Cyprus. Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then. There was also a separate domestication in China which took place about 8000 years ago. DNA evidence from sub-fossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first <b>domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> in Europe had been brought from the Near East. This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boar resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock. Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported in turn to the ancient Near East. Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries. <b>Domestic</b> <b>pigs</b> tend to have much more developed hindquarters than their wild boar ancestors, to the point where 70% of their body weight is concentrated in the posterior, which is the opposite of wild boar, where most of the muscles are concentrated on the head and shoulders.|$|E
