5|$|The basic story {{elements}} unfold as the protagonist, Tim, {{attempts to}} rescue a princess from a monster. Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations and motivations. The game features traditional aspects of the platform genre while integrating various powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses by finding and assembling <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> pieces.|$|E
5|$|The color {{matching}} required in a tiling by Wang dominoes {{can easily be}} achieved by modifying {{the edges of the}} tiles like <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> pieces so that they can fit together only as prescribed by the edge colorings. Raphael Robinson, in a 1971 paper which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jigsaw</b> <b>puzzles</b> were {{originally}} created by painting {{a picture on}} a flat, rectangular piece of wood, and then cutting that picture into small pieces with a jigsaw, hence the name. John Spilsbury, a London cartographer and engraver, is credited with commercializing <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzles</b> around 1760. <b>Jigsaw</b> <b>puzzles</b> have since come to be made primarily of cardboard.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzles</b> (500 piece Clue/750 piece Cluedo/200 Jr. ed.), {{based on the}} game was {{introduced}} in 1991.

However, the converse question — whether {{some form of}} multilinear maps follows from iO — has remained largely open. We offer an abstraction of multilinear maps called Polynomial <b>Jigsaw</b> <b>Puzzles,</b> and show that iO for circuits implies Polynomial <b>Jigsaw</b> <b>Puzzles.</b> This implication is unconditional: no additional assumptions, such as one-way functions, are needed. Furthermore, we show that this abstraction of Polynomial <b>Jigsaw</b> <b>Puzzles</b> is sufficient to construct iO for NC 1, thus showing a near-equivalence of these notions...|$|R

5|$|The Coens {{referenced}} the noir tradition {{again with}} The Man Who Wasn't There (2001); a black-and-white crime melodrama set in 1949, {{it features a}} scene apparently staged to mirror the one from Out of the Past pictured above. Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle.</b> British-born director Christopher Nolan's black-and-white debut, Following (1998), was an overt homage to classic noir.

5|$|If {{the account}} of Sima Qian (c. 145–86 BC) in his Records of the Grand Historian is proven correct upon the {{unearthing}} of Qin Shi Huang's (r. 221–210 BC) tomb, the raised-relief map has existed since the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). Robert Temple and Joseph Needham suggest that certain pottery vessels of the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the raised-relief map. The Han Dynasty general Ma Yuan (14 BC – 49 AD) made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 AD. Such rice models were expounded on by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) author Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845 AD). A raised-relief map made of wood representing all the provinces of the empire and put together like a giant 0.93 m2 (10ft2) <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> was invented by Xie Zhuang (421–466 AD) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479).|$|E

Xie Zhuang (421–466) of the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479) created a 0.93 m2 (10ft2) wooden raised-relief map of the empire (showing mountains and rivers) which could be taken apart and pieced together like a giant <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle.</b> Shen Kuo also created his own raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste.|$|E

25|$|Toys {{became more}} {{widespread}} {{with the changing}} attitudes towards children engendered by the Enlightenment. Children began {{to be seen as}} people in and of themselves, as opposed to extensions of their household and that they had a right to flourish and enjoy their childhood. The variety and number of toys that were manufactured during the 18th century steadily rose; John Spilsbury invented the first <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> in 1767 to help children learn geography. He created puzzles on eight themes – the World, Europe, Asia, Africa, America, England and Wales, Ireland and Scotland. The rocking horse (on bow rockers) was developed {{at the same time in}} England, especially with the wealthy as it was thought to develop children's balance for riding real horses.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{investigation}} into the crash site by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary involved many helicopter surveys, satellite imaging, and {{a search of the}} area by police and soldiers. The wreckage of the crash was scattered over 2,000 square kilometres and AAIB investigators were confronted by a massive <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> in trying to piece the plane back together. In total 4 million pieces of wreckage were collected and registered on computer files. More than 10,000 pieces of debris were retrieved, tagged and entered into a computer tracking system. The perpetrators had apparently intended the plane to crash into the sea, destroying any traceable evidence, but the late departure time of the aircraft meant that its explosion over land left a trail of evidence.|$|E

500|$|Actor Misha Collins, {{known for}} playing the angel Castiel on the American {{television}} series Supernatural, {{is the founder of}} GISHWHES.

Collins posted a message on Twitter, declaring that if the show won, Ollis had promised him a rhinoceros which he would share with everyone who helped by voting for the show. When Supernatural won the competition, Collins, partially inspired by his time at the University of Chicago as an undergraduate during which he participated in the school's annual scavenger hunt, asked his followers to send him self-addressed stamped envelopes into which he put scavenger hunt prompts written on the backs of <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> pieces from a puzzle depicting a rhino.
