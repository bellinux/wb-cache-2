40|$|Rovabio® Excel is a {{preparation}} of endo- 1, 3 (4) -beta-glucanase and endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase that {{is intended to}} be used as a feed additive for lactating sows, at a dose of 1   500 glucanase U and 1   100 xylanase U/kg feed, in order to minimise the mobilisation of body reserves of sows during lactation. The European Food Safety Authority issued an opinion on the safety and efficacy of Rovabio® Excel as a feed additive for chickens and turkeys for fattening, laying hens, piglets (weaned) and pigs for <b>fattening,</b> <b>ducks,</b> guinea fowl, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons. The full description of the formulations, manufacturing processes, purity, stability and homogeneity of the product is given in that assessment. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the safety aspects, other than for the new target species, are covered in the previous assessment and would not be affected by the extension of use requested. The results of a tolerance study showed that 200 -fold the recommended dose was tolerated well by the sows when offered for a period of seven weeks, including gestation and lactation. Therefore, the Panel concludes that the recommended dose is safe in lactating sows. The Panel cannot conclude on the efficacy of Rovabio® Excel from the available efficacy data...|$|E
40|$|Rovabio® Excel is {{an enzyme}} {{preparation}} (solid and liquid forms) of endo- 1, 3 (4) -beta-glucanase and endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase, {{produced by a}} non-genetically modified strain of Penicillium funiculosum (Talaromyces versatilis sp. nov.). The additive {{is to be used}} as a feed additive for chickens and turkeys for fattening, laying hens, piglets (weaned) and pigs for <b>fattening,</b> <b>ducks,</b> guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons. Tolerance trials performed in chickens and turkeys for fattening, laying hens and piglets showed that the animals tolerated well 200 -fold (chickens, turkeys and piglets) or 20 -fold (laying hens) the recommended dosage. Therefore, the additive is safe for these target species at the recommended dose. The conclusion can be extended to pigs for fattening and can be extrapolated to ducks, guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons provided that the same dose applies. The fermentation product used for the preparation of the additive gave negative results for mutagenicity. The results obtained in a sub-chronic oral toxicity study raised no concerns regarding the product. Therefore, the additive gives rise to no concern for consumer safety. No risks to the environment are expected from the use of the product as a feed additive. Based on the results obtained in the efficacy trials provided in chickens and turkeys for fattening, laying hens, piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening, it is concluded that the additive has the potential to be efficacious at the recommended dose. These conclusions can be extrapolated to ducks, guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons. The Panel proposes a recommendation to modify the specifications of the additive...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe PSR {{problem has}} become a major {{occupational}} health issue in Western countries. At the request of an SME which processes <b>fattened</b> <b>ducks,</b> we developed a specific approach taking into account its economic and social environment. We assumed that the PSR could not be dealt with independently of the realities and the production constraints. The initial request, made by the person responsible for occupational health and the head of production, mentioned a deterioration in the working environment in the "stripping" department, where "foie gras" is prepared once removed from the duck. This resulted in an increase in absenteeism (more than 20 %), complaints from employees over a long period, a deterioration in mutual aid between employees in the department and a general demotivation. We proposed a participative methodology (in working groups) targeting the identification and resolution of quality and production problems, ranging from difficulties in producing foie gras of quality to being able to cope with PSR. In particular, we will discuss the method employed: * Work analyses to identify problems with production and quality, * Search for links between problems of production, quality and health, * Participatory ergonomics to try out solutions and evaluate them, * Reflection on the organization with middle and top management. The production problems were finally resolved, thereby improving productivity and quality. Beyond these aspects, our biggest challenge was to establish a process allowing more leeway for employees to improve their daily situation, something that supervisors saw as loss of control. Our focus was employee commitment to the process and the positive results have finally proved convincing. Absenteeism has stabilized and was lower {{a few months after the}} intervention. Feedback from managers and employees has reported the efficiency of this work-centered approach...|$|R

[...] - The global {{increase}} in liver production {{indicates that the}} demand for this unique product will probably remain on the long term. Production, however, will probably be re-structured in favour of cheaper <b>fattened</b> <b>duck</b> liver. Goose liver {{on the other hand}} will remain the top segment within the fattened liver segment. Hungary - the second largest liver producer after France - will be interested in producing both. Hungary has been a global leader in goose liver production for decades but can expect to see new competitors (e. g. China) in worldwide liver trade. Additionally, the increased duck liver production in other countries may also {{make it more difficult to}} export Hungarian liver products. As fattened liver (foie gras) cannot be produced in any other way than the way it is currently done the present requirement of relevant labelling of products made from <b>fattened</b> geese and <b>ducks</b> is the correct solution due to the ever stronger animal welfare movements. This provides customers with fair information, allowing them to make a choice of purchasing of refusing such products. It would be useful to use appropriate tools of communication to make consumers aware that fattened goose liver is a traditional product of Hungary, which has a unique quality. There are serious social interests (jobs, industry) and economic benefits (export revenue) attached to preserving this industry. To protect the entire liver industry and improve the image of fattened liver it would be possible and necessary to refute extreme and baseless criticism of the production of fattened liver by raising awareness of production technologies which promote animal welfare. libamÃ¡j, kacsamÃ¡j, mÃ¡jpiac, mÃ¡jfogyasztÃ¡s, Ã¡llatjÃ³lét, goose liver, duck liver, liver market, liver consumption, animal welfare, International Relations/Trade, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R

40|$|This manual was {{originally}} produced in Spanish by the Ministry of Sugar Production in Cuba. With funds from CTA, the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) {{was able to}} translate it and produce it in English {{in order to help}} increase duck production as a source of protein for the Caribbean in particular, and also for other ACP countries. The domestic duck has a rapid growth rate: while fattening chickens require 23 % and 19. 7 % of total protein (TP) during the initial growing and <b>fattening</b> stages respectively, <b>ducks</b> can perform very well with 20 % and then 16 % protein up to the time of slaughter. Perhaps {{the most important aspect of}} duck-rearing for the Caribbean and other cane producing countries is their preference for liquid diets, which makes ducks particularly suitable for rearing on some by-products of sugar. Sugar by-products such as intermediate syrups A and B, syrup-off, or even sugar cane juice, can provide the required energy component of up to 65 % of dry matter, while soyabeans or soya flour, sunflowers, fish silage, earthworms or organic waste can provide the protein element of the diet. This small manual covers all aspects of duck rearing, production, reproduction, housing, hygiene and management. Sixteen pages are devoted to feeding, with tabulated sugar-based formulae for different stages of duck growth, and tables which show the use of differing amount sand types of compounds that may be utilized.
