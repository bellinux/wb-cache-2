(MIL-DTL-43511D clause 3.5.10 <b>for</b> <b>goggles</b> and visors and MIL-PRF31013 clause 3.5.1.1 for spectacles. Though these standards have been very commonly used especially by NATO forces, an update on MCEPS of January 2013 now reference these clauses in MIL-PRF-32432. Ballistic sunglasses or prescription eyeglasses must meet the same requirements. In brief, the U.S. military standard requires that ballistic eyewear must be able to withstand up to a [...]15 caliber (at 640 ft/sec) for spectacles and [...]22 caliber at 550-560 ft/sec <b>for</b> <b>goggles.</b> The European standard identifies four levels of impact protection.|$|R
