The captain decides {{that they should be}} exiled to Ceti AlphaV, a harsh world that Kirk {{believes}} would be a perfect place for Khan to start his kingdom. Khan claims he is up to the challenge of taming the world and accepts Kirk's offer. Instead of a court-martial for Lt.McGivers, Kirk allows her to go into exile with Khan. Spock notes that it would be <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what Khan makes of Ceti AlphaV in 100years.|$|E
5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so it would be <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what unfolded between them.|$|E
25|$|Keep in mind our Constitution predates the Industrial Revolution. Our founders did {{not know}} about electricity, the train, telephones, radio, television, automobiles, airplanes, rockets, nuclear weapons, satellites, or space exploration.

25|$|In Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in {{the upper}} reaches of the Yangtze River, Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni are {{distributed}} in mountainous areas, and are not subjected to flood influence as much as in the middle and lower reaches of the river. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that a relatively lower number of haplotypes were found in this region as compared with Oncomelania hupensis hupensis. It appears likely that there has been certain degree of isolation for these mountainous populations.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the crowd's {{reaction}} to the English last-wicket partnership. They cheered every scoring shot and went into ecstasy over Tattersall's efforts. It was quite obvious that {{they had decided to}} fight the battle out for England and were plainly partisan...There are many Australians, and I am one of them, who believe that cricket will reach its highest level again when England and Australia are on level pegging. These were the people who cheered the tenth-wicket partnership to the echo.|$|E
25|$|Building {{up to the}} 2012 presidential election, it was <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{how strong}} the {{influence}} of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns, where Obama's winning campaign had been social media-heavy, whereas McCain's campaign did not really grasp social media. JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media. Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media {{to the advantage of}} presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.|$|E

500|$|During an interview, series {{producer}} Paul Marquess, {{he described}} it as a long running storyline, adding: [...] "It is dark to begin with, the lessons that Ste learns are ultimately positive and life affirming." [...] He also felt it was about not [...] "being afraid of who you are" [...] and Ste was [...] "refreshingly accepting" [...] of his feelings towards a man. Richardson revealed he was shocked to discover the details of the plot. He felt it was <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how Ste coped with the being the victim of domestic violence.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the episode was pitched by Simpsons writer Ron Hauge, who {{thought it would be}} <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an episode in which Bart would run into a retired Western film star in the {{neighborhood}} and [...] "think he was the coolest guy in the world", although the actor had seen better days. Hauge suggested that Swartzwelder, who is an avid Western fan, would be the appropriate writer for the episode. Swartzwelder also pitched the plot idea about the angry dog who chases Bart in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Although Tony did {{not appear}} in the show until September 2008, his arrival was {{anticipated}} from April of that year, when EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer commented that the series was building a picture of his character, {{and that it would be}} <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him on-screen. It was reported on 2 July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a child sexual abuse storyline involving Whitney.

He added that, [...] "hile Bow Wow's more mature stance suits him well, {{it will be}} <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how his younger fans and mainstream R radio react to the teenage MC's new image. Either way, Bow Wow has proven that his act is no child's play."

Hennig justified this choice, believing that it would prove <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what his decision had engendered after a few millennia. She emphasized, though, that she did not consider him a monster or mustache-twirling villain, remarking that [...] "in many ways, he's a more complex and sympathetic character than Raziel himself". Sources which helped to formulate his role in the plot ranged from Biblical lore to Eastern myth and mysticism.|$|E

500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic complimented the {{performances}} by Betsy Brandt and Aaron Paul, and {{said of the}} latter, [...] "Seriously, does any actor on TV convey more by saying less than Aaron Paul?" [...] He also compared Skyler's increasingly calculated approach to Walter's drug dealing to Gus' personality. New York magazine writer Logan Hill praised Brandt's performance {{and said it was}} <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an episode so focused on Skyler and Marie on a show usually dominated by the male characters. However, he said Skyler's transformation from concerned wife to competent criminal partner felt too sudden. Not all reviews were positive.

From the beginning of the writing process, Yoshimura specifically wanted the Lange character to be mean and unpleasant, rather than the nice and innocent victim more typically portrayed in such television episodes: [...] "Tragedy can happen to jerky people too and I think it'd be much more <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how that kind of character's circumstances transcends the typical cliched TV kind of victim." ...|$|E

500|$|Shore {{traced the}} concept {{for the title}} {{character}} to {{his experience as a}} patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled: [...] "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [...] and I thought that it would be <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a character who actually did that before they left the room." [...] A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way. The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this. Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network's insistence that the character be reimagined—putting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension. The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis, which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency.|$|E

500|$|The game artists {{regularly}} drafted {{variations on}} Tali's face throughout the series' development.

They were aware that either decision would likely annoy some people, and that no reveal could universally fit all views of Tali. BioWare wished to unveil her face in a [...] "tasteful way" [...] outside of the game engine, and decided that a gift from Tali would be the best way. A stock photo was used to ensure the face's closeness to a real photograph.
