5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} <b>force</b> (<b>per</b> unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E

25|$|Friction. This {{is a force}} always {{opposing}} the forward motion, whereby the vector invariably acts in the negative direction s with an effect to reduce the speed. The friction at play in the balanced-flow models is the one exerted by the roughness of the Earth's surface on the air moving higher above. For simplicity, we here assume that the frictional <b>force</b> (<b>per</b> unit mass) adjusts to the parcel's speed proportionally through a constant coefficient of friction K. In more realistic conditions, the dependence of friction on the speed is non-linear except for slow laminar flows.|$|E

In electrical systems, the stored energy {{is the sum}} of energies stored in lossless inductors and capacitors; the lost energy {{is the sum of}} the energies dissipated in resistors per cycle. In mechanical systems, the stored energy is the maximum possible stored energy, or the total energy, i.e. the sum of the potential and kinetic energies at some point in time; the lost energy is the work done by an external conservative <b>force,</b> <b>per</b> cycle, to maintain amplitude.|$|E
25|$|When {{describing}} {{a container of}} gas, the term pressure (or absolute pressure) refers to the average <b>force</b> <b>per</b> unit area that the gas exerts {{on the surface of}} the container. Within this volume, it is sometimes easier to visualize the gas particles moving in straight lines until they collide with the container (see diagram at top of the article). The force imparted by a gas particle into the container during this collision is the change in momentum of the particle. During a collision only the normal component of velocity changes. A particle traveling parallel to the wall does not change its momentum. Therefore, the average force on a surface must be the average change in linear momentum from all of these gas particle collisions.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the friction behaviors of graphene flakes sliding on a gold substrate using molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of flake size, flake shape, relative rotation angle between flake and substrate, and crystal orientation of substrate on the friction process are thoroughly studied. It is found {{that under the}} same load, the average friction <b>forces</b> <b>per</b> atom are smaller for a bigger graphene flake, which exhibits an obvious size effect. It is also shown that flake shape is critical in determining the friction in the sliding process. The average friction <b>forces</b> <b>per</b> atom for the square flake are much bigger than those for the triangular and round flakes. Moreover, the average friction <b>forces</b> <b>per</b> atom for the triangular flake are the smallest. We also find that the orientation of graphene flake relative to gold substrate plays {{a vital role in}} the friction process. The friction forces for the graphene flake sliding along the armchair direction are much bigger than those for the flakes with rotation. In addition, it is also found that single crystalline gold substrate exhibits a significant anisotropic effect of friction, which is attributed to the anisotropic effect of potential energy corrugation. These understandings not only shed light on the underlying mechanisms of graphene flake sliding on the gold substrates but also may guide the design and fabrication of nanoscale graphene-based devices.|$|R

25|$|A useful {{idea from}} {{mechanics}} {{is that the}} energy gained by a particle {{is equal to the}} force applied to the particle multiplied by the displacement of the particle while that force is applied. Now consider the first law without the heating term: dU = -PdV. The pressure P {{can be viewed as a}} force (and in fact has units of <b>force</b> <b>per</b> unit area) while dVis the displacement (with units of distance times area). We may say, with respect to this work term, that a pressure difference forces a transfer of volume, and that the product of the two (work) is the amount of energy transferred out of the system as a result of the process. If one were to make this term negative then this would be the work done on the system.|$|E

500|$|Pressure is an across {{variable}} because {{pressure is}} measured {{relative to the}} two terminals of an element, not as an absolute pressure.

[...] Forces act through an element; a rod with a force applied to the top will transmit the same force to an element connected to its bottom. [...] Thus, in the through and across analogy the mechanical domain {{is analogous to the}} electrical domain like the mobility analogy, but the acoustical domain is analogous to the electrical domain like the impedance analogy.|$|E
