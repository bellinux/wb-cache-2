50|$|Beginning in the 1860s, <b>ferrocement</b> barges {{were built}} in Europe for use on canals, and around 1896, an Italian engineer, Carlo Gabellini, began {{building}} small ships out of <b>ferrocement.</b> The most famous of his ships was the Liguria.|$|E
5000|$|On August 2, 1917, Nicolay Fougner of Norway {{launched}} the first self-propelled <b>ferrocement</b> ship intended for ocean travel. This was an [...] vessel of 400 tons named Namsenfjord. With {{the success of}} this ship, additional <b>ferrocement</b> vessels were ordered, and in October 1917, the U.S. government invited Fougner to head a study into the feasibility of building <b>ferrocement</b> ships in the United States. The Fougner Concrete Shipbuilding Company, Flushing Bay, New York, reported calculated cost was of $290 per deadweight ton for the Cape Fear (List of shipwrecks in 1920 [...] "10.21 30 October") and the Sapona which they presumably built.|$|E

50|$|Concrete {{ships are}} built {{of steel and}} <b>ferrocement</b> (reinforced concrete) instead of more {{traditional}} materials, such as steel or wood. The advantage of <b>ferrocement</b> construction is that materials are cheap and readily available, while the disadvantages are that construction labor costs are high, as are operating costs. (<b>Ferrocement</b> ships require thick hulls, which means extra mass to push and less space for cargo.) During the late 19th century, there were concrete river barges in Europe, and during both World War I and World War II, steel shortages led the US military to order the construction of small fleets of ocean-going concrete ships, the largest {{of which was the}} SS Selma. Few concrete ships were completed in time to see wartime service during World War I, but during 1944 and 1945, concrete ships and barges were used to support U.S. and British invasions in Europe and the Pacific. Since the late 1930s, there have also been <b>ferrocement</b> pleasure boats.|$|E
50|$|On April 12, 1918, President Woodrow Wilson {{approved}} the Emergency Fleet Corporation program which oversaw {{the construction of}} 24 <b>ferrocement</b> ships for the war. However, {{when the war ended}} in November 1918, only 12 <b>ferrocement</b> ships were under construction and none of them had been completed. These 12 ships were eventually completed, but soon sold to private companies who used them for light-trading, storage, and scrap.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ferrocement</b> faux bois uses a {{combination}} of concrete, mortar and grout applied to a steel frame or armature to sculpt lifelike representations of wooden objects. Final sculpting can be done while the mixture is wet, in a putty state, or slightly stiff. Techniques vary among artisans. Most popular in the late 19th century through the 1940s, <b>ferrocement</b> faux bois has largely disappeared {{with the passing of}} those most expert in its practice. What few objects remain from that peak period (mostly in the form of garden art, such as planters and birdbaths) are now highly prized by collectors.|$|E

50|$|Rainwater {{harvesting}} {{has become}} significant {{in view of}} the realization that water has become scarce and it is becoming a critical problem globally. In big cities large residencies are required to have a rainwater harvesting system. For the present, drains are being constructed with conventional materials such as brick and stonemasonry and R.C.C. side drains. Rain water is made to flow through these drains to a centralized water storage tank. Water from this tank is designated for nondomestic and gardening purposes. The water storage tank is of brick masonry or R.C.C. The drains for the flow of rainwater and the tank for the storage of rainwater can be constructed using <b>Ferrocement</b> technology. <b>Ferrocement</b> drains are machine-made, precast products about 2.4 to 5 meters long with covers and perforations of the same length at about 25 mm thick. The surfaces of these drains are known to be strong and not easily eroded by the flow of water. The bottom and sides of the water storage tanks consist of <b>ferrocement</b> plates with space frames. These plates are about 25 mm thick, waterproof, strong, durable, and low-maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Between 1908 and 1914, larger <b>ferrocement</b> barges {{began to}} be made in Germany, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, and California. The remains of a British ship of this type, the {{auxiliary}} coaster Violette (built 1919), can be seen at Hoo, Kent, England.|$|E

50|$|Albert Vrana (1921-1994)was an American {{sculptor}} who is {{best known}} for his mid-twentieth century monumental architectural sculptures done in the Modernist style, using novel materials, such as <b>ferrocement,</b> and new techniques, such as sand casting using plastic Styrofoam molds to shape sculptural concrete panels and metal sculptures.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ferrocement</b> or ferro-cement (also called thin-shell {{concrete}} or ferro-concrete) is {{a system}} of reinforced mortar or plaster (lime or cement, sand and water) applied over layer of metal mesh, woven expanded-metal or metal-fibers and closely spaced thin steel rods such as rebar. The metal commonly used is iron or some type of steel. It is used to construct relatively thin, hard, strong surfaces and structures in many shapes such as hulls for boats, shell roofs, and water tanks. <b>Ferrocement</b> originated in the 1840s in France and is the origin of reinforced concrete. It has {{a wide range of}} other uses including sculpture and prefabricated building components. The term [...] "ferrocement" [...] has been applied by extension to other composite materials, including some containing no cement and no ferrous material.|$|E
50|$|Cement and {{concrete}} are used interchangeably {{but there are}} technical distinctions {{and the meaning of}} cement has changed since the mid-nineteenth century when <b>ferrocement</b> originated. Ferro- means iron although metal commonly used in ferro-cement is the iron alloy steel. Cement in the nineteenth century and earlier meant mortar or broken stone or tile mixed with lime and water to form a strong mortar. Today cement usually means Portland cement, Mortar is a paste of a binder (usually Portland cement), sand and water; {{and concrete}} is a fluid mixture of Portland cement, sand, water and crushed stone aggregate which is poured into formwork (shuttering). Ferro-concrete is the original name of reinforced concrete (armored concrete) known at least since the 1890s and in 1903 it was well described in London's Society of Engineer's Journal but is now widely confused with <b>ferrocement.</b>|$|E
50|$|In construction, {{chicken wire}} or {{hardware}} cloth {{is used as}} a metal lath to hold cement or plaster, in a process known as stuccoing. Concrete reinforced with chicken wire or hardware cloth yields <b>ferrocement,</b> a versatile construction material. It {{can also be used to}} make the armature for a papier-mâché sculpture, when relatively high strength is needed.|$|E
50|$|Modern hobbyists also build <b>ferrocement</b> boats (ferroboats), {{as their}} {{construction}} methods {{do not require}} special tools, and the materials are comparatively cheap. A pioneer in this movement is Hartley Boats, which has been selling plans for concrete boats since 1938. Meanwhile, since the 1960s, the American Society of Civil Engineers has sponsored the National Concrete Canoe Competition.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{examples}} of the craft survive at Parc des Buttes-Chaumont opened for an exposition in Paris in 1867. In 1873, the inventor of <b>ferrocement,</b> Joseph Monier expanded his patents to include bridges. He designed the first bridge of reinforced concrete, crossing the moat at the Chateau Chazelet, in France. It was sculpted to resemble timbers and logs.|$|E
50|$|Squatting slabs {{can be made}} of {{porcelain}} (ceramic), stainless steel, fibreglass, or in {{the case}} of low-cost versions in developing countries, with concrete, <b>ferrocement,</b> plastic, or wood covered with linoleum. Slabs can also be made of wood (timber), but need to be treated with preservatives, such as paint or linoleum, to prevent rotting and to enable thorough cleaning of the squatting slab.|$|E
50|$|More boats {{have been}} added, {{including}} the schooner Katherine Ellen which was impounded in 1921 for running guns to the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Kennet Canal barge Harriett, and <b>ferrocement</b> barges built in World War II. The last boat was beached in 1965.The ground level {{has built up}} {{over the years and}} some of the more recent additions are lying on top of those which had been beached earlier.|$|E
50|$|Designed {{to reduce}} noise {{transmission}} between rooms, the ﬂats come ﬁtted with the patented FerroLite partition wall system. The wall is essentially non-load bearing {{and made of}} <b>ferrocement.</b> As compared to other cement-based partition walls, the hollow core of the FerroLite wall cuts down {{on the need for}} raw materials like cement and sand. In addition, services can be installed and concealed within the wall with minimal wet works and without the need for hacking.|$|E
50|$|Gray is Managing Director of Ecotechnics Maritime {{which owns}} and {{operates}} the Research Vessel Heraclitus, a 25-meter <b>ferrocement</b> Chinese junk. Since 1975 its multicultural crew of explorers, researchers and artists have sailed the vessel over 270,000 miles, in every sea except the Arctic. Gray has organised a project based on the Heraclitus, a three-year expedition to study the changing port cultures of the Mediterranean entitled Lives and Legends of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5000|$|Ferrolite Wall [...] - HDB new {{patented}} wall using {{a material}} called <b>ferrocement,</b> {{which is similar}} to concrete but uses less sand as it contains a steel wire mesh. A ferrolite wall uses 20 per cent less sand than a concrete one. It is less susceptible to cracking and heat from the sun and have better sound-insulation capabilities. It is a piloted project launched from 2006 for selective Fernvale Court, Treelodge and Kim Tian Green.|$|E
50|$|The Big Duck is a <b>ferrocement</b> {{building}} {{in the shape of}} a duck located in Flanders, New York, on Long Island. It was originally built in 1931 by duck farmer Martin Maurer in nearby Riverhead, and used as a shop to sell ducks and duck eggs. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. It is a principal building on the Big Duck Ranch, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.|$|E
50|$|Computer-assisted {{planning}} {{facilities were}} used to resolve the structure's unorthodox design. A simple floor of wire mesh and mortar was used instead of a traditional foundation. All the structure's components are self-supporting, relieving stress by their ubiquitous continuity. <b>Ferrocement,</b> only one inch thick, {{was used for the}} undulating walls and domes in order to reduce load. The cave was constructed by unskilled tribal labourers using only hand tools. Broken ceramic crockery and waste tiles {{were used to}} cover the domes' exterior, which bears a transversal mosaic of a snake.|$|E
