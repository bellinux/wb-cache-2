25|$|Balance {{refers to}} the {{relative}} volume {{of each of the}} instruments. Because chamber music is a conversation, sometimes one instrument must stand out, sometimes another. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> simple matter for members of an ensemble to determine the proper balance while playing; frequently, they require an outside listener, or a recording of their rehearsal, to tell them that the relations between the instruments are correct.|$|E
25|$|The {{conservation}} of large chromosomal segments makes comparison between species worthwhile. Chromosome banding {{has been a}} reliable indicator of chromosome homology overall, i.e. that the chromosome identified {{on the basis of}} banding actually carries the same genes. This relationship may fail for phylogenetically distant species or species that have experienced extremely rapid chromosome evolution. Banding is still morphological and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> foolproof indicator of DNA content.|$|E
25|$|Because {{hardened}} metal {{is usually}} more brittle than softer metal, through-hardening (that is, hardening the metal uniformly throughout the piece) <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> suitable choice for uses where the metal part {{is subject to}} sliding contact with hard or abrasive materials. In such circumstances, case-hardening can provide a part that will not fracture (because of the soft core that can absorb stresses without cracking) but also provides adequate wear resistance on the surface.|$|E

25|$|Development {{geography}} is {{a branch of}} geography which refers to {{the standard of living}} and its quality of life of its human inhabitants. In this context, development is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change. However, development <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> positive process. Gunder Frank commented on the global economic forces that lead to the development of underdevelopment. This is covered in his dependency theory.|$|E
25|$|Rationalists {{also have}} {{different}} understanding and claims involving {{the connection between}} intuition and truth. Some rationalists claim that intuition is infallible and that anything we intuit to be true is as such. More contemporary rationalists accept that intuition <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> source of certain knowledge– thus allowing {{for the possibility of}} a deceiver who might cause the rationalist to intuit a false proposition in the same way a third party could cause the rationalist to have perceptions of nonexistent objects.|$|E
25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} {{diagnosed}} clinically based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as EM, facial palsy, or arthritis), or {{a history of}} possible exposure to infected ticks, as well as serological blood tests. The EM rash <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> bull's eye, i.e., it can be solid red. When making a diagnosis of Lyme disease, health care providers should consider other diseases that may cause similar illnesses. Not all individuals infected with Lyme disease develop the characteristic bull's-eye rash, and many may not recall a tick bite.|$|E

25|$|The {{identification}} of dungeons and rooms {{used to hold}} prisoners <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> straightforward task. Alnwick Castle and Cockermouth Castle, both near England's border with Scotland, had chambers in their gatehouses which have often been interpreted as oubliettes. However, this has been challenged. These underground rooms (accessed by a door in the ceiling) were built without latrines, and since the gatehouses at Alnwick and Cockermouth provided accommodation {{it is unlikely that}} the rooms would have been used to hold prisoners. An alternative explanation was proposed, suggesting that these were strong-rooms where valuables were stored.|$|E
25|$|Competition is {{only one}} of many {{interacting}} biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure. Moreover, competition <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> straightforward, direct, interaction. Interspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered fecundity, growth, or survival may result in at least one species. Interspecific competition has the potential to alter populations, communities and the evolution of interacting species. On an individual organism level, competition can occur as interference or exploitative competition.|$|E
25|$|The sugar was {{originally}} added shortly before serving, and therefore did not add carbonation or alcohol to the beverage, as the sugar {{did not have}} the time to ferment. Modern faro beer is still characterized by the use of brown sugar and lambic, but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> light beer. The use of meertsbier has disappeared, and modern faro is not viewed as cheap or light. Today, faro is bottled, sweetened, and pasteurized to prevent refermentation in the bottle. Examples are produced by Cantillon, Boon, Lindemans or Mort Subite.|$|E

25|$|Future eruptions {{may include}} {{pyroclastic}} flows and surges {{similar to those}} that occurred at Mount Pelée, Merapi, Vesuvius, Etna, Soufrière Hills, Mount Unzen and elsewhere. During 2003, there was an increase in seismic activity at the volcano and a rift opened on the north-east flank. No eruptive activity occurred but a volume of material - possibly liquid, was emplaced into the edifice and is estimated to have a volume of ~1011 m3. Such activity can indicate that magma is rising into the edifice, but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> precursor to an eruption.|$|E
25|$|Conservation <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> full {{explanation}} for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning top is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the nutation axis, but neglecting friction {{at the point of}} spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its precession axis. Also, in any planetary system, the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.|$|E
25|$|Many biblical authors draw {{a strong}} {{connection}} between love {{of others and}} love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman {{is the same as}} hatred of God. Thomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.|$|E

25|$|Since the client's life is his to live, {{and not the}} therapist's, {{hermeneutic}} counseling {{states that}} therapists must {{be open to the}} horizons of the individuals they work with, even when their horizon conflicts with the therapist's. Hermeneutic theory states that this {{is an important part of}} understanding that client resistance to therapeutic intervention <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> defiant or oppositional act as mainstream therapies would say. Instead, an understanding of client resistance is re-conceptualized as part of the dialogical process and effort for both client and therapist to learn how to relate to one another authentically and arrive at contextual truth and meaning for the client.|$|E
25|$|Today's {{biometric}} technology makes non-violent {{methods of}} gaining access, {{even by the}} most experienced safe hackers and code crackers, nearly impossible. Modern vaults and safes are also reinforced {{to the point that}} the amount of explosives needed to blow them open would likely create unwanted attention and run the risk of harming the building to the point of collapse. By their very nature, even the most impregnable vault or safe eventually needs to be able to be opened and closed by someone. To circumvent vault and safe security features, robbers often kidnap the bank manager, but that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> successful ideal as banks have often removed the manager's ability to open the vault.|$|E
25|$|Slab {{rollback}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> {{continuous process}} suggesting an episodic nature. The episodic {{nature of the}} rollback is explained by {{a change in the}} density of the subducting plate, such as the arrival of buoyant lithosphere (a continent, arc, ridge, or plateau), a change in the subduction dynamics, or a change in the plate kinematics. The age of the subducting plates does not have any effect on slab rollback. Nearby continental collisions have an effect on slab rollback. Continental collisions induce mantle flow and extrusion of mantle material, which causes stretching and arc-trench rollback. In the area of the Southeast Pacific, there have been several rollback events resulting in the formation of numerous back-arc basins.|$|E
