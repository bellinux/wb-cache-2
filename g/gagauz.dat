5|$|By {{the time}} of the Soviet Census of 1989, 27.4% of the {{population}} of Odessa Oblast identified themselves as ethnic Russian, whilst 55.2% identified themselves as ethnic Ukrainians. The remainder was made up mostly of Moldavians, Bulgarians and <b>Gagauz.</b>|$|E
5|$|The country's {{official}} language is Turkish, which is spoken by 85.54 {{percent of the}} population a first language. 11.97 {{percent of the population}} speaks the Kurmanji dialect of Kurdish as mother tongue. Arabic and Zaza are the mother tongues of 2.39 percent of the population, and several other languages are the mother tongues of smaller parts of the population. Endangered languages in Turkey include Abaza, Abkhaz, Adyghe, Cappadocian Greek, <b>Gagauz,</b> Hértevin, Homshetsma, Kabard-Cherkes, Ladino (Judesmo), Laz, Mlahso, Pontic Greek, Romani, Suret, Turoyo, Ubykh, and Western Armenian.|$|E
25|$|However, {{opposition}} was growing to the increasingly exclusionary nationalist {{policies of the}} Popular Front, especially in Transnistria, where the Yedinstvo-Unitatea (Unity) Intermovement had been formed in 1988 by Slavic minorities, and in the south, where the organization <b>Gagauz</b> Halkî (<b>Gagauz</b> People), formed in November 1989, came to represent the <b>Gagauz,</b> a Turkic-speaking minority there.|$|E

25|$|Several rural {{villages in}} the {{municipalities}} of Aksakovo, Suvorovo, and Valchidol, {{as well as the}} Vinitsa district of Varna, have historically been populated mostly by <b>Gagauz.</b>|$|E
25|$|Characteristic {{features}} of Turkish, such as vowel harmony, agglutination, {{and lack of}} grammatical gender, are universal within the Turkic family. There is also {{a high degree of}} mutual intelligibility among the various Oghuz languages, which include Turkish, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Qashqai, <b>Gagauz,</b> Balkan <b>Gagauz</b> Turkish, and Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar. Although methods of classification vary, the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided equally into two branches: Oghur, the only surviving member of which is Chuvash, and Common Turkic, which includes all other Turkic languages including the Oghuz subbranch.|$|E
25|$|The major Christian-Turkic peoples are the Chuvash of Chuvashia and the <b>Gagauz</b> (Gökoğuz) of Moldova. The {{traditional}} {{religion of}} the Chuvash of Russia, while containing many ancient Turkic concepts, also shares some elements with Zoroastrianism, Khazar Judaism, and Islam.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish {{language}} {{belongs to}} the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is {{for the most part}} mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include Azerbaijani, <b>Gagauz,</b> Turkmen and Urum, and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.|$|E
25|$|According to Ion Nistor, the {{population}} of Bessarabia in 1856 was composed of 736,000 Romanians (74%), 119,000 Ukrainians (12%), 79,000 Jews (8%), 47,000 Bulgarians and <b>Gagauz</b> (5%), 24,000 Germans (2.4%), 11,000 Romani (1.1%), 6,000 Russians (0.6%), adding {{to a total of}} 990,274 inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{location}} of their earliest area of settlement is disputed: {{a group of}} historians proposes that the group was probably tasked with defending the Byzantine border to the north, and settled in and around what later became known as Babadag, while another one centers this presence on the Southern Dobrujan strip of land known as Kaliakra (presently in Bulgaria). In addition, various historians argue that this Seljuq migration was the decisive contributor to the ethnogenesis of the <b>Gagauz</b> people, which, some of them believe, could also have involved the Cumans, Pechenegs, Oghuz and other Turkic peoples. The <b>Gagauz,</b> few of whom have endured in Dobruja, are majority Eastern Orthodox, a fact which was attributed to a process of religious conversion from Islam.|$|E
25|$|Almost 80% of {{the people}} {{currently}} residing in Anatolia are Turks. Kurds constitute a major community in southeastern Anatolia, and are the largest ethnic minority. Abkhazians, Albanians, Arabs, Arameans, Armenians, Assyrians, Azerbaijanis, Bosnian Muslims, Circassians, <b>Gagauz,</b> Georgians, Serbs, Greeks, Hemshin, Jews, Laz, Levantines, Pomaks, Zazas {{and a number of}} other ethnic groups also live in Anatolia in smaller numbers.|$|E
25|$|In mid-October 1990, {{approximately}} 30,000 Moldovan nationalist {{volunteers were}} sent to Gagauzia and Transnistria, where an outbreak of violence was averted by {{the intervention of the}} Soviet 14th Army. (The Soviet 14th Army, now the Russian 14th Army, had been headquartered in Chișinău since 1956.) However, negotiations in Moscow between the <b>Gagauz</b> and Transnistrian leadership, and the government of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova failed.|$|E
25|$|Under the Ottomans, the {{population}} became extremely diverse, with {{significant number of}} Turks and other Muslim peoples arriving from Asia Minor, the steppes north of the Black Sea, and the Caucasus, along with Orthodox Christian <b>Gagauz,</b> Armenians, and Sephardic Jews from Thessaloniki. Many Bulgarians from the region were forcibly relocated to Asia Minor and, {{in the wake of}} the Russo-Turkish wars, up to 250,000 eastern Bulgarians were transferred to Russian Bessarabia and Crimea.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} {{proportion of}} the peoples of European Russia gradually decreased during the past century, but still compose 91% {{of the total population}} of Russia in 2010. The absolute numbers of most of these peoples reached its highest level {{in the beginning of the}} 1990s. Since 1992, natural growth in Russia has been negative and the numbers of all peoples of European Russia were lower in 2010 than in 2002, the only exceptions being the Roma (due to high fertility rates) and the <b>Gagauz</b> (due to high levels of migration from Moldova to Russia).|$|E
25|$|In 1814, {{the first}} German {{settlers}} arrived and mainly {{settled in the}} southern parts and Bessarabian Bulgarians began settling in the region too, founding towns such as Bolhrad. Between 1812 and 1846, the Bulgarian and <b>Gagauz</b> population migrated to the Russian Empire via the River Danube, after living many years under oppressive Ottoman rule, and settled in southern Bessarabia. Turkic-speaking tribes of the Nogai horde also inhabited the Budjak Region (in Turkish Bucak) of southern Bessarabia from the 16th to 18th centuries, but were totally driven out prior to 1812.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Census of 1817, which {{recorded}} 96,526 {{families and}} 482,630 inhabitants, did not register ethnic data except for recent refugees (primarily Bulgarians) and certain ethno-social categories (Jews, Armenians and Greeks). In the 20th century, Romanian historian Ion Nistor extrapolated {{the numbers for}} the ethnic groups, providing the following estimates: 83,848 Romanian families (86%), 6,000 Ruthenian families (6.5%), 3,826 Jewish families (4.2%), 1,200 Lipovan families (1.5%), 640 Greek families (0.7%), 530 Armenian families (0.6%), 482 Bulgarian and <b>Gagauz</b> families (0.5%). An 1818 statistic of three counties in southern Bessarabia (Akkerman, Izmail and Bender) that had witnessed strong emigration of the Muslim population and immigration from other regions, including Ottoman lands south of the Danube, recorded the following percentages: 48.64% Moldavians, 7.07% Russians, 15.65% Ukrainians, 17.02% Bulgarians and 11.62% others, amounting to a total population of 113,835.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev's {{policies}} of perestroika and glasnost in the Soviet Union allowed political liberalisation at a regional level. This {{led to the}} creation of various informal movements all over the country, and to a rise of nationalism within most Soviet republics. In the Moldavian SSR in particular, there was a significant resurgence of pro-Romanian nationalism among ethnic Moldovans. The most prominent of these movements was the Popular Front of Moldova. In the spring of 1988, PFM demanded that the Soviet authorities declare Moldovan the only state language, return to the use of the Latin alphabet, and recognise the shared ethnic identity of Moldovans and Romanians. The more radical factions of the Popular Front espoused extreme anti-minority, ethnocentric and chauvinist positions, calling for minority populations, particularly the Slavs (mainly Russians and Ukrainians) and <b>Gagauz,</b> to leave or be expelled from Moldova.|$|E
25|$|As the Cumans {{ceased to}} have a state of their own, they were {{gradually}} absorbed into Eurasian populations (certain families in Hungary, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Turkey, Romania, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tatars in Crimea). The Cumans in Dobruja were assimilated into Bulgarian and Romanian people. Traces of the Cumans can still be found in placenames stretching from China to Macedonia, such as the city of Kumanovo in the northeastern Republic of Macedonia; a Slavic village named Kumanichevo in the Kostur (Kastoria) district of Greece, which was changed to Lithia after Greece obtained this territory in the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest; Comăneşti in Romania; Kuman, a city in Xinjiang, China; Kuh-e Kumana, a mountain in Lorestān, Iran; the village of Koman in Iran; Kuman, {{a small town in}} Sistan Va Baluchestan, Iran; Polovtsy, a town in Smolenskaya Oblast', Russia; Polovtsy in Mahilyowskaya Volblasts', Belarus; the steppes north of the Caucasus Mountains, referred to as Kuban as well as the Kuban River; the village of Kumane in Serbia; the village of Kumanitsa, in the municipality of Ivanjica, Serbia; the municipality of Kuman in the Fier District, Fier County, southwestern Albania; Küman, a village and municipality in the Lerik Rayon of Azerbaijan; the town and district of Ulaş in the Sivas province of Turkey; Comana in Northern Dobruja (also Romania); the small village of Kumanite in Bulgaria; Kuman, a town in Qashqadaryo, Uzbekistan; Kuman-san, a mountain peak near Ch'unch'ŏn, Gangwon, South Korea; the town of Kumanlar in Ordu, Turkey; Debrecen in Hungary; the village of Bugac in Hungary, the counties of Bács-Kiskun and Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok as well as the cities Kiskunhalas and Kunszentmiklós in Hungary, the village of Kunmadaras in Greater Cumania, Hungary; and the town of Kumanov in Khmel'nyts'ka Oblast', Ukraine. The flower, Kumoniga (melilot), is also a relic of the Cumans. The <b>Gagauz</b> people are believed by some historians to be descendents of the Cumans; the name Qipcakli occurs as a modern <b>Gagauz</b> surname. The etymology of the Sea of Azov is popularly said to derive from a certain Cuman prince named Azum or Asuf, who was killed defending a town in this region in 1067.|$|E
25|$|Leon Levițchi's {{corpus of}} English {{translations}} from Eminescu {{first appeared in}} 1978, {{one year after the}} death of another celebrated Eminescu translator, the teenaged Corneliu M. Popescu. In 1984, Cartea Românească put out a volume featuring Deicke and Popescu's versions, and renditions into seven other languages: French, by Mihail Bantaș; Spanish, by Omar Lara; Armenian, by H. Dj. Siruni; Russian, by Yuriy Kozhevnikov and I. Mirinski; Italian, by Mario De Micheli; Hungarian, by Jenő Kiss; and Portuguese, by Dan Caragea. New Italian renditions were also done by Marco Cugno (1989–1990) and Geo Vasile (2000). There are also several version of the poem in Serbo-Croatian, including one by Mate Maras (1998). Another English version, the work of Josef Johann Soltesz, was printed in 2004, followed by Tomy Sigler's Hebrew (2008) and Todur Zanet's <b>Gagauz</b> (2013), then by Miroslava Metleaeva's new Russian and Güner Akmolla's Crimean Tatar (both 2015). The project of translating into French was again taken up in the 2010s, with Jean-Louis Courriol authoring a celebrated adaptation. Courriol has nevertheless avoided including it in French anthologies, arguing that Luceafărul was no longer relevant or understandable.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{admixture}} analyses {{based on}} data of several individuals of modern populations, estimate that the genes of the Bulgarians have two sources and a main admixture event between 1000 and 1600 YBP. The genes that are provisionally or indicatively {{to be associated with}} the Balto-Slavic donor group constitute about 40-45% of the total, i.e. Belarusian-like, of which a Lithuanian-like admixture is estimated at 23.2% and a Polish-like admixture at 19.3%. Early gene flows between southeastern and eastern Europe make it difficult to obtain a correct estimate, although young enough identical by descent segments confirmed such connection and that the East and West Slavs share more identical by descent segments with South Slavs than with Greeks, inter-Slavic populations (a group of Romanians, <b>Gagauz),</b> but less with Balts, while the South Slavs share similar number with East and West Slavs, but fewer with Greeks. Genetically and linguistically the Slavic ancestors of the modern South Slavs had divided mainly into two groups, each of which took a migration stream either through the west or the east of the Carpathian Mountains. The western Balkans was settled with Sclaveni, the east with Antes. Haplogroup R1a, the major haplogroup among Slavic tribes, reveals that the haplogroup of the Serbo-Croat group is mainly constituted by R1a-L1280 or R1a-CTS3402, while the Macedono-Bulgarian is exclusively made up of the R1a-L1029. A pattern of distribution of IBD segments between South Slavs and East and West Slavs suggests a shared ancestry or a modest gene flow.|$|E
25|$|After 1812, {{the newly}} {{installed}} Russian authorities expelled the large Nogai Tatar population of Budjak (Little Tartary), and encouraged {{the settlement of}} Moldavians, Wallachians, Bulgarians, Ukrainians and others through various fiscal facilities and exemption from military service. The colonization was generated {{by the need to}} better exploit the resources of the land, and by the absence of serfdom in Bessarabia. German colonists from Switzerland (canton Lausanne), France, and Germany (Württemberg) settled in 27 localities (most newly settled) in Budjak, and by 1856 Bessarabian Germans were 42,216. Russian veterans of the 1828–1829 war with the Ottomans were settled in 10 localities in Budjak, and three other localities were settled by Cossacks from Dobrudja (which got there from the Dniepr region some 50 years earlier). Bessarabian Bulgarians and <b>Gagauz</b> arrived from modern eastern Bulgaria as early as {{the second half of the}} 18th century. In 1817, they numbered 482 families in 12 localities, in 1856 – 115,000 people in 43 localities. Ukrainians had arrived Bessarabia since before 1812, and already in the 1820s they made up one third of the population of the most northern Hotin county. In the following decades more Ukrainians settled throughout the northern part of Bessarabia from Galicia and Podolia. Jews from Galicia, Podolia and Poland also settled in Bessarabia in the 19th century, but mostly in the cities and fairs; in some of these they eventually became a plurality. In 1856, there were 78,751 Bessarabian Jews and according to the Imperial Russian census of 1897, the capital Kishinev had a Jewish population of 50,000, or 46%, out of a total of approximately 110,000. There was even an attempt by the Russian authorities to create 16 Jewish agricultural colonies, where 10,589 people would settle. However within less than 2 generations, most of them sold the land to the local Moldavians and moved to the cities and fairs. The various population movements saw an increase of the Slavic population to more than a fifth of the total population by 1920, while the proportion of the Moldovan population steadily decreased. In absence of any official records on ethnic distribution until the late 19th century, various figures for the ethnic proportions of the region have been advanced. Thus, in the 1920s Romanian historian Ion Nistor alleged that, at the beginning of the Russian administration, Moldavians represented 86% of the population. While according to official statistics speakers of Moldovan and Romanian accounted for 47.8% in 1897, some authors proposed figures as high as 70% for the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
