The rumour of the capture or destruction of Dain's brig had reached the Arab's ears three days before from the sea-fishermen and through the dwellers on the lower reaches of the river.

50|$|The Steerage Act of 1819, and all {{the other}} Acts {{regulating}} conditions of travel passed after that, were repealed and superseded by the Carriage of Passengers Act of 1855, passed March 3, 1855. The Carriage of Passengers Act imposed a wider range of regulations on the conditions of travel than the original Steerage Act, combining and extending regulations introduced in the many other Acts passed starting 1847. Specifically, in addition to modifying the limits based on tonnage and food and water provisions, it added many regulations on such topics as deck space, hospitals, berths, ventilators, cambooses and cooking ranges, discipline and cleanliness, and privies. The additional regulations were designed and motivated by the goal of reducing the spread of infections and <b>deaths</b> <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> after experience with epidemics of cholera, typhus, and typhoid in recent years (such as the 1847 North American typhus epidemic).|$|R
