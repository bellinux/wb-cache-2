40|$|Abstract. The {{production}} of natural hydroxyapatite (HAp) specifically from cortical bovine bones and natural calcite was studied in this paper. Bovine hydroxyapatite (BHA) was produced from bovine bone {{in bulk form}} by <b>de-fatting</b> continued with calcination at 900 ºC. Natural calcite hydroxyapatite (CHA) was produced by hydrothermal method. It was confirmed from XRD, FTIR, and SEM results that HA have been successfully produced from natural sources like bulk bovine bone and natural calcite. The results also show that the crystallinity of BHA is higher than CHA, matching with the hardness test results of sintered BHA and CHA...|$|E
40|$|The largest {{quantities}} of by-products of dairy processing originates from the cheese making. Whey proteins {{are used for}} animal feeding and human nutrition as well, for example in dry soups, infant formulas, and supplements. The fat components of the whey might impair its use. The aim of our experiments {{was to investigate the}} separation of the lipid fraction of whey. The microfiltration {{is said to be a}} gentle and energy efficient method for this task. During the measurements 0. 2 μm microfiltration membranes were used and the membrane separation was enhanced by vibration, inserting static mixer and air sparging. The <b>de-fatting</b> efficiency, the retention of the whey components, the flux values, and the resistances in different combinations were compared in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Phytoestrogens are diphenolic {{compounds}} that {{are present in}} several edible plants and are particularly abundant in soybeans. Because of their estrogenical, antriestrogenical, anticarcinogenic and antioxidant activities in animal and humans, they became of great interest. Dietary factors are considered important in determination of risks, in fact, studies have revealed beneficial or protective effects of the consumption of vegetables, in particular soy and soybean products. So that in the present paper the simultaneous determination of eight isoflavones and coumestrol in vegetables is reported. The quantitative analysis has been made by means of LC separation combined with tandem mass spectrometry. In particular, a new simple and fast extraction methodology and a clean-up, based on cold aided <b>de-fatting,</b> is proposed. Method performancewas evaluated by comparison with a reference procedure. The developed procedure was then used for a survey of phytoestrogens concentration in some selected vegetables...|$|E
30|$|After the {{hydrolysis}} procedure, the hydrolysate was filtered by centrifugation in a GHP nanosep (Pall Corp.) at 10, 000  rpm for 10  s. The filtered {{samples were}} de-fatted by adding 0.5  mL of n-hexane/dichloromethane (3 : 2, v/v), shaking for 10  s, and removing the upper organic solvent. This <b>de-fat</b> procedure was repeated three times. The remaining acidic solution was evaporated under stream of dry nitrogen to dryness {{with the addition}} of 0.2  mL methanol.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} preliminary clinical, radiological andhistological result using {{fresh frozen}} cortico-cancellous blockallograft {{in combination with}} Le Fort I osteotomy for preprosteticsurgery. Methods: Since 2007, 5 patients suffering of extremely atrophicjaws bone were selected for repositioning of the maxilla andsinus lift augmentation, prior implant-supported prosthetic rehabilitation. Patients underwent Le Fort I procedure and freshfrozen cortico-cancellous blocks were used as interpositionalallograft. Resorbable double-layer membrane were placed whenon-lay grafts were performed. Harvesting of bone blocks wasperformed from iliac crest of multi-organ donor. Pre-operativex-ray evaluation included a standard x-panoran and CT Dentascan. Immediately before surgery, bone chips were washed withsaline solution at 40 ºC in order to <b>de-fat</b> it, and mixed withautologous venous graft. Standard chemio-profilaxis and postoperativetherapy were administer to each patient. Six monthsafter bone grafting a CT Denta-scan was obtained prior implantsurgery. A bony biopsy was performed {{at the time of}} implantinsertion to evaluate bone graft osteorigeneration. Results: All surgical procedure were performed without complications. Only moderate swelling and moderate blood loss fromnose during immediate time after surgery were observed. CTDental-scan, performed 5 months after surgery, confirmed noneradiological signs of re-absorbed bone tissue neither periostealreactions. Histological results showed good bone integration withnone tissue necrosis or immunological reactions. Conclusion: Fresh frozen homologous grafts can be consider asvalid substituted bone tissue in maxillo-facial surgery...|$|R
40|$|Dika nut kernels were {{extracted}} from the nuts of 24 Irvingia gabonensis fruits collected from 151 trees in three villages in Cameroon and Nigeria. Methods were developed for the milling, <b>de-fatting,</b> hot-water pasting and rapid visco-analysis of the samples, to simulate the cooking of dika nut meal as a food-thickening agent. Two parameters (viscosity and drawability), thought {{to relate to the}} soup-thickening quality of dika nut meal, were derived from the traces. The samples exhibited significant tree-to-tree variation in viscosity, drawability and fat content, and differences between their villages of origin were significant. Thickening was found not to be directly associated with protein content. Similarly, the fat content did not contribute to the thickening properties at temperatures above fat melting point. Fat determination and fatty acid profiling indicated that the fat content ranged from 37. 5 % to 75. 5 % and identified myristic and lauric acids as the major fatty acid components. This study is part of a wider tree domestication project characterising tree-to-tree variation in fruit, nut and kernel traits of I. gabonensis with the aim of improving the livelihoods of subsistence farmers...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The pollen coat is {{the first}} {{structure}} of the pollen to encounter the mucosal immune system upon inhalation. Prior characterizations of pollen allergens have focused on water-soluble, cytoplasmic proteins, but have overlooked much of the extracellular pollen coat. Due to washing with organic solvents when prepared, these pollen coat proteins are typically absent from commercial standardized allergenic extracts (i. e., "de-fatted"), and, as a result, their involvement in allergy has not been explored. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a unique approach to search for pollen allergenic proteins residing in the pollen coat, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) {{to assess the impact}} of organic solvents on the structural integrity of the pollen coat. TEM results indicated that <b>de-fatting</b> of Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda grass) pollen (BGP) by use of organic solvents altered the structural integrity of the pollen coat. The novel IgE-binding proteins of the BGP coat include a cysteine protease (CP) and endoxylanase (EXY). The full-length cDNA that encodes the novel IgE-reactive CP was cloned from floral RNA. The EXY and CP were purified to homogeneity and tested for IgE reactivity. The CP from the BGP coat increased the permeability of human airway epithelial cells, caused a clear concentration-dependent detachment of cells, and damaged their barrier integrity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Using an immunoproteomics approach, novel allergenic proteins of the BGP coat were identified. These proteins represent a class of novel dual-function proteins residing on the coat of the pollen grain that have IgE-binding capacity and proteolytic activity, which disrupts the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier. The identification of pollen coat allergens might explain the IgE-negative response to available skin-prick-testing proteins in patients who have positive symptoms. Further study of the role of these pollen coat proteins in allergic responses is warranted and could potentially lead to the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic tools...|$|E
