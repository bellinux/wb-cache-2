40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{analyzing}} recent evolutions of the Romanian agrifood trade with Hungary. In {{the years when}} both countries were CEFTA members (1997 - 2004), Hungary has been the main partner in the Romanian agrifood trade. Since Romania joined the EU in 2007, the agrifood trade volume {{between the two countries}} increased spectacularly: 8. 6 times for <b>exports</b> (<b>dispatches),</b> <b>and</b> 4. 5 times for imports (arrivals) (2011 / 2006). In 2010 and 2011, Hungary was the third, respectively the second destination for Romanian agrifood intra-EU dispatches. On the other hand, during 2007 - 2011, Hungary has been the first source for the intra-EU arrivals in Romania. The agrifood bilateral trade balance is still negative for our country, although it decreased in value terms in 2010 - 2011. The paper is analyzing as well the composition by products of the bilateral trade. </em...|$|R

5000|$|Each member country {{establishes}} {{an annual}} threshold value below which a {{business is not}} required to file Intrastat forms. [...] The reporting thresholds vary from country to country and, within one country, may be different for <b>dispatches</b> (<b>exports)</b> <b>and</b> arrivals (imports). For the eurozone countries excluding Italy, thresholds for 2013 average 316,000 and 422,000 euro for arrivals (imports) <b>and</b> <b>dispatches</b> (<b>exports),</b> respectively. As established by Regulation (EC) No 222/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009, the current thresholds are designed to cover 97% of <b>dispatches</b> <b>and</b> 95% of arrivals. This regulation raised thresholds with the purpose of reducing the statistical and, hence, financial burden on small operators. According to an EU Memo of 2013, the increased thresholds reduced the number of reporting enterprises by one third and saved them 134 million euro.|$|R

This research work aims to provide a diagnosis of infrastructural Buenaventura port status compared with the port of Cartagena, performing a thorough search of informative data, statistics, and reports; to define the asymmetries between the two ports. The results indicate a clear lack of state support and disorganization in the internal processes of management of the port of Buenaventura, which, ultimately, does not have sufficient capacity to receive <b>and</b> <b>dispatch</b> goods, which generates an increase in time and in operating costs in <b>export</b> <b>and</b> import processes. Buenaventura port infrastructure is {{below the level of}} the port of Cartagena...|$|R

In general, instructions for a decode <b>and</b> <b>dispatch</b> interpreter may be any size. For example, a decode <b>and</b> <b>dispatch</b> interpreter to simulate an Intel Pentium decodes instructions that range from 1 to 16 bytes. However, bytecoded systems typically choose 1-byte codes for the most-common operations. Thus, the thread often has a higher space cost than bytecodes. In most uses, the reduction in decode cost outweighs the increase in space cost.|$|R

40|$|Part 3 : Virtualization and Cloud Computing TechnologiesInternational audienceThe use of {{virtualization}} technology makes {{software applications}} more scalable and cost effective {{when they are}} deployed over cloud computing platforms, but virtualization technology also brings challenges to task scheduling over cloud. The commonly used list scheduling schemes split the scheduling process into two phases: ordering <b>and</b> <b>dispatching.</b> However, majorities of recent researches about scheduling of cloud tasks concentrate on optimizing the schedulers’ performance in one phase, but seldom consider the collaborations of scheduling policies used in different phases. This paper summarizes some representative ordering <b>and</b> <b>dispatching</b> policies used in list schedulers, models the execution processes of these ordering <b>and</b> <b>dispatching</b> policies using Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN), and simulates the list scheduling process of cloud tasks. Based on the modeling and experimental results, we further evaluate which composition of ordering <b>and</b> <b>dispatching</b> policies provides optimal performance in the two-phase scheduling process of cloud tasks...|$|R
