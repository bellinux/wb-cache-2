5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving home {{in which}} Poe lived is in Baltimore, preserved as the <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> <b>Poe</b> House and Museum. Poe {{is believed to}} have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia (as well as his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe). It {{is open to the public}} and is also the home of the <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> <b>Poe</b> Society. Of the several homes that Poe, his wife Virginia, and his mother-in-law Maria rented in Philadelphia, only the last house has survived. The Spring Garden home, where the author lived in 1843–1844, is today preserved by the National Park Service as the <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> <b>Poe</b> National Historic Site. Poe's final home is preserved as the <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> <b>Poe</b> Cottage in the Bronx.|$|E

5|$|Irving, {{along with}} James Fenimore Cooper, {{was among the}} first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe, and Irving {{encouraged}} American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Herman Melville, and <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> <b>Poe.</b> Irving was also admired by some European writers, including Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, Charles Dickens, Francis Jeffrey, and Walter Scott.

The episode features cultural references to Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the three poets Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> <b>Poe.</b> Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.9, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|<b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> <b>Poe,</b> whose poetry {{had been}} {{included}} in Griswold's anthology, published a critical response that questioned which poets were included. This began a rivalry which grew when Griswold succeeded Poe as editor of Graham's Magazine at a higher salary than Poe's. Later, the two competed {{for the attention of}} poet Frances Sargent Osgood. They never reconciled their differences and, after Poe's mysterious death in 1849, Griswold wrote an unsympathetic obituary. Claiming to be Poe's chosen literary executor, he began a campaign to harm Poe's reputation that lasted until his own death eight years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlap between the writers of Unknown and Astounding, {{there was a good}} deal of overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. Sf historian Paul Carter has argued that the spectrum of fantastic fiction from Weird Tales through Unknown to Astounding was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as Wonder Stories were more like the works of <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> <b>Poe</b> than they were tales of scientific imagination.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe (née Clemm; August 15, 1822 – January 30, 1847) was {{the wife}} of American writer <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> <b>Poe.</b> The couple were first cousins and {{publicly}} married when Virginia Clemm was 13 and Poe was 26. Biographers disagree as {{to the nature of}} the couple's relationship. Though their marriage was loving, some biographers suggest they viewed one another more like a brother and sister. In January 1842 she contracted tuberculosis, growing worse for five years until she died of the disease at the age of 24 in the family's cottage, at that time outside New York City.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} Georgia family, Chivers became {{interested}} in poetry at a young age. After he and his first wife separated, he received a medical degree from Transylvania University but focused his energy on publishing rather than medicine. In addition to submitting poems to various magazines and journals, Chivers published several volumes of poetry, including The Lost Pleiad in 1845, as well as plays. <b>Edgar</b> <b>Allan</b> <b>Poe</b> showed {{an interest in the}} young poet and encouraged his work. Chivers spent the last few years of his life defending the reputation of Poe, who had died in 1849, though he also thought Poe had been heavily influenced by his own poetry. Chivers died in Georgia in 1858.|$|E
