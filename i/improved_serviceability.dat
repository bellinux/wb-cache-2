40|$|Project Final Report for " 100 kW Energy Transfer Multiplexer Power Converter Prototype Development Project" {{prepared}} under DOE grant number DE-FG 36 - 03 GO 13138. This project {{relates to}} the further development and prototype construction/evaluation for the Energy Transfer Multiplexer (ETM) power converter topology concept. The ETM uses a series resonant link to transfer energy from any phase of a multiphase input to any phase of a multiphase output, converting any input voltage and frequency to any output voltage and frequency. The basic form of the ETM converter consists of an eight (8) -switch matrix (six phase power switches and two ground power switches) and a series L-C resonant circuit. Electronic control of the switches allows energy to be transferred in the proper amount from any phase to any other phase. Depending upon the final circuit application, the switches may be either SCRs or IGBTs. The inherent characteristics of the ETM converter include the following: Power processing in either direction (bidirectional); Large voltage gain without the need of low frequency magnetics; High efficiency independent of output load and frequency; Wide bandwidth with fast transient response and; Operation as a current source. The ETM is able to synthesize true sinusoidal waveforms with low harmonic distortions. For a low power PM wind generation system, the ETM has the following characteristics and advantages: It provides voltage gain without the need of low frequency magnetics (DC inductors) and; It has constant high efficiency independent of the load. The ETM converter can be implemented into a PM wind power system with smaller size, reduced weight and lower cost. As {{a result of our}} analyses, the ETM offers wind power generation technology for the reduction of the cost and size as well as the increase in performance of low power, low wind speed power generation. This project is the further theoretical/analytical exploration of the ETM converter concept in relationship to PM wind power generator applications in the 100 kW and under power range. The theoretical/analytical and bench scale work focuses on simplifying the basic ETM converter topology (in terms of parts count and complexity) for the specific application of the low power PM system. The project goals and objectives were for Spellman HV will develop a 100 kW prototype ETM power converter based on paralleled lower ratings converters. The proposed configuration of this prototype is a 100 kW rated converter comprised of four (4) 34 kW rated modules connected in parallel (the fourth converter is included to demonstrate N+ 1 fault tolerance). This approach is more viable as there is lower technological risk involved in developing a 34 kW-rated converter than a single 100 kW unit. The modular system approach should have a lower deployment and service cost over a single unit system, because of the economics of scale (smaller units at a higher volume means lower manufacturing cost) and because of <b>improved</b> <b>serviceability</b> (a non-redundant power system with one failed module will still operate at a lower power level). There is also the added benefit that greater commercial application and acceptance should be achieved by having a modular system available in which fault tolerance (N+ 1 or 2 N) is a feature. This modular approach would allow the output power to be increased by adding more paralleled converters. Thus, the maximum output power of the overall power system {{is a function of the}} interconnection medium (the hot swap connection subsystem), rather than the ratings of a single module. The project was implemented with Spellman HV acting as the program management and production assembly and test facility; The Baker Company acting as a technical consultant and resource when required; and dtm Associates acting as the design/development resource for the hardware development of the 100 kW ETM converter prototype...|$|E

In this paper, properties of suitable FRP materials, adhesives and two ways of strengthening beams exposed to bending moment are presented. Passive or slack reinforcement is one way of strengthening. The most effective way of such a strengthening was to place reinforcement laminates on both tension and compression side of the beam. However, the FRP material is only partially utilised. The second way is to apply pre-stressing in FRP materials prior to bonding to tension side of flexural members and this way was shown to provide the most effective utilisation of these materials. The state of the art of such a strengthening and various methods are discussed. Increasing the load-bearing capacity, introducing a pre-cambering effect and thus <b>improving</b> <b>serviceability</b> which often governs the design and reducing the amount of FRP reinforcement needed are some of the main advantages.
