5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would <b>go</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5|$|In July 1947—three {{months after}} Jackie Robinson made {{history with the}} Brooklyn Dodgers—Doby broke the MLB color barrier in the American League when he signed a {{contract}} to play with Bill Veeck's Cleveland Indians. Doby was {{the first player to}} <b>go</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> majors from the Negro leagues. A seven-time All-Star center fielder, Doby and teammate Satchel Paige were the first African-American players to win a World Series championship when the Indians took the crown in 1948. He helped the Indians win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant in 1954, finished second in the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award voting and was the AL's RBI leader and home run champion. He went on to play for the Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Chunichi Dragons before his retirement as a player in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Of these 77players, 36 {{have been}} pitchers, {{the most of}} any position; 27 of these were right-handed, while 9 were left-handed. Thirteen outfielders, {{including}} one center fielder, and 12 shortstops were selected. The A's have also drafted six catchers, five third basemen, four first basemen, and one second baseman in the first round. Additionally, 23players came from high schools or universities in the A's home state of California, followed by 10 from Texas and 9 from Florida. They also drafted Ariel Prieto in 1995, who had defected from Cuba the year before. Prieto made his major league debut in 1995, one of 20players in draft history to <b>go</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> majors without playing in the minor leagues.|$|E
5|$|Work on element 102 also {{continued}} in Dubna, and in 1964, experiments {{were carried out}} there to detect alpha-decay daughters of element 102 isotopes by synthesizing element 102 from the reaction of a uranium-238 target with neon ions. The products were carried along a silver catcher foil and purified chemically, and the isotopes 250Fm and 252Fm were detected. The yield of 252Fm was interpreted as evidence that its parent 256102 was also synthesized: as {{it was noted that}} 252Fm could also be produced directly in this reaction by the simultaneous emission of an alpha particle with the excess neutrons, steps were taken to ensure that 252Fm could not <b>go</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> catcher foil. The half-life detected for 256102 was 8s, which is much higher than the more modern 1967 value of (3.2±0.2)s. Further experiments were conducted in 1966 for 254102, using the reactions 243Am(15N,4n)254102 and 238U(22Ne,6n)254102, finding a half-life of (50±10)s: at that time the discrepancy between this value and the earlier Berkeley value was not understood, although later work proved that the formation of the isomer 250mFm was less likely in the Dubna experiments than at the Berkeley ones. In hindsight, the Dubna results on 254102 were probably correct and can be now considered a conclusive detection of element 102.|$|E

25|$|The nucleus geniculatus lateralis {{is made up}} of {{different}} cellular strata separated by lamellae, parallel to the surface. The stratae 1 and 2, the most ventral, are magnocellular.

The nasal component of the optic nerves (the axons issued from the nasal field of the retina of both sides) crosses at the chiasma.The axons of the temporal field do not cross. This is very important in clinical neurology. After the chiasma, axons form the visual tracts turning around the peduncles and arriving into the polar anterior part of the geniculate nucleus. Retinal axons from the controlateral retina end in stratae 1,4 and 6. Those from the ipsilateral retina end in 2,3 and 5. The axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus, through the optic radiation, end in the primary visual cortex around the calcarine fissure. See visual system.|$|E
