40|$|The {{usefulness}} of technical drawings {{as well as}} scientific illustrations such as medical drawings of human anatomy essentially depends on the placement of labels that describe all relevant parts of the figure. In order to not spoil or clutter the figure with text, the labels are often placed around the figure and are associated by thin connecting lines to their features, respectively. This labeling technique is known as <b>external</b> <b>label</b> placement. In this paper we introduce a flexible and general approach for <b>external</b> <b>label</b> placement assuming a contour of the figure prescribing the possible positions of the labels. While much research on <b>external</b> <b>label</b> placement aims for fast labeling procedures for interactive systems, we focus on highest-quality illustrations. Based on interviews with domain experts and a semi-automatic analysis of 202 handmade anatomical drawings, we identify a set of 18 layout quality criteria, naturally not all of equal importance. We design a new geometric label placement algorithm that is based only {{on the most important}} criteria. Yet, other criteria can flexibly be included in the algorithm, either as hard constraints not to be violated or as soft constraints whose violation is penalized by a general cost function. We formally prove that our approach yields labelings that satisfy all hard constraints and have minimum overall cost. Introducing several speedup techniques, we further demonstrate how to deploy our approach in practice. In an experimental evaluation on real-world anatomical drawings we show that the resulting labelings are of high quality and can be produced in adequate time.

Clustering {{methods and}} nearest {{neighbour}} classifiers typically compute distances between data points {{as a measure}} of similarity, with nearby pairs of points considered more like each other than remote pairs.

Entry of Mg- 25 and Ca- 41 into the outer cortical apoplast of non-mycorrhizal roots was detected after 4 min of labelling. After a longer exposure time the endodermis with its Casparian band acted as an efficient apoplastic diffusion barrier for the radial movement of Mg- 25 and Ca- 44 into the stele. A fraction of approximately one-third of the apoplastic cations of the root cortex could not be exchanged against the <b>external</b> <b>label</b> even after longer exposure times. The ectomycorrhizal sheath of the two fungal species used, Pisolithus tinctorius (Pers.) Coker & Couch and Suillus bovinus (L. ex Fr.) Kuntze, does not completely inhibit the apoplastic movement of ions into the mycorrhizal root cortex, but retarded the penetration of isotopes into the cortical apoplast. In roots inoculated with S. bovinus, a clear labelling of the cortical apoplast could first be detected after 24 h {{of exposure to the}} stable isotope solution. At this time the labelling of the cortical apoplast in these mycorrhizal roots was higher than those of non-mycorrhizal roots and, with EDXS, changes in the element composition of the apoplast were detected.

30|$|American scholar G. William Skinner’s Chinese {{assimilation}} theory (G. William Skinner, 1957; 1958) {{is essential}} to the research on overseas Chinese. The Study of Chinese Society(Maurice Freedman and G. William Skinner, 1979), a collection of papers compiled by the scholar, introduced pioneering studies of Chinese in Singapore, Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. These papers drew anthropologists’ attention to the research of overseas Chinese in the 1950 s and early 1960 s, and demonstrated that social scientists can understand the important elements of Chinese culture through observation of “Residual China.” Recent anthropological fieldwork reports are not entirely confined to traditional social organizations, but also focus on the modern enterprise system. For example, through fieldwork in Singapore and Malaysia, scholars have analyzed the social basis and organizational principle of Chinese commercial companies and emphasized the role of interpersonal networks in decision making. They have focused on the factors of personal control, interpersonal relations and interpersonal credit and held that market is not the sole consideration in the decision-making process of companies (C. K. Tong and P. K. Yong, 1998). According to these cultural ties, people migrated again to the world, especially to the traditional overseas Chinese settlements in the new migration trend after there form and opening up. A lot of new immigrants chose Singapore, expecting an easy life with language and cultural convenience in a Chinese society. In fact, they interacted in everyday life with different Chinese ethnic groups, such as Singaporean Chinese, Malaysian Chinese and Taiwanese, which continued to reconfirm their self-identification and <b>external</b> <b>label</b> of “Chinese.” In this interactive process, new immigrants took advantage of cultural similarity to integrate into the local community. At the same time, the two sides constantly re-interpreted their cultural symbols and resources. On the one hand, the local Chinese protected their superiority of “more traditional” culture through dialect, behavior, customs, social networks and even political identity; on the other hand, new immigrants made use of language, art and family values to confirm their “more Chinese” cultural identity. This mirrors the division of Chinese people with respect to Chinese culture in the cultural environment of a new era, and the concept of “cultural China” therefore must be carried forward (Zhang, 2014).|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} some innovative approaches to image the carotid arteries with 7 T MRI are introduced. It shows {{the potential of}} ultra-high field MRI for carotid artery imaging, and addresses some major technical hurdles related {{to the use of}} high frequency RF pulses as well. A so-called leaky waveguide transmitter was developed which was used in combination with a high density receive array. A group of healthy subjects was scanned with the developed setup at 7 T, as well as on a state-of-the-art setup at 3 T. At an average depth of the carotids, a considerable gain in SNR of a factor 2. 0 was measured. The setup benefits from the high density of receivers by increased acceleration capacity. T 1 and T 2 in the healthy vessel wall was measured and reported both for 3 T and 7 T. T 2 was found to be decreased at 7 T, whereas the an increase of T 1 was reported. These values were unknown at 7 T and can be used for sequence optimization. The leaky waveguide transmitter that was developed for RF excitation in the neck, could also be used to extend the reach of the standard 7 T head coil for brain imaging. In this combination the waveguide transmitter was used for the magnetic labelling of the blood passing through the carotids. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) sequences were applied to quantify perfusion in the brain. Whole brain ASL has shown to be challenging at 7 T, due to the effects of tissue heating and limited power efficiency. The combined setup of the head coil together with <b>external</b> <b>label</b> coil allowed for efficient labelling, far enough below the brain to allow for whole brain ASL. B 1 performance was quantified, and possibilities were explored. RF shimming for territorial selection and increased labelling delays up to 4000 ms were performed. Essential blood suppression pre-pulses that are used at 3 T cannot be used at 7 T. The culprit of this effect is the local character of transmit coils at 7 T. An evaluation of alternative blood suppression techniques was done, that may require no or less B 1 + coverage. The results can serve as a basis for further developments for in vivo high field blood suppression techniques. A good blood suppression technique would facilitate more freedom in sequence design for carotid plaque imaging. A group of patients with a higher than 70...|$|E

40|$|To resolve occlusions, we move labels {{along the}} pole only. (b) Label {{placement}} has been constrained {{by a set}} of planes in 3 D space. Labels are allowed to move within a plane, which is fixed in 3 D space. To avoid constant label motion, the label positions are frozen after creating the layout for a viewpoint. The placement is updated only when the viewing angle to the plane grows larger than a threshold. Annotations of objects in 3 D environments are commonly con-trolled using view management techniques. State-of-the-art view management strategies for <b>external</b> <b>labels</b> operate in 2 D image space. This creates problems, because the 2 D view of a 3 D scene changes over time, and temporal behavior of elements in a 3 D scene is not obvious in 2 D image space. We propose managing the place-ment of <b>external</b> <b>labels</b> in 3 D object space instead. We use 3 D geo-metric constraints to achieve label placement that fulfills the desired objectives (e. g., avoiding overlapping labels), but also behaves con-sistently over time as the viewpoint changes. We propose two geo-metric constraints: a 3 D pole constraint, where labels move along a 3 D pole sticking out from the annotated object, and a plane con-straint, where labels move in a dominant plane in the world. This formulation is compatible with standard optimization approaches for labeling, but overcomes the lack of temporal coherence. ∗e-mail: tatzgern | kalkofen | grasset...|$|R

The labelling procedures {{were performed on}} intact tissue so that the results would more closely approximate the topography of the brush border in vivo. The microvilli were isolated, subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and the [3 H]glycoproteins detected by fluorography. Densitometer scans of the fluorograms of the [3 H]galactoproteins showed that, under reducing conditions, 90 % of the protein-associated radioactivity was incorporated into two glycoproteins. The major [3 H]galactoprotein of early placental microvilli had an estimated molecular mass of 92 kDa (desialylated) and migrated as a diffuse band. A minor 180 kDa glycoprotein was less consistently labelled. No change in the apparent molecular mass of either component was detected {{in the absence of}} beta-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that the 180 kDa component was not a dimer of the 92 kDa glycoprotein. The remaining 10 % the radioactivity was equally distributed among several minor membrane components. Densitometer scans of the fluorograms of the [3 H]sialoproteins showed that, under either reducing or non-reducing conditions, 90 % of the 3 H was preferentially incorporated into the 92 - 110 kDa region of the gel. Although no distinct bands were visible, the higher-molecular-mass region of this area was always most heavily labelled. A minor 180 kDa glycoprotein was also 3 H-labelled. The pattern of brushborder [3 H]glycoproteins from first-trimester placentas differed markedly from that of term placental microvilli and from placental fibroblast plasma membranes that were 3 H-labelled by identical <b>external</b> <b>labelling</b> techniques.
