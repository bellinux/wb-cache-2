5|$|To convey {{accurate}} information, <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> {{necessary to}} have a standard vocabulary describing clouds; this was achieved {{by means of a}} series of classifications first achieved by Luke Howard in 1802, and standardized in the International Cloud Atlas of 1896.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> {{obvious that}} Mme. {{is not the}} invalid she makes out to be and the two women don disguises for their journey. Mme la Comtesse puts on the clothes {{of a young man}} but when Philippa turns up {{unexpectedly}} with the Man in Grey, <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> clear that Jacques and his mother are one and the same.|$|R

5|$|A {{shipyard}} {{was established}} in Faversham by James Pollock & Sons (Shipbuilders) in 1916 {{at the request of}} Lord Fisher, the First Lord of The Admiralty, for manufacturing barges for landing craft. Faversham already had a tradition of shipbuilding, and <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> a major contributor to markets throughout the world, producing vessels such as the Molliette and the Violette, both constructed of concrete. Over 1200 ships were built and launched from Faversham between 1916 and 1969.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Perón's death, the {{government}} suspended all official activities {{for two days}} and ordered all flags flown at half-staff for ten days. <b>It</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> apparent, however, that these measures fell short of reflecting popular grief. The crowd outside of the presidential residence, where Evita died, grew dense, congesting the streets for ten blocks in each direction.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed Air Vice Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff. He became {{responsible for}} matters other than operations, such as administration and training. <b>It</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> clear that Jones and Bostock {{could not get}} along together, but Kenney preferred to have Bostock in operational command, and although he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> {{apparent}} that Méchain and Delambre's result (443.296lignes) was slightly too short for the meridianal {{definition of the}} metre. Arago and Biot extended the survey to the island of Formentera in the western Mediterranean Sea in 1806–1809, and found that one ten-millionth of the Earth's quadrant should be 443.31lignes: later work increased the value to 443.39lignes. The modern value, for the WGS84 reference spheroid, is m or lignes.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> {{evident that}} Wong's career would {{continue}} to be limited by American anti-miscegenation laws, which prevented her from sharing an on-screen kiss with any person of another race, even if the character was Asian, but being portrayed by a white actor. The only leading Asian man in U.S. films in the silent era was Sessue Hayakawa. Unless Asian leading men could be found, Wong could not be a leading lady.|$|E
5|$|Osmium {{has high}} {{reflectivity}} in the ultraviolet {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> clear that the oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E

Hours before the vote on 24 June, he resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, leaving Gillard to assume the leadership unopposed. Treasurer Wayne Swan was at the same time elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Deputy Leader.|$|E
5|$|The {{sporting}} event was started at Little Wittenham Bridge in 1984 by the lockkeeper, Lynn David, as a fund-raising {{event for the}} Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). He noticed that people occasionally snapped sticks from nearby hedges to play the sport and he then {{came up with the}} idea of a competition to aid the charity. He put out a box of sticks and a collection box and <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> an annual event.|$|E
5|$|The task of {{incorporating}} eastern Honduras into the Spanish Empire {{fell to the}} evangelising efforts of Spanish missionary orders. The earliest Franciscan missionaries, {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century, attempted to convert the natives in their own settlements. <b>It</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> obvious that this was impractical, given the paucity of available missionaries, and the wide dispersal of Indian villages and towns. The friars changed their tactics, and gathered the natives in mission towns, known as reducciones.|$|E

5|$|Having {{traveled}} to France {{in the early}} 1920s, Gordon Balfour, the nephew of John Balfour, (who {{was one of the}} co-founders of Balfours Bakery), found inspiration for the frog cake in European confectionery. The frog cake was introduced by Balfours in 1922 after Gordon's return to Adelaide, during a time in which tearooms were still popular in the city. <b>It</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> known as the Balfours mascot, and has traditionally only been sold in South Australia, although they are now sold in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland as well.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} Battle of Finschhafen, <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> {{clear that the}} strength of the Japanese forces there had been seriously underestimated, and the 9th Division needed to be resupplied and reinforced, and its casualties evacuated. Herring strove to get the necessary amphibious lift from the navy but the commander of the United States Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender, was reluctant to expose his ships to the Japanese air threat. The matter went up the chain of command to Mackay, to Blamey, and ultimately to MacArthur, who could do little, given that he had no real authority over the U.S. Navy.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness was commercially {{successful}} {{following its}} December 1984 release and was positively received by critics. Around 4,000cabinets were sold, and <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> the highest-earning game in arcades. However, the game consistently fell from this ranking during its seventh week in arcades that Atari tracked the game's success. Cerny attributed the six-week arcade life to Marble Madnesss short gameplay length. He believed that players lost interest after mastering it {{and moved on}} to other games. The arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare. Stan Szczepanski holds the official world record of 187,880 points.|$|E

5|$|The Buccaneers first {{joined the}} NFL in 1976 {{as members of}} the AFC West. The {{following}} year, they moved to the NFC Central. The Tampa Bay expansion franchise was originally awarded to Tom McCloskey, a construction company owner from Philadelphia. <b>It</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> apparent that McCloskey had financial problems, so the NFL found a replacement in Hugh Culverhouse. They were purchased by Malcolm Glazer in 1995 for $192 million, following Culverhouse's death. The front office staff of the team includes Bryan Glazer, Edward Glazer, and Joel Glazer.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort to}} develop a lighter, quieter camera with a reflex {{viewfinder}} led {{to the introduction of}} the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a shutter angle of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR during the first few years after its introduction, and <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> {{one of the most popular}} studio cameras in the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.|$|E
5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were particularly difficult. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. <b>It</b> <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> clear that this {{would take more than}} six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.|$|E
