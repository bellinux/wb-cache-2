5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Kauai early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that <b>day.</b> <b>Prior</b> to Iniki's arrival in Kauai, 8,000people were housed in shelters, {{many of whom}} remembered Hurricane Iwa 10years prior. Because schools were canceled, traffic was light during the evacuation, and streets were clear by mid-morning. Rather than sending tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm's passage.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first formed on August20 {{in the central}} Caribbean Sea from a broad area of low pressure, based on weather reports from weather stations and ships in the vicinity. Moving steadily to the west-northwest towards the western Caribbean, the disturbance slowly intensified, attaining tropical storm strength by 1200UTC the next <b>day.</b> <b>Prior</b> to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, however, the system was analyzed to be an open trough up until August22. The tropical storm began to move more towards {{the west in the}} Gulf of Mexico after clipping the Guanahacabibes Peninsula—the westernmost region of Cuba—late on August22.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{analysis}} from Météo-France (MFR), a disturbance in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident south of the Chagos Archipelago on February6, after Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar and {{moved away from the}} region. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed it as developing a <b>day</b> <b>prior</b> in the same general area. Later on February6, a circulation developed concurrently with an area of organized convection. On February8, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone– the equivalence of a hurricane– on February9.|$|E

5|$|The {{tropical}} {{wave that}} caused the flooding moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September29. Moving westward, the system entered the eastern Caribbean Sea on October5, although rainfall began spreading across Puerto Rico the <b>day</b> <b>prior.</b> The wave's associated convection, or thunderstorms, were amplified by an upper-level trough to its west. It was developing into a tropical cyclone while it moved across Puerto Rico. When the system's rainbands reached the mountains of southern Puerto Rico, it produced torrential rainfall, and additional precipitation occurred owing to the system's slow movement.|$|E
5|$|Thuppakkis {{first look}} poster was leaked on the {{internet}} on 30 April 2012, a <b>day</b> <b>prior</b> to its scheduled release on 1 May. The poster, that depicted Vijay holding a cigar in his mouth, was criticised by social activists for violating the Indian Tobacco Act, which prohibits advertising tobacco products. Murugadoss explained {{that it was only}} for promotional purposes and added that the film had no such scenes, claiming that even a small sequence featuring Vijay smoking had been deleted from the film.|$|E
5|$|Her refit at Portsmouth Dockyard {{began in}} March 1914 and was {{interrupted}} by the declaration of war on Germany on 4 August. She'd been formally recommissioned the <b>day</b> <b>prior,</b> but the turret work required another week to complete. Invincible was the first battlecruiser to be fitted with a new fire-control director, but this could not be completed in the allotted time and would remain inoperable until she was refitted after the Battle of the Falkland Islands. She was declared operational on 12 August, when Rear-Admiral Sir Archibald Gordon Moore, commanding the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron, hoisted his flag in her. He was ordered to the Humber, along with the battlecruiser , where he could better support the British ships patrolling the Broad Fourteens.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the 150th {{anniversary of}} Alexander Pushkin's birth was {{organised}} {{at the hotel}} by the Society of Cultural Relations with the USSR, attended by the Soviet chargé d'affaires, the Polish ambassador, the Romanian minister, and Cecil Day-Lewis, raising Mi5's suspicions that he still had communist sympathies, a contention he later denounced. In the post-war period, the Dorchester {{became one of the}} most popular hotels in London for actors and entertainers, and the banqueting rooms and suites became known for their press conferences and parties. Diners at the Dorchester included Cyril Connolly, T. S. Eliot, Harold Nicolson, and Edith Sitwell, with a clientele of luminaries such as Ralph Richardson, Elizabeth Taylor, Alfred Hitchcock, and Barbra Streisand. Queen Elizabeth II attended the Dorchester when she was a princess on the <b>day</b> <b>prior</b> to the announcement of her engagement to the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 10 July 1947. Prince Philip also held his stag night party at the hotel, which has been documented in a plaque.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} before its release, a number of texts {{purporting}} to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16 July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the U.S. edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date. The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena {{in order to identify}} one source. This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series' history. Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks. Reviews published in both The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times on 18 July 2007, corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one <b>day</b> <b>prior</b> to release, The New York Times confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.|$|E
5|$|On April 16, 2010, the <b>day</b> <b>prior</b> to {{the annual}} Vaisakhi Parade held in Surrey, B.C., one of the parade {{organizers}} issued a statement indicating should Dosanjh and BC Liberal backbencher Dave Hayer choose to attend the parade, their safety could not be guaranteed. This was {{due in part to}} comments that Dosanjh had made after the parade in 2007, suggesting a police investigation into reports of a parade float that had a picture of Talwinder Singh Parmar on it, the alleged mastermind behind the bombing of Air India Flight 182. Dosanjh also expressed concerns over some attendees wearing International Sikh Youth Federation T-shirts, a terrorist organization that is banned in India, Britain, the United States, and Canada.|$|E

5|$|On August25, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted on {{satellite imagery}} on August25. The thunderstorms pulsed and became better organized by August27. That day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed southeast of the Japanese island of Okinotorishima, or about 520km (325mi) northwest of Guam. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also estimated a tropical cyclone formed on August27. With a ridge to the north, the depression tracked slowly to the southwest. The system gradually organized while developing improved outflow to the south, although a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the north caused wind shear. On August29, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Dujuan, although the JTWC had upgraded a <b>day</b> <b>prior.</b> That day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the region, naming it Onyok.|$|E
5|$|On September20, {{roughly one}} <b>day</b> <b>prior</b> to Igor's arrival in Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Center (CHC) issued {{tropical}} storm watches and warnings for southern Newfoundland and the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The following day the CHC issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} eastern and northern coasts. Although sustained hurricane-force winds were recorded across parts of the island, warnings were not issued due to stronger-than-expected re-intensification of the storm as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Early on September22, all advisories were discontinued as Igor {{moved away from the}} region. In response to the storm's arrival, schools were closed and several flights were delayed or canceled at St. John's International Airport. Offshore, an oil rig with 110 personnel was mostly evacuated near the coast of Newfoundland on September19. In comparison to Hurricane Earl two weeks earlier, there was substantially less media attention given to Igor, attributed to the possibility of it going out to sea.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>day</b> <b>prior</b> to the game, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech {{to win by}} 11.5 points. Despite that advantage, Tech {{head coach}} Frank Beamer warned his team and {{the public about the}} threat underdog Air Force posed to the Hokies' chances of winning. Both Beamer and Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry were among the longest-tenured coaches in college {{football}} at the time. DeBerry had been a college coach for 19years, while Beamer had coached for 16 years. The game would be an opportunity for DeBerry to gain his 150th career win and defeat a ranked team {{for the first time since}} 1999. Ticket sales prior to the game were sluggish, as both teams failed to sell out their assigned allotments, and local sales registered fewer than 8,000tickets sold. In addition, local media coverage of the game was very sparse.|$|E

40|$|Mice immunized with typhoid-paratyphoid vaccine USP {{were found}} to be {{protected}} when challenged with serological groups A, B, and C of Neisseria meningitidis. Mice immunized with this vaccine both 14 and 7 <b>days</b> <b>prior</b> to challenge were protected against mean lethal doses (LD 50) of 5, 220 and 1, 151 of groups A and B, respectively, and in two separate experiments they were protected against 3, 568 and 268 LD 50 of group C. Mice immunized four or more times on successive <b>days</b> <b>prior</b> to challenge were also protected. They demonstrated tolerance and survived a much larger LD 50 challenge than mice immunized by any other immunization schedule. Mice immunized once or twice anytime within 7 <b>days</b> <b>prior</b> to challenge were not protected and thus failed to exhibit nonspecific resistance. Serum antibody probably was responsible for the protection afforded mice immunized 14 and 7 <b>days</b> <b>prior</b> to challenge. However, this was not demonstrated conclusively...|$|R
