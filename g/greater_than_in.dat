The total of deaths in London was <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> any previous outbreak for 100 years, though as {{a proportion}} of the population, the epidemics in 1563, 1603 and 1625 were comparable or greater.

5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild {{set up on}} December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to {{organize}} writers for the war effort. Rossen served as the body's chairman until 1944 and advocated {{the opening of a}} Second Front to support West European resistance against the Nazis. His earnings were much <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> {{other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of}} the detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

5|$|Sales {{of country}} estates became common around the 1920s. The annual tax payable had spiralled and was twenty times <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> 1870 {{resulting}} in the break-up of many larger land-holdings. Pitfour was no exception and the dispersal of the estate continued piecemeal after the sequestration of George Arthur, the sixth laird. The main estate policies including the lake and other land were purchased by Bernard Drake in November 1926 when he bought Saplinbrae, the former minister's house. Drake was {{a partner in the}} electrical engineering company, Drake and Gorham.|$|E

Although widespread, G.clavatus has become rare in many parts of Europe and extinct in the British Isles. It has been placed on the national Red Lists of threatened fungi in 17 European countries and is one of 33 species proposed for international conservation under the Bern Convention.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{inequality}} within Birmingham is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> {{any other}} major English city, and is exceeded only by Glasgow in the United Kingdom. Levels of unemployment {{are among the}} highest in the country, with 10.0% of the economically active population unemployed (Jun 2016). In the inner-city wards of Aston and Washwood Heath, the figure is higher than 30%. Two-fifths of Birmingham's population live in areas classified as in the 10% most deprived parts of England, and overall Birmingham is the most deprived local authority in England in terms of income and employment deprivation. The city's infant mortality rate is high, around 60% worse than the national average. Meanwhile, just 49% of women have jobs, compared to 65% nationally, and only 28% of the working-age population in Birmingham have degree level qualifications in contrast to the average of 34% across other Core Cities.|$|E
