50|$|<b>Delorazepam</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with severe schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorders, those with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to <b>delorazepam</b> or related benzodiazepines, and those with moderate to severe renal impairment (<b>delorazepam</b> is sometimes administered at a reduced dose to patients with mild renal impairment). <b>Delorazepam</b> is {{generally considered to be}} contraindicated in patients with severe acute or chronic illnesses but is occasionally used in the palliative care of terminal patients during their last days/weeks of life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Delorazepam</b> is well absorbed after administration, {{reaching}} peak plasma levels within 1 - 2 hours. It has a {{very long}} elimination half-life and can still be detected 72 hours after dosing. Bioavailability is about 77 percent. Peak plasma levels occur at just over one hour after administration. Significant accumulation occurs of <b>delorazepam</b> due to its slow metabolism; the elderly metabolise <b>delorazepam</b> and its active metabolite slower than younger individuals, resulting in a dose of <b>delorazepam</b> accumulating faster and peaking at a higher plasma concentration than an equal dose administered to a younger individual. The elderly also have a poorer response to the therapeutic effects and {{a higher rate of}} adverse effects. The elimination half-life of <b>delorazepam</b> is 80-115 hours. The active metabolite of <b>delorazepam</b> is lorazepam and represents about 15 - 24 percent of the parent drug (<b>delorazepam).</b> The pharmacokinetics of <b>delorazepam</b> are not altered if it is taken with food, except for some slowing of absorption. Delorazepams potency is approximately equal to that of lorazepam, being ten times more potent by weight than diazepam (1 mg <b>delorazepam</b> = 1 mg lorazepam = 10 mg diazepam), typical doses range from 0.5 mg - 2 mg. Treatment is generally initiated at 1 mg for healthy adults and 0.5 mg in pediatric and geriatric patients and patients with mild renal impairment, treatment is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.|$|E
50|$|Long term use of <b>delorazepam</b> (as well as {{all other}} benzodiazepines) {{has been found to}} {{increase}} long term cognitive deficits (persisting longer than sixth months) which some researchers claim to be permanent. Short term use may occasionally cause depression and the risk of depressive symptoms occurring increases considerably with longer terms of use, <b>delorazepam</b> is not intended to be used for more than 2-4 weeks unless it used only occasionally on an as-needed basis. When being used on an as-needed basis the need for <b>delorazepam</b> therapy should be re-evaluated each time a new prescription for <b>delorazepam</b> is issued, and alternative medications should be considered if patients begin to take <b>delorazepam</b> habitually (many days in a row).|$|E
50|$|The {{most serious}} effect of long term <b>delorazepam</b> use is dependence, with {{withdrawal}} symptoms which mimic delirium tremens presenting when <b>delorazepam</b> use is discontinued. Although the withdrawal effects from <b>delorazepam</b> are generally less severe than its shorter-acting counterparts, {{they can be}} life-threatening. Slow de-titration of <b>delorazepam</b> {{over a period of}} weeks or months is generally suggested to minimize the severity of withdrawal. Psychological effects of withdrawal such as rebound anxiety and insomnia have been known to persist for months after physical dependence has been successfully treated.|$|E

50|$|<b>Delorazepam,</b> {{also known}} as chlordesmethyldiazepam and nordiclazepam, is a drug which is a {{benzodiazepine}} and a derivative of desmethyldiazepam. It is marketed in Italy, where it is available under the trade name EN and Dadumir. <b>Delorazepam</b> (chlordesmethyldiazepam) is also an active metabolite of the benzodiazepine drugs diclazepam and cloxazolam. Adverse effects may include hangover type effects, drowsiness, behavioural impairments and short-term memory impairments. Similar to other benzodiazepines <b>delorazepam</b> has anxiolytic, skeletal muscle relaxant, hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Delorazepam</b> {{is mainly}} {{used as an}} {{anxiolytic}} because of its long elimination half-life; showing superiority over the short-acting drug lorazepam. In comparison with the antidepressant drugs, paroxetine and imipramine, <b>delorazepam</b> {{was found to be}} more effective in the short-term but after 4 weeks the antidepressants showed superior anti-anxiety effects.|$|E
50|$|Metabolism of this {{compound}} {{has been}} assessed, revealing diclazepam has an approximate elimination half-life of 42 hours and undergoes N-demethylation to <b>delorazepam,</b> {{which can be}} detected in urine for 6 days following administration of the parent compound. Other metabolites detected were lorazepam and lormetazepam which were detectable in urine for 19 and 11 days, respectively, indicating hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes occurring concurrently with N-demethylation.The protein-binding of this compound has not been analysed but the figures for the metabolites are, <b>delorazepam</b> >90%, lorazepam 91.5% (parenterally) & 85% (orally) and <b>delorazepam</b> >90%.|$|E
50|$|Patients with {{a history}} of drug and/or alcohol abuse are {{believed}} to have an increased risk of abusing <b>delorazepam</b> (as well as all other benzodiazepines), this must be considered when a physician prescribes <b>delorazepam</b> to such patients. Although all patients being treated with <b>delorazepam</b> should be routinely monitored for signs of abuse and diversion of medication, increased monitoring of patients {{with a history}} of drug and/or alcohol abuse is always warranted. Benzodiazepine abuse in patients taking them as prescribed on an as-needed basis for chronic/refractory anxiety, insomnia, and intermittent muscle spasms has occurred and generally occurs very slowly, becoming evident only after months or years since the initiation of therapy. Monitoring of patients actively using <b>delorazepam</b> should never be discontinued even if the patients has been stable on the medication for many months or years.|$|E
50|$|<b>Delorazepam</b> {{has also}} {{demonstrated}} effectiveness in treating alcohol withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Delorazepam</b> is {{also used}} as a {{premedication}} for dental phobia for its anxiolytic properties. High doses of <b>Delorazepam</b> may be administered the night before a dental (or other medical) procedure {{in order to provide}} relief from anxiety-associated insomnia that night with the effects persisting long enough to sufficiently treat anxiety the next day.|$|E
50|$|<b>Delorazepam</b> hosts all {{the classic}} {{side-effects}} of GABAA full agonists (such as most benzodiazepines). These include sedation/somnolence, dizziness/ataxia, amnesia, reduced inhibition, increased talkativeness/sociability, euphoria, impaired judgement, hallucinations, and respiratory depression. Paradoxical reactions including increased anxiety, excitation, and aggression may occur {{and are more}} common in elderly, pediatric, and schizophrenic patients. In rare instances, <b>delorazepam</b> may cause suicidal ideation and actions.|$|E
50|$|People with {{renal failure}} on {{haemodialysis}} have a slow elimination rate and a reduced volume of {{distribution of the}} drug. Liver disease has {{a profound effect on}} the elimination rate of <b>delorazepam,</b> resulting in the half-life almost doubling to 395 hours, whereas healthy patients showed an elimination half-life of 204 hours on average. Caution is recommended when using <b>delorazepam</b> in patients with liver disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Delorazepam</b> is {{available}} in tablet and liquid drop formulations. The liquid drop formulation is absorbed more quickly and has improved bioavailibility.|$|E
50|$|Cloxazolam (marketed {{under the}} brand names Sepazon, Olcadil (Brazil, Portugal and Spain), Akton (Belgium), and Lubalix (Switzerland)) {{is a drug}} which is a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. Cloxazolam is metabolised into the active metabolite chlordesmethyldiazepam (<b>delorazepam).</b> It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.|$|E
50|$|Caution must be {{used when}} <b>delorazepam</b> is {{administered}} alongside other sedative medications (ex. opiates, barbiturates, z-drugs, and phenothiazines) due to {{an increased risk of}} sedation, ataxia, and (potentially fatal) respiratory depression. Although overdoses of benzodiazepines alone rarely result in death, the combination of benzodiazepines and other sedatives (particularly other gabaminergic drugs such as barbiturates and alcohol) is far more likely to result in death.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{affinity}} chromatography as means of isolating/purifying proteins which have {{an affinity for}} benzodiazepine is described. Three such drugs are employed: chlorazepate, clonazepam and <b>delorazepam.</b> The results {{presented in this paper}} indicate that the proposed technique only works for chlorazepate and <b>delorazepam.</b> In fact these benzodiazepine-Sepharose derivatives are able to retain specifically proteins from human serum and rat kidney, lung, skeletal muscle and brain...|$|E
40|$|Phenazepam and {{etizolam}} {{were the}} first uncontrolled benzodiazepines available {{for sale in the}} UK. Pyrazolam, flubromazepam and diclazepam are not used medicinally anywhere in the world; they are produced exclusively for the uncontrolled, recreational market. It is important to know whether potentially abused drugs like these can be detected in routine toxicological screening tests. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate whether the Immunalysis® Benzodiazepines ELISA kit could detect phenazepam, etizolam, pyrazolam, flubromazepam, diclazepam and its metabolite <b>delorazepam.</b> Their cross-reactivity was assessed by comparing the absorbance of the drug with that of oxazepam, the reference standard. This study found that these uncontrolled benzodiazepines cross-react sufficiently to produce a positive result with the Immunalysis® Benzodiazepine ELISA kit. Cross-reactivity ranged from 79 to 107 % for phenazepam, etizolam, pyrazolam, flubromazepam, diclazepam and <b>delorazepam</b> fortified into blood. The results show that it is possible to detect these newer benzodiazepines with traditional forensic toxicology laboratory tools and it is important to include these benzodiazepines in the confirmation tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} receptor from rat {{brain was}} solubilised and purified 5200 -fold by affinity chromatography. The affinity column contained an immobilized benzodiazepine (<b>delorazepam)</b> and biospecific elution with 6 mM-chlorazepate was achieved. The purified receptor is apparently homogeneous in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The native protein had a molecular weight of 240, 000, and the subunit one of 60, 000. The dissociation constant (KD) is 8 nM for [3 H]diazepam. A correlation {{exists between the}} value of affinity obtained for benzodiazepine derivatives and their known pharmacological effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Background Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric {{syndrome}} {{that may}} occur in as- sociation with mental, neurological and medical disorders. A delay in {{diagnosis and treatment of}} catatonic symptoms is re- lated to a high risk of medical complications such as dehydra- tion, malnutrition, pressure ulcers, thrombotic events, aspiration pneumonia and infections. Objectives The authors present the case of a bipolar patient, admitted to the Psychiatric Clinic of the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pis- ana for catatonic syndrome, complicated by weight loss, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pressure ulcers and systemic infection. Results Supportive therapy, including hydration, electrolytic restoration and antibiotics was adopted to stabilize the patient’s general conditions. Treatment with low molecular weight heparin was given for DVT and to prevent pulmonary embolism. Catatonic symptoms were initially treated with intravenous administration of <b>delorazepam,</b> with some improvement in catalepsy and waxy flexibility. As treatment with benzodiazepines was not complete- ly effective, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was used in combi- nation with <b>delorazepam,</b> which led to progressive resolution of catatonic symptoms. Conclusions The existence of medical complications requires a multidiscipli- nary therapeutic strategy, with the intervention of different spe- cialists. Our experience confirms the efficacy and safety of ECT in catatonia, even in the presence of serious complications such as DVT. In these cases, combination of ECT and benzodiazepines should be considered elective treatment to achieve quick resolu- tion of symptoms and reduce morbidity and mortality...|$|E
40|$|Solid phase microextraction {{coupled to}} high {{performance}} liquid chromatography with UV detection (SPME/LCUV) has been employed {{to study the}} binding of <b>delorazepam</b> to human serum albumin (HSA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The procedure could also be potentially extended to the measurement of partition coefficients between {{a wide variety of}} semi- or non-volatile compounds and matrices. The method is solvent free, simple, fast, and drawbacks of the conventional analytical techniques are avoided. Moreover, the matrix did not interfere with the measurement by binding to the fibre and the amount extracted by the fibre was negligibly small; thus it did not disturb the delorazepam–protein binding...|$|E
40|$|An SPME–HPLC–UV {{method for}} the {{determination}} of <b>delorazepam,</b> a representative benzodiazepine, in spiked human urine samples was developed for the first time. The performances of two commercially available fibers, a carbowax/templated resin (Carbowax/TPR- 100) and a polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), were compared, indicating the latter as the most suitable for urine samples analysis. All the aspects influencing adsorption (extraction time, pH, temperature, salt addition) and desorption (desorption and injection time, desorption solvent mixture composition) of the analyte on the fiber have been investigated. In particular, short extraction times were necessary to reach the equilibrium and very short desorption times were employed. The procedure required simple sample pre-treatment {{and was able to}} detect 5 ng/ml in spiked urine, regardless of the complexity of the matrix. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|A rapid, {{sensitive}} and specific LC-MS/MS method {{was developed and}} validated for quantifying chlordesmethyldiazepam (CDDZ or <b>delorazepam),</b> the active metabolite of cloxazolam, in human plasma. In the analytical assay, bromazepam (internal standard) and CDDZ were extracted using a liquid-liquid extraction (diethyl-ether/hexane, 80 / 20, v/v) procedure. The LC-MS/MS method on a RP-C 18 column had an overall run time of 5. 0 min and was linear (1 /x weighted) over the range 0. 5 - 50 ng/mL (R > 0. 999). The between-run precision was 8. 0 % (1. 5 ng/mL), 7. 6 % (9 ng/mL), 7. 4 % (40 ng/mL), and 10. 9 % at the low limit of quantification-LLOQ (0. 500 ng/mL). The between-run accuracies were 0. 1, - 1. 5, - 2. 7 and 8. 7 % for the above mentioned concentrations, respectively. All current bioanalytical method validation requirements (FDA and ANVISA) were achieved and it {{was applied to the}} bioequivalence study (Cloxazolam-test, Eurofarma Lab. Ltda and Olcadil (R) -reference, Novartis Biociencias S/A). The relative bioavailability between both formulations was assessed by calculating individual test/reference ratios for Cmax, AUClast and AUCO-inf. The pharmacokinetic profiles indicated bioequivalence since all ratios were as proposed by FDA and ANVISA. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Zopiclone is a non-benzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} agent, indicated {{for short-term}} treatment of insomnia (max. 4 weeks) at the dose of 7. 5 mg/day. It has been marketed {{as a drug}} with a lower potentiality of overuse than benzodiazepines. Prazepam, a prodrug for desmethyldiazepam, is a benzodiazepine derivative drug indicated {{for the treatment of}} anxiety at the dose of 20 - 40 mg/day. Its abuse liability is described as lower than other benzodiazepines, because of the slow onset and long duration of action. Insomnia and anxiety are prevalent symptoms in general population, in particular among migraine patients. Here we are going to present the case of a chronic migraine patient with zopiclone and prazepam dependence, and analgesic overuse, whose hair was analysed to detect the use of the drugs. The drugs in her hair were detected by liquid chromatography/electrospray tamdem mass spectrometry [LC/ESI-MS/MS (Agilent technology, Palo Alto, CA, USA) ] (Matuszewski et al., 2003). Description of the case: 37 -year-old female migraine patient, Secondary School Diploma, married. Two 7 -year-old twin daughters, she runs a tobacconist shop. Smoker (15 cigarettes/day), teetotaller, she drinks 1 coffee/day. She started suffering from headache as a child. After puberty, she had perimenstrual migraines. Migraine disappeared during pregnancy, but worsened after her daughters’ birth. It has been daily and associated to severe insomnia for 3 years. In summer 2009, a psychiatrist prescribed her fluoxetine and hypnotics. The patient came to Headache Centre in January 2010. She suffered from daily headache and unbearable insomnia and every day she used at least an intramuscular injection of ketorolac (Toradol 10 mg), 20 tablets of zopiclone (Imovane 7. 5 mg), 20 tablets of prazepam (Prazene 20 mg). She was admitted to day hospital to be detoxified. At admission, a sample of hair was collected for drug testing. During hospitalization, prazepam and zopiclone were gradually reduced. In order to prevent withdrawal symptoms, <b>delorazepam</b> (En) was administered intravenously and a prophylactic migraine treatment was started, with topiramate (Topamax) 25 mg in the evening, which was then gradually increased to 100 mg/day. At the discharge, the patient was taking 4 tablets of zopiclone and 4 of prazepam a day. The psychiatrist also recommended mirtazapine (Remeron) 30 mg/day. At two- month follow-up, the patient was taking every day: topiramate 100 mg (with good migraine improvement), 2 tablets of zopiclone, and 2 of prazepam. Another hair sample was collected. At the admission in the proximal hair segment (recent use) fluoxetine 6. 3 ng/mg, zopiclone 6. 68 ng/mg, prazepam 0. 67 ng/mg were detected; in the distal hair segment (previous use) fluoxetine 1. 7 ng/mg, zopiclone 3. 94 ng/mg, prazepam 0. 92 ng/mg were detected. At two- month follow-up, in the proximal hair segment (recent use) fluoxetine 1. 9 ng/mg, topiramate 6. 3 ng/mg, mirtazapine 1. 0 ng/mg, <b>delorazepam</b> 0. 14 ng/mg, prazepam 0. 06 ng/mg were detected and zopiclone was not detectable. Therefore hair analysis confirmed the pharmacological history of the patient. Zopiclone and prazepam dependence had been nearly only reported in subjects with predisposition to abuse or suffering form psychiatric disorders (Cimolai, 2007). Doses were always lower than in the case that we described. In this patient, insomnia, anxiety, and the stressing family situation were, besides from migraine, the main factors which had led to an increasing use, up to 150 mg/day of zopiclone and 400 mg/day of prazepam, with consequent dependence. Hair analysis has a long tradition in the detection of substances of abuse. However, the keratinous matrix {{can also be used to}} detect a large number of drugs. In the clinical setting, the analysis of drugs in the hair can demonstrate previous use of medications and compliance with drug therapy over time. Cimolai (2007). Can Fam Physician. 53, 2124 - 2129.
