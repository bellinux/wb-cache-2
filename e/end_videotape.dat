5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At the <b>end</b> of the <b>videotape</b> {{there is a special}} fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|R

Thirty teachers, at different grade levels and with different subject matter affiliations, were videotaped while teaching one of their own classes. These tapes, ranging from 15 to 35 minutes in length, were edited to produce two taped episodes of five minutes duration for each teacher. In addition, 15 -second segments, to be used as mea-sures of first impressions, were prepared for each teacher. To measure the nonverbal behaviors displayed by the teachers an instrument for coding the behaviors was developed.

40|$|Purpose: Despite {{calls for}} {{studying}} interaction processes in coaching, {{little is known}} about the link between coach–client interactions and coaching success. In particular, interpersonal behavior in coaching remains unexplored, although it is considered highly relevant to social relationships and interaction outcomes. This study takes first steps to address this gap. Design/Methodology/Approach: We examined the dynamics of coaches’ and clients’ interpersonal behavior based on the two basic dimensions affiliation and dominance. Furthermore, we investigated the link between emergent interpersonal behavior patterns and coaching outcomes. To this <b>end,</b> we <b>videotaped</b> and analyzed a total of 11, 095 behavioral acts nested in 30 coach–client dyads. Findings: Sequential analysis showed that reciprocal friendliness patterns were positively linked to working alliance. Coaches’ dominant–friendly interaction behavior particularly activated clients, in terms of showing dominance during the coaching interaction process. Clients’ dominance was linked to their overall goal attainment. Implications: Our results highlight the importance of interpersonal behavior for coaching success. Specifically, our findings suggest that dominance interaction patterns are context- and relation-specific, offering an explanation for contradicting empirical studies on interpersonal dominance. For coaches, our study implies that high awareness for interpersonal signals can help establish a positive atmosphere and activate clients’ dominance. Originality/Value: This empirical study uses behavior observation and interaction analysis to understand the interpersonal dynamics during coaching sessions. Our results increase our theoretical understanding of coaching effectiveness by shedding light on the micro-level behavioral dynamics that drive successful coaching processes...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the STS- 99 mission was to complete high resolution mapping of large sections of the Earth's surface using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), a specially modified radar system. This radar system produced unrivaled 3 -D images of the Earth's Surface. The mission was launched at 12 : 31 on February 11, 2000 onboard the space shuttle Endeavour. and led by Commander Kevin Kregel. The crew was Pilot Dominic L. Pudwill Gorie and Mission Specialists Janet L. Kavandi, Janice E. Voss, Mamoru Mohri from the National Space Development Agency (Japanese Space Agency), and Gerhard P. J.

5000|$|The daytime {{show was}} reduced to two games to {{accommodate}} a five-minute news break towards the half-hour mark. On the CBS daytime run, each wrong vote paid the three challengers $100 for a possible total of $400 divided among the three challengers for a [...] "complete stump" [...] of all four wrong votes. If all the votes were correct, the challengers split a consolation prize of $75. During the show's final year and a half, for only the daytime version, the studio audience also voted, with the majority vote counting equally with that {{of one of the}} celebrity panelists, thus a maximum $500 divided among the challengers could be awarded for the maximum five incorrect votes. If there was a tie for the highest vote from the audience, and for each panelist who was disqualified, a wrong vote was counted. One CBS daytime episode featuring Dorothy Kilgallen, best known as a regular panelist on What's My Line?, was broadcast on the East Coast on Monday, November 8, 1965, as news of her sudden death was circulated by wire services. The breaking news story prompted CBS newscaster Douglas Edwards to announce her death immediately after To Tell the Truth <b>ended.</b> She had <b>videotaped</b> the program six days earlier, according to the New York Herald Tribune. The newspaper added that Kilgallen and Arlene Francis both pretended to be Joan Crawford while sitting next to the real Crawford in a celebrity segment that the daytime series featured regularly starting in 1965. The episode was one of the large majority of To Tell the Truth daytime episodes that were destroyed because of the common practice of wiping videotape prior to the invention of the videocassette. This was a different half-hour telecast from the 1962 prime-time episode on which Kilgallen can be seen and heard as one of the panelists. GSN repeated that episode decades later.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} measure certain visually perceived nonverbal behaviors of teachers {{in an effort to}} learn the relationships between these behaviors and the affective responses of students to the teachers, To this <b>end,</b> teachers were <b>videotaped,</b> and the tapes were shown to students for their affective responses. Thirty teachers, at different grade levels and with different subject matter affiliations, were videotaped while teaching one of their own classes. These tapes, ranging from 15 to 35 minutes in length, were edited to produce two taped episodes of five minutes duration for each teacher. In addition, 15 -second segments, to be used as measures of first impressions, were prepared for each teacher. To measure the nonverbal behaviors displayed by the teachers an instrument for coding the behaviors was developed. The reliability of the instrument was established on the basis of computed coefficients of interobserver agreement. A total of 879 students in grades seven through nine, none of whom were familiar with the teachers who appeared in the videotapes, were shown the videotapes of the teachers. No sound accompanied the visual images of the teachers. Thus only visual information was available for the establishment of affective responses. Each student supplied an affective rating for each teacher viewed. For this purpose, a semantic differential scale, with the expressions Liked Very Much and Disliked Very Much at the respective poles of the scale, was employed. In addition, students were asked to record the teacher characteristics, on which they had based their affective ratings, on a data card which was turned in to the investigator. Approximately half of the students supplied affective ratings, but no comments, to the first impression segments for each teacher. When the nonverbal behaviors displayed on the teacher tapes had all been coded by means of the nonverbal behavior instrument and mean values of student affective responses to each teacher had been determined, all of the data were transferred to computer cards and analyzed by means of a stepwise multiple regression analysis program. Separate analyses were performed to determine (a) the reliability of the nonverbal behavior instrument, (b) the identity of nonverbal behaviors which would serve as significant predictors of student affective response, and (c) whether students were consciously aware of the teacher nonverbal behaviors when they made their affective ratings of the teachers. Findings 1. On the basis,Of satisfactorily high coefficients of interobserver agreement the instrument employed in the {{investigation was}} judged to be a reliable measure of teacher nonverbal behaviors. The overall Tr value for the instrument was. 79. Z. The teacher nonverbal behaviors were analyzed in relation to student affective response in terms of both frequency and duration measurements of the behaviors, separately and in combination. When analyzed in combination the duration measures consistently proved to be better predictors than the frequency measures and it was concluded that the relationship between student affective responses and teacher nonverbal behavior can be predicted more effectively when the teachers' nonverbal behaviors are measured in terms of their duration. 3. Analysis of the combined affective responses of boys and girls to the teachers indicated that regardless of the sex of the respondent, students showed a higher degree of liking for teachers who smiled often and who held up books, photographs, etc. for the class to inspect. 4. When boys' and girls' affective responses were analyzed separately and compared, differences related to sex became apparent. Boys tended to show a higher degree of liking for teachers who were younger and who employed more gestures while teaching. Girls appeared to base their affective responses on first impressions more than did boys. Also, girls preferred teachers who seldom manipulated objects while teaching. 5. A significant difference between {{the number of students who}} reported nonverbal behaviors as the basis of their affective ratings of the teachers and those who failed to report such behaviors, seemed to indicate that students tend to make affective judgments in the absence of consciously perceived awareness of the teachers' specific nonverbal behaviors...|$|R
