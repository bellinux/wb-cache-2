500|$|René Spitz, a psychoanalyst, {{undertook}} {{research in}} the 1930s and '40s {{on the effects of}} maternal deprivation and <b>hospitalism.</b> His investigation focused on infants who had experienced abrupt, long-term separation from the familiar caregiver, as, for instance, when the mother was sent to prison. These studies and conclusions were thus different from the investigations of institutional rearing. Spitz adopted the term anaclitic depression to describe the child's reaction of grief, anger, and apathy to partial emotional deprivation (the loss of a loved object) and proposed that when the love object is returned to the child within three to five months, recovery is prompt but after five months, they will show the symptoms of increasingly serious deterioration. He called this reaction to total deprivation [...] "hospitalism". He {{was also one of the}} first to undertake direct observation of infants. The conclusions were hotly disputed and there was no widespread acceptance.|$|E

50|$|In 1945, Spitz {{investigated}} <b>hospitalism</b> {{in children}} in a foundling home. He found that the developmental imbalance caused by the unfavorable environmental conditions during the children's first year produces irreparable psychosomatic damage to normal infants. Another study of Spitz showed that under favorable circumstances and adequate organization a positive child development can be achieved. He stated that the methods in foundling homes should therefore be carefully evaluated.|$|E

This need is especially strong in childhood {{and it can}} override the need for safety as witnessed in children who cling to abusive parents.

50|$|<b>Hospitalism</b> (or anaclitic {{depression}} in its sublethal form) was a pediatric diagnosis {{used in the}} 1930s to describe infants who wasted away while in hospital. The symptoms could include retarded physical development, and disruption of perceptual-motor skills and language. It is now understood that this wasting disease was mostly caused {{by a lack of}} social contact between the infant and its caregivers. Infants in poorer hospitals were less subject to this disease since those hospitals could not afford incubators which meant that the hospital staff regularly held the infants.|$|E

40|$|The {{author is}} {{of the opinion that}} the usual {{procedures}} of psychiatric admission can no longer be regarded as adequate. More or less following the methods used in general hospitals, they seem to neglect the social aspects to a large extent. BY now it has become apparent that for certain patients (a) short- or long-termB hospitalisation in a mental institution is {{and will continue to be}} at times unavoid-able. This applies to victims of various degrees of brain damage accompanied by serious behavioural and emotional disturbances, as well as to patients for whom it is considered essential to find the most important underlying causes of disturbance at a macro-, meso- or micro-social level. At the same time, (b) such hospitalisation does have harmful side-effects from the beginning such as stigmatisation and increasing symptoms of <b>hospitalism.</b> As to point (a), admission to a mental hospital is something that will always be with us since disturbance will inevitably result from a detrimental change in the relationship between the ability to bear and the load carried, between ego strength and stress. Every society is bound to care for its deviants! As to point (b), two types of <b>hospitalism</b> can now be clearly distinguished. Th...|$|E

40|$|Discharge {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes that hospitalized patients must endure. This process is complex, requires coordination among several professionals and transfers an overwhelming amount of information to patients. Often, it is limited to the writing of the discharge summary, with a primary emphasis on the drug list. Since the rise of <b>hospitalism</b> in 1996, a greater emphasis has been placed on understanding this process and in developing interventions to make it more effective and safe. In our country, little is known about how this process is taking place. Probably the absence of financial penalties for readmissions has influenced in the lack of study and development of this process. In the USA the knowledge of the discharge process is well advanced, and several strategies have been developed for reducing adverse events, medication errors, and 30 -days readmissions. Other interventions have increased patient satisfaction and the degree of knowledge about their conditions. The aim of this paper is to do a comprehensive review of the literature, to provide healthcare teams with various tools that could improve both the discharge process as well as the discharge summary. The final objective is to optimize the safety and satisfaction of our patients and the hospital metrics of quality...|$|E

The first one contained twenty questions for small patients to respond and the other contained 20 questions to ask persons accompanying them and 12 questions of directed interview {{with the head of}} the children´s department in this hospital. The data were collected from October to November 2008. Eighty-five parents accompanying their children and 30 unaccompanied children, 15 boys and 15 girls, in the children department of the hospital in Klatovy respond the questionnaires. Hypothesis 1 ``The rights issued from the Charter for Children in Hospitals are observed in the children department of the hospital in Klatovy`` has been confirmed. Hypothesis 2 ``The persons accompanying children in hospital know the children rights`` has not confirmed. The aim of the Bachelor´s work was to find out if the rights of children in hospital are observed and if parents or other persons accompanying children are informed on the rights as they are stated in the Charter for Children in Hospitals in the children department in Klatovy.

40|$|Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) can be {{detected}} in humans and in many domestic animals and pets. It colonises the skin and mucosa but {{can also lead to}} severe wound and respiratory infections and even blood poisoning. The special characteristic of these germs is their insusceptibility (resistance) to a group of antibiotics that include penicillins and cephalosporins. As a consequence of this resistance infections with these germs are difficult to treat. The name is derived from the test substance, methicillin, on the basis of which the re-sistance of the bacteria was identified in the past. In hospitals MRSA has been the feared pathogenic organism for decades of the so-called <b>hospitalism</b> infections. Since the 1990 s MRSA has been increasingly detected outside hospitals, too. In this Opinion the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has examined the main exposure routes for man, i. e. the possibility of becoming infected through contact with livestock, the environment and contact or consumption of food with MRSA. Attention focused on MRSA type ST 398 as this is the type that has been detected most frequently along the food chain, i. e. from livestock down to the food in the retail trade, in Germany too. BfR recommends that groups of individuals like farmers, veterinarians and slaughterhouse staff should be given more information about the risk of colonisation and infection with MRSA, the necessary hygiene rules and protection measures. At the present time, {{it is not possible to}} quantify the risk for consumers of being colonised or even infected with MRSA ST 398. BfR believes that comprehensive research work is needed in order to gain a better understanding of the properties of the pathogen. This should focus above all on the factors which facilitate its spread and the possibility that the germ takes on pathogenic properties from other pathogens or acquires resistance to other antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} the topical issue of social conditions {{of people with}} mental retardation living in Ukraine. Tackling this issue {{is very important for}} building a tolerant, humane society and the welfare state. All people with mental retardation need social support and assistance regardless of level of their intellectual capacities, because social adaptation of a person with even the lightest mental retardation is a challenge. It is clear, that the heavier level needs greater amount of assistance. Families which care for these children or adults need assistance. Fortunately, there are certain mechanisms of social assistance to such people in this country: legislative, financial (governmental pensions and benefits), institutional (state residence and care institutions). Unfortunately, they are limited and have some adverse trends at the moment. First of all, not all people with the mental retardation are granted the legal status of disabled people. That?s why some of them are deprived of public assistance. Ukrainian by-laws often conflict with the laws that determine the governmental aid to such people, or simply do not contain mechanisms for implementation of the declared state obligations. It seems that such legislative mechanisms support the unwanted things: promote the transfer of all children and adults with the mental retardation (regardless of their abilities and behaviour) in a large specialized isolated boarding schools, refuse to provide appropriate education for children with severe mental retardation and other trends that considered undesirable for people with the mental retardation by specialists and by international practices. Governmental pension and benefit for family?s care are less than twice subsistence wages, and such families are often incomplete (mother and a child). If such individuals live at state boarding schools, they fall into the category socially excluded and get the syndrome of <b>hospitalism.</b> Also in such institutions the rights of people with high mental retardation are often violated. Their living conditions are improper (there are also some quite serious violations and abuses). Thus at the moment in Ukraine the social conditions of people?s living with mental retardation are quite vulnerable and often severe, especially if such people do not live with their parents, and attend boarding schools. This demonstrates the need for constant monitoring of this problem and the creating of the adequate mechanisms of social protection for this category of population. ? ?????? ?????? ??????????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ????? ??? ? ?????????? ??????????? ? ???????, ??? ????? ????? ? ????? ???????? ????????????, ????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ???????????. ????? ???????? ??? ????????????? ????????? ??????? ???? ???????? ? ????????? ????? ???????? ????????, ??????????, ??????????????? ??????? ? ??????????? ???? ???????? ?????? ????? ????? ?????????. ??? ????? ? ?????? ???????????? ?????????, ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ????? ???? ????????? ?????????...|$|E
40|$|The need is {{the manifestation}} of absence, lack of {{something}} or infringement of internal balance and influence the individual to the behaviour that should again create the balance. The need of certainty and safety is dominant need especially for small children. It is need to avoid jeopardy and danger and express oneself by the general human tendency to eliminate the anxiety {{and it is possible}} to meet the needs by reliable and sure interpersonal relationship. The feel of certainty and safety enables obtaining of confidence, life worth, reliability, independency, orientation in human community as well as in material value. The hospitalization of a child means significant interference with person life. In the hospital a child is separated from the family and its home environment. A child is hamper in movement, lay up and invest with foreign people in foreign environment with different daily routine. We speak about <b>hospitalism</b> when the conditions in hospital or in another institute, where is the child on the long- term basis hospitalize, are so unfavourable that the child is harmed in its development. From the medical point of view has a child hospitalization also positive aspect such as pernament medical supervision and professional care. The aim of my bachelor thesis is to find out whether an often hospitalized child meet the needs. I have appointed two different hypothesis: The need of certainty and safety is not fulfil in an often hospitalized child (H 1). The nurse cooperation with child dependents is minimal during the time of child hospitalization (H 2). Any of the above hypothesis where proven. Quantitative research was used for processing of practical part of my bachelor thesis called: "Often hospitalization of children and its affect on his need of safety and sureness. Controlled interview, observation and questionaire were used as technique of data collection and as a research collection I used patients of children's ward and its dependent from hospital in České Budějovice and Písek. The results shows that during a child hospitalization a child has only a low rate of anxiety from staying in hospital, its environment and medical staff. In the contrary a great number of children are sorrowful in the hospital. They miss both parents and friends, pet or their toys. During the hospitalization more than half of parents is accomodated together with their child. Average period of hospitalization of a child is in about sixty percents cases only one week, in twenty-five percents cases two to four weeks, in ten percents cases five or more than five weeks. Only small percentage of informants did not reply this question. Information about a disease that caused hospitalization of a child was in {{more than half of the}} cases supplied by attending physician, in twenty percents cases by parents and less than ten percents of informants did not reply this question. I would like this thesis to serve as a textbook and as an instructive material for both medical staff and parents of hospitalized children...|$|E
