25|$|Monogyne workers kill foreign queens {{and aggressively}} defend their territory. However, not all {{behaviours}} are universal, primarily because worker behaviours {{depend on the}} ecological {{context in which they}} develop, and the manipulation of worker genotypes can elicit change in behaviours. Therefore, behaviours of native populations can differ from those of introduced populations. In a study to assess the aggressive behaviour of monogyne and polygyne red fire ant workers by studying interaction in neutral arenas, and to develop a reliable <b>ethogram</b> for readily distinguishing between monogyne and polygyne colonies of red imported fire ants in the field, monogyne and polygyne workers discriminated between nestmates and foreigners as indicated by different behaviours ranging from tolerance to aggression. Monogyne ants always attacked foreign ants independently if they were from monogyne or polygyne colonies, whereas polygyne ants recognised, but did not attack, foreign polygyne ants, mainly by exhibiting postures similar to behaviours assumed after attacks by Pseudacteon phorids. Hostile versus warning behaviours were strongly dependent on the social structure of workers. Therefore, the behaviour toward foreign workers was a method of characterising monogyne and polygyne colonies. Most colonies in the southeastern and south-central US tend to be monogynous.|$|E

30|$|We have {{a system}} that {{identifies}} flies and extracts various attributes; we implemented more than 1, 000 automatically observable shape and constellation descriptors.

5000|$|The {{behaviours}} in an <b>ethogram</b> {{are usually}} defined to be mutually exclusive and objective, avoiding subjectivity and functional inference {{as to their}} possible purpose. [...] For example, a species may use a putative threat display, which in the <b>ethogram</b> is given a descriptive name such as [...] "head forward" [...] or [...] "chest-beating display", and not [...] "head forward threat" [...] or [...] "chest-beating threat". This degree of objectivity is required because what looks like [...] "courtship" [...] might have a completely different function, and in addition, the same motor patterns in different species can have very different functions (e.g. tail wagging in cats and dogs). Objectivity and clarity in the definitions of behaviours also improve inter-observer reliability.|$|E

Ethograms can be used to detect the occurrence or prevalence of abnormal behaviours (e.g. stereotypies, feather pecking, tail-biting), normal behaviours (e.g. comfort behaviours), departures from the <b>ethogram</b> of ancestral species and the behaviour of captive animals upon release into a natural environment.|$|E
5000|$|Often, ethograms are {{hierarchical}} in presentation.

40|$|Inter-individual {{variability}} has various impacts {{in animal}} social behaviour. This implies {{that not only}} collective behaviours have to be studied but also the behavioural variability of each member composing the groups. To understand those effects on group behaviour, we develop a quantitative methodology based on automated <b>ethograms</b> and autonomous robots to study the inter-individual variability among social animals. We choose chicks of Gallus gallus domesticus as a classic social animal model system for their suitability in laboratory and controlled experimentation. Moreover, even domesticated chicken present social structures implying forms or leadership and filial imprinting. We develop an imprinting methodology on autonomous robots to study individual and social behaviour of free moving animals. This allows to quantify the behaviours of large number of animals. We develop an automated experimental methodology that allows to make relatively fast controlled experiments and efficient data analysis. Our analysis are based on high-throughput data allowing a fine quantification of individual behavioural traits. We quantify the efficiency of various state-of-the-art algorithms to automate data analysis and produce automated <b>ethograms.</b> We show {{that the use of}} robots allows to provide controlled and quantified stimuli to the animals in absence of human intervention. We quantify the individual behaviour of 205 chicks obtained from hatching after synchronized fecundation. Our results show a high variability of individual behaviours and of imprinting quality and success. Three classes of chicks are observed with various level of imprinting. Our study shows that the concomitant use of autonomous robots and automated <b>ethograms</b> allows detailed and quantitative analysis of behavioural patterns of animals in controlled laboratory experiments.

Five groups of short-haired guinea pigs were observed. The guinea pigs were filmed. Next, video records were analysed using <b>ethograms</b> and description of social behaviour between group members. Data record was written down to <b>ethograms</b> every 1 minute for a periof of 24 hours. Observed activities were food intake, resting (including sleep), movement and comfort beahaviour (grooming). Generally, eighteen guinea pigs (in five groups) were observed. Guinea pigs are friendly animals, they create stable and well-organised groups. None aggressive behaviour was observed between group members. Besides small conflicts because of age difference, food or interruption during sleep. The oldest sows were dominant and their place was close to food. It was found out that guinea pigs rested the most (726 minutes, half-day). Food intake made up 590 minutes (41 %) and movement 84 minutes (6 %). More active were younger guinea pigs and boar who was housed with two sows.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} a {{model of}} postfracture pain in perching birds. ANIMALS: 21 adult domestic pigeons (Columba livia). PROCEDURES: In each bird, a standardized osteotomy of 1 femur was performed and the fracture was immobilized with an intramedullary pin. Degree of postoperative pain was evaluated 6 times/d for 4 days by use of 3 methods: an electronic perch for assessment of weight-bearing load differential of the pelvic limbs, 4 numeric rating pain scales for assessment of pain (all of which involved the observer {{in the same room}} as the bird), and analysis of video-recorded (observer absent) partial <b>ethograms</b> for bird activity and posture. Measurements obtained were compared with data collected before the surgery to evaluate the ability of these methods to detect pain. RESULTS: The weight-bearing load differential was a sensitive, specific, reliable, and indirect measure of fracture-associated pain in the model used. Two of 4 tested pain scales (fractured limb position and subjective evaluation of degree of pain) were sensitive and specific for detecting pain and were reliable in a research setting. Interobserver reliability of the 4 pain scales was excellent. Partial <b>ethograms</b> were sensitive for identifying pain-associated behavior in pigeons, particularly during the first 2 days after surgery. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The fracture pain model was reliable and reproducible and may be useful for experimental studies involving postsurgical pain in pigeons.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a method based on machine vision for automatically measuring aggression and courtship in Drosophila melanogaster. The genetic and neural circuit bases of these innate social behaviors are poorly understood. High-throughput behavioral screening in this genetically tractable model organism is a potentially powerful approach, {{but it is}} currently very laborious. Our system monitors interacting pairs of flies and computes their location, orientation and wing posture. These features are used for detecting behaviors exhibited during aggression and courtship. Among these, wing threat, lunging and tussling are specific to aggression; circling, wing extension (courtship 'song') and copulation are specific to courtship; locomotion and chasing are common to both. <b>Ethograms</b> may be constructed automatically from these measurements, saving considerable time and effort.

5000|$|Abnormal {{behaviour}} {{of birds}} in captivity {{can be defined}} in several ways. [...] Statistically, 'abnormal' is when the occurrence, frequency or intensity of a behaviour varies statistically significantly, either more or less, from the normal value. This means that theoretically, almost any behaviour could become 'abnormal' in an individual. Less formally, 'abnormal' includes any activity judged to be outside the normal behaviour pattern for captive birds of that particular class or age. For example, running rather than flying may be a normal behaviour and regularly observed in one species, however, in another species it might be normal but becomes 'abnormal' if it reaches a high frequency, or in another species it is rarely observed and any incidence is considered 'abnormal'. This article does not include 'one-off' behaviours performed by individual birds that might be considered abnormal for that individual, unless these are performed repeatedly by other individuals in the species and are recognised {{as part of the}} <b>ethogram</b> of that species.|$|E

We observed four primate species (callimico, red handed tamarin, Mueller gibbons, red ruffed lemurs) and two marsupials (wallabies and wallaroos) at the Miller Park Zoo in Bloomington, Illinois to examine behavioral differences in the presence and absence of zookeepers and the general public.

40|$|Although predatory {{behavior}} is traditionally {{described by a}} basic <b>ethogram</b> composed of 3 phases (search, pursue, and capture), behavioral studies of large terrestrial carnivores generally use {{the concept of a}} ‘‘hunt’’ to classify and measure foraging.

We used 3 ̆e 2, 150 h of observed wolf (Canis lupus) behavior in Yellowstone National Park, including 517 and 134 encounters with elk (Cervus elaphus) and American bison (Bison bison), respectively, to demonstrate the functional importance of several frequently described, but rarely quantified, patterns of large carnivore behavior not explicitly described by the basic <b>ethogram</b> (approaching, watching, and attacking groups). To account for these additionally important behaviors we propose a modified form of the basic <b>ethogram</b> (search, approach, watch, attack-group, attack-individual, and capture). We tested the applicability of this <b>ethogram</b> by comparing it to 31 previous classifications and descriptions involving 7 other species and 5 other wolf populations.

Furthermore, although Arctic charr has been described as the most variable between all vertebrate species, possible behavioural plasticity outside of the breeding season has not been widely investigated, and a complete <b>ethogram</b> for Arctic charr not in breeding condition is currently unavailable. This study presents the first complete <b>ethogram</b> of captive Arctic charr behaviour outside of the breeding season. The completeness of this <b>ethogram</b> was validated based on the Behavioural Accumulation Curves methodology, a reliable and easy to use tool for assessing the best compromise between sampling effort and <b>ethogram</b> completeness. Additionally, a new way of presenting an <b>ethogram</b> has been proposed and validated using a dichotomous key to describe behaviour types. This proved to be a more effective operational tool for identifying Arctic charr behaviour than the <b>ethogram.</b> The dichotomous key of behaviour led to a significantly less ambiguous identification of behavioural units, thus reducing observer, recording errors and enhancing accuracy.
