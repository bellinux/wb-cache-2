25|$|Because the {{mesothorax}} and metathorax {{hold the}} wings, {{they have a}} combined name called the pterothorax (pteron = wing). The forewing, which goes by different names in different orders (e.g., the tegmina in Orthoptera and elytra in Coleoptera), arises between the mesonotum and the mesopleura, and the hindwing articulates between the metanotum and metapleura. The legs arise from the mesopleura and metapleura. The mesothorax and metathorax each have a pleural suture (mesopleural and metapleural sutures) that runs from the wing base to the coxa of the leg. The sclerite anterior to the pleural suture is called the <b>episternum</b> (serially, the mesepisternum and metepisternum). The sclerite posterior to the suture is called the epimiron (serially, the mesepimiron and metepimiron). Spiracles, the external organs of the respiratory system, are found on the pterothorax, usually one between the pro- and mesopleoron, {{as well as one}} between the meso- and metapleuron.|$|E
25|$|The typical and usual {{segments}} of the insect leg are divided into the coxa, one trochanter, the femur, the tibia, the tarsus, and the pretarsus. The coxa in its more symmetrical form, has {{the shape of a}} short cylinder or truncate cone, though commonly it is ovate and may be almost spherical. The proximal end of the coxa is girdled by a submarginal basicostal suture that forms internally a ridge, or basicosta, and sets off a marginal flange, the coxomarginale, or basicoxite. The basicosta strengthens the base of the coxa and is commonly enlarged on the outer wall to give insertion to muscles; on the mesal half of the coxa, however, it is usually weak and often confluent with the coxal margin. The trochanteral muscles that take their origin in the coxa are always attached distal to the basicosta. The coxa is attached to the body by an articular membrane, the coxal corium, which surrounds its base. These two articulations are perhaps the primary dorsal and ventral articular points of the subcoxo-coxal hinge. In addition, the insect coxa has often an anterior articulation with the anterior, ventral end of the trochantin, but the trochantinal articulation does not coexist with a sternal articulation. The pleural articular surface of the coxa is borne on a mesal inflection of the coxal wall. If the coxa is movable on the pleural articulation alone, the coxal articular surface is usually inflected to a sufficient depth to give a leverage to the abductor muscles inserted on the outer rim of the coxal base. Distally the coxa bears an anterior and a posterior articulation with the trochanter. The outer wall of the coxa is often marked by a suture extending from the base to the anterior trochanteral articulation. In some insects the coxal suture falls in line with the pleural suture, and in such cases the coxa appears to be divided into two parts corresponding to the <b>episternum</b> and epimeron of the pleuron. The coxal suture is absent in many insects.|$|E

50|$|The thorax is {{robust and}} compact. Unlike other lower Brachicera it bears long {{bristles}} (macrochaeta) useful as taxonomic characters. Bristles {{of this type}} are always present on the notopleuron (notopleural bristles) and, in two series, on mesonotum (dorsocentral, supralar and postalar). Other bristles are present on the metanotum (dorsocentral bristles on the ventral <b>episternum</b> and {{at the apex of}} the mesoscutellum.The legs are relatively long and strong, with many macrochaetes performing a raptatorial function. The wings are well developed, often relatively narrow for speedy flight; the alula is generally well developed, with the exception of Leptogastrinae and part of Dasypogoninae. The venation is much as in Rhagionidae, Tabanidae and Therevidae; the radial R is always four-branched, with R2+3 unbranched. Details of wing venation determine subfamilies and lower taxa. The wings are most often hyaline, but sometimes smoky or dark colored, or partly infuscated in many genera or completely darkened.The abdomen consists of 6-8 visible segments preceding the genitalia in males, but the eighth segment is sometimes entirely or partially concealed, and terminal forming the ovipositor. It is long and narrow conical in most species but wide, dorsoventrally flattened and short in bee mimics. In Leptogastrinae the abdomen is extremely long and slender in Leptogastrinae. In some tribes, the male undergoes axial torsion of 180 degrees.|$|E
5000|$|Monoclonius was Edward Drinker Cope's third named ceratopsian, after Agathaumas and Polyonax. Several fossils {{were found}} by Cope, {{assisted}} {{by a young}} Charles Hazelius Sternberg, {{in the summer of}} 1876 near the Judith River in Chouteau County, Montana, only about a hundred miles (some 150 km) from the site of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, fought that June. The finds did not represent a single, let alone articulated, skeleton, but came from different locations. Together they included elements of most parts of the animal (only the feet were entirely missing), including the base part of a long nasal horn, part of the skull frill, brow horns, three fused cervical vertebrae, a sacrum, a shoulder girdle, an ilium, an ischium, two thighbones, a shinbone, a fibula and parts of a forelimb. Just two weeks after leaving Montana, Cope hastily described and named these finds on 30 October 1876 as the type species Monoclonius crassus. The specific name means [...] "the fat one" [...] in Latin. Since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group, Cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material, not recognizing the nasal horn core, nor the brow horns, as part of a fossil horn. The skull frill he interpreted as an <b>episternum,</b> an ossified part of the breastbone, and the fused cervicals he assumed to be anterior dorsals.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} log-inhabiting arthropods {{and their}} associated mites for ectoparasitic fungi (Ascomycetes: Laboulbeniales) in South-east Queensland and Far North Queensland. Fungus host records were: Rickia berlesiana (Baccarini) on most species of Fedrizziidae (Acari: Mesostigmata) and three species of Passalidae (Coleoptera); Rickia leptaulacis Thaxter on {{two species of}} Fedrizzia (Fedrizziidae), one species of Megisthanus (Mesostigmata: Megisthanidae), and two species of Passalidae; Rick ia sp. A on two species of Paradiplogynium (Mesostigmata: Diplogyniidae) and the cockroach Panesthia tryoni Shaw (Blaberidae); Rickia sp. B on two species of Fedrizzia; Rickia sp. C on one species of Megisthanus; Rickia sp. D on Promegistus armstrongi (Mesostigmata: Promegistidae); and Dimorphomyces sp. A on a species of Micromegistus (Mesostigmata: Parantennulidae). Our data are the first records of Dimorphomyces in Australia, R. leptaulacis on mites, and Laboulbeniales on members of the Diplogyniidae, Parantennulidae, and Promegistidae. At a species-level, 15 - 88 per cent of mites were infested with Laboulbeniales; the most thalli found on a single mite was 34. Thalli of R. berlesiana and R. leptaulacis were especially common on old passalid beetles, but were rare on young beetles. Thalli were common on the ventral prothorax, and leg femora and tibiae, but were mostly found on the mesothoracic <b>episternum</b> and anterior elytra of beetles. Given the protected positions that most thalli occur, and that these positions are the preferred sites for mite associates, we hypothesise that mites are important vectors of fungi between beetles...|$|E
40|$|The morphology, infrastructure, {{innervation}} {{and physiology}} {{of the third}} axillary muscle in Manduca sexta were examined to investigate the role of this muscle in flight. The muscle consists of three parts: the upper bundle, which originates on the <b>episternum,</b> and the middle and lower bundles, which originate on the epimeron; all three parts insert {{on the tip of}} a projection from the third axillary sclerite. The middle bundle is composed of tonic fibres, and is innervated by a single slow axon, while the other two bundles consist of intermediate fibres and are each innervated by a single fast axon. The shape and position of the third axillary sclerite within the wing hinge are such that its primary function appears to be remotion of the wing. The length of the third axillary muscle determines the amount of remotion, independently of the degree of elevation or depression of the wing and independently of the amount of remotion of the contralateral wing. Electrophysiological recordings from the three parts of the muscle during tethered flight indicate that they may each function independently of each other and in different ways. The tonic (middle) bundle is capable of maintaining tension to hold the wings in the folded position at rest and is active when the wings are folded at the end of flight. The intermediate (upper and lower) bundles are activated phasically with impulses that may occur with various relationships to the timing of activation of a direct depressor, the subalar, or of several of the elevators. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the third axillary muscles on both sides are important in determining the asymmetric degrees of remotion observed in turning flight...|$|E
