25|$|The axioms {{of a group}} formalize the {{essential}} aspects of symmetry. Symmetries form a group: they are closed because <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, the result will still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity {{comes from the fact}} that symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions are associative.|$|E
500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> look at a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 interview, Gibson {{said of his}} philanthropic works, [...] "It {{gives you}} perspective. It's one of my faults, you {{tend to focus on}} {{yourself}} a lot. Which is not always the healthiest thing for your psyche or anything else. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> little time out to think about other people, it's good. It's uplifting." ...|$|E

5000|$|Nelson says [...] "I {{thought it}} would be funny <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> boy who was really good and doesn't really sin and have him break pretty much every commandment in a day. That kind of gave me a basis to start, too, when I was filling out the notebook." ...|$|R

[...] "The clerk downstairs says {{the snow is}} nine feet deep over the mountain trails and the wind would cut an iron beam in two. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> automobile to California, John, you must put it on snowshoes and connect it with a steam heating-plant." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We talk {{today about}} yards after the catch, {{but he would}} get acres of yards after the catch {{because he was so}} elusive in the open field. When the ball was up in the air, he looked like Willie Mays in center field. [...] He could adjust and wind up {{catching}} the ball over his shoulder in stride about as well as anyone. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> look at the offensive stats in pro football then, he was not just the best in the league, he was head and shoulders above his competitors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott has {{developed}} a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: [...] "I like working, always, {{with a minimum of}} three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [...] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and– whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up– then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010 the 2008–2009 Annual Report of the President's Cancer Panel was {{released}} and recommended: [...] "Because {{of the long}} latency period of many cancers, the available evidence argues for a precautionary approach to these diverse chemicals, which include (…) bisphenolA". In August 2010, the Maine Board of Environmental Protection voted unanimously to ban the sale of baby bottles and other reusable food and beverage containers made with bisphenol A as of January 2012. In February 2011, the newly elected governor of Maine, Paul LePage, gained national attention when he spoke on a local TV news show saying he hoped to repeal the ban because, [...] "There hasn't been any science that identifies {{that there is a}} problem" [...] and added: [...] "The only thing that I've heard is <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> plastic bottle {{and put it in the}} microwave and you heat it up, it gives off a chemical similar to estrogen. So the worst case is some women may have little beards." [...] In April 2011, the Maine legislature passed a bill to ban the use of BPA in baby bottles, sippy cups, and other reusable food and beverage containers, effective 1 January 2012. Governor LePage refused to sign the bill.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had listened}} eagerly, as I say; {{and it was}} her nature to {{understand}} quickly. [...] "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>you</b> appreciate what <b>you</b> say. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> great responsibility." ...|$|R

2500|$|Cantrell was a {{close friend}} of former Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who he {{described}} as his best friend. Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E

5000|$|They {{have stated}} that they're heavily {{influenced}} by Swedish death metal. Guitarist Kris Norris said in an interview, [...] "Well, {{put it this way}} - <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> encyclopedia of metal, you could list just about every Scandinavian band as our influences! It’s not really any one particular band; we wouldn't say that we’re influenced by, say, In Flames or At The Gates, it’s every band from there." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{jerked his}} {{handsome}} head in literal protest at a doubt. [...] "Why that's exactly what I mean by my gratitude {{for all your}} trouble. It has been just as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> particular interest." [...] She only looked at him by way of answer in such sudden headlong embarrassment, as she was quite aware, that while she remained silent he showed himself checked by her expression. [...] "You have--haven't you?--taken a particular interest?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Watch never hurted any {{creature}} yet," [...] said Bawcombe. He caught {{things just}} {{for his own}} amusement, but never injured them--he always let them go again. He would hunt mice in the fields, and when he captured one he would play with it like a cat, tossing it from him, then dashing after and recapturing it. Finally, he would let it go. He played with rabbits in the same way, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> rabbit from him and examined it you would find it quite uninjured.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, sah," [...] he answered. [...] "We'll git dar {{twenty minutes}} before de train does, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>takes</b> half <b>an</b> hour I can whip up. That train's mostly late, anyway." ...|$|R
