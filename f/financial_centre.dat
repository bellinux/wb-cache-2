5|$|London finance {{industry}} {{is based in}} the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major Central Business Districts in London. London {{is one of the}} pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance. London took over as a major <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading <b>financial</b> <b>centre.</b> Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on both the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) and The Global Cities Index.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu {{traditionally}} {{served as}} a commercial and <b>financial</b> <b>centre.</b> Before the importation of mass-produced cloth from Europe and America, the city's textiles were forwarded far and wide throughout {{the interior of the}} continent, {{as well as to the}} Arabian peninsula and as far as the Persian coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} capital to feed rapid {{economic}} expansion also saw Birmingham grow into a major <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> with extensive international connections. Lloyds Bank was founded in the town in 1765, and Ketley's Building Society, the world's first building society, in 1775. By 1800 the West Midlands had more banking offices per head than any other region in Britain, including London.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on the geography of financial activity in order to assess the role of <b>financial</b> <b>centres.</b> While there is widespread concern that rapid technological progess especially in communication and information technologies will ultimately lead to a delocalization of financial activity, the role of <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> depends delicately on their success in generating local externalities. On the basis of empirical evidence on recent developments in world financial markets, it is argued that the ability of <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> to attract <b>financial</b> activity in information sensitive securities will be crucial for their future role. To the extent that information is localized and market access is costly, <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> perform an important role in aggregating local information. Therefore a reduction of global market access and information costs may increase global demand for local securities, and even strengthen the role of certain <b>financial</b> <b>centres.</b> Furthermore, complementarities between informationally sensitive and less sensitive financial activities may also attract footloose activities to <b>financial</b> <b>centres.</b> <b>financial</b> centres; information sensitivity; local information; market access costs; thick market externalities...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent times}} the {{financial}} services industry has experienced a major transformation, in which markets and players have been globalised and consolidated. Certain <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> have concentrated on financial firms and markets, engendering considerable research on the foundations of their pre-eminence. Nevertheless, the growth of <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> in peripheral regions has not been conveniently analysed, {{despite the fact that}} financial activity may {{play a major role in}} some economies. This paper provides a thorough survey of state-of-the-art literature, both on the transformation of the financial marketplace, and on the rise of global <b>financial</b> <b>centres,</b> devoting especial attention to the appearance of peripheral <b>financial</b> <b>centres.</b> The Scottish case is studied, among other aspects, through the use of Input-Output multipliers, to determine the dramatic role financial services have to play in this region’s economy. This approach advanced may be adapted to other locations, to help to assess the specific impact of <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> and to draw attention to possible problems arising from overdependence on their activity. <b>Financial</b> <b>centres,</b> Scotland, <b>financial</b> cluster, Input-Output, regional economy. ...|$|R

5|$|Germany {{is part of}} the European {{single market}} which {{represents}} more than 508 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Germany introduced the common European currency, the Euro in 2002.

5|$|Greater London's {{population}} declined {{steadily in}} the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6million in 1939 to around 6.8million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> during the 1980s. The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> matured in the 1990s, but {{was greatly}} {{affected}} by the Asian financial crisis in 1998, and again in 2003 by the SARS outbreak. A revival of external and domestic demand {{has led to a}} strong recovery, as cost decreases strengthened the competitiveness of Hong Kong exports and a long deflationary period ended. Government intervention, initiated by the later colonial governments and continued since 1997, has steadily increased, with the introduction of export credit guarantees, a compulsory pension scheme, a minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws, and a state mortgage backer.|$|E

It provides new insights on the spatial effects of the 2008 – 2009 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on the technical efficiency of the top- 1000, world-leading banks in terms of total assets. The results reveal that the distance of banks’ headquarters to these <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> matters. In particular, banks that are located at a bigger distance from New York and London present a lower technical efficiency than banks that are closer to these <b>financial</b> <b>centres.</b> In addition, the results show that the Global Financial Crisis has magnified the effect of distance and the need for banks to be closer to global <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> during the ‘core’ of that period...|$|R
5|$|In 1983, the Hong Kong dollar {{left its}} 16:1 peg with the Pound {{sterling}} and {{switched to the}} current US-HK Dollar peg. Hong Kong's competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined due to rising labour and property costs, {{as well as new}} development in southern China under the Open Door Policy introduced in 1978 which opened up China to foreign business. Nevertheless, towards the early 1990s, Hong Kong had established itself as a global <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> along with London and New York City, a regional hub for logistics and freight, one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia and the world's exemplar of Laissez-faire market policy.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire of London {{broke out}} in 1666 in Pudding Lane {{in the city and}} quickly swept through the wooden buildings. Rebuilding took over ten years and was {{supervised}} by Robert Hooke as Surveyor of London. In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> matured for much of the 1700s.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the gaps}} in financial centres’ competitiveness {{and their impact on}} regional economic convergence in 23 EU Member States during the period of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). In particular, we explore the economic convergence and divergence patterns among regions from two different perspectives across the selected EU Member States and within each country. From a methodological viewpoint, we apply a fully non-parametric framework to the club convergence model and address the endogeneity problem between financial centres’ competitiveness and regional economic convergence. Our results show that the large and internationally-oriented <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> experienced a diverging trend in terms of the competitiveness of financial centres’ business environment during the peak of the crisis. We also find evidence that the convergence of <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> reduces regional economic inequalities between the regions where <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> are located. In contrast, the increase in the competitiveness of <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> only serves to widen existing inequalities at the national level. Finally, we examine and discuss the impact of competitiveness drivers of <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> on the convergence pattern of EU regions...|$|R

5|$|Edmund Crouchback {{passed on}} the castle to his eldest son, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, in 1298. Lancaster married Alice de Lacy, which made him the richest nobleman in England. Kenilworth became the primary castle of the Lancaster estates, {{replacing}} Bolingbroke, and acted as both a social and a <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> for Thomas. Thomas built the first great hall at the castle from 1314 to 1317 and constructed the Water Tower along the outer bailey, as well as increasing {{the size of the}} chase. Lancaster, with support from many of the other English barons, found himself in increasing opposition to Edward II. War broke out in 1322, and Lancaster was captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge and executed. His estates, including Kenilworth, were confiscated by the crown. Edward and his wife, Isabella of France, spent Christmas 1323 at Kenilworth, amidst major celebrations.|$|E
