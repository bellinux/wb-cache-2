We want to keep him." [...] Hodgson dismissed reports Torres was set to leave Liverpool by saying, [...] "He has {{told us that he}} is looking forward to Monday, to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for Liverpool next season. That is what I know so other reports, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest,</b> are erroneous." [...] Torres stated his commitment to Liverpool on 3 August: [...] "My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is {{the same as it was}} on my first day when I signed." ...|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter Dan Gerson joined Pixar in 1999 {{and worked}} on the film with the filmmakers {{on a daily basis}} for almost two years. He {{considered}} it his first experience in writing a feature film. He explained, [...] "I would sit with Pete [...] and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." ...|$|E

500|$|Feminist author Naomi Wolf {{criticized the}} video as {{propaganda}} for the Marine Corps, stating [...] "I {{really want to}} find out if she was paid by them for making it ..... it is truly shameful. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> a boycott of this singer whom I really liked if you are as offended at this glorification of violence as I am." [...] Glenn Selig, founder of The Publicity Agency, responded to these claims on Fox News Live, stating, [...] "In her efforts to boycott the video, Naomi Wolf has brought more attention to it, without her comments, most people would clearly have seen the military simply as a metaphor and not as an attempt by Katy Perry to glamorize the military or war." [...] Perry told MTV that she chose the military plot because it represented the song, saying, [...] "It's an affirmation of strength, so I wanted to go the strongest route I ever could." ...|$|E
500|$|By early 1887, 13 African Americans {{were playing}} in the [...] "white" [...] minor leagues, {{including}} four in the Ohio State League. [...] Weldy began the season with the Akron Acorns of the Ohio State League. [...] However, he appeared in only four games for the Acorns. During the 1887 season, racial segregation began to become the official policy in certain minor leagues. [...] Weldy was outraged by a report that the Tri-State League (successor to the Ohio State League) had abandoned racial integration. [...] In March 1888, {{he wrote a letter}} to the league's president protesting the decision. [...] In his 1970 history of racial segregation in baseball, Robert Peterson described Weldy's letter as [...] "perhaps the most passionate cry for justice ever voiced by a Negro athlete." [...] In the letter, Walker wrote:The law is a disgrace to the present age, and reflects very much upon the intelligence of your last meeting, and casts derision at the laws of Ohio– the voice of the people– that say all men are equal. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> that your honorable body, in case that black law is not repealed, pass one making it criminal for a colored man or woman to be found on a ball ground... There should be some broader cause– such as lack of ability, behavior and intelligence– for barring a player, rather than his color. [...] It is for these reasons and because I think ability and intelligence should be recognized first and last– at all times and by everyone– I ask the question again, 'Why was the law permitting colored men to sign repealed, etc.?' ...|$|E

Father's rule had been 'Question everything, take nothing for granted,' and I never outlived it, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> it be made the motto of a world journalists' association." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Good Morning America, Nancy Grace said in reaction to events that [...] "If anything, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> that guilt made her commit suicide. To suggest that a 15- or 20-minute interview can cause someone to commit suicide is focusing on the wrong thing." [...] She then said that, while she sympathized with the family, she knew from her own experience {{as a victim of}} crime that such people look for somebody else to blame.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{independent}} {{evidence for}} Chalmers' claim is the essay and proposal he submitted for adhesive postage stamps to the General Post Office, dated 8 February 1838 and {{received by the}} Post Office on 17 February 1838.

We have a portable studio that we set up at the different hotels that we are staying at. We set up shop anywhere in the hotel.

Rihanna likes to work late hours, so she would come into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am." [...] Continuing Harrell stated [...] "The show was the priority, and then the album. That's how the day was broken up." [...] Expanding on this Harrell stated that Rihanna would perform every night, finish her meet [...] and greet by 1 a.m. Then go to the studio for around two or three a.m. During these session Harrell stated [...] "I’d make the decision based off where I felt her voice was. Knowing she just did two hours of a show and meet-and-greets, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> capturing the stuff that was easier to get like the lower-range stuff so we wouldn’t hurt or damage her voice." ...|$|E
