5|$|During his <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> naval service, Callaghan {{had been}} courting Mary Tormey of Oakland, California; the two married on July 23, 1914. Their son, Daniel Judson Callaghan Jr., {{was born in}} Alameda, California, on October 16, 1915.|$|E
5|$|Bergen {{remained}} a quiet base during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the occupation, experiencing only one large Allied air attack. In 1943, the U-boat base added two new bunkers, U-Stützpunkt Prien and U-Stützpunkt Weddingen {{along with a}} shipyard named Danziger Werft.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using dead fish to fertilize the soil. For the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> colonial life, the fur trade was the dominant source of income, buying furs from Native Americans and selling to Europeans, beyond subsistence farming. Shortly after {{the departure}} of the Mayflower, Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E
50|$|Southern District {{entered the}} newly formed Hong Kong Third District Division League in 2002-03 season. However, the team did not reach the Hong Kong Third Division League Final Round and thus did not get {{promotion}} in the <b>first</b> <b>fews</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> {{the newly formed}} club.|$|R
50|$|During {{formation}} of the system, {{it is possible that}} water loss during its <b>first</b> <b>few</b> million <b>years</b> <b>of</b> existence occurred. This was likely due to photoevaporation.|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{large quantities of}} hydrogen and helium on Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, and Kepler-11f suggest that these planets formed within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> million <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the system's existence, when gas could still be captured from the forming protoplanetary disc.|$|R
5|$|Dogalis {{career was}} uneventful; she {{served with the}} main Italian fleet for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> her career and visited the United States in 1893 {{for the start of}} the World's Columbian Exposition. In January 1908, the ship was sold to Uruguay and renamed 25 de Agosto and later Montevideo. In 1914, the cruiser was {{withdrawn}} from service, but she was not disposed of until 1932 when she was sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Eddy was widowed {{when she}} was 22 years old and pregnant, after which she {{returned}} to live in her father's home. Her son was raised there for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his life, looked after by domestic staff because of Eddy's poor health. The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy alleges that she allowed him to be adopted when he was four. According to Eddy, {{she was unable to}} prevent the adoption, but McClure's implied otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Henry assumed {{formal control}} of his {{government}} in January 1227, although some contemporaries argued that he was legally still a minor until his 21st birthday the following year. The King richly rewarded Hubert de Burgh for his service during his minority years, making him the Earl of Kent and giving him extensive lands across England and Wales. Despite coming of age, Henry remained heavily influenced by his advisers for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his rule and retained Hubert as his justiciar to run the government, granting him the position for life.|$|E
5000|$|For the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>of</b> its existence, the City of New York lacked an {{official}} flag and seal. [...] By {{the end of}} the 19th century, the city was flying an unofficial flag featuring a round blue seal on a white field.|$|R
50|$|Ouellet {{played for}} Rimouski Océanic in the QMJHL before being drafted 124th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. He spent his <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> out <b>of</b> junior {{in the minor}} leagues and was named to the AHL All-Rookie Team with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The first camping season {{started in}} the first week of July, 1925. It was decided to call the new {{facility}} Camp Squanto, in honor of the Patuxet Indian, Tisquantum, whose aid to the Pilgrims in Plymouth helped them survive the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> difficult <b>years</b> <b>of</b> their settlement.|$|R
5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E
5|$|The cover art for Amazing {{had been}} largely {{supplied}} by Ed Valigursky during the late fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including Alex Schomburg, Leo Summers and Ed Emshwiller. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Amazing, contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the {{federation}} were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a booming economy. The government's coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia's copper mines, and overseas investment saw the {{rapid expansion of}} the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and Lusaka. High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded. Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald Macintyre.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11f's low {{density is}} {{not shared by}} the planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c because the solar wind has reduced their atmospheres to a thin layer. The planets accreted such atmospheres because they formed within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> million <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the system's existence, when a protoplanetary disk was still present.|$|R
50|$|Troon Juniors {{played in}} the Western League North Section but the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> saw little <b>of</b> any note, with league form being poor and usually ending in a lowly position.|$|R
5000|$|When Seeger, Agnes [...] "Sis" [...] Cunningham and {{her husband}} Gordon Friesen were {{considering}} launching a magazine devoted to protest songs, Turner became {{the key to the}} enterprise. Through his role at Gerde's, Turner rounded up contributors of protest songs for Broadside during its <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> many <b>of</b> them young songwriters like Phil Ochs, Bonnie Dobson, Len Chandler and Mark Spoelstra.|$|R
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> their {{marriage}} were reasonably happy, {{leading to the}} birth of their daughter Vibeke in 1895, but as a result of P.S. Krøyer's periods of mental illness, by the early 1900s they spent ever more time apart. In 1902, Marie began an affair with the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén, with whom she became pregnant in 1905. Thereafter she spent most of her time with Alfvén in Sweden, marrying him in 1912, three years after Krøyer had died in Skagen.|$|E
5|$|The {{interest}} cost is another major item of this company's financing. In the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> operation, interest rates were well above market rates. Interest expense stood at around NT$1.3billion per month in April 2008, when THSRC first achieved break-even cash flow, with revenue and cash expenses (which exclude depreciation) both around NT$2.1billion. Interest rates {{fell in the}} first half of 2009, reducing interest expenses and contributing to a reduced net loss.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{had taken}} up his diocese in Scotland by 17 August 1298. On this date his seal was {{attached}} to a document which recorded the losses suffered by Scone Abbey following the Scottish rebel defeat by the English crown at the Battle of Falkirk. In the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 14th century Thomas witnessed three charters of Coupar Angus Abbey {{in the company of}} Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, a known opponent of the English crown.|$|E

50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> {{each group}} <b>of</b> players were {{accompanied}} by a gamemaster throughout the dungeon. In 2005, this was switched to having a gamemaster assigned to each room to ensure more consistent rulings for a given room.|$|R
50|$|Monroeville was platted in 1817, {{one year}} after the arrival of the first settler, and the village was {{incorporated}} in 1868. Within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> churches <b>of</b> the Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian faiths were organized. The village's first Episcopal families began meeting together in 1843, but eleven years passed before they were gathered into their own parish, and the present church building was not built until 1861.|$|R
5|$|Time has {{undergone}} several restorations because of deterioration and decline caused by natural and urban elements. During the late 1990s and the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 21st century it underwent repairs that corrected {{many of the}} problems caused by these earlier restorations. Although extensive renovation of the sculpture was completed as recently as 2005, the supporters of Time continue to seek resources for additional lighting, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation has nominated it for further funding.|$|E
5|$|A {{minority}} of Vietnamese are also {{followers of the}} Cao Đài faith which was introduced in 1927. The Cao Đài faith attracted both Vietnamese and Cambodian adherents within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> its founding, but a royal decree which outlawed the religion and efforts by Cambodian nationalists to prosecute Khmer adherents led to Cao Dai being observed solely by Vietnamese from the 1930s onwards. A Cao Đài temple was built in Mao Tse Tung Boulevard in 1937, and in the 1960s there were about 70,000 adherents in Cambodia. Cao Đài was outlawed during the Khmer Republic and Khmer Rouge regimes, but regained official recognition in 1985 and has about 2,000 adherents in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{also worked}} {{occasionally}} as an umpire in significant games. One notable example {{was the final}} contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29–18, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game. Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> existence.|$|E
50|$|The winery {{was founded}} in 1992 by Charles Lill, Greg Lill, Jay Soloff and {{winemaker}} Chris Upchurch. For the <b>few</b> <b>first</b> <b>years,</b> Master <b>of</b> wine David Lake served as consulting enologist.|$|R
25|$|Also when {{children}} with congenital (infantile) strabismus (e.g. infantile esotropia) receive strabismus surgery within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> or two <b>of</b> their life, this {{goes along with}} the hope that they may yet develop their full potential for binocular vision including stereopsis.|$|R
50|$|Although {{treatment}} {{results can}} be rapid, stains can reappear within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> months and <b>years</b> <b>of</b> treatment. In order to maintain your whitened smile, there are multiple ways to protect your teeth and prolong the treatment.|$|R
5|$|After {{teaching}} at the University of Washington from 1910 to 1912, Morgan completed a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1914. Stieglitz supervised her dissertation. She {{may have been the}} only married woman to have received a Ph.D. in chemistry in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century. Despite the fact that married women were not generally welcome on university faculties (female professors were usually expected to resign when they married), Stieglitz agreed to write a recommendation letter for Morgan for a position at the University of Illinois. Stieglitz noted in his letter that the university should overlook Morgan's marital status because her husband was ill at the time.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} gained success in European club tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s, and {{thousands}} of IFK fans travelled to Hamburg, Barcelona, Dundee, Milan, Manchester and Munich, the supporters gained influence on the club, for example by lending money to the almost bankrupt IFK Göteborg so the team could go to Valencia to play the quarter-final in the UEFA Cup in 1982, or by being the main force behind the move back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992. The early 1990s saw a downward trend in attendance numbers, even though the club was successful on the pitch, but the trend turned in the later years of the decade and the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the new millennium brought the club's highest average attendance since the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Both Regina Margherita and Benedetto Brin {{served in}} the active duty {{squadron}} for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> their careers, and participated in the peacetime routine of fleet training. Regina Margherita frequently served as the fleet flagship before {{the completion of the}} new s. On 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, starting the Italo-Turkish War. The two ships saw action during the war in the 3rd Division in the 2nd Squadron. Benedetto Brin took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, and both were involved in the campaign to seize Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, a non-partisan local {{government}} elections were {{decided to be}} held in entire country, starting first to hold the elections in Karachi, Sindh Province. Subsequently, Aziz supervised and presided the first free and fair local body elections with PML(Q) and its allied parties sweeping the election arena. Controversially, Aziz allocated Rs. 20 million to each district where PML(Q) candidates lost the National Assembly elections in order to secure its voting bank that was lost in 2002. In Sindh and Balochistan Province, Aziz presided the peaceful election held events and personally monitored the success of the {{local government}} body programme. Under his <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> government, the law and order situation remains under control and prosperity in Balochistan, and presided the completion {{the first phase of the}} Gwadar port.|$|R
50|$|First-class cricket in New Zealand in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> {{consisted}} entirely <b>of</b> {{the annual}} match between Canterbury and Otago, {{which began in}} 1863-64.
