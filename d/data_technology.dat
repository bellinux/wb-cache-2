25|$|Originally, Bandai never {{intended}} to develop a system with Internet connectivity in mind. However, Apple and Bandai received feedback from customers, indicating {{that they were looking}} for a system that could connect to the Internet. To make Internet connectivity possible, Apple had to incorporate a modem into the Pippin design. Two years earlier (1992), Apple had already moved away from the older serial interface with an external Hayes-compatible modem on its Macintosh systems, and switched to a serial interface which included GeoPort – a serial <b>data</b> <b>technology</b> that allowed software to emulate a modem. Implementing GeoPort into the Pippin platform required Apple to make a major change in its design – moving away from the 68030 footprint and to a PowerPC footprint. Apple chose the PowerPC 603 32-bit processor, as it was designed to be a low-cost, low-end processor for embedded use.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPolicy-makers {{expect that}} open {{data will be}} {{accepted}} and used more and more, resulting {{in a range of}} benefits including transparency, participation and innovation. The ability to use open data partly depends on the availability of open <b>data</b> <b>technologies.</b> However, the actual use of open <b>data</b> <b>technologies</b> has shown mixed results, and there is a paucity of research on the predictors affecting the acceptance and use of open <b>data</b> <b>technologies.</b> A better understanding of these predictors can help policy-makers to determine which policy instruments they can use to increase the acceptance and use of open <b>data</b> <b>technologies.</b> A modified model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is used to empirically determine predictors influencing the acceptance and use of open <b>data</b> <b>technologies.</b> The results show that the predictors performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and voluntariness of use together account for 45 % of the variability in people's behavioral intention to use open <b>data</b> <b>technologies.</b> Except for facilitating conditions, all these predictors significantly influence behavioral intention. Our analysis of the predictors that influence the acceptance and use of open <b>data</b> <b>technologies</b> can be used to stimulate the use of open <b>data</b> <b>technologies.</b> The findings suggest that policy-makers should increase the acceptance and use of open <b>data</b> <b>technologies</b> by showing the benefits of open data use, by creating awareness of users that they already use open data, by developing social strategies to encourage people to stimulate each other to use open data, by integrating open data use in daily activities, and by decreasing the effort necessary to use open <b>data</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R

At the time, Lazaridis was an {{engineering}} student at the University of Waterloo while Fregin was an engineering student at the University of Windsor. In 1988, RIM became the first wireless <b>data</b> <b>technology</b> developer in North America and the first company outside Scandinavia to develop connectivity products for Mobitex wireless packet-switched data communications networks. In 1990, RIM introduced the DigiSync Film KeyKode Reader. In 1991, RIM introduced the first Mobitex protocol converter. In 1992, RIM introduced the first Mobitex point-of-sale solution, a protocol converter box that interfaced with existing point-of-sale terminal equipment to enable wireless communication. In 1993, RIM introduced the RIMGate, the first general purpose Mobitex X.25 gateway. In the same year, RIM launched Ericsson Mobidem AT and Intel wireless modem containing RIM modem firmware. In 1994, RIM introduced the first Mobitex mobile point-of-sale terminal. In the same year, RIM received the Emmy Award for Technical Innovation and the KPMG High Technology Award. In 1995, RIM introduced Freedom, the first Type II PCMCIA radio modem for Mobitex.|$|E

The highly competitive market in digital <b>data</b> <b>technology</b> and high-efficiency power supplies rapidly adopted these new components because of their improved performance. Furthermore, by improving the conductivity of the electrolyte, capacitors not only can withstand a higher ripple current rating, they are much cheaper to produce since water is much cheaper than other solvents. Better performance and low cost drove widespread adoption of the new capacitors for high volume products such as PCs, LCD screens, and power supplies.|$|E
