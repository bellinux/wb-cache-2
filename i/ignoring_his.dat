5|$|The Expendables' leader. Stallone {{insisted on}} {{performing}} his own stunts, <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> doctor's advice after several surgeries {{to repair a}} broken back and neck injury he received while filming The Expendables.|$|E
5|$|A scientist, engineer, billionaire, {{founder and}} owner of Oscorp, who tests an {{unstable}} strength enhancer on himself and becomes the insane and powerful demon. Unaware of Spider-Man's true identity, he also {{sees himself as a}} father figure for Peter, <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> own son, Harry. Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.|$|E
5|$|For most of Edward's reign, Mary {{remained}} {{on her own}} estates and rarely attended court. A plan between May and July 1550 to smuggle her out of England {{to the safety of}} the European mainland came to nothing. Religious differences between Mary and Edward continued. When Mary was in her thirties, she attended a reunion with Edward and Elizabeth for Christmas 1550, where 13-year-old Edward embarrassed Mary, and reduced both her and himself to tears in front of the court, by publicly reproving her for <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> laws regarding worship. Mary repeatedly refused Edward's demands that she abandon Catholicism, and Edward persistently refused to drop his demands.|$|E
60|$|He paused so {{long that}} she <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> {{injunction}} of silence.|$|R
60|$|Dominey obeyed {{a little}} sullenly. <b>His</b> companion, however, <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> demeanour.|$|R
50|$|England and Austria <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> claim, {{the latter}} of which had a {{candidate}} {{in the form of}} Archduke Charles who immediately claimed himself as Charles III of Spain. The Grand Duke of Tuscany also <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> claims. In the mean time he pursued the expansion of Savoy and bought various fiefdoms of the Holy Roman Empire.|$|R
5|$|Late 18th-century critics {{felt that}} Smart's madness {{justified}} them in <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> A Song to David, {{but during the}} following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition {{to be the source}} of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{plays at}} the park with his teddy, Rupert. A vicious dog grabs Rupert from him and tears it to shreds. Lois runs after the dog, {{retrieves}} Rupert, and repairs him, causing Stewie to rethink all the bad thoughts he's had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and frustrated at his increased dependency and even has a nightmare of murdering him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> demands for attention (faking he got sick from pills and claiming to be dying), until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to hate her once again.|$|E
30|$|Inherit: Completely <b>ignores</b> <b>his</b> {{personal}} opinion and inherits the opinion he receives from T.|$|R
50|$|Spider-Man {{can choose}} to <b>ignore</b> <b>his</b> spider-sense, and {{distraction}} or fatigue can force unawareness.|$|R
50|$|Intensely {{concentrated}} on <b>his</b> work, he <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> health {{and died of}} tuberculosis, aged only thirty-one.|$|R
5|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, Greatfoot is {{run over}} and killed while {{crossing}} a freeway during a hunt. The pups begin hearing a strange wolf howl, but when they track it they find a fresh kill and the familiar human scent. New kills appear every few days as the young wolves grow larger and stronger. One night when they hear the unusual howl, they are closer than usual to it and reach the kill in time to meet their benefactor, a human male. The pack stares at the man, before disappearing back into the forest, <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> howl. As he goes to leave, however, the six return {{to the edge of}} the clearing and howl.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{decides that}} he is going to take a break from rehearsals after he is called back on stage to read his cue cards. When Tracy appears to be <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> cue cards, Jenna informs Liz of the situation, and realizes that Tracy might be {{illiterate}}, citing an earlier promo cue card mishap ("The Aftermath") as an example. Liz confronts Tracy about the problem; he admits {{that he is}} illiterate and agrees to get help. Liz later notices Tracy reading a newspaper, and learns that he was using the ploy to get out of work. Liz tells Tracy that she is not going to take it anymore, and forces him to go through with the sketch.|$|E
5|$|Cofresí's {{victims were}} locals and foreigners, {{and the region}} was {{economically}} destabilized. When he boarded Spanish vessels he usually targeted immigrants brought by the royal decree of 1815, <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> fellow criollos. The situation was complicated by several factors, most of them geopolitical. The Spanish Empire had lost most of its possessions in the New World, and her last two territories (Puerto Rico and Cuba) faced economic problems and political unrest. To undermine the commerce of former colonies, Spain stopped issuing letters of marque; this left sailors unemployed, and they gravitated towards Cofresí and piracy. On the diplomatic front, the pirates assaulted foreign ships while flying the Flag of Spain (angering nations who had reached an agreement about the return of ships captured by corsairs and compensation for losses). Aware that the problem had developed international overtones, Spanish-appointed governor of Puerto Rico Lt Gen Miguel Luciano de la Torre y Pando (1822–1837) made Cofresí's capture a priority. By December 1823 other nations joined the effort to combat Cofresí, sending warships to the Mona Passage. Gran Colombia sent two corvettes, the Bocayá and the Bolívar, {{under the command of}} former privateer and Jean Lafitte associate Renato Beluche. The British assigned a corvette, , to the region after the William Henry incident.|$|E
50|$|Mary's spirit even reinvigorates John Glidden. Glidden <b>ignores</b> <b>his</b> {{doctor and}} {{looks forward to}} {{spending}} time with Mary.|$|R
50|$|The judges {{intentionally}} <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> alibi that he {{had been}} with his young niece {{at the time of the}} murder.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{leaned back}} in her chair. Her eyes were fixed anxiously upon his face. She {{completely}} <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> question.|$|R
5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|Johnson wrote a {{considerable}} part of Irene in 1737 while teaching at Edial Hall School, the academy he had founded in 1735. Johnson spent his evenings {{working on his}} play while <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> wife Elizabeth (known as Tetty). This provoked David Garrick, his student, to perform a skit mocking the incidents, although the incidents he portrayed were more than likely his own fabrications. However, the play was written mostly for Mrs. Johnson; she was fond of it and {{hoped it would be}} a success. Her belief in the play inspired Johnson to finish it and push to have it performed. When Edial Hall failed, Johnson travelled to London and brought the unfinished manuscript with him. In 1737, Johnson tried to submit Irene to Charles Fleetwood, the owner-manager of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, but Fleetwood rejected it on the grounds that there was no patron and his theatre was catering to other types of performances. Johnson tried in 1741 to have the unperformed play printed, but this too failed. He seems to have continued to revise it over the next several years, since a manuscript notebook contains draft material made not earlier than June 1746.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 2004 {{in an open}} letter, Sihanouk {{announced}} his plans to abdicate. At the same time, he criticised Hun Sen and Ranariddh for <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> {{suggestions on how to}} resolve the political stalemate of the past year. Meanwhile, Hun Sen and Ranariddh had agreed to introduce a constitutional amendment that provided for an open voting system, requiring parliamentarians to select cabinet ministers {{and the president of the}} National Assembly by a show of hands. Sihanouk disapproved of the open voting system, calling upon Senate President Chea Sim not to sign the amendment. When Chea Sim heeded Sihanouk's advice, he was ferried out of the country shortly before the National Assembly convened to vote on the amendment on 15July. On 17July 2004, the CPP and FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government, leaving SRP out as an opposition party. On 6October 2004, Sihanouk wrote a letter calling for the throne council to convene and select a successor. The National Assembly and Senate both held emergency meetings to pass laws allowing for the abdication of the monarch. On 14October 2004 the throne council unanimously voted to select Norodom Sihamoni as Sihanouk's successor. Sihamoni was crowned as the King of Cambodia on 29October 2004.|$|E

60|$|Lieut. D'Hubert felt vexed beyond measure. His {{shoulders}} moved slightly. He made {{no other}} answer. He could not <b>ignore</b> <b>his</b> responsibility.|$|R
50|$|While {{fighting}} with the Ghaznavids, Vijayachandra may have <b>ignored</b> <b>his</b> western frontiers. This later resulted in a Sena invasion led by Lakshmana Sena.|$|R
5|$|Clorinde {{had been}} almost {{undamaged}} in the battle and comfortably outran all British pursuit. Without a safe harbour in the entire Indian Ocean, Saint-Criq initially sailed for the Seychelles, hiding among the islands until 7 June. On 26 June, Clorinde landed at Diego Garcia and collected fresh water and coconuts before beginning the return journey to France {{in defiance of the}} orders to continue on to Batavia issued before the convoy left Brest. On 1 August, Clorinde passed the Cape of Good Hope, Saint-Criq supplementing his provisions by raiding British and American merchant ships in the Atlantic. On 24 September, Clorinde encountered the British blockade squadron off Brest and was chased by the 80-gun ship of the line HMS Tonnant under Captain Sir John Gore. Although Tonnant came close enough to Clorinde to discharge her broadside at the frigate, Gore was unable to catch the elusive French ship and was eventually forced to retire to open waters after coming under fire from batteries at Pointe Trépassée. By 17:00, Clorinde was anchored in Brest harbour. Saint-Criq was heavily criticised for his failure to support Roquebert and for <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> orders to sail to Batavia if Mauritius had been captured. In March 1812, he was brought to a court martial to examine his behaviour and found to have been negligent in his duty, for which he was dismissed from the service, expelled from the legion of Honour and sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Napoleon is reported to have suggested that Saint-Criq be shot for deserting his commanding officer.|$|E
25|$|Masahiro Matsuoka as Shingo Muraki, a {{chef who}} {{previously}} moved to Tokyo {{to pursue his}} cooking career, <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> father's wish that he take over the family's temple. However, he moves back to his hometown {{to take up the}} job of advising a restaurant that is run by a local high school.|$|E
25|$|Fred Smailey and Eve Van Brugh {{are making}} {{plans for a}} school feast. Fred is a very grave person, objecting to the {{frivolous}} entertainments being planned by Eve, but they are in love, and, despite her teasing and <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> chides, they get along quite well. Fred doesn't think Eve's mother cares much for him, although she agreed to their engagement.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1960s, Curran {{was being}} criticized for <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> members' needs and concerns. His $85,000-a-year salary {{was one of}} the highest in the American labor {{movement}} even though his union was small and shedding members. He enjoyed an unlimited expense account, and traveled by chartered jet and private limousine. He cajoled the union's executive board into building a massive, Art Deco headquarters in Manhattan, and had the edifice named after himself.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, GameSpy {{remarked that}} the 1986 video game Kid Icarus, {{which had become}} very popular and then faded to {{relative}} obscurity, had followed a trajectory similar to its namesake from Greek mythology, Icarus, who had escaped imprisonment when his father created wings from feathers and wax, but <b>ignoring</b> <b>his</b> father's advice, Icarus flew {{too close to the}} sun so that the wax melted and Icarus fell to his death in the sea.|$|E
25|$|Teddy {{proceeds}} to the Sport Deck and locates his little sister, Booper, at play with another young passenger. Booper is a domineering and hateful child, contrasting sharply with her older brother's equanimity. Teddy, with firmness, politely exhorts {{the girl to}} return with the camera to the cabin and report to their mother. <b>Ignoring</b> <b>his</b> sister’s verbal ripostes, he reminds her to meet him shortly for their swimming lesson at the swimming pool. She submits with bad grace as he departs.|$|E
