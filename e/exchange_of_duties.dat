60|$|In such a home as this parsonage, {{a nest of}} comfort, {{without any}} of the stateliness that would carry a {{suggestion}} of Cheverel Manor, Mr. Gilfil was not unreasonable in hoping that Caterina might gradually shake off the haunting vision of the past, and recover from the languor and feebleness which were the physical sign of that vision's blighting presence. The next thing to be done was to arrange an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> with Mr. Heron's curate, that Maynard might be constantly near Caterina, and watch over her progress. She seemed to like him to be with her, to look uneasily for his return; and though she seldom spoke to him, she was most contented when he sat by her, and held her tiny hand in his large protecting grasp. But Oswald, alias Ozzy, the broad-chested boy, was perhaps her most beneficial companion. With something of his uncle's person, he had inherited also his uncle's early taste for a domestic menagerie, and was very imperative in demanding Tina's sympathy in the welfare of his guinea-pigs, squirrels, and dormice. With him she seemed now and then to have gleams of her childhood coming athwart the leaden clouds, and many hours of winter went by the more easily for being spent in Ozzy's nursery.|$|E

The matching situation including heat load, heat <b>exchange</b> area, <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> utilities, flow fraction of splitting, temperature of inlet and outlet, etc. for cold and hot streams in the heat exchanger network with splitting stream is presented in detail, Analysis the relationship between total heat exchange area, total heat load, total capital cost and annual operation cost of the heat exchanger network.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{reliance on}} information technology to support business processes has emphasised {{the need for}} information security mechanisms. This, however, has resulted in an ever-increasing workload in terms of security administration. Policy-based approaches have been proposed, promising to lighten the workload of security administrators. Separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> is one <b>of</b> the principles cited as a requirement when setting up these policy-based mechanisms. Different types <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> policies exist. They can be categorised into policies that can be enforced at administration time, viz. static separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> requirements and policies that can be enforced only at execution time, viz. dynamic separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> requirements. This paper deals with specifying static separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> requirements in role-based workflow environments. It proposes a mathematical model based {{on the concept of}} “conflicting entities ” to express static separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> requirements. It provides a detailed explanation of the integrity checking that must take place at administration time to ensure that specified separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> requirements are honoured...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to uncover the {{philosophical}} foundations <b>of</b> the defendant's <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> restitution in the law of unjust enrichment. I argue that the current dominant account for the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> restitution – that it is best explained by the model of corrective justice – is inadequate as it fails to accommodate two key features of an action in unjust enrichment, namely, the irrelevance of fault {{and the absence of}} causation. In place of corrective justice, I suggest three alternative models: distributive justice, equity, and commutative justice. The first two candidates ultimately prove unsatisfactory, but in their respective failures help identify certain fundamental elements of unjust enrichment. The third is the most promising, but care must be taken not to conflate it with corrective justice. I argue that corrective and commutative justice are not synonymous since, while corrective justice exemplifies an intrapersonal equality, the relevant form of equality for commutative justice is interpersonal. I define commutative justice as exemplifying the principle <b>of</b> equality in <b>exchange,</b> specifically, equality <b>of</b> the things <b>exchanged.</b> Unjust enrichment, I conclude, is a manifestation <b>of</b> inequality <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> <b>of</b> commutative in justice. Although commutative justice accurately describes situations of unjust enrichment, I admit that it cannot alone justify the existence or imposition <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> restitution on the defendant. Something more is required: a normative theory for preserving the status quo of initial entitlement distribution. As such, I canvas two alternative theories as exemplified by Hegelian and Aristotelian conceptions of property, respectively. These two theories map onto a corresponding distinction between private (pre-institutional) rights and public (post-institutional) values. I conclude that given the legal <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> restitution {{and the fact that it}} is difficult to conceptualize a private right that could justify this type <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> on the defendant, the Aristotelian understanding is preferable...|$|R
