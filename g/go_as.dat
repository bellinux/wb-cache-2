5|$|During 2013–14, Wenger {{celebrated his}} 1,000th game {{in charge of}} Arsenal {{and in the process}} became the fourth manager in English {{football}} (after Sir Matt Busby, Dario Gradi and Sir Alex Ferguson) to do so.

5|$|Newspapers of {{the time}} {{reported}} that the society promoted free love, but the society promoted free love only {{in the sense that}} consenting adults had a right to change partners and even to have more than one partner at a time. Rather than promiscuousness, though, the society promoted tolerance, including tolerance of homosexuality. The Spirit Fruit Society, unlike most other communitarian groups of that time, did not seek to convert or recruit others to the group. Members were permitted to come and <b>go</b> <b>as</b> they pleased. The goal of the commune was not to convert or to expand membership in the society—it was simply to live as the adherents wished to live.|$|E

5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the Moon {{in the sky}} varies with the lunar phase and the season of the year. The full moon is highest during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox, the lunar declination can <b>go</b> <b>as</b> far as 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site: close to the equator, an observer can see a smile-shaped crescent moon.|$|E

5|$|The {{second story}} focuses on Shiva marrying Dhatchayini against {{the will of}} her father Dhatchan. Dhatchan {{performs}} a Mahayajna without inviting his son-in-law.

After the two leave, Karen (Megan Mullally)—Grace's friend and socialite assistant—tells Grace that she did not like the way Will and Val acted towards one another. Grace, however, refuses to accept what Karen implies.|$|E
