5|$|Two {{high-level}} island platforms serve {{three of}} the four Northeast Corridor passenger tracks; there is a center passing track, as well as a fifth track on the south side that is only used by CSX and Norfolk Southern <b>freights.</b> Most SEPTA Trenton Line trains and five daily Amtrak trains (two northbound and three southbound) stop at these platforms. Two low-level platforms, a short distance to the west, serve the diverging SEPTA-owned Chestnut Hill West Line. North Philadelphia has been a flag stop on the line since 1993. The station has relatively low inbound boardings; however, it is used by riders from the Chestnut Hill West Line transferring to SEPTA and Amtrak trains to reach jobs in New Jersey and New York.|$|E

50|$|<b>Freight</b> audit can be {{conducted}} at the shipment or <b>freight</b> invoice level. A company that has standard weights for standard packages may opt to audit <b>freight</b> invoices at <b>freight</b> invoice level to reduce complexity in the <b>freight</b> audit process. This is known as <b>freight</b> invoice validation and this process is simple as compared to a <b>freight</b> audit at shipment level. A company that has a more complex shipping process may choose to go for <b>freight</b> invoice verification. This <b>freight</b> invoice verification process is a flexible solution that allows the customer to use their shipment and package measurements and calculate against the <b>freight</b> quotes and finally compare against the <b>freight</b> invoice. By having detail shipment information, customers can analyze <b>freight</b> cost by product line reports or interface payment information into their ERP systems.|$|R
25|$|After Conrail took over, {{existing}} labor contracts kept EL's freight schedule largely unchanged. The railroad replaced many rotted ties, returning it {{to better}} physical condition. But Conrail eventually shifted all freight traffic to other routes, citing the grades over the Pocono Mountains and EL's early-1960s severing of the Boonton Branch near Paterson, New Jersey as reasons for moving rail traffic {{off of the}} route, leading Conrail to run its final through <b>freights</b> in late 1978 and officially ended service on the Cut-Off in January 1979. Routine maintenance on the line ceased, and the signal system was shut off. Scranton-Slateford <b>freights</b> continued running into 1980 when coal delivered to the Metropolitan Edison power plant in Portland, Pennsylvania, shifted from the Scranton Division to the former Bangor & Portland Railway.|$|E
25|$|Despite this delay, {{the process}} of {{electrification}} began in earnest in 1922 and by 1926 full electrified haulage had been instituted between Glencoe and Pietermaritzburg, with lashups of three electric locomotives being used on the heaviest <b>freights.</b> These trains were then hauled onward to Durban {{by a pair of}} Class 14 4-8-2 steam locomotives.|$|E

25|$|After {{reaching}} Quorn, work moved {{ahead to}} extend the second track to Loughborough. The double track between Loughborough and Rothley opened on 1 June 2000. This gave additional capacity, which is especially useful at galas, where up to six trains may be in operation at any one time. This enables the running of non-passenger-carrying trains (<b>freights,</b> TPO set) during galas {{to a greater extent}} than any other heritage railway. It also means that the timetable can be generally adhered to, as delays do not cascade, as they do on single track lines.|$|E
25|$|Fleet numbers 7600–7619 {{were built}} and {{delivered}} in 1944 and 7620–7629 in 1945, all by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They {{went to work}} on the Cumberland Division's rugged West End subdivision with its more than 2% grades and tight curves, where with the older 2-8-8-0 EL classes, they hauled West Virginia coal and <b>freights.</b> Since the EM-1s had roller bearings throughout, they also handled mail and express trains, replacing two B class T-3 4-8-2 Mountains. That continued until January 21, 1947, when near Oakland, Maryland, train 29 with engine 7625 derailed with the locomotive rolling onto the engineer's side, killing the engineer. The EM-1s were then restricted to coal and freight trains until the late 1950s, when the B used EM-1 No. 7600 for railfan trips.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} side platforms {{were replaced}} with high-level island platforms, {{long enough to}} permit level boarding for twelve-car trains. The platforms and platform supports were constructed of cast-in-place concrete. The line was widened to eight tracks through the station, with the platforms between the 2nd and 3rd tracks and the 6th and 7th tracks. The center non-platform tracks were reserved for through <b>freights,</b> with the outside non-platform tracks used by local <b>freights.</b> Each platform had a -wide waiting room, [...] long on the eastbound (south) platform and [...] long on the westbound platform. The waiting rooms were covered in copper sheathing and had large skylights. The railroad constructed full-length steel platform canopies in their own shops. A separate baggage tunnel, west of the main passenger tunnel, connected with freight elevators to the platforms. When the renovations were complete in 1915, the station was renamed as North Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "The Grouping" [...] in 1923, the Nclass {{remained}} on the former SECR network, which was incorporated into the Southern Railway's Eastern section. Typical services included , Ashford and [...] <b>freights,</b> and Cannon Street to Dover passenger trains. The spring of 1924 saw Nos.A815 and A825 transferred to the former LSWR mainline between Waterloo and Guildford for trials. These proved successful, and {{paved the way for}} the allocation of most of the Woolwich batch to the Southern Railway's Western section. The type regularly replaced Dugald Drummond's ageing LSWR T9 class 4-4-0s on portions of the Atlantic Coast Express over the steeply graded mainlines west of Exeter.|$|E
500|$|In peacetime, {{the class}} was {{occasionally}} used on fast <b>freights</b> from Southampton Docks, although it was common to see them {{at the head of}} freight and troop trains during the Second World War. Ten [...] "Urie Arthurs" [...] were transferred to the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in October 1942, and were based at Heaton shed for use on freight and occasional passenger trains in the north east and southern Scotland. They returned to the Southern Railway in July 1943 after the introduction of United States Army Transportation Corps S160 class 2-8-0s into service. From 1945 the King Arthur class regularly deputised for Bulleid’s new Pacifics, which were experiencing poor serviceability due to mechanical failures. The entire class came into British Railways ownership in 1948: they could be found in most areas of the Southern Region on medium-length expresses and stopping trains on the ex-LSWR mainline.|$|E

500|$|Events {{surrounding}} the February 1905 First Division match with Aston Villa highlighted the ground's inadequacies. The official attendance was given as 28,000, though with the gates closed before kick-off, thousands climbed over walls or forced entrances {{in order to}} gain admission, and the actual attendance is estimated at anything up to 35,000. The Birmingham Daily Mail reported [...] "a constant stream of vehicles to the ground, while the trams were disgorging their <b>freights</b> at Muntz Street every two or three minutes." [...] Inside, [...] "the swaying of the mass of spectators rendered the placing of additional supports against the barriers a necessary precaution", and children were passed overhead and deposited on the pitch for their own safety. The following Monday the same newspaper commented that had space been available, another ten or fifteen thousand spectators might well have attended, as [...] "hundreds of people found the doors closed against them, and probably there were thousands who would not go to the ground in view of the inevitable crush." [...] The size of the crowd preferring to attend the same day's Birmingham & District League match between the two clubs' reserve teams at Villa Park – at least 3,000 spectators – lent support to that view.|$|E
500|$|After {{modification}} by Maunsell, the S15 {{class was}} regarded by locomotive crews as an excellent goods engine {{best known for}} working heavy night express goods trains between Exeter, Southampton and Nine Elms. The S15s were also very capable passenger engines, being able to deputise in situations {{where there was a}} shortage of passenger locomotives during peak holiday periods. Both Urie and Maunsell S15s spent most of their working lives on the Southern Railway's Western section, although they were sometimes used on inter-regional <b>freights.</b> In order to increase maintenance efficiency, all Urie S15 locomotives (which had the lower boiler pressure) were concentrated at the Southern Railway's London freight depot at Feltham. This yard also featured the Maunsell S15s, which were allocated to Exmouth Junction, Hither Green and Salisbury, demonstrating the [...] "go anywhere" [...] nature of the class. Despite the design being only a year newer, the S15s outlasted their N15 King Arthur class counterparts because of their dual freight/passenger abilities, though they were retired between 1962 and 1966 as part of the British Railways Modernisation Plan. Maunsell S15 number 30837 became the final member of the class in operation, returning to Feltham in January 1966 to work a farewell rail tour.|$|E
500|$|Following the merger, the Ma and Pa {{operated}} through passenger and freight trains between York and Baltimore, as well {{as local}} trains {{at each end of the}} line, hauling mail and express, slate, marble, anthracite coal, lumber, furniture, and agricultural products to market. Particularly on the Pennsylvania Division (DeltaYork), slate from Delta and manufactured goods from Red Lion and York were mainstays of the railroad's outbound freight traffic in the early years. On the Maryland Division, inbound anthracite coal deliveries accounted for a significant volume of carloadings, along with milk from the many dairy farms in the area. One early morning train from Fallston boarded more than 1,100gallons of milk daily and was dubbed the [...] "Milky Way". The line was profitable and traffic volume was such that additional locomotives were necessary. The Ma and Pa acquired two 0-6-0 Baldwin switchers in 1913, #29 and #30 (pictured), called [...] "jewels of engines, in some respects the most attractive the road had", by writer George Hilton in The Ma & Pa [...] A History of the Maryland & Pennsylvania Railroad. The next year, three 2-8-0 [...] "Consolidations" [...] by Baldwin were added to the roster, providing more powerful locomotives for the BaltimoreYork through <b>freights.</b> At its peak, the railroad had 16locomotives and 160pieces of rolling stock, with 573employees.|$|E
