40|$|Abstract. During {{the full}} {{cycle of the}} {{emergency}} management, Civil Pro-tection operative procedures involve many actors belonging to several insti-tutions (civil protection agencies, public administrations, research centers, etc.) playing different roles (decision-makers, data and service providers, <b>emergency</b> <b>squads,</b> etc.). In this context the sharing of information is a vital requirement to make correct and effective decisions. Therefore a European-wide technological infrastructure providing a distributed and coordinated access to different kinds of resources (data, information, services, exper-tise, etc.) could enhance existing Civil Protection applications and even enable new ones. Such European Civil Protection e-Infrastructure should be designed and implemented {{taking into account the}} specific requirements of Civil Protection applications and the state-of-the-art in the scientific and technological disciplines which could make the emergency manage-ment more effective. In the last years Grid technologies have reached a mature state provid...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{surveys the}} {{performance}} of a rescue worker by cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a rescue team (<b>squad)</b> of <b>emergency</b> care. This care is provided by several kinds of squads ? by ALS (Advanced life support vehicles) ? large ambulance vehicles comprising a paramedic and a driver/rescue person), by RRV (Rapid response vehicles) ambulance carrying a physician, and also by the rendezvous system, where a physician works together with an ALS crew in situations when a patient's life or health is in serious danger. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with education and competences and powers of a medical rescue worker. Anatomic-physiological information on the heart, the respiratory system and the central nervous system follow. At the same time, the personnel of the medical rescue are explained and the emergency medical stations (bases) in Southern Bohemia are mentioned. Further on, the procedure during basic and extended cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the handling of external defibrillator are described. Then, the practical part follows. Its objective is to survey the competences of a rescue worker in the above mentioned <b>emergency</b> <b>squads</b> and the procedure by the cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The survey had the form of a questionnaire and 100 rescue workers from Southern Bohemia responded to 13 questions related to the cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The gathered results brought the answer to the third hypothesis. The geographical dislocation of emergency medical service stations of Southern Bohemia and the table of the stations of Emergency Medical Services of Southern Bohemia ? types of <b>emergency</b> rescue <b>squads</b> and their composition according to the type are enclosed in the appendix...|$|R
