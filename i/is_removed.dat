5|$|After {{the cloth}} is dry, the resist <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> by boiling or {{scraping}} the cloth. The areas treated with resist keep their original colour; when the resist <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> {{the contrast between}} the dyed and undyed areas forms the pattern. This process is repeated as many times as the number of colours desired.|$|E

50|$|Smaller cysts may <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by laser treatment, larger cysts {{will have}} to <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> surgically in an {{operating}} room.|$|R
5|$|Reversible pulpitis is {{characterized}} by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus <b>is</b> <b>removed,</b> such as when dental decay <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> and a filling placed, or because new layers of dentin (tertiary dentin) have been produced inside the pulp chamber, insulating against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response to cold.|$|E
5|$|Uncoating happens {{inside the}} cell when the viral capsid <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> and {{destroyed}} by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash table. With this strategy, it may become necessary to clean the flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key–value pairs once too large a fraction of the array becomes occupied by deleted keys.|$|E
50|$|According to {{footnote}} 3 of the case, {{the first}} nine titles above <b>were</b> <b>removed</b> from shelves of the High School library; A Reader for Writers <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> from the Junior High School library; and The Fixer <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> from the curriculum of a 12th-grade literature course.|$|R
50|$|YaST used {{to include}} SaX and SaX2, the Suse Advanced X configuration. SaX was re-written as SaX2 in SuSE Linux 6.4.

50|$|Appointees to the Order of Canada {{can have}} their {{membership}} revoked if the order's advisory council determines a member's actions have brought dishonour to the order. As of 2016, seven people have <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> from the Order of Canada: Alan Eagleson, David Ahenakew, T. Sher Singh, Steve Fonyo, Garth Drabinsky, Conrad Black, and Ranjit Chandra. Eagleson <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> from the order after being jailed for fraud in 1998; Ahenakew <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> in 2005, after being convicted of promoting anti-Semitic hatred in 2002; Singh <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> after the revocation of his law licence for professional misconduct; Fonyo <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> due to numerous criminal convictions; Drabinky <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> in 2012 after being found guilty of fraud and forgery in Ontario; and Chandra <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> in 2015 for committing research fraud. The formal removal process is performed by the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada, though it can be initiated by any citizen of Canada.|$|R
5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} the air by flights from an open perch. The stinger <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure is applied to the insect, thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> from storage.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the appearance and distribution of the rash, specific medical signs may be used by medical practitioners to assist with diagnosis. These may include Auspitz's sign (pinpoint bleeding when scale <b>is</b> <b>removed),</b> Koebner phenomenon (psoriatic skin lesions induced by trauma to the skin), and itching and pain localized to papules and plaques.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, Veronica helps a student, Meryl (Amanda Walsh) locate {{her missing}} boyfriend. Meanwhile, with Mercer (Ryan Devlin) imprisoned for the campus rapes, Veronica {{tries to find}} the truth. This {{investigation}} leads to an instance in which Veronica is drugged {{and a part of}} her hair <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> by a mysterious figure. In addition, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) questions the morality of his relationship with Harmony (Laura San Giacomo), leading to their breakup.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube <b>is</b> <b>removed,</b> the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E
5|$|Protandry is when an {{individual}} starts out male and becomes female while the reverse condition is known as protogyny, the latter being more common. Changing sex can occur in various contexts. In the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, where males have harems of up to ten females, if the male <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> {{the largest and most}} dominant female develops male-like behaviour and eventually testes. If she <b>is</b> <b>removed,</b> the next ranking female takes her place. In the species Anthias squamipinnis, where individuals gather into large groups and females greatly outnumber males, if a certain number of males are removed from a group, the same number of females change sex and replace them. In clownfish, individuals live in groups and only the two largest in a group breed: the largest female and the largest male. If the female dies, the male switches sexes and the next largest male takes his place.|$|E

5|$|Revision 1.2 of the {{specification}} {{was released}} in 2010. Several changes are made and limits are increased including allowing 1.5A on charging downstream ports for unconfigured devices, allowing High Speed communication while having a current up to 1.5A, and allowing a maximum current of 5A. Also, support <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> for charging port detection via resistive mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Soft tissue reflection: An {{incision}} is {{made over}} the crest of bone, splitting the thicker attached gingiva roughly in half so that the final implant will have a thick band of tissue around it. The edges of tissue, each {{referred to as a}} flap are pushed back to expose the bone. Flapless surgery is an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the implant) <b>is</b> <b>removed</b> for implant placement rather than raising flaps.|$|E
5|$|Temnothorax unifasciatus, a myrmicinid ant, {{has been}} shown not to have {{collective}} worker policing. However, when a queen <b>is</b> <b>removed,</b> a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions in egg laying are created by dominance hierarchies. Individuals do not act in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs and reducing the contributions of opponents.|$|E
50|$|The {{promenade}} deck and rear chapel may have <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> {{from the house}} during Hugh Grant's occupation. It is thought that the {{promenade deck}} <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> as it had deteriorated significantly while the chapel <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> and relocated into town where it was adapted to a private residence.|$|R
50|$|On 6 October 2008 Smooth Radio <b>was</b> <b>removed</b> {{from the}} MXR Wales and West {{multiplex}} {{to allow for}} the relaunch of Jazz FM.
