5|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following {{the announcement of the}} matchup, ticket sales diverged. By December 12, Cincinnati sold about 9,000 tickets. This total increased to approximately 13,000 tickets by December 20, and the school prepared multiple tour buses for a student convoy to the game. At Virginia Tech, meanwhile, sales lagged. In an effort to spur sales, Tech administrators had head football coach Frank Beamer star in a video asking Hokies fans to buy tickets to the game. Owing to limited demand for tickets, prices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> market plunged.|$|E

The lawsuit claimed that UBS misrepresented the quality of mortgages sold to the two housing agencies for US$4.5 billion.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of this failure, D. Luis de Haro, invaded Portugal and besieged Elvas, the main defensive system of Portugal - where the Portuguese army that had besieged Badajoz took refuge and was suffering a second catastrophic plague. A small relief army was improvised by the Portuguese which inflicted a crushing defeat to the Spanish army at the decisive battle of the Lines of Elvas (14 January 1659). This way, the Portuguese independence was granted while the Spanish reached military advantage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> front of war, Minho and Galicia.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary.</b> Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E

5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. He plays with their senses {{as they try}} to flee through the corridors, and then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift TARDIS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> control room, which atomises Nephew. House deletes the secondary control room as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room, where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she {{will not be able to}} speak to the Doctor again but will be there for him. Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Kunis {{auditioned for}} but failed to get {{the role of a}} Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly. Instead, she was cast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were {{required}} to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. That '70s Show ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.|$|E
5|$|Chicago's defense {{allowed the}} 5th least total yardage, allowed less than 100yards per {{game on the}} ground, and allowed the fewest yards per drive of any NFL team. The line was {{anchored}} by Adewale Ogunleye, who had 6.5 sacks, and Pro Bowler Tommie Harris, who recorded 5, along with rookie Mark Anderson, who led the team with 12 sacks. Behind them, {{two of the three}} Bears starting linebackers, Lance Briggs, and Brian Urlacher, were selected to the 2007 Pro Bowl. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary,</b> cornerbacks Ricky Manning and Charles Tillman each recorded five interceptions.

5|$|Consisting of two quasars with a {{separation}} of less than 5 arcseconds, the quasar pair 4C 11.50 {{is one of the}} visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although it does have a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and {{are in the process of}} merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} this fact, ticket sales were slow. By December 23, Tech had sold just 6,500 of its 17,500-seat allotment, while Stanford fans had {{purchased}} 9,000 tickets from their allotment. These figures increased slightly as the game day approached, but the schools were hampered by several factors. The tickets assigned to the schools were in less-desirable seats, and many seats were available far more cheaply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> market. In one example, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a similar ticket was available for $12 through an online ticket seller. The two schools were forced to purchase the remaining unsold tickets, costing each several hundred thousand dollars.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1986 {{season the}} Browns lost {{standout}} safety and former defensive {{rookie of the}} year Don Rogers. Rogers died of a cocaine overdose leaving the team without one of its best defenders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> for the 1986 season. Despite the tumultuous off season, 1986 marked Cleveland's entry into the ranks of the NFL's elite as Kosar's play improved and the defensive unit came together. Kosar threw for 3,854yards to a corps of receivers that included Brian Brennan, Newsome and rookie Webster Slaughter. On defense, cornerbacks Frank Minnifield and Hanford Dixon {{emerged as one of the}} NFL's premiere pass-defending duos. After a slow start, the Browns rose to the top of the divisional standings, twice beating the Pittsburgh Steelers and ending a 16-game losing streak at Three Rivers Stadium. A 12–4 record earned Cleveland home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|The Ministry of National Education is {{responsible}} for pre-tertiary education. This is compulsory and lasts twelve years: four years each of primary school, {{middle school and high}} school. Less than half of 25- to 34-year-old Turks have completed at least high school, compared with an OECD average of over 80 percent. Basic education in Turkey is considered to lag behind other OECD countries, with significant differences between high and low performers. Turkey is ranked 32nd out of 34 in the OECD's PISA study. Access to high-quality school heavily depends on the performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> school entrance exams, to the point that some students begin taking private tutoring classes when they are 10 years old.

5|$|Bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> burial were {{arranged}} without respect for anatomical order; {{it is plausible}} {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to the secondary burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E
