5|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} is {{a method}} by which diamond can be grown from a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gas</b> mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method {{has been the subject}} of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.|$|E

30|$|Vapor {{extraction}} (VAPEX) {{has been}} proposed as an alternative for heavy-oil recovery in reservoirs where thermal methods face technical and economic problems. In VAPEX, a pair of horizontal injector-producer wells is employed. The gaseous hydrocarbon solvent (normally propane or a mixture of methane–propane or propane–butane) is injected from the top well and the diluted oil drains downward by gravity to the bottom producer. Recently, the idea of incorporation of CO 2 into the gaseous hydrocarbon mixture has emerged. Incorporation of CO 2 is believed to make the process more economical and environmentally and technically attractive. CO 2 is cheaper than the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases</b> and has higher solubility into the heavy oil {{than most of the}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases.</b> It also adds value to the environmental side of the process as CO 2 can be sequestered while improving the VAPEX performance at the same time. Moreover, the addition of CO 2 to the injected gas increases the dew point of the solvent mixture, and solvent mixtures with higher dew point can be used in heavy-oil reservoirs with higher pressure in which the mixture of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases</b> may partly condense, which decreases the VAPEX efficacy. Thus, the advantage of incorporating CO 2 into the injected solvent is threefold. The objective of this work, therefore, is to simulate the performance of the VAPEX process when different solvent mixtures, including <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases</b> and CO 2, are incorporated with the aim of improving its performance. The design and the major results of the simulation for the CO 2 -based VAPEX process are discussed.|$|R

40|$|The Khibiny Complex hosts a {{wide variety}} of carbon-bearing species that include both {{oxidized}} and reduced varieties. Oxidised varieties include carbonate minerals, especially in the carbonatite complex at the eastern end of the pluton, and Na-carbonate phases. Reduced varieties include abiogenic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gases,</b> particularly methane and ethane, dispersed bitumens, solid organic substances and graphite. The majority of the carbon in the Khibiny Complex is hosted in either the carbonatite complex or within the so-called “Central Arch”. The Central Arch is a ring-shaped structure which separates khibinites (coarse-grained eudialite-bearing nepheline syenites) in the outer part of the complex from lyavochorrites (medium-grained nepheline syenites) and foyaites in the inner part. The Central Arch is petrologically diverse and hosts the major REE-enriched apatite-nepheline deposits for which the complex is best known.
