50|$|Albacore tuna are pelagic predators - open-sea hunters. Their diets vary {{very little}} from season to season. Unlike other tuna that eat {{primarily}} fish, {{for example the}} bigeye and yellowfin tuna, the albacore's main source of food is cephalopods. The most abundant cephalopod in its diet is Heteroteuthis dispar, a tiny deep-water squid found in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Other food sources of the albacore include fish, crustaceans, and gelatinous organisms. Not much {{is known about the}} <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> of the albacore, however, mostly because it dives over 400 m underwater when searching for food, and tagging and tracking has been unsuccessful thus far.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} a vegetable-rich <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> and obesity among Chinese adults. Design: A <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> rich in vegetables is associated with lower risk of obesity and non-communicable chronic disease in Western countries. A similar <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is found in the}} Chinese population but the cooking method is different. A crosssectional household survey of 2849 men and women aged 20 years and over was undertaken in 2002 in Jiangsu Province (response rate, 89. 0 %). Food intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Factor analysis was used to identify food patterns. Nutrient intake was measured by food weighing plus consecutive individual 3 -day food records. Height, weight and waist circumference were measured. Results: The prevalence of general obesity (BMI ≽ 28 kgm⁻²) was 8. 0 % in men and 12. 7 % in women, central obesity was 19. 5 % (≽ 90 cm) and 38. 2 % (≽ 80 cm), respectively. A four-factor solution explained 28. 5 % of the total variance in food frequency intake. The vegetable-rich <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> (whole grains, fruits and vegetables) was positively associated with vegetable oil and energy intake. Prevalence of obesity/central obesity increased across the quartiles of vegetable-rich <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and four distinct food patterns, the vegetable-rich pattern was independently associated with obesity. Compared with the lowest quartile of vegetable-rich pattern, the highest quartile had higher risk of general obesity (men, prevalence ratio (PR) : 1. 82, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 05 – 3. 14; women, PR: 2. 25, 95 % CI: 1. 45 – 3. 49). Conclusion: The vegetable-rich <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> was associated with higher risk of obesity/central obesity in Chinese adults in both genders. This association can be linked to the high intake of energy due to generous use of oil for stir-frying the vegetables...|$|E

Baseline examinations included an interview-administered diet history, a self-administered questionnaire, blood pressure and anthropologic measurements, and blood samples donated after an overnight fast. Cluster analysis identified six <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> for which 43 food group variables were used. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the risk of each component (hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and central obesity) and <b>food</b> <b>patterns,</b> controlling for potential confounders. The study demonstrated relations, independent of specific nutrients, between <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> and hyperglycemia and central obesity in men and hyperinsulinemia in women. <b>Food</b> <b>patterns</b> dominated by fiber bread provided favorable effects, while <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> high in refined bread or in cheese, cake, and alcoholic beverages contributed adverse effects.

40|$|Knowledge of {{specific}} <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> {{of elderly people}} is important for relating diet to nutritional status and disease and for the identification of groups at risk of under- or over-consumption {{of specific}} nutrients. The standardised methodology employed in the SENECA surveys (Survey in Europe on Nutrition and the Elderly a Concerted Action) provided {{a unique opportunity to}} study cross-cultural differences in nutritional issues and lifestyle factors affecting health and performance of elderly people in Europe. This thesis explores <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> in elderly Europeans and their impact on health. For the evaluation of the nutrient quality and the healthfulness of <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> in elderly Europeans two approaches were applied: The Nutrient Adequacy Ratio, and a diet score, based on eight dietary components with a likely protective function for a number of chronic diseases. For a better insight in <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> in addition to a conventional description, cluster analysis was employed. Food intake data from 1221 dietary histories recoded by the Eurocode system was used to identify specific <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> within each of the SENECA towns. On the pooled level <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> across centres emerged. <b>Food</b> <b>patterns</b> varied between and within European settings and the two types of variation appeared to be of the same magnitude. <b>Food</b> <b>patterns</b> were stable with age in 245 women from the Danish, Dutch, Swiss and Spanish SENECA towns. Minor changes attributable to period were, however, found. Also, foods contributing to the intake of specific nutrients were found to vary between SENECA towns. In addition to food choice, food handling affected the actual nutrient intake, and should, therefore, be considered in the nutritional evaluation of elderly people. Weight loss showed to be an indicator of poor health in Danish (n = 115) and Dutch (n = 12 1) elderly people, but energy intake as an intermediary factor could not be proven in this study. Nevertheless, a further analysis of the Danish data showed that, both quantity and quality of food intake matter in the prevention of disability in 115 elderly Danes. In conclusion, this thesis underlines the importance of <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> of elderly people today for their ability to perform activities of daily living tomorrow. Inadequate nutrient intake appeared to result from a combination of low energy intake and unfavourable <b>food</b> <b>patterns.</b> Vulnerable groups of elderly people may gain from stimulation of physical activity and recommendations on nutritious foods...|$|R

Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study food intake of 973 people (736 women) were gathered by Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ 208 food items). These food items were stratified to 40 food groups and using factor analysis were analyzed by SPSS software. Res‌ults: Factor analysis determined 3 major food patterns: healthy dietary pattern (HDP) (high in poultry, low fat dairy products, high fat dairy products, cruciferous vegetables, yellow vegetables, green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, whole grains, fish, olives, and fruits) western dietary patterns (WDP) (high in meat, processed meat, organ meats, margarine, condiments, sweets and desserts, soft drinks, dried fruits, snacks) traditional dietary patterns (TDP) (high in eggs, tea, fruit juices, refined grains, nuts, pickles, hydrogenated fats, sugars, salt, spices).

Methods: A population-based study of 454 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years was included. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary patterns and three dietary patterns were identified based on the principal component analysis method. Results: Malay adolescents had significantly higher scores for the Western-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> and local-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern,</b> whereas Chinese adolescents showed higher scores for the healthy-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> Multivariate analyses show that age and physical activity (PA) levels were positively associated with healthy-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> in Malay (All, p < 0. 001), whereas higher consumption of eating-out from home (EatOut) (p = 0. 014) and fast food (p = 0. 041) were negatively associated. High weekly breakfast skipping (p < 0. 001) and EatOut (p = 0. 003) were positively associated with a Western-based pattern, whereas age (p < 0. 001) and household income (p = 0. 005) were negatively associated. Higher frequency of daily snacking (p = 0. 013) was positively associated with local-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> For Chinese adolescents, age (p < 0. 001), PA levels (p < 0. 001) and maternal education level (p = 0. 035) showed positive associations with the healthy-based pattern, whereas high EatOut (p = 0. 001) and fast food intakes (p = 0. 001) were negatively associated. Higher weekly consumption of EatOut (p = 0. 007), fast food (p = 0. 023) and carbonated beverages (p = 0. 023), and daily snacking practice (p = 0. 004) were positively associated with higher Western-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern,</b> whereas age (p = 0. 004) was inversely associated. Conclusion: This study showed that there were significant differences in dietary patterns and its association factors between Malay and Chinese adolescents. More importantly, these findings suggest that unhealthy dietary and lifestyle practices could increase the risk of adherence to unhealthy Western-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> that is high in fat, sugar and salt contents, and, consequently, increase the risk of developing obesity and metabolic-related disorders during these critical years of growth...|$|E
40|$|Background: Inadequate {{energy and}} {{nutrient}} intakes {{are a major}} nutritional problem in developing countries. A recent study in Beninese school-aged children in different seasons revealed a high prevalence of stunting and poor iron status that {{might be related to}} the <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> Objective: To analyse the <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> and resulting energy and nutrient intakes of rural Beninese school-aged children in relation to season and school attendance. Subjects and methods: The study was performed in northern Benin in eighty randomly selected children aged 6 ¿ 8 years. Dietary intake was assessed using observed weighed records. Food, energy and nutrient intakes were measured in post- and pre-harvest seasons. Complete food consumption data sets were available for seventy-five children. Results: <b>Food</b> <b>pattern</b> showed seasonal variations. Cereals, roots and tubers were the main staple foods. Contributions of animal products to the diet were very small. The <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> was not different for either boys v. girls or for children attending v. not attending school. Median daily energy intakes were 5 ? 0 and 5 ? 3 MJ in the post- and pre-harvest season, respectively. Only fat and vitamin C showed seasonal differences (P, 0 ? 05). Energy and nutrient intakes were different for boys and girls but, unexpectedly, not for children attending v. not attending school. Conclusions: Seasonal variations in <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> did not result in seasonality in energy and nutrient intakes.

Increasing evidence confirms that breastfeeding protects against overweight and obesity. However, {{little is known about the}} mechanism underlying the association between breastfeeding and obesity. One possibility is that breastfed infants are better able to control their meal size and intervals than formula-fed infants. This might lead to a healthier diet in later life and protect against overweight and obesity. Objective: To determine the relationship between breastfeeding, <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> and being overweight in the Caribbean. Methods: In a cross-sectional school-based study in 2004 - 2005, weight and height were measured by two research assistants in 1776 children aged 6 - 11 years on Aruba, an island in the Caribbean. BMI was defined according to guidelines by the International Obesity Task Force. Parents completed a questionnaire pertaining to breastfeeding and dietary <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> Results: 1451 / 1776 (81. 7 %) children were breastfed; 851 / 1766 (47. 9 %) children were breastfed for < 4 months, 227 / 1776 (12. 8 %) for 4 - 6 months and 373 / 1776 (21. 0 %) for ≧ 6 months. Children who were breastfed for ≥ 4 months had lower odds (OR 0. 32, 95 %CI 0. 25 - 0. 40) of being overweight including obesity than those who either were not breastfed or who were breastfed for < 4 months. Children who were breastfed for ≥ 4 months were more likely to have a structured <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> of six eating moments a day (OR 7. 43, 95 % CI 5. 87 - 9. 39, P< 0. 001) and to have breakfast every day (OR 2. 86, 95 % CI 2. 17 - 3. 78, P< 0. 001) than those who were not or who were breastfed for < 4 months.

40|$|This {{community-based}} participatory {{study examines}} how campesinos (small rural landholders) understand and act upon their understandings regarding their <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> {{change in the}} context of a transnational family life and fiscal remittances. It examines <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> negotiation using in-depth interviews, focus groups, filmic ethnography, participant observation and <b>Food</b> <b>Pattern</b> Analysis with rural small landholders from two communities in northern Guanajuato, México. Rural <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> shift between pre-migration and current times are explained according to the broader economic frame of rural livelihoods, the local social context, as well as through the particularities of individual's consumption. As of the 1980 's newer fluid income-based livelihoods including remittances, formal employment and cash transfers coincide with campesino's increasing access to and interaction with the commercial food system. In terms of change particularities between pre-migration and current times, it is evidenced by consumption frequency changes of key foods, the manner in which dishes are served and eaten, the freshness of the staple ingredient/s used, and the resulting <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> diversity. Food shifts are shown to ebb and flow through time and are not linear and rigid. In regard to the question of how campesinos negotiate their food patterns in rural spaces, campesino's explanations of their consumption commonly refer to three motivating factors; these include taste preference, social returns motivation, and newer notions of time and convenience. These mechanisms taken together inform the notion that fluid income through remittances, implies not only benefits among the rural sector but costs as well. For example, while remittances enhance women's and children's agency related to their food activities and negotiation of social relations, they also support enhanced access to commercial foods, and often to highly processed foods that are high in sugar, salt and fat; they also reduce rural family production capacity as a result from displaced labor. Taken together, remittances may imply an exposed risk to nutrition-related disease and potential food insecurity. Furthermore, remittances are known to foster a sense to attain an elevated standard of living which supports an "need" to consume status foods, while also encouraging the avoidance of stigmatized regional foods. However, there is no evidence to suggest that campesinos intend to permanently sever their food production capacity; a majority of respondents still produce food...|$|E

A list of consumed food and usual serving sizes was compiled from previous local survey, using single 24 hours dietary recalls and frequency questionnaires. The list was composed of 127 items and the nutrient composition was calculated by the computer program DietPro version 3. 0. The FFQ was administered to each subject twice {{in a period of}} six months. To characterize <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> consumption, the most frequently mentioned foods were identified. One hundred and four (104) workers were studied, randomly selected. Items consumed {{at least once a day}} by 50 % of the workers were: white bread, margarine, black coffee, white sugar, red beans and white rice. Variety of daily consumed foods was small.

40|$|Abstract Resource {{distribution}} {{can vary}} greatly {{in space and}} time. Consequently, ani-mals should adjust their searching tactics to such spatio–temporal patterns {{in accordance with their}} innate capabilities, or alternatively, they should use a genetically fixed searching tactic that has been evolved in response to the specific pattern of the food they experience. Using a simulation model and a genetic algorithm, we show how optimal searching tactics change as a function of food spatial pattern. Searching tactics for hidden prey can be approximated using the following three components: (1) Extensive search mode (ESM), the type of movement before encountering a food item; (2) Intensive search mode (ISM), the type of movement after encountering a food item; and (3) ISM duration. Both ESM and ISM are characterized by movement tortuosity. We show that searching behavior adap-tively changes as a function of <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> When food is distributed in a regular pattern, ISM is more directional than ESM, but under a clumped <b>food</b> <b>pattern,</b> ISM is much more tortuous than ESM.

Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between a wide range of possible family and child indicators and adherence to dietary patterns for infants aged 9 months. Design: The two dietary patterns ‘Family Food’ and ‘Health-Conscious Food’ were displayed by principal component analysis, and associations with possible indicators were analysed by multiple linear regressions in a pooled sample (n= 374) of two comparable observational cohorts, SKOT I and SKOT II. These cohorts comprised infants with mainly non-obese mothers versus infants with obese mothers, respectively. Results: A lower Family Food score indicates a higher intake of liquid baby food, as this pattern shows transition from baby food towards the family's food. Infants, who were younger at diet registration and had higher body mass index (BMI) z-scores at 9 months, had lower Family <b>Food</b> <b>pattern</b> scores. A lower Family <b>Food</b> <b>pattern</b> score was also observed for infants with immigrant/descendant parents, parents who shared cooking responsibilities and fathers in the labour market compared to being a student, A lower Health-Conscious <b>Food</b> <b>pattern</b> score indicates a less healthy diet. A lower infant Health-Conscious <b>Food</b> <b>pattern</b> score was associated with a higher maternal BMI, a greater number of children in the household, a higher BMI z-score at 9 months, and a higher infant age at diet registration. Conclusions: Associations between infant dietary patterns and maternal, paternal, household, and child characteristics were identified. This may improve the possibility of identifying infants with an increased risk of developing unfavourable dietary patterns and potentially enable an early targeted preventive support...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the reproducibility and validity of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was developed to assess the overall dietary consumption via dietary pattern method in a rural population in southwest China. A total of 179 participants aged between 40 and 70 years old were included in this study. Participants administered FFQ at baseline (FFQ 1) and one year later (FFQ 2) to assess the reproducibility. Six 3 -day 24 -hour recalls (24 HRs) were completed between the administrations of two FFQs to determine the validity. Dietary patterns from three separate dietary sources were derived by using principle component factor analysis. Comparisons between dietary pattern scores were made by using Pearson or intraclass correlation coefficient, cross-classification analysis, weighted kappa (κ) statistic and Bland-Altman analysis. The de-attenuated method was adopted to correct the monthly and seasonally variation and the partial correlation analysis was used correct the influence by total energy intake. Two major dietary factors, labeled as prudent pattern and processed <b>food</b> <b>pattern,</b> were identified. The prudent pattern was characterized by higher factor loadings of wheat, rice, fresh vegetables, bean products, nuts, red meat, white meat and fresh eggs; and the processed <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> was characterized by higher factor loadings of pickled vegetables, preserved vegetables and salted meat. Between Two FFQs, intraclass correlation coefficients were 0. 57 for prudent pattern and 0. 55 for processed <b>food</b> <b>pattern,</b> partial Pearson correlation coefficients were 0. 51 for the prudent pattern and 0. 56 for the processed food pattern; weighted κ statistic ranged from 0. 45 (for the prudent pattern) to 0. 56 (for the processed <b>food</b> <b>pattern).</b> Between FFQs and 24 HRs, de-attenuated correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 54 to 0. 78 for the prudent pattern and from 0. 55 to 0. 61 for the processed food pattern; partial Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 41 to 0. 56 for the prudent pattern and from 0. 42 to 0. 44 for the processed food pattern; weighted κ statistic ranged from 0. 42 to 0. 46 for prudent pattern and from 0. 43 to 0. 60 for processed <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> The Bland-Altman plots and limits of agreement indicated that the deviation/divergence was not obvious for both of the patterns between FFQ 1 and FFQ 2 and between FFQs and 24 HRs. The study suggests that the FFQ is reasonably reproducible and valid to assess the overall dietary consumption via dietary pattern methods in the Chinese rural population...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Morbidity and {{mortality}} data highlight prostate cancer {{as the most}} commonly diagnosed neoplasm in Jamaican males. This report examines the association between dietary patterns and risk of prostate cancer in Jamaican men. Materials and methods Case-control study of 204 histologically confirmed newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases and 204 individually matched urology clinic controls in Jamaica, 2004 – 2007. Diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Results Factor analysis yielded four dietary patterns: (i) a "healthy" pattern of vegetables, fruits and peas and beans, (ii) a "carbohydrate" pattern with high loadings for white bread and refined cereals, (iii) "sugary foods and sweet baked products" pattern and (iv) a "organ meat and fast food pattern" with high loadings for high fat dessert, organ meat, fast food and salty snacks. Logistic regressions with the individual dietary patterns controlling for potential confounders showed no association between any of the <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> and risk of prostate cancer. The healthy pattern showed an inverse non-significant association, whereas the carbohydrate pattern was positively and insignificantly related to prostate cancer. Analysis of all <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> adjusting for each other revealed no association between <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> {{and the risk of}} prostate cancer. Conclusion Dietary patterns identified in our sample were not associated with risk of prostate cancer. Further investigations that better define cancer-free subjects and dietary measurements are needed to examine diet and prostate cancer outcomes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Food {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{ingredients}} for survival of any culture or race. It provides the essentials as well as supporting nutrients for growth, maintenance, protection and cure against disease and deficiency conditions. The <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> and nutrient intake reflect the nutritional status. There is variation in the dietary pattern of the tribes living in different isolated regions. The tribal people generally consume foodstuff available in and around their habitat. A large number of tribes depend on their own pattern of agriculture for producing rice or other cereals and some green leafy vegetables. People of different tribes constitute a distinct category with their ethnicity and culture differences. Nutritional status largely depends on the <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> of the community which are influenced by social customs, beliefs, superstition, religion, cultural behavior, changes in living environment, Mass communication and Socio-economic status of the family...|$|E
