25|$|The West adopted {{many of the}} Byzantine {{iconographic}} elements, but {{preferred the}} stable rather than the cave, though Duccio's Byzantine-influenced Maestà version tries to have both. The midwives gradually dropped out from Western depictions, as Latin theologians disapproved of these legends; sometimes the bath remains, either being got ready or with Mary bathing Jesus. The midwives are still seen where Byzantine influence is strong, especially in Italy; as in Giotto, one may hand Jesus over to his mother. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.|$|E
60|$|His voice sank {{almost to}} a whisper, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} nervously.|$|R
60|$|She did not answer. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} again. His lordship had disappeared.|$|R

2500|$|The image {{may be a}} relief, or free-standing, {{and side}} details may be present or omitted. [...] The centre-piece is Mithras clothed in Anatolian costume and wearing a Phrygian cap; who is {{kneeling}} on the exhausted [...] bull, holding it by the nostrils [...] with his left hand, and stabbing it with his right. As he does so, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder towards the figure of Sol. A dog and a snake reach up towards the blood. A scorpion seizes the bull's genitals. A raven is flying around or {{is sitting on the}} bull. Three ears of wheat are seen coming out from the bull's tail, sometimes from the wound. The bull was often white. The god is sitting on the bull in an unnatural way with his right leg constraining the bull's hoof and the left leg is bent and resting on the bull's back or flank. The two torch-bearers are on either side, dressed like Mithras, Cautes with his torch pointing up and Cautopates with his torch pointing down. Sometimes Cautes and Cautopates carry shepherds' crooks instead of torches.|$|E
60|$|Sam {{thought as}} 'ow the whiskey 'ad got to Mr. Goodman's 'ead at last. 'Owever, to pacify 'im {{he promised to}} do wot 'e was told, and next morning, when they was all at breakfast, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> and catches Mr. Goodman's eye.|$|E
6000|$|... [A gentleman {{walking on}} the common comes into sight from behind the cottage. He is hardly past middle age, with {{something}} of the artist about him, unconventionally but carefully dressed, and clean-shaven except for a moustache, with an eager susceptible face and very amiable and considerate manners. He has silky black hair, with waves of grey and white in it. His eyebrows are white, his moustache black. He seems not certain of his way. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> the palings; takes stock of the place; and sees the young lady.] ...|$|E
60|$|Heneage took no more {{notice of}} him {{than he would}} of a yapping terrier. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his head into Wrayson's eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder. The road ran {{straight}} {{for over a}} half-mile behind them, and not a living thing showed upon it.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Do not fear,' {{said the}} girl, 'for {{if we know}} {{not the way we}} know one that knows it: Atlas is his name--the Giant of the Mountain. He dwells on the highest peak of the snow-crested hill, and it is he who holds up the heavens, and keeps heaven and earth asunder. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> all the world, and over the wide western sea: him we must ask to answer your question. Take off your shield, which is so heavy, and sit down with us among the flowers, and let us think how you may slay the Gorgon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Under this provocation, Mr. Smallweed's {{favourite}} adjective of disparagement is {{so close}} to his tongue that he begins the words [...] "my dear friend" [...] with the monosyllable [...] "brim," [...] thus converting the possessive pronoun into brimmy and appearing to have an impediment in his speech. Once past this difficulty, however, he exhorts his dear friend in the tenderest manner not to be rash, but to do what so eminent a gentleman requires, and to do it with a good grace, confident that it must be unobjectionable as well as profitable. Mr. Tulkinghorn merely utters an occasional sentence, as, [...] "You are the best judge of your own interest, sergeant." [...] "Take care you do no harm by this." [...] "Please yourself, please yourself." [...] "If you know what you mean, that's quite enough." [...] These he utters with an appearance of perfect indifference as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> the papers on his table and prepares to write a letter.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{course the}} {{intention}} of this book is not to induce {{people to go to}} Spain: railway journeys are long and tedious, the trains crawl, and the hotels are bad. Experienced globe-trotters have told me that all mountains are very much alike, and that pictures, when you have seen a great many, offer no vast difference. It is much better to read books of travel than to travel oneself; he really enjoys foreign lands who never goes abroad; and the man who stays at home, preserving his illusions, has certainly the best of it. How delightful is the anticipation as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> time-tables and books of photographs, forming delightful images of future pleasure! But the reality is full of disappointment, and the more famous the monument the bitterer the disillusion. Has any one seen St. Peter's without asking himself: Is that all? And the truest enjoyment arises from things that come unexpectedly, that one had never heard of. Then, living in a strange land, one loses all impression of its strangeness; it is only afterwards, in England, that one realises the charm and longs to return; and a hundred pictures rise to fill the mind with delight. Why can one not be strong enough to leave it at that and never tempt the fates again? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Desinit in Culicem mulier formosa supernè," [...] said Stangrave, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> Claude's shoulder; [...] "but I {{suppose he}} {{followed}} nature, and copied his model." ...|$|R

60|$|If {{this kind}} of composition, of which the two years' product is now laid before the public, fail in art, as it {{constantly}} does and must, it at least {{has the advantage of}} a certain truth and honesty, which a work more elaborate might lose. In his constant communication with the reader, the writer is forced into frankness of expression, and to speak out his own mind and feelings as they urge him. Many a slip of the pen and the printer, many a word spoken in haste, he sees and would recall as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> his volume. It is a sort of confidential talk between writer and reader, which must often be dull, must often flag. In the course of his volubility, the perpetual speaker must of necessity lay bare his own weaknesses, vanities, peculiarities. And as we judge of a man's character, after long frequenting his society, not by one speech, or by one mood or opinion, or by one day's talk, but by the tenor of his general bearing and conversation; so of a writer, who delivers himself up to you perforce unreservedly, you say, Is he honest? Does he tell the truth in the main? Does he seem actuated by a desire to find out and speak it? Is he a quack, who shams sentiment, or mouths for effect? Does he seek popularity by claptraps or other arts? I can no more ignore good fortune than any other chance which has befallen me. I have found many thousands more readers than I ever looked for. I have no right to say to these, You shall not find fault with my art, or fall asleep over my pages; but I ask you to believe that this person writing strives to tell the truth. If there is not that, there is nothing.|$|E
6000|$|Matters grew greatly {{worse when}} George paid his first Visit to Hanover in {{character}} of King, {{early in the}} Summer of 1729. Part of his road lies through Prussian Territory: [...] "Shall he have free post-horses, as his late Majesty was wont?" [...] asks the Prussian Official person. [...] "If he write to request them, yes," [...] answers Friedrich Wilhelm; [...] "if he don't write, no." [...] George does not write; pays for his post-horses;--flourishes along to Hanover, in absolute silence towards his clownish Brother-in-Law. You would say <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> the head of him, {{as if there were}} no such clown in existence;--he has never yet so much as notified his arrival. [...] "What is this? There exists no Prussia, then, for little George?" [...] Friedrich Wilhelm's inarticulate, interjectionary utterances, in clangorous metallic tone, we can fancy them, now and then; and the Tobacco-Parliament is busy! British Minister Dubourgay, steady old military gentleman, who spells imperfectly, but is intent to keep down mischief, writes at last to Hanover, submissively suggesting, [...] "Could not, as was the old wont, some notification of the King's arrival be sent hither, which would console his Prussian Majesty?" [...] To which my Lord Townshend answers, [...] "Has not been the custom, I am informed [WRONG informed, your Lordship]; not necessary in the circumstances." [...] Which is a high course between neighbors and royal gentlemen and kinsfolk. The Prussian Court hereupon likewise shuts its lips; no mention of the Hanoverian Court, not even by her Majesty and to Englishmen, for several weeks past. [Dubourgay.] Some inarticulate metallic growl, in private, at dinner or in the TABAKS-COLLEGIUM: the rest is truculent silence. Nor are our poor Hanover Recruits (according to our List of Pressed Hanoverians) in the least sent back; nor the Clamei Meadows settled; [...] "Big Meadow" [...] or [...] "Little one," [...] both of which the Brandenburgers have mown in the mean time.|$|E
60|$|But {{the case}} differs {{materially}} in the debtor {{side of the}} account; for here the tradesman, who with all his boasts of keeping his books exactly, has yet no ledger, which being, as I have said, duly posted, should show every man's account at one view; and being done every week, left it scarce possible to omit any parcel that was once entered in the day-book or journal--I say, the tradesman keeping no ledger, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> his day-book for the whole year past, to draw up the debtor side of his customer's account, and there being a great many parcels, truly he overlooks {{one or two of}} them, or suppose but one of them, and gives the chapman the account, in which he sums up his debtor side so much, suppose £136, 10s.: the chapman examining this by his book, as he did the cash, finds two parcels, one £7, 15s., and the other £9, 13s., omitted; so that by his own book his debtor side was £153, 18s.; but being a cunning sharp tradesman, and withal not exceeding honest, 'Well, well,' says he to himself, 'if Mr G. says it is no more than £136, 10s. what have I to do to contradict him? it is none of my business to keep his books for him; it is time enough for me to reckon for it when he charges me.' So he goes back to him the next day, and settles accounts with him, pays him the balance in good bills which he brought up with him for that purpose, takes a receipt in full of all accounts and demands to such a day of the month, and the next day comes and looks out another parcel of goods, and so begins an account for the next year, like a current chapman, and has the credit of an extraordinary customer that pays well, and clears his accounts every year; which he had not done had he not seen the advantage, and so strained himself to pay, that he might get a receipt in full of all accounts.|$|E
60|$|Here {{he stopped}} and laid down the newspaper. Trudaine took it from him, {{and shook his head}} forebodingly as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the {{paragraph}} which had just been read.|$|R
60|$|In the morning, when Dave got up <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{to where}} Phil {{was in the}} habit of sleeping. The bed was empty, and the shipowner's son was gone.|$|R
60|$|Then Nathan Dobb {{dropped into}} the chair beside his safe, and from the strong box took a package of documents. These <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> for nearly half an hour.|$|R
5000|$|In Aztec mythology, Chalchiuhtlatonal [...] was a god of water, {{related to}} Chalchiuhtlicue. [...] <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> the sea, and protects the animals living in it.

50|$|Some {{continuity}} {{errors are}} evident in the finished film. After Dracula is thrown from the carriage, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> to where his coffin has landed; in a close-up, part of his mustache is gone. Also, when Talbot transforms into the Wolf Man for the final time, his hands lack fur.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} morning, rumors spread about Shanta at Motilal's house, and Seth adds fuel to fire. Villagers humiliate Motilal {{before he}} can defend himself. Saddened {{at the turn of}} events, Motilal leaves the house. As <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> from a distance, he asks God to forgive the villagers for insulting him and not trusting him.|$|E
6000|$|Staniford rose. He {{was smiling}} gayly as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the broad stretch of empty deck, {{and down into}} Lydia's eyes. [...] "Wouldn't you {{like to take a}} turn, now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{his left}} shoulder, [...] And for {{to see what}} he might see; [...] There was he aware of his auld father, [...] Came tearing his hair most piteouslie.|$|R
60|$|No! It was a ghost, clear enough. I {{could see}} {{the back of the}} chair through his body. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> towards me, took the shadowy pipe from his lips, and nodded.|$|R
