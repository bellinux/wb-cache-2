The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) International Direct Investment Statistics database provides annual statistics from 1980 onwards on international direct investment {{to and from the}} OECD area. Data are broken down by geographical zone and industrial sector for direct investment flows and stocks. The data are presented in the following tables: Direct Investment by Country Provides statistics for OECD countries on international direct investment flows (inflows, outflows) and position (inward, outward) by geographical distribution, i. e. to and from partner countries and regions. Data are provided <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>currency.</b> Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) - by Industrial Sectors Provides statistics for OECD countries on international direct investment flow (inflows, outflows) and positions (inward, outward) by industrial sector, according to the International Standard Industrial Classification Revision 3 secondary level classification. Exchange Rates Provides statistics for OECD countries on exchange rates both as yearly averages and end-of-period rates <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> units per United States dollar (USD). Note: These OECD series relate to exchange rates used at the time of drafting to compute the amounts in US dollars for comparative tables.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{identification}} of potential disadvantages associated with the existence of <b>national</b> <b>currencies</b> with the floating exchange rate regime during the current financial and economic crisis in countries postponing their entry into the eurozone. The hypothesis is that the advantages of a floating exchange rate may be outweighed by their disadvantages (high volatility of exchange rates). First part of the paper provides evidence {{about the development of}} Czech crown exchange rate since transition from fix to free float regime. Special attention will be given to the period during the recent global economic crisis. For the sake of comparison, evolution of other currencies in the region (zloty, forint and Slovak crown), will be taken to consideration. Second part of the paper form case studies identifying impact due to volatility on <b>national</b> <b>currencies.</b> Case studies were used to identify possible negative impacts from volatility <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>currencies</b> on export firms in the Czech Republic and holders of mortgage loans denominated in foreign currencies in Hungary. The last part of the paper will formulate recommendations for businesses entering into foreign trade relationships, as well as for policy makers <b>in</b> countries using <b>national</b> <b>currencies</b> which are preparing for membership in the eurozone...|$|R
50|$|Often {{there are}} issues related to paying tax. Some {{alternative}} currencies are considered tax-exempt, {{but most of them}} are fully taxed as if they were <b>national</b> <b>currency,</b> with the caveat that the tax must be paid <b>in</b> the <b>national</b> <b>currency.</b> The legality and tax-status of alternative currencies varies widely from country to country; some systems in use in some countries would be illegal in others.|$|R
50|$|The groups {{announced}} {{their decision to}} cease mutual trade payments in U.S. dollars and instead henceforth give credits to one another <b>in</b> their <b>national</b> <b>currencies</b> alone.

5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>currencies.</b> While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|R
40|$|In multi-country studies, {{researchers}} frequently {{extract data}} in a single currency rather than in native currencies. This approach can be misleading for financial analysts’ forecasts in the euro zone when researchers are using the IBES database. We suspect that forecasts of earnings before {{the birth of the}} euro on January 1, 1999 are kept <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>currencies,</b> although {{they are supposed to be}} displayed in euros, which can severely distort results concerning earnings forecast accuracy. We propose a simple procedure for checking for the existence of this error, as well as a quick solution to overcome it...|$|R
40|$|We {{extended}} the Cole and Kehoe model (1996) by adding trade and debt denominated <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>currency.</b> We then evaluated some external debt defaults and steep <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> devaluations occurred during last decades. Although default is unlikely, steep devaluation has been repeatedly triggered during financial distresses. It helps to overcome financial crisis as it improves trade balance and reduces national debt level. On the other hand, expected devaluation hurts welfare through both higher national debt cost and {{reductions in the}} investment level. We modeled such trade-offs and showed that trade openness, by and large, improves the expected welfare as it allows for a better devaluation-response technology. We ran model simulations based on past 48 crises occurred in 32 middle-income countries, reasonably fitting devaluation and default responses observed as from 1971...|$|R

The model predicts that only where financial development is limited a reduction in exchange rate uncertainty raises a firm's profit, lowers prices, and induces new firms to export.

The price of Bitcoins <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>currencies</b> have been quite volatile over the brief period of Bitcoin?s existence. Among <b>national</b> <b>currencies,</b> the possibility of triangular arbitrage leads to near equality of bilateral exchange rates and exchange rates obtained via triangular trade. We explore {{the relationship between a}} bilateral exchange rate of two major <b>national</b> <b>currencies</b> and the exchange rate that can be obtained via triangular trade through Bitcoins. Features of the Bitcoin exchanges make it difficult to meet conditions necessary for strict (risk-free) arbitrage, but market pressures from the threat of arbitrage constrain the <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> prices of Bitcoins to adjust toward the bilateral foreign exchange rate obtained in the traditional foreign exchange market. In this paper, we compare the Bitcoin implied exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Chinese Renminbi to the market US Dollar/Renminbi exchange rate, and show that the Bitcoin implied rate adjusts toward the FOREX market rate due to market pressures from the threat of triangular arbitrage. One implication is that the bilateral rate and the triangular trade rate obtained from trade in Bitcoins are cointegrated, and we study the adjustment process when these exchange rates are misaligned...|$|R

The factors by which the model is augmented, summarize {{information that can be}} used by banks to forecast interest rates and evaluate macroeconomic risks. The estimation results indicate that there is a significant relation between the markup and the changes in 1 -month WIBOR. This relation can be interpreted as evidence of incomplete transmission of the monetary policy shocks to mortgage rates set by monetary financial institutions. The policy shocks are partially absorbed by changes in the markup. ...|$|R
