5|$|Branham {{regarded}} {{his series}} of sermons on the Seven Seals in 1963 as {{a highlight of}} his ministry. In reality, Branham's teaching on this subject revealed very little new doctrine and was <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> laborious restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages.|$|E
5|$|During the A320 {{development}} programme, Airbus considered propfan technology, {{backed by}} Lufthansa. At the time unproven, it was <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering {{speed of a}} turbofan at turboprops economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans.|$|E

5|$|A Geschwaderstab was <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> Headquarters Unit (Stabschwarm) for {{the entire}} wing. There were {{headquarters}} units also at gruppe level. Initially when JG 1 was re-formed in Jever, it was constituted as a Regional Fighter Command (Jagdfliegerführer 2) on 30 November 1939 with an intention to co-ordinate with navy (Kriegsmarine) flak and signals units. This autonomous command defending the coastline was placed under Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher. Geschwaderstab JG 1 (Stab. JG 1) was also alternatively called JG Nord or JG Schumacher and was equipped with Bf 109 'D' and 'E' variants.|$|E

Activities of small museums around Kraków and in the Lesser Poland region are promoted {{and supported by the}} Małopolska Institute of Culture; the Institute organises annual Małopolska Heritage Days.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was plunged into bankruptcy, social injustice, poverty, crime and mass unemployment. During these {{depressing}} years, Germany saw {{the creation of}} a number of extremist political and paramilitary associations, representing both the far-left and the far-right. Amidst this crisis, Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German Workers Party, later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81. The political program of the party was <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism, driven by Adolf Hitler and his world view.|$|E
5|$|Chris {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{characters}} of , reuniting with Jill Valentine. Sections of the game are <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> retelling of Resident Evil. The two join a private biohazard containment force, and in 2003 embark on a mission to destroy the Umbrella Corporation after hearing rumours of a new Bio Organic Weapon (BOW) being developed.

5|$|<b>Essentially</b> <b>a</b> stylist, Kippax was {{in every}} sense a great batsman, for he could suit his game {{to the needs of}} the occasion. A {{beautiful}} driver to the off, he cut at times in delightful fashion, the slower wickets of England affecting his abilities in that direction in only the slightest degree.|$|E
5|$|Fig.8 {{illustrates}} {{the operation of}} a Fourier transform spectrometer, which is <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> Michelson interferometer with one mirror movable. (A practical Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.|$|E
5|$|His health failing, Hancock {{spent his}} final few years as <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> figurehead {{governor}}. With {{his wife at}} his side, he died in bed on October 8, 1793, at 56 years of age. By order of acting governor Samuel Adams, the day of Hancock's burial was a state holiday; the lavish funeral was perhaps the grandest given to an American up to that time.|$|E

5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E
5|$|In United States {{railroad}} terminology, a troop sleeper was {{a railroad}} passenger car {{which had been}} constructed to serve {{as something of a}} mobile barracks (<b>essentially,</b> <b>a</b> sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations. This method allowed part of the trip to be made overnight, reducing the amount of transit time required and increasing travel efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Marking Specter's {{entire career}} in the Senate and, indeed, in all his public offices was one {{overriding}} fact: First and foremost, he considered himself <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> trial attorney rather than a professional politician.

5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This was <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> MAR {{with half of}} the elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start {{to be able to be}} upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1969, while {{paying a}} visit to the {{northern}} town of Las Anod, Somalia's then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d'état on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition— <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June, the Second Armistice at Compiègne {{was signed}} between France and Germany ending hostilities. Northern and western France was placed under direct German occupation, while Alsace-Lorraine {{became part of}} Germany. Italy would control its own zone in the southeast, and an unoccupied zone, the zone libre, would be governed by the newly formed Vichy {{government}} (État Français) led by Pétain. Vichy was nominally independent, and still controlled French overseas colonies, but in practice was <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> German client state.|$|E
