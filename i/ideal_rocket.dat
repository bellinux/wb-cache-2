50|$|In general, the worldlines {{of these}} {{observers}} {{need not be}} timelike geodesics. If any of the worldlines bends away from a geodesic path in some region, {{we can think of}} the observers as test particles that accelerate by using <b>ideal</b> <b>rocket</b> engines with a thrust equal to the magnitude of their acceleration vector. Alternatively, if our observer is attached to a bit of matter in a ball of fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium, this bit of matter will in general be accelerated outward by the net effect of pressure holding up the fluid ball against the attraction of its own gravity. Other possibilities include an observer attached to a free charged test particle in an electrovacuum solution, which will of course be accelerated by the Lorentz force, or an observer attached to a spinning test particle, which may be accelerated by a spin-spin force.|$|E

We have {{carried out the}} first experimental study using a detonation tube hung in a ballistic pendulum arrangement within a large pressure vessel {{to determine the effect}} that the environment has on the single-cycle impulse. Air pressure decreased below 100 kPa, whereas initial pressure of the stoichiometric ethylene– oxygen mixture inside the tube varied between 100 and 30 kPa. The original impulse model (Wintenberger et al., Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 19, No. 1, 2002, pp. 22 – 38) was modified to predict the observed increase in impulse and blowdown time as the environmental pressure decreased below 1 atm. Comparisons between the impulse from detonation tubes and <b>ideal</b> steady-flow <b>rockets</b> indicate incomplete expansion of the detonation tube exhaust, resulting in a 37 % difference in impulse at a pressure ratio (ratio of pressure behind the Taylor wave to environmental pressure) of 100.

An R-F antennae that wraps around a chamber of gas is used to create the waves and excite the gas. Once the energy provided by the antennae couples with the gas a plasma is created. Once the plasma is formed, the plasma is accelerated out of the engine using a magnetic field of ideal topology. Mini-helicon thrusters, invented by Oleg Batishcev, are small simple thrusters ideal for small maneuvers in space.

The goals were to successfully design, manufacture and test a thruster, while discovering the complications that arise through out the complete design process of a green thruster. The thruster was successfully designed using <b>ideal</b> <b>rocket</b> equations and the design was successfully confirmed using CFD and FEA. Manufacturing of the thruster was fully planned and revealed mild flaws in thruster design. For example some features were not manufacturable to the exact measurements desired. Testing of the engine gave results inconsistent with expected values with a maximum nominal thrust of 2. 38 lbf. Measurement errors in thrust and mass flow rates caused calculations of thruster performance, such as ISP, to vary from expected values.

A next-order mass model is developed that is able to model the mass differences between hydrogen-fueled and other stages. Propellants considered range in density from liquid methane to inhibited red fuming nitric acid. Calculated comparisons are shown for solid rocket boosters, liquid first stages, liquid upper stages, and a balloon-deployed single-stage-to-orbit concept.

50|$|The Sea Sparrow was {{far from}} an <b>ideal</b> weapon. Its <b>rocket</b> engine was {{designed}} {{with the assumption that}} it would be launched at high speed from an aircraft, and therefore is optimized for a long cruise at relatively low power. In the surface-to-air role one would rather have very high acceleration in order to allow it to intercept sea-skimming targets as soon as possible. The power profile is also suitable for cruising in thin air at high altitudes, but at low altitudes it does not produce enough power to overcome drag and dramatically decreases range; some estimates indicate that the Sea Sparrow may be effective only to 10 km, about one quarter of the range of the air-launched Sparrow. An engine of much higher power would greatly improve performance, in spite of a shorter burning time.|$|R
50|$|Solid {{propellant}} rockets {{are much}} easier to store and handle than liquid propellant rockets. High propellant density makes for compact size as well. These features plus simplicity and low cost make solid propellant <b>rockets</b> <b>ideal</b> for military applications. In the 1970s and 1980s the U.S. switched entirely to solid-fueled ICBMs: the LGM-30 Minuteman and LG-118A Peacekeeper (MX). In the 1980s and 1990s, the USSR/Russia also deployed solid-fueled ICBMs (RT-23, RT-2PM, and RT-2UTTH), but retains two liquid-fueled ICBMs (R-36 and UR-100N). All solid-fueled ICBMs on both sides had three initial solid stages, and those with multiple independently targeted warheads had a precision maneuverable bus used to fine tune the trajectory of the re-entry vehicles. U.S. Minuteman III ICBMs were reduced to a single warhead by 2011 {{in accordance with the}} START treaty leaving only the Navy's Trident sub-launched ICBMs with multiple warheads.|$|R
40|$|Next-generation launch {{vehicles}} demand several technological {{improvements to}} achieve lower cost and more reliable access to space. One technology area whose performance gains may far exceed others is densified propellants. The <b>ideal</b> <b>rocket</b> engine propellant {{is characterized by}} high specific impulse, high density, and low vapor pressure. A propellant combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LH 2 /LOX) {{is one of the}} highest performance propellants, but LH 2 stored at standard conditions has a relatively low density and high vapor pressure. Propellant densification can significantly improve this propellant's properties relative to vehicle design and engine performance. Vehicle performance calculations based on an average of existing launch vehicles indicate that densified propellants may allow an increase in payload mass of up to 5 percent. Since the NASA Lewis Research Center became involved with the National Aerospace Plane program in the 1980 's, it has been leading the way in making densified propellants a viable fuel for next-generation launch vehicles. Lewis researchers have been working to provide a method and critical data for continuous production of densified hydrogen and oxygen...|$|E
40|$|An <b>ideal</b> <b>rocket</b> engine {{sensing system}} might probe several key {{elements}} of the rocket engine including: the fuel and oxidizer supply for mass flow rate and impurities, the combustion chamber for pressure and mole fraction of reactants, or the plume for temperature and mole fraction of products. This thesis focuses on the rocket plume component of a rocket engine sensing system. The rocket plume sensor consists of a wavelength scanning laser that spatially sweeps through the rocket plume {{in order to determine}} the temperature, water mole fraction, and pressure at different positions in an axially symmetric plume. Because of the low absorbance that will occur in a small rocket plume (< 1 % for a 2 inch diameter plume), all noise must be minimized. The three largest sources of noise are mode noise, beamsteering, and laser intensity noise. Throughout this research, these three sources of noise are studied in depth. Final recommendations are given for designing a system that will successfully measure these qualities in a rocket plume...|$|E
40|$|Aerodynamics and Performance Estimation Toolset is a {{collection}} of four software programs for rapidly estimating the preliminary design performance of aerospace vehicles represented by doing simplified calculations based on ballistic trajectories, the <b>ideal</b> <b>rocket</b> equation, and supersonic wedges through standard atmosphere. The program consists of a set of Microsoft Excel worksheet subprograms. The input and output data are presented in a user-friendly format, and calculations are performed rapidly enough that the user can iterate among different trajectories and/or shapes to perform "what-if" studies. Estimates that can be computed by these programs include: 1. Ballistic trajectories as a function of departure angles, initial velocities, initial positions, and target altitudes; assuming point masses and no atmosphere. The program plots the trajectory in two-dimensions and outputs the position, pitch, and velocity along the trajectory. 2. The "Rocket Equation" program calculates and plots the trade space for a vehicle s propellant mass fraction over a range of specific impulse and mission velocity values, propellant mass fractions as functions of specific impulses and velocities. 3. "Standard Atmosphere" will estimate the temperature, speed of sound, pressure, and air density as a function of altitude in a standard atmosphere, properties of a standard atmosphere as functions of altitude. 4. "Supersonic Wedges" will calculate the free-stream, normal-shock, oblique-shock, and isentropic flow properties for a wedge-shaped body flying supersonically through a standard atmosphere. It will also calculate the maximum angle for which a shock remains attached, and the minimum Mach number for which a shock becomes attached, all as functions of the wedge angle, altitude, and Mach number...|$|E

The maximum altitude of these rockets are usually in the range of 4900 feet (1500 meters).

40|$|Aluminum {{combined}} with oxygen {{has been proposed}} as a potential lunar in situ propellant for ascent/descent and return missions for future lunar exploration. Engine concepts proposed to use this propellant have not previously been demonstrated, and the impact on performance from combustion and two-phase flow losses could only be estimated. Therefore, combustion tests were performed for aluminum and aluminum/magnesium alloy powders with oxygen in subscale heat-sink rocket engine hardware. The metal powder was pneumatically injected, {{with a small amount}} of nitrogen, through the center orifice of a single element O-F-O triplet injector. Gaseous oxygen impinged on the fuel stream. Hot-fire tests of aluminum/oxygen were performed over a mixture ratio range of 0. 5 to 3. 0, and at a chamber pressure of approximately 480 kPa (70 psia). The theoretical performance of the propellants was analyzed over a mixture ratio range of 0. 5 to 5. 0. In the theoretical predictions the <b>ideal</b> one-dimensional equilibrium <b>rocket</b> performance was reduced by loss mechanisms including finite rate kinetics, two-dimensional divergence losses, and boundary layer losses. Lower than predicted characteristic velocity and specific impulse performance efficiencies were achieved in the hot-fire tests, and this was attributed to poor mixing of the propellants and two-phase flow effects.

40|$|During the Space Shuttle Program, one of {{the most}} {{hazardous}} operation that occurred was the loading of liquid hydrogen (LH 2) during fueling operations of the spacecraft. Due to hydrogen's low explosive limit, any amount leaked could lead to catastrophic event. Hydrogen's chemical properties make it <b>ideal</b> as a <b>rocket</b> fuel; however, the fuel is deemed unsafe for most commercial use because of the inability to easily detect the gas leaking. The increased use of hydrogen over traditional fossil fuels would reduce greenhouse gases and America's dependency on foreign oil. Therefore a technology that would improve safety at NASA and in the commercial sector while creating a new economic sector would have a huge impact to NASA's mission. The Chemochromic Detector for sensing hydrogen gas leakage is a color-changing detector that is useful in any application where {{it is important to know}} not only the presence but also the location of the hydrogen gas leak. This technology utilizes a chemochromicpigment and polymer matrix that can be molded or spun into rigid or pliable shapes useable in variable temperature environments including atmospheres of inert gas, hydrogen gas, or mixtures of gases. A change in color of the detector material indicates where gaseous hydrogen leaks are occurring. The irreversible sensor has a dramatic color change from beige to dark grey and remains dark grey after exposure. A reversible pigment changes from white to blue in the presence of hydrogen and reverts back to white in the presence of oxygen. Both versions of the sensor's pigments were comprised of a mixture of a metal oxide substrate and a hydro-chromic compound (i. e., the compound that changed color in the presence of hydrogen) and immediately notified the operator of the presence of low levels of hydrogen. The detector can be used in a variety of formats including paint, tape, caulking, injection molded parts, textiles and fabrics, composites, and films. This technology brings numerous benefits over the traditional hydrogen sensors: The technology has excellent temperature stability (4 K to 373 K), it can be used in cryogenic fluid applications, it is easy to apply and remove; it requires no power to operate; it has a quick response time; the leak points can be detected visually or electronically; it is nonhazardous, thus environmentally friendly; it can be reversible or irreversible; it does not require on-site monitoring; has a long shelf life; the detector is very durable; and the technology is inexpensive to manufacture...|$|R

The design study was constrained by assuming the generator must function within the performance and structural limits of an existing magnet and by assuming realistic limits on (1) the axial electric field, (2) the Hall parameter, (3) current density, and (4) heat flux (given the criteria of heat sink operation). The major results of the work are summarized as follows: (1) A Faraday type of generator with rectangular cross section is designed to operate with a combustor pressure of 300 psi. Based on a magnetic field strength of 1. 5 Tesla, the electrical power output from this generator {{is estimated to be}} 54. 2 KW with potassium seed (weight fraction 3. 74 %) and 92 KW with cesium seed (weight fraction 9. 66 %). The former corresponds to a enthalpy extraction ratio of 2. 36 % while that for the latter is 4. 16 %; (2) A conceptual design of the Faraday MHD channel is proposed, based on a maximum operating time of 10 to 15 seconds. This concept utilizes a phenolic back wall for inserting the electrodes and inter-electrode insulators. Copper electrode and aluminum oxide insulator are suggested for this channel; and (3) A testing configuration for the sub-scale rocket based MHD system is proposed. An estimate of performance of an <b>ideal</b> <b>rocket</b> based MHD accelerator is performed.

40|$|The need to {{increase}} specific impulse of rocket launcher engines has lead design engineers to start development of ever more complex engine cycles starting from simple gas pressure fed engines to the very complex staged combustion cycle engines. Currently {{a wide range of}} different cycles does exist. These cycles not only differ in terms of performance, but also in terms of mass, cost, reliability etc., which in general makes it difficult to quickly determine which cycle is best suited for a certain mission or task. For this a tool that is capable of analysing different cycles and the impact of design choices has been developed. The tool, named LiRA, has as goal giving the user better system level understanding of the different possible engine cycles and the functions of the components; it can therefore provide valuable and time saving assistance during design or in analysis and optimisation studies. A modular approach is applied where engine components are sized using a performance, dimension and mass model who make use of corrected <b>ideal</b> <b>rocket</b> theory and empirical relations. This work focuses mainly on the methodology and the construction of the models, and further includes the optimisation of an upper stage and a verification, validation and uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the tool and the optimisation to assess its accuracy, precision and applicability. The completed program has proved to confirm known trends and known cycle characteristics like the mass savings that can be achieved when using turbo-pump fed engines instead of pressure fed engines for mid- to high-thrust booster applications. Further the superior performance of closed cycles, especially staged combustion cycles has been confirmed, and some cycle specific design choices like the need of bypasses in expander cycles have been explained. The tool however is not complete and should be expanded; the addition of a cost and reliability assessment model is for example strongly recommended. There also remain issues with the accuracy and uncertainty of certain estimates which make that the current version should only be used for comparative studies.

40|$|At the Space Engineering (SpE) {{department}} of the Delft University of Technology performance testing of micropropulsion systems is done using the Delft Aerospace Rocket Thrust Stand (DARTS) facility. The DARTS facility {{has a need for}} a new improved test stand which can measure the thrust performance of the in-house developed micro-thrusters. The work presented in this Master thesis report addresses this need. This report shows the validation process of a test stand capable of steady-state thrust measurements in a range of 0. 1 to 15 [mN]. The AE-TB- 5 m thrust bench is selected to provide these measurement capabilities. The AE-TB- 5 m test stand has been re-assembled, improved and discrepancies in its measurement characteristics have been successfully identified and solved. A new calibration process for the test stand has been developed to provide full automation in order to mitigate any inconsistencies due to human influence. Furthermore, the measurement accuracies are determined and are found to be below 0. 036 [mN], which fully complies with the target requirement of 0. 1 [mN]. The test stand measurement capabilities have been successfully demonstrated in both an atmospheric and vacuum environment using the heritage T 3 Micro Propulsion System (T 3 μPS) thruster test model originating from the Delfi-n 3 Xt CubeSat mission. Moreover, an empirical relation for the estimation of a loss factor on the thrust coefficient due to viscous effects in low Reynolds number nozzles has been evaluated. The results of this analysis shows improved correlation with experimental data in vacuum conditions and for Reynolds numbers between 5500 and 10000 when compared with <b>ideal</b> <b>rocket</b> theory. The feasibility of an experimental bell-shaped micro nozzle produced using a novel microprecision additive manufacturing technique has been evaluated. The nozzle shape showed a nearly perfect correlation between the designed bell curve and the manufactured product. An axially symmetric bell nozzle of this micron scale is considered a unique engineering accomplishment. The nozzle throat shows incompatibility with a high vacuum environment resulting from inspection with an electron-microscope. Despite a collapsed throat, a leak path trough the throat is successfully identified using the AE-TB- 5 m, again demonstrating its operational capabilities. The test stand is considered fully operational and ready to enable thrust measurements of other micropropulsion systems at the DARTS facility. Aerospace EngineeringSpace Engineerin...|$|E
