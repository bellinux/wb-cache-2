40|$|BACKGROUND: Magnesium (Mg(2 +)) is an {{essential}} ion for cell growth, neuroplasticity and muscle contraction. Blood Mg(2 +) levels < 0. 7 mmol/L may cause a heterogeneous clinical phenotype, including muscle cramps and epilepsy and disturbances in K(+) and Ca(2 +) homeostasis. Over the last decade, the genetic origin of several familial forms of <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> has been found. In 2000, mutations in FXYD 2, encoding the gamma-subunit of the Na(+) -K(+) -ATPase, were identified to cause isolated dominant <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> (IDH) in a large Dutch family suffering from <b>hypomagnesaemia,</b> hypocalciuria and chondrocalcinosis. However, no additional patients have been identified since then. METHODS: Here, two families with <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> and hypocalciuria were screened for mutations in the FXYD 2 gene. Moreover, the patients were clinically and genetically characterized. RESULTS: We report a p. Gly 41 Arg FXYD 2 mutation in two families with <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> and hypocalciuria. Interestingly, {{this is the same}} mutation as was described in the original study. As in the initial family, several patients suffered from muscle cramps, chondrocalcinosis and epilepsy.

40|$|Gitelman {{syndrome}} is an inherited tubulopathy {{leading to a}} hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> and hypocalciuria.

Chronic <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> can lead to chondrocalcinosis, which often affects knees but can affect other joints. Here we present a case of Gitelman syndrome complicated by cervical chondrocalcinosis leading to neck pain and numbness of the fingers.

40|$|Abstract. Over {{recent decades}} {{there have been}} several papers that {{documented}} hypomagnesaemia*, in cancer patients treated, with cisplatin, with combined che-motherapies and more recently, with cetuximab an antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor. Recently, however, the clinical read-out of cetuximab-induced <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> has received different interpretations. Some reports called the readers â€™ attention to the importance of magnesium supplementation in relieving patientâ€™s discomfort or preventing the most severe complications of <b>hypomagnesaemia.</b> Other reports claimed that magnesium deficiency could con-tribute to the oncologic efficacy of cetuximab. This latter interpretation implies that the decision on magnesium supplementation should consider {{the pros and cons of}} returning magnesium to normal levels.

40|$|Currently, {{targeted}} anti-epidermal {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) agents {{have an important}} role in the treatment of various cancers. These drugs, particularly anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, may induce electrolyte disorders, such as <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> and hypocalcaemia. Early symptoms of magnesium deficiency can easily go unrecognized. However, <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> can in rare cases lead to serious clinical manifestations, including cardiac arrhythmias or convulsions. The elective tubular expression of renal EGF/EGFR explains the mechanism of this class-related drug side effect. Inhibition of the EGFR induces a mutated-like transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 6 (TRPM 6) syndrome, characterized by urinary magnesium and calcium wasting. The risk of <b>hypomagnesaemia</b> is associated with treatment duration. It is a reversible toxicity; the recovery of magnesium serum levels is usually seen 4 - 6 Â weeks of stopping the anti-EGFR antibody.
