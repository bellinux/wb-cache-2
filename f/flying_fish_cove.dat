30|$|Flying {{fish are}} {{important}} traditional fisheries resources in various Caribbean, South East Asian, and Southern Pacific regions and countries (Huang and Ou 2012). In the past, <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> were economically important species for coastal fisheries, with the catch amount reaching the top twenty {{in terms of}} fisheries production in Taiwan. Darkwinged <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cypselurus cyanopyerus), Limpidwing <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cheilopogon unicolor), Spotwing <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cypselurus poecilopterus), and Stained <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cheilopogon spilonotopterus) are the main edible species caught in Taiwan (Huang and Ou 2012). Recently, Staphylococcus xylosus strain Q 2 isolated from dried <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> was a halotolerant histamine-former capable of producing > 500  ppm of histamine in culture broth without shaking at 35  °C for 24  h (Kung et al. 2015). So far, <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> have never been implicated in the outbreaks of scombroid poisoning in the world. However, if the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle is contaminated with Gram-positive histamine former, such as S. xylosus, and stored at improper temperatures, {{it is important to}} be aware that <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle could become a hazardous food vehicle for histamine poisoning. Currently, no information is available concerning histamine formation in contaminated <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle. This work was undertaken to study the effect of S. xylosus proliferation in <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle on histamine formation and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) under the controlled storage temperatures of − 20, 4, 15, 25, and 35 °C.|$|R
50|$|The ornamented <b>flying</b> <b>fish,</b> or beautyfin <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cypselurus callopterus) , is {{a species}} of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> of the genus Cypselurus in the family Exocoetidae. The British {{ichthyologist}} Albert Günther first described it in 1866 in his eight-volume Catalogue of Fishes (1859-1870).|$|R
25|$|Christmas Island has 80 {{kilometres}} of shoreline {{but only}} small {{parts of the}} shoreline are easily accessible. The island's perimeter is embodied by sharp cliff faces, making many of the island's beaches difficult to get to. Some of the easily accessible beaches include <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>Cove</b> (main beach), Lily Beach, Ethel Beach, and Isabel Beach, while the more difficult beaches to access include Greta Beach, Dolly Beach, Winifred Beach, Merrial Beach, and West White Beach, which all require a vehicle with four wheel drive and a difficult walk through dense rainforest.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 February 1942, lookouts on Christmas Island spotted an object out at sea, which on closer inspection {{turned out to be}} a carley float carrying the body of a Caucasian man wearing a blue boilersuit that had been sun-bleached white. The flesh of his right arm had been eaten away by fish, and his eyes and nose consumed by birds. Shrapnel was embedded in the float's outer covering, while the proliferation of marine growth indicated that it had been adrift for some time. As the island was under threat of Japanese invasion, after a brief examination, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>Cove.</b> Evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March.|$|E
25|$|From the {{outbreak}} of the South-East Asian theatre of World War II in December 1941, Christmas Island was a target for Japanese occupation because of its rich phosphate deposits. Anaval gun was installed under a British officer and four NCOs and 27 Indian soldiers. The first attack was carried out on 20 January 1942, by the Japanese submarine, which torpedoed a Norwegian freighter, the Eidsvold. The vessel drifted and eventually sank off West White Beach. Most of the European and Asian staff and their families were evacuated to Perth. In late February and early March 1942, there were two aerial bombing raids. Shelling from a Japanese naval group on 7 March led the district officer to hoist the white flag. But after the Japanese naval group sailed away, the British officer raised the Union flag once more. During the night of 10–11 March, a mutiny of the Indian troops, abetted by Sikh policemen, led to the killing of the five British soldiers and the imprisonment of the remaining 21 Europeans. At dawn on 31 March 1942, a dozen Japanese bombers launched the attack, destroying the radio station. The same day, a Japanese fleet of nine vessels arrived, and the island was surrendered. About 850 men of the Japanese 21st and 24th Special Base Forces and 102nd Construction Unit came ashore at <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>Cove</b> and occupied the island. They rounded up the workforce, most of whom had fled to the jungle. Sabotaged equipment was repaired and preparations were made to resume the mining and export of phosphate. Only 20 men from the 21st Special Base Force were left as a garrison.|$|E
30|$|The {{cultural}} {{characteristics of}} the Tao tribe, such as the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> festival, canoes, and underground houses, are unique to the Tao tribe in Taiwan; other indigenous tribes in Taiwan do not have such cultural features. The <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> season represents {{the core of the}} life and culture of the Tao tribe; the annual rituals and lifestyles are operated according to the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> season. The <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> season spans from February to August each year, with several important ceremonies taking place during this period, such as mivanwa (<b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> attracting festival) and manoigoyin (end of eating <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> festival). During the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> season, the people are not allowed to catch other than the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> and the common dolphinfish; they also have specific regulations for fishing gear and the number of people allowed to fish. During this period, all tribe members must follow traditional norms and avoid violating the related taboos, i.e., must not interfere with the tribe peoples’ lifestyle or affect their personal social status.|$|R
50|$|The California <b>flying</b> <b>fish,</b> Cheilopogon pinnatibarbatus californicus, is a {{subspecies}} of Pacific <b>flying</b> <b>fish.</b> It {{may grow}} up to 15 inches (38 cm) in length and is the largest member of the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> family. It {{is found in the}} Eastern Pacific Ocean, from Oregon to Baja California. As with all other <b>flying</b> <b>fish,</b> the California can not actually fly, but it can launch itself into the air, using its specially adapted fins to glide along the surface.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> are {{primarily}} aquatic animals, their body density must {{be close to}} that of water for buoyancy stability. This primary requirement for swimming, however, means that <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> are heavier than other habitual fliers, resulting in higher wing loading and lift to drag ratios for <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> compared to a comparably sized bird. Differences in wing area, wing span, wing loading, and aspect ratio {{have been used to}} classify <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> into two distinct classifications based on these different aerodynamic designs.|$|R

40|$|The {{high price}} of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> eggs in Japan {{encourages}} South Sulawesi fishermen in Indonesia to harvest increasing quantities of eggs every year. Similarly, the increasing local demand for <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> encourages Indonesian fishermen to use gill nets to catch more fish. As a consequence of this increasing quantity of eggs harvested and fish caught, Indonesia has become concerned about the overexploitation of the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> population. Thus far policy suggestions concerning {{the management of the}} <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> fishery have been based on a static biological model, since the data needed to construct a dynamic bioeconomic model are very limited.

30|$|In this study, it {{demonstrated}} that hazardous levels of histamine could be formed by S. xylosus in <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat when stored at temperatures above 15 °C. Flying fish {{may become a}} hazardous food if the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat is contaminated with histamine formers, such as S. xylosus, and exposed to temperatures above 15  °C. However, the formation of histamine by S. xylosus in samples stored at 4 °C after 96  h was negligible. Although histamine was not detected in any frozen samples, it accumulated rapidly in the previously frozen <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat and once thawed and stored at 25 °C. It is suggested that <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat should be stored below 4  °C to control histamine production.|$|R
30|$|Histamine is {{the main}} causative agent of scombroid poisoning. However, unlike scombroid fish, {{histamine}} poisoning due to consumption of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> has never been reported. In this study, the white muscle of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> had high levels of free histidine at approximately 423.9  mg/ 100  g, and was inoculated with Staphylococcus xylosus Q 2 isolated from dried <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> at 5.0 log CFU/g and stored at − 20 to 35 °C to investigate histamine-related quality. The histamine contents quickly increased to higher than 50  mg/ 100  g in samples stored at 25 and 35 °C within 12  h as well as stored at 15 °C within 48  h. However, bacterial growth and histamine formation were controlled by cold storage of the samples at 4 °C or below. Once the frozen <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> samples stored at − 20 °C for 2  months were thawed and stored at 25 °C after 24  h, histamine started to accumulate rapidly (> 50  mg/ 100  g of <b>fish).</b> Therefore, <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle was a good substrate for histamine formation by bacterial histidine decarboxylation at elevated temperatures (> 15 °C) when it is contaminated with S. xylosus. In conclusion, since the improperly contaminated <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle with S. xylosus could lead to production of hazardous levels of histamine over time when stored at temperatures > 15 °C, the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> should be stored below 4  °C or below to control proliferation of S. xylosus, and TVBN and histamine production.|$|R
