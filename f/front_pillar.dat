25|$|In the Second World War {{the church}} and the {{adjoining}} parsonage in the Kettelerallee were damaged by several bomb hits. The church windows were destroyed in 1943 by the blast waves of bomb explosions nearby. The large main staircase at the tower was destroyed in 1944 by a bomb hit and the church roof of fire bombs. After rebuilding, the church interior from 1951 got a white coating on the walls with an orange-coloured ceiling. The new church windows were re-glazed in a yellowish hue. The two side altars were removed. In addition, there were a total of five side chapels in the church between the pillars in the inner church and the two side walls of the church ship. They were dedicated to various saints, such as Saint Elizabeth, Saint Rita and Saint Agnes. Behind the left <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> was the entrance to the pulpit, which had a rectangular sounding board. The church was put under cultural heritage management in 1986 together with its location and the assignment to the Ernst May settlement around the church. In 1990 extensive renovations were begun, in which the altar area was redesigned and the interior was restored to its original color in 1992, also for reasons of cultural heritage management.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} faces west on Broadway. Because it sits {{between two}} raised rail lines, {{it is nearly}} invisible until one is next to it. The only sign still visible inside or outside the building is a painted notice on the <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> that says “No Parking Cabs Only”. The method of construction has retained its integrity after 50 years of abandonment.|$|E
50|$|A trigonon is {{represented}} {{on one of}} the Athenian red-figured vases from Cameiros in the island of Rhodes, dating from the 5th century BCE, which are preserved in the British Museum. The triangle is here an irregular one, consisting of a narrow base to which one end of the string was fixed, while the second side, forming a slightly obtuse angle with the base, consisted of a wide and slightly curved sound-board pierced with holes through which {{the other end of the}} strings passed, being either knotted or wound round pegs. The third side of the triangle was formed by the strings themselves, the <b>front</b> <b>pillar,</b> which in modern European harps plays such an important part, being always absent in these early Oriental instruments. A small harp of this kind having 20 strings was discovered at Thebes, Greece in 1823.|$|E
50|$|The {{store was}} first raised on Christmas Day in 1841 and {{finished}} the next spring. An overhang and the <b>front</b> <b>pillars</b> were added later that year. Its west wing was originally a separate structure; after being connected it {{was used as a}} storeroom.|$|R

50|$|This {{instrument}} {{consists of}} a pear-shaped body, to which is added a curved neck supported on a <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> or arm springing from the body, and therefore reminiscent of the harp. There are twelve catgut strings. The curved fingerboard, almost parallel with the neck, is provided with frets, and has in addition a thumbkey for each string, by means of which the accordance of the string is mechanically raised a semitone at will. The dital or key, on being depressed, acts upon a stop-ring or eye, which draws the string down against the fret, and thus shortens its effective length. The fingers then stop the strings as usual over the remaining frets. A further improvement was patented in 1816 as the British harp lute. Other attempts possessing less practical merit than the dital harp were the lyra-guitarre, which appeared in Germany, {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century; the accord-guitarre, towards the middle of the same century; and the keyed guitar.|$|E
5000|$|Flowers, {{together}} with their containers, are {{an important element of}} the decorations for the tea ceremony. The flowers arranged in the simple [...] "thrown-in" [...] (nageire) manner suitable for tea ceremony are called chabana (茶花), and the containers for them are generically referred to as hanaire (花入). Hanaire may be of bronze or other metal, celadon and other types of ceramic, bamboo, or basketry. Bamboo hanaire (take-hanaire) came into being with the development of wabi-cha, as did hanaire of domestic Japanese ceramic ware such as Bizen ware and Shigaraki ware. Basketry hanaire (kago-hanaire) usually are reserved for use in the warm season, when the chabana will consist of an assortment of seasonal grassy flowers. The chabana may be hung on the back wall of the tokonoma, or on its main <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> (tokobashira), in which cases the hanaire will have a ring attached to the back, or a small hole in the back, for the hook. Also, there are metal and bamboo hanaire designed to be hung by a chain from a hook in the ceiling of the tokonoma. These are generally referred to as tsuri-hanaire, and if they are boat-like, they are referred to as tsuribune (suspended boat).|$|E
50|$|In 1937 {{bodies were}} the same except for drip moldings running {{from the bottom of}} the <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> up and over the doors and rear quarter window, new fenders and bumpers, {{headlights}} rigidly attached (adjusted by moving reflector), wheel discs incorporated a hubcap, and a built-in trunk was incorporated on most bodies. A die-cast eggcrate grille was used, but the hood louver treatment differed from that used in Fisher bodied cars. Chrome die cast strips were used at the rear of the hood side panels. A seven-passenger Fisher-bodied Special touring sedan, without a division window was offered on the 138.0 in wheelbase. These two body styles had the eggcrate hood louvers typical of all Fisher bodied Cadillacs for 1937. The Business car line included eight-passenger versions of these Special sedans plus eight-passenger versions of Fleetwood body styles. The eighth passenger was seated with two others on auxiliary seats. A commercial chassis on a 156.0 in wheelbase was offered. Engine changes included a lighter flywheel, a generator relocated in the vee, an oil filter, a new carburetor with full automatic electric choke, an oil bath cleaner, and a relocated distributor. A new transmission design featured pin-type synchronizers, shifter rails relocated to the side of the case, a cover on the bottom of the case, and an extension integral with the transmission mainshaft. Sales totaled 4,332.|$|E
50|$|The Forum at {{the present}} Meienbergstrasse lane hosted on its eastern side (Rütistrasse) a stone with two {{distinctive}} <b>front</b> <b>pillars.</b> The forum was accessible by a wide staircase and by a double door to the main room. The foundations are rreserved, {{as well as the}} pivots of the door leaf and the locking hole. Due to its central location and the <b>front</b> <b>pillars,</b> the building may also interpreted as a temple. The front of the large square was completed by symmetrical lateral walls. To the west of the plant, there was another stone building with columns, maybe uses as a Curia or temple.Public institutions, such as the spas, are suspected at the area of the present cemetery at the St. Ursula church, and a walled temple precinct with two Gallo-Roman temples, a fire altar and two chapels on the northwest of the settlement at the Seewiese area, then the edge of the settlement on Kempratnerbucht. On the exit road (Rütistrasse-Rebacker) towards Vitudurum, a digger fire field with around 50 burials archaeologically was recorded.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{wind tunnel}} {{measurement}} and numerical simulation of a 50 % scaled sedan model surface pressure distribution {{were made in}} order to provide fundamental data for improving the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation accuracy of the aerodynamic noise related flow field around automobiles. The pressure measurement positions of the wind tunnel experiment were on the side window and the door. The wind tunnel test section speed was 30 m/s at 0 ° yawing angle. As for the CFD simulation, the wind tunnel shape computational domain and four settings of the near wall computational mesh were made. Both the k-ω SST and the Realizable k-ε turbulence models were chosen. And three value ranges of the near wall computational mesh’s dimensionless wall distance (y) were realized. Compared with the experimental data, the pressure coefficient (CP) simulation results showed good agreement with the measurement at the re-attaching region on the side window and the attaching region on the door. But the large CP prediction errors happened in the region of the <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> vortex, the side view mirror wake. It was also shown that the predicted CP values were almost independent of the y value, except the comparatively larger CP predicted errors on the side window obtained by using the k-ω SST turbulent model when the y value ranged from 4 to 7. Further unsteady CFD simulation and the exterior aerodynamic noise measurement need be carried out due to the unsteady features of the separated flows, including the <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> vortex and the side view mirror wake...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{addresses}} {{an experimental}} {{investigation of the}} dynamic and the control of a longitudinal vortex emanating from the <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> of a dihedral bluff body corresponding to a simplified geometry of an automotive vehicle. The control system {{is based on a}} thin rectangular slot located along the lateral edge of the windscreen and provides steady suction or blowing normal to the lateral face of the geometry. Qualitative results obtained with dye visualizations and Schlieren photos provide an overview {{of the impact of the}} control on the topology of the vortex flow. Quantitative Stereo-PIV measurements and unsteady forces measurements are used to characterize the interaction between the control and the longitudinal vortex. Controls that change significantly the topology of the vortex core and reduce aerodynamic drag are identified...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{we propose}} {{the method of}} optimally {{selecting}} material of <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> (A-pillar) and package tray for minimizing weight while satisfying vehicle requirements on static stiffness and dynamic stiffness. First, we formulate a material selection optimization problem. Next, we establish the CAE procedure of evaluating static stiffness and dynamic stiffness. Then, to enhance the efficiency of design work, we integrate and automate the established CAE procedure using a commercial process integration and design optimization (PIDO) tool, PIAnO. For effective optimi-zation, we adopt the approach of metamodel based approximate optimization. As a sampling method, an orthogonal array (OA) is used for selecting sampling points. The response values are evaluated at the sampling points and then these response values are used to generate a metamodel of each response using the radial basis function regression (RBFr). Using the RBFr models, optimization is carried out an evolutionary algorithm that can handle discrete design variables. Material optimization result reveals that the weight is reduced by 49. 8 % while satisfying all the design constraints...|$|E

40|$|Local scour at bridge pillars {{that occurs}} {{continuously}} will cause {{damage to the}} bridge structure. Many forms of pillar {{have been developed to}} minimize local scouring, but yet provide maximum results. Laboratory model has been developed to identify the local scour phenomena on the grouped cylinder pillar by looking at the phenomena with and without pillar protector. The bed of model is using Kampar sand with grain size d 35 = 0, 285 mm, d 50 = 0, 330 mm and d 65 = 0, 380 mm and Gs = 2, 63. Three variations of the flow used in this research is classified on the type of subcritical flow with Froude number ranged from 0, 46354 – 0, 76903. Reynolds number in Fr 1 scored 1658, 416 then included in the transitional flow and turbulent flow occur in Fr 2 scored 3081, 683 and Fr 3 scored 4381, 188. Hjulstorm graphic shows that the granules of gradation used in this research in moving zone. Hydrodynamic flow in pillar causes downflow on the <b>front</b> <b>pillar</b> and wake vortices are formed on the back, so that the presence of these forces will create a horseshoe vortex {{at the bottom of the}} pillar. The equilibrium of scour depth against time function occurred at minute 75. The maximum ratio of scour depth (ds/b) is 2, 9 which occurs in Q 3 P. Pillar protector of curtain type can reduce scour depths of up to 62, 07 %. Sediment transport analysis result prove that the higher Froude number is used the bigger the granules are transported.

His accent was also clean Peninsular. James Grahame, who sat opposite across the chessboard, wore the same vague but recognizable stamp of breeding, though his duck suit was getting ragged and his red silk sash was obviously cheap. He had steady gray eyes, and light hair, a rather prominent nose and a firm mouth. He looked older than his thirty years. The lines on his forehead hinted at stern experience, and his alertness was partly masked by an easy self-control. Walthew was younger, and dressed with scrupulous neatness in duck, with smart tan shoes. His face was mobile, his glance quick but open, and his mouth sensitive; he {{had the look of}} an aristocratic American.|$|R
