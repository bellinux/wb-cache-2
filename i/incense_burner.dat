5|$|A {{variety of}} Buddhist metal {{implements}} and objects have been designated as 19 National Treasures. These include five decorated bronze or copper gongs, struck with wooden sticks during Buddhist rituals, {{a set of}} flower baskets (keko) used in the Buddhist flower-scattering ritual, six pagoda shaped reliquaries, an <b>incense</b> <b>burner,</b> a sutra container, a bowl for offerings, a banner for ceremonial use, the finial of a pilgrim's staff and two sets of implements used in Esoteric Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63. The priestesses carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the phiale (phial or jug), oinochoai (wine jars), thymiaterion (<b>incense</b> <b>burner),</b> {{and in the case}} of E50–51, evidently they have just handed the marshal E49 a kanoun, making the girl the kanephoros. The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E
5|$|Gimbal: The gimbal {{is known}} as the 'Cardan' {{suspension}} after Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), yet it was known long before him. The British scientist Joseph Needham writes that the earliest confirmed use of gimbals in Europe is the 9th century recipe book Little Key of Painting and Belgian chemist and historian of science Mappae clavicula, which mentioned a vase surrounded by rings which allowed it to be undisturbed when in a rolling motion. Needham and BGeorge Sarton both write that an Arabic translation—dated to roughly the era of Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833)—of an ancient Greek work now lost (i.e. Pneumatica) by 3rd-century BC Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (c. 280– c. 220 BC) contains a description of gimbals used to support an inkpot that could wet a pen on any of its sides, yet Needham suspects Arabic interpolation and doubts total authenticity, while Sarton asserts {{that for the most part}} the Arabic translation is faithful to Philo's lost original, hence Philo should be credited with the invention of the gimbal. Around 180 AD, the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) inventor and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) — who also created a rotary fan and zoetrope lamp—invented a 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions', or 'Bedclothes Censer'. This <b>incense</b> <b>burner</b> had a series of metal rings which could be moved in any direction while the burner in the middle remained constantly level. This is the first clear reference in China of the gimbal, although there is a hint in the writing of Sima Xiangru (179–117 BC) that this device existed in the 2nd century BC (i.e., 'the metal rings burning perfume'). The gimbal <b>incense</b> <b>burner</b> is mentioned in subsequent dynasties, while silverwork specimens of gimbal incense burners from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) still exist. In the Liang Dynasty (502–557) there is mention of gimbals used in hinges for doors and windows, while an unnamed artisan presented a warming stove to Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) in 692 which employed gimbals to keep it constantly balanced.|$|E
25|$|Sculptural ceramic art {{includes}} <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> {{and hand}} or mold-made figurines sometimes used as ocarinas. The profusely decorated, elongated Classic <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> from {{the kingdom of}} Palenque - evolved from Early-Classic models - show the modeled face of a deity (usually the jaguar deity of terrestrial fire) or of a king. The elaborate Post-Classic, mold-made effigy <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> especially associated with Mayapan represent standing deities (or priestly deity impersonators) often carrying offerings.|$|R
50|$|Offering 2 was interred {{under the}} north-south {{axis of the}} pyramid {{and appears to be}} a dedicatory {{offering}} before construction began. It consists of five used <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> associated with evidence of the burning of wood and incense. Two of the <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> are cylindrical with applied masks of the sun god, with traces of red and blue paint, this were placed on either side of three effigy <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> shaped like human figures.

5|$|Structure 4 is {{an unusual}} {{combination}} of temple and palace. It is situated on the southeast side of Plaza 2. The structure consists of a central pyramidal base flanked by two attached range structures. The pyramidal base is topped by a shrine containing three rooms, the final room of the three is circular. The temple has three steep stairways flanked by balustrades. The main stairway ascends directly from the plaza, those on either side are perpendicular to the main stairway. The balustrade of each stairway terminates at the top in a vertical panel. The temple facade is in good condition although {{the roof of the}} temple is missing. The range structures are unequal in size and each contains a single long room atop a low platform. The facade of each of these rooms once possessed a row of columns although only stumps remain in situ. This temple-palace is K'iche' in style and has been identified with the Nija'ib' lineage of the K'iche', being very similar to the Temple of Awilix at Q'umarkaj. A tomb was excavated in Structure 4, it consisted of a complete skeleton with associated offerings that included two tripod earthenware bowls, one with duck effigies, a tripod <b>incense</b> <b>burner,</b> a flint knife, nine obsidian knives, five jade beads and some fragments of gold.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the tea ceremony among the ruling class had a significant influence on ceramic production. To satisfy the demand for high quality pottery items necessary to the tea ceremony {{a large number of}} celadon vases and tenmoku ash-glazed teabowls initially were imported from China from the mid-11th to the 16th centuries. These imported items were copied and produced locally at the Seto kiln in Owari Province. Around the mid-16th century adjacent Mino took over as a production center of conservative Chinese inspired Seto style pottery. The Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592–1598, and subsequent relocation of Korean potters to Kyushu, brought new pottery styles to Japan. From the late-16th century, Mino potters developed new, distinctly Japanese techniques such as Shino ware or Raku ware. This was also motivated by a general shift of tastes among teamasters and others, who came to prefer simpler unglazed tea bowls formed by hand rather than on a pottery wheel. Of the 14 pottery items in this list, eight entries are chawan bowls used in the tea ceremony, three are flower vases, one is an <b>incense</b> <b>burner,</b> one a tea-leaf jar and one a funerary pot. Eight objects originated in China, five in Japan and one in Korea.|$|E

40|$|<b>Incense</b> <b>burners</b> are {{ceremonial}} vessels {{considered to}} be part of the archaeological study of artifacts. Through them and their contexts, possible interpretations may be posited associated with the religious practices of the ancient inhabitants. Furthermore, they are valuable because they reflect iconographic issues linked to the symbology and cosmovision of the prehispanic world. In archaeology, <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> are defined like containers that were used to burn natural aromatic resins, without disregarding the possibility that they may have also been used to deposit other types of offerings. Actually, the majority of the <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> found by archaeologists were made of mud and stone, but there is also evidence of others manufactured with wood, jade, and even rubber (Rice 1999 : 25). <b>Incense</b> <b>burners</b> vary greatly in terms of shape. The most important part is the receptacle, which may present a variety of forms such as that of a bowl, a dish, a vase, or a flat surface. This basic form may include handles, bases, pedestals, lids, and/or flanges. Also, designs of human figures, animals, or a blend of both aimed at forming effigies and faces can be included (Rice 1999 : 25). This study was mainly focused on the rim-heads <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> from Escuintla. We had the opportunity to excavate a small site called Quebrada La Culebra located at Nueva Concepción, in the banks of an affluent of the Coyolate known as Cardoza River. There, a substantial sample of fragments and <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> was gathered. With these data and the available ceramic collections from Escuintla, an analysis of the <b>incense</b> <b>burners</b> was undertaken to find out about their function and meaning in the prehispanic world.

25|$|These landscapes are sumi-e—ink paintings—done on silk, a {{relatively}} expensive medium reflecting {{the status of}} the artist and patron. They are mounted as kakejiku or kakemono, vertical wall hangings. This type of painting would typically be hung in a tokonoma alcove, sometimes foregrounded by a seasonal flower arrangement and decorative <b>incense</b> <b>burner.</b> Kakemono were usually hung low, as they were intended to be viewed while frontally seated at the distance of a tatami mat width (approximately 90cm). Although kakejiku were objects of decoration, their lack of elaboration reflects their secondary purpose as objects to stimulate quiet contemplation.|$|E

He thinks it is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi'er and other despotisms. He is so frightened that he is literally paralyzed.
