5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean <b>economic</b> <b>reforms.</b> While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce <b>economic</b> <b>reforms</b> by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success <b>economic</b> <b>reforms</b> have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E

40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>reform</b> - the {{introduction}} of elements of the market into a planned economy - has been the central political problem for socialist states {{for at least three}} decades. This thesis seeks to elucidate the nature of the problem through a reconsideration of the general theoretical issues, and through a comparative analysis of the practice of <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> in two countries - Czechoslovakia and Hungary. In Part One, the arguments in favour of the use of the market in socialism are recapitulated, and the implications of various socialist economic models for political freedom, democracy, and the realisation of some concept of the 'social interest 1 are discussed. The case studies presented in Part Two address the practical political problem of introducing market-type reform into communist systems. In Czechoslovakia, the issue of <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> contributed to a profound political crisis culminating in 1968. But it is argued, <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> was not the only, or even the most important source of the crisis. In the different political conditions in Hungary, <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> was embraced by the regime as a means of securing political stability and popular legitimacy. Political crisis was avoided, but at the costof compromise in the <b>economic</b> <b>reform.</b> The conclusion is that while full-scale democratisation of the political system may not be an inevitable concomitant of <b>economic</b> <b>reform,</b> profound changes in the style and instruments of communist rule are required...|$|R

Showing how <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> {{has become the}} central issue on the German political agenda, raising contentious issues of policy management and posing deeper questions about political beliefs and identities. It also examines {{the politics of the}} reform process, outlining competing views about the root causes of Germany’s economic problems, the appropriate policy responses, and the distribution of costs. It situates the reform process in the wider context of the decline of the German economic model (Modell Deutschland) and Germany’s transition from European ‘pace-setter’ to economic ‘laggard’. Particular attention is paid to the following key questions: * What continuities and discontinuities can be seen in Germany's political economy? * Are globalization and Europeanization associated with a progressive neo-liberal ascendancy in <b>economic</b> <b>reform?</b> * How does <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> in Germany compare with that in other states, notably Britain and France? * Are there distinctive patterns in the way domestic policymakers negotiate <b>economic</b> <b>reform?</b> * How do the characteristics of the German labour market and welfare state condition <b>economic</b> <b>reform?</b> * How much variation exists at the Laender levels?

40|$|The {{debate on}} the {{political}} obstacles to <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> in postcommunist countries has cen-tered around two interrelated theories. Adam Przeworski argues that short-term negative distri-butional consequences can stall <b>economic</b> <b>reform.</b> Joel Hellman contends that industry insiders and political elites have incentives to stall <b>economic</b> <b>reform.</b> Although both sets of theories con-tend that the distributional aspects of <b>economic</b> transition affect <b>reform,</b> important differences remain in their interpretation {{of the relationship between}} the rising levels of poverty and income inequality in transition economies. This article empirically examines the relationship between the pretransition levels of poverty and income inequality in 17 postcommunist transition econo-mies using cross-sectional regressions. The central finding in this article is that countries with large spans of the population hovering above poverty are less likely to achieve high levels of eco-nomic reform, lending support to theory that adverse socioeconomic conditions prior to transi-tion can impede <b>economic</b> <b>reform...</b>|$|R
