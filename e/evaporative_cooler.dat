25|$|A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a {{multistage}} <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooler.</b> The air {{is passed}} through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again.

Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50°F (28°C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of forced ventilation and <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> on the physiological and production responses of dairy cows Holstein × Zebu. Experiments were conducted with 32 crossbred cows (Holstein × Zebu) in the same lactation phase, mean daily production of 17 kg and mean body weight of 550 kg. Four different treatments {{were randomly assigned to}} groups with eight cows each. The treatments were: <b>Evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> in the waiting room + forced ventilation with <b>Evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> in the milking room (NW+VNM), <b>Evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> in the waiting room (NW), forced ventilation with <b>Evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> in the milking room (VNM) and a control treatment without forced ventilation and <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> (CON). Experimental work was realised in a commercial farm located in the interior of Bahia State, Brazil, during 45 days in January and February. Climatic data were measured using a meteorological station. Temperature Humidity Index (THI) and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) were calculated. In order to study animal responses milk production, udder temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature of white and black spots and rectal temperature were measured. It was observed that the cows under VNM treatment presented higher milk production and lower udder temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature of white and black spots.
