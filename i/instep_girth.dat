40|$|BackgroundKnowledge {{of gender}} {{differences}} in foot shape assists shoe manufactures with designing appropriate shoes for men and women. Although gender differences in foot shapes are relatively known among young men and women, less is known about how the older men and women’s feet differ in shape. A recent development in foot shape assessment {{is the use of}} 3 D foot scanners. To our knowledge this technology has yet to be used to examine gender differences in foot shape of Japanese older adults. MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 151 older men (74. 5 [*]±[*] 5. 6 years) and 140 older women (73. 9 [*]±[*] 5. 1 years) recruited in Kasama City, Japan. Foot variables were measured in sitting and standing positions using Dream GP Incorporated’s 3 D foot scanner, Footstep PRO (Osaka, Japan). Scores were analyzed as both raw and normalized to truncated foot length using independent samples t-test and analysis of covariance, respectively. ResultsIn men, the measurement values for navicular height, first and fifth toe and instep heights, ball and heel width, ball girth, arch height index (just standing), arch rigidity index and <b>instep</b> <b>girth</b> were significantly greater than the women’s, whereas the first toe angle, in both sitting and standing positions was significantly smaller. However, after normalizing, the differences in ball width, heel width, height of first and fifth toes in both sitting and standing and ball girth in sitting position were nonsignificant. According to Cohen’s d, among all the foot variables, the following had large effect sizes in both sitting and standing positions: truncated foot length, instep, navicular height, foot length, ball girth, ball width, heel width and <b>instep</b> <b>girth.</b> ConclusionThis study provides evidence of anthropometric foot variations between older men and women. These differences need to be considered when manufacturing shoes for older adults...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} compilation of size standard of Indonesian children shoes, for it is abviously that the available size systems currently, such as English system, American system and French system are not suitable with Indonesian foot sizes. Samples of the research were taken from children foot sizes of DIY using area purposive sampling, while data analvsis method used was Statistical of M (Mean) and SD (Standard of Deviation). The foot size data were calculated using comparison parameter of breadth to length size, joint girth, <b>instep</b> <b>girth</b> and short heel. Result of the research showed that the increase of each size number was 6, 75 mm; breadth figure and joint, girth size got a raise in, successivelv of 2, 75 mm and 6, 25 mm in harmonv for each size number, which were classififield into narrow. medium and wide fitting...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{subjected}} to 500 Indonesia School boy of North- Sumatra Province (Medan), West Java Province (Bandung), Central-Java Province (Semarang), East-Java Province (Surabaya) and DKI Jaya. 100 samples of foot sizes which represented foot sizes of SD, SLTP, and SLTA School boy werw taken from each province. By analyzing the data of foot sizes of the school man, a suggestion on design of shoe lasts seritable with the shape and type of foot, fits and conform the requirements {{to be used as}} lost in shoe manufacturing could be proposed. The results of data analyse shown that : 1. The length of soles ranged from 30 - 37 ps, the mean of which was 34 ps. 2. <b>Instep</b> <b>girth</b> ranged withim F,G,H,I,J,K. 3. The foot sizes scattered between (8 - 12) years of age at (31 - 32) ps...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{accuracy}} and the repeatability of measures made by means of a stereophotogrammetric equipment and processed by a special software developed within the EUROShoE project (Growth Programme, European Commission), with the purpose to collect three-dimensional data from the surface of the foot. A prosthetic foot was marked with black stickers (5 mm diameter) corresponding to 10 anatomical landmarks, and repeated acquisitions of its surface were performed within a day and through days. Measures of the distance between pairs of markers were made manually on the artificial foot and estimated through the acquired surface data. The mean accuracy computed on 14 distances was 1. 1 mm (SD = 1. 2). The intra and inter day variability was assessed by considering repeated measures of conventional shoe making variables (e. g. stick length, ball <b>girth,</b> <b>instep</b> girth,…) produced by using dedicated software. The results, expressed in term of coefficients of variation, ranged between 0. 2 and 0. 8 %. The achieved results demonstrate that the equipment and the software ensure adequate measures for the shoe making process (i. e. characterization and choice of the last) and for an easy detection of the human foot surface. Both of them are key steps for the implementation of best fit or custom made shoe production, even if attention must be paid to enviromental settings during data collection in a retail shop contest...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, when {{manufacturers}} are designing online MC options, {{they also need}} to make the process interesting and convenient by providing an easy-to-follow option with clear guidelines. This would facilitate consumers’ ability to find the exact athletic shoes they want. Furthermore, when examining college students’ preferences for levels of customization, the results showed that 63.91 % participants preferred best-matched fit customization, indicating that they desire both functionally useful and aesthetically appealing athletic shoes. To date, major athletic shoe companies provide style customization, but not all of them offer best-matched fit customization beyond the normal selection of sizes. It has been assumed commonly that best-matched fit customization can be fulfilled better in physical stores than online, which may limit the wide acceptance of online MC for purchasing athletic shoes (Boër and Dulio 2007). Thus, the acceptance of online MC depends on offering both functional and aesthetic customization options. Therefore, athletic shoe companies need to work on providing best-matched fit customization options. If athletic shoe companies implement best-matched fit customization in online MC, consumers will be encouraged to measure certain parts of their feet (such as net foot length, flat ball width, ball girth, and <b>instep</b> <b>girth)</b> and input these measurements into the online MC system. Then, the system will compare the consumers’ feet with the lasts in the library and find the closest last. In this way, best-matched fit customization in online mass-customized athletic shoes could be achieved, and the utilitarian factor of these shoes would be enhanced.|$|E
