40|$|A {{repairable}} {{system is}} a system that can be restored to an operational state after a repair event. The system may experience multiple events over time, which are called recurrent events. To model the recurrent event <b>data,</b> the <b>renewal</b> process (RP), the nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), and the trend-renewal process (TRP) are often used. Compared to the RP and NHPP, the TRP is more flexible for modeling, because it includes both RP and NHPP as special cases. However, for a multi-level system (e. g., system, subsystem, and component levels), the original TRP model may not be adequate if the repair is effected by a subsystem replacement and if subsystem level replacement events affect the rate of occurrence of the component-level replacement events. In this paper, we propose a general class of models to describe replacement events in a multilevel repairable system by extending the TRP model. We also develop procedures for estimation of model parameters and prediction of future events based on historical data.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} this paper are to estimate and analyse the private value of patent rights in the United Kingdom, France and Germany during the post- 1950 period, and to provide and consider some implications of an index of the `quality' (or average private value) of patents. Since patent rights are seldom marketed, their private value is in general unobserved. This paper makes inferences {{on the value of}} patent rights from the economic responses of patentees. in most countries patentees must pay an annual renewal fee in order to keep their patents in force. If it is assumed that agents make renewal decisions based on the value of the patent right obtained by <b>renewal,</b> then <b>data</b> on patent <b>renewals</b> and renewal fee schedules contain information on the distribution of the value of patent rights. In Section I we outline a simple economic model of patent renewal decisions which, when combined with the <b>renewal</b> <b>data,</b> allows us to estimate the distribution of the private value of patent protection. Section II describes the data set and provides some simple nonparametric evidence on shifts in the patent value distribution over time. In Section III we parameterise the model, and then present and discuss the estimates. This includes some discussion of the empirical correlates of intertemporal changes in the value distribution. Section IV derives estimates of the quantiles of the distribution of the value of patent rights, and compares our results to information on both the distribution of the value of patented ideas and on the resource cost of producing them. Section V considers some implications of our results for the distinction between measures of the quantity and the value of patents. The results indicate that the average value of patents varies across countries. We also use the estimates {{to examine the relationship between}} the decline in patenting activity since the late 1960 s, the simultaneous fall in patents per unit of inventive output...|$|R

The longer run downward trend in patents per R&D dollar is interpreted not as an indication of diminishing returns but rather as a reflection of the changing meaning of such data over time. The conclusion is reached that, in spite of many difficulties and reservations, patent data remain a unique resource for the study of technical change. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of motorway renewal costs {{presented in this}} paper was driven by two research questions: First, to analyse the economic process of motorway renewal work and to identify whether there exist economies of scale; and second to identify the influence of traffic volume on renewal costs and to derive an estimate of marginal infrastructure costs as part of optimal road user charges. The analysis is based on cross-sectional <b>data</b> for motorway <b>renewal</b> costs and traffic volume in Germany during the period 1980 - 1999. Two translog models were estimated, each of them including the factor input prices for labour, material and capital, and a set of regional dummy variables as well as dummy variables for the type of material used for renewal. The first model includes in addition to these variables the sqm of renewed road as explanatory variable. The second model was constructed to analyse the relationship between traffic volume and renewal costs and contains the average annual daily traffic volume of trucks and passenger cars as independent variables. Two main results were derived from the models: First, motorway renewal work is characterised by substantial economies of scale. Second, the relationship between renewal costs and traffic volume is expressed by a cost elasticity, i. e., the ratio between marginal and average costs, which ranges from 0. 05 up to 1. 17 with a digressive increase of marginal costs. ...|$|R

Besides a much-needed shift in mindset, legacy planning methodology holds the key. This chronic issue is gaining renewed attention with the recent rise of new-generation hosts such as China where massive event-led construction was fast-tracked in a top-down fashion. What remains less understood is the impact and implications of such a forceful paradigm on legacy planning and urban renewal. This paper aims to address this gap with an in-depth case study of Expo 2010 Shanghai China. The central theme is to investigate how this paradigm has been adopted to a previous dockland selected as the Expo 2010 site and a catalyst for city-branding oriented urban <b>renewal.</b> <b>Data</b> was sourced from 2004 to 2015 from personal observations, strategic policies, planning documents, photo documentation, and meetings and interviews.

I propose {{that a real}} options perspective can provide {{an effective means of}} re-examining and revising firms‘ strategic investment decisions in general, and of making individual, investment-level abandonment decisions in particular. The principal purposes of this research are to explore whether firms make abandonment decisions in accordance with real options theory, and the relative strength of the traditional economic theory, the behavioral theory of the firm and real options theory in explaining firms‘ abandonment decisions. I develop a set of hypotheses in the context of firms‘ R 2 ̆ 6 D investment strategies in the world chemical industry. Using U.

The results from the empirical analyses suggest that, 1) firms‘ actual innovation abandonment decisions are consistent with the predictions made from real options theory; and 2) a real options perspective provides better explanation of firms‘ abandonment decisions than traditional economic theory and the behavioral theory of the firm. Therefore, taking such a perspective allows us to better predict abandonment than the other models. In investigating whether insights from real options theory enlighten firm‘s abandonment decisions, this research contributes to the strategic decision making literature, real options research, RBV and dynamic capability research and innovation literature...|$|R

A {{growing body of}} literature has emerged {{on the issue of}} marginal infrastructure wear and tear costs, but the majority of the work is focused on costs for infrastructure maintenance. Railway track renewals are a substantial part of an infrastructure manager 9 ̆ 2 s budget, but in disaggregated statistical analyses, they cause problems for traditional regression models since there is a piling up of values of the dependent variable at zero. Previous econometric work has sought to circumvent the problem by aggregation in some way. In this paper we work with disaggregate (track-section) data, including the zero observations, but apply censored and sample selection regression models to overcome the bias that would result from estimation using OLS. We derive track renewal cost elasticities with respect to traffic volumes and in turn marginal renewal costs using Swedish railway <b>renewal</b> <b>data</b> over the period 1999 to 2009. Our paper is the first paper in the literature that we are aware of to report usage elasticities specifically for renewal costs and therefore adds important new evidence to the previous literature where there is a paucity of studies on renewals and considerable uncertainty over the effects of rail traffic on renewal costs. In the Swedish context, we find that the inclusion of marginal track renewal costs in the track access pricing regime, which currently only reflects marginal maintenance costs, would add substantially to the existing track access charge...|$|R

Aircraft engines can be more economically maintained and resources can be saved if the maintenance process is improved. The starting point is an optimization model suggesting what parts in the engine that should be replaced at each maintenance time. The input data is the age of the details in the engine. Statistical models are developed that estimates the remaining life of the components in the engine. The models work with different kinds of data. The first data set only contains times between repairs and is modeled with a non-stationary renewal process and a non-homogeneous Poisson process. With our <b>data</b> the non-stationary <b>renewal</b> process works better. Different repair stations affect the life of the components, which the non-stationary renewal process manages to model. This model also manages the aging component problem in an effective way. However, in this case no aging is present other than substantial degeneration after the first repair. The second dataset contains crack growth data. The remaining life is modeled with a empirical crack growth model. With data directly indicating the condition of the detail a more precise estimate of the reaming life can be made. In order to get an interface with the optimization model the distributions need to be discrete. Four methods to make discretizations are discussed and adapted to suit the model. The methods are compared and the choice concerning the number of points of support is discussed. Finally the consequence of using a narrow scenario tree is commented upon...|$|R

Given the strategic and financial importance of season ticket holders (STH) to professional sport teams, this paper examines {{the effectiveness of a}} range of variables in identifying the STH {{who are most likely to}} churn. Research methods: A longitudinal field study was undertaken to reflect actual conditions. Survey data of a professional sport team STH were collected prior to the conclusion of the season. Actual <b>renewal</b> <b>data</b> were then tracked from team records the following season. This work was replicated across five professional sport teams from the Australian Football League, with renewal predictions made and tracked for over 10, 000 STH. Results and findings: The results suggest that the ‘Juster’ Scale – a simple, one-item purchase probability measure – is an effective identifier of those most at risk of churning, more than 3 months in advance. When combined with ticket utilization and tenure measures, predictive accuracy improves markedly, to the point where these three measures can be used to provide an effective early warning system for managers. Implications: Whilst there is a tendency to view STH as highly loyal, these data reinforce the importance of actively managing all customers to reduce churn. Despite their commitment, STH do churn, but those most likely to can be predicted by examining their patterns of behaviour in the current season. Efforts to retain STH need to shift their focus from transactional value assessments. <br /...|$|R

Firstly, we performed a tomographic inversion on the whole dataset consisting of 1, 035 local earthquakes occurred from July 2001 to January 2003, combining 14, 205 P-wave and 3, 337 S-wave arrival time differences. After, we separately analysed the 2001, 2002 - 2003 and intra eruptive datasets to obtain the tomographic images in the three distinct periods. The tomographic inversion during the eruptive periods revealed the presence of anomalous volumes with very low Vp/Vs (values as small as 1. 64) located in the same place of the 2001 and the 2002 - 2003 dike intrusions also evidenced by attenuation tomographies and modeled by geodetic data. We suggest that these anomalies trace the intrusion of volatile-rich magma leading to these peculiar explosive eruptions. In the tomograms related to the intra-eruptive period some variations in the elastic parameters have also been observed. The analysis of the geodetic and seismic deformation pattern in the intra eruptive period suggested that during 2001 – 2003 period the active deformation at Mt Etna has been continuous, excluding a brief period of deflation following the 2001 eruption. In fact, after this period, the seismicity rate remained high, the geodetic <b>data</b> showed a <b>renewal</b> of the areal dilatation, suggesting a new magma upraising from depth causing an overpressure in the shallow reservoir which triggered the 2002 - 2003 eruption...|$|R
