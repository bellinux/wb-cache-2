5000|$|By far {{the most}} {{significant}} works on <b>defeasibility</b> by the mid-1970s were in epistemology, where John Pollock's 1974 Knowledge and Justification popularized his terminology of undercutting and rebutting (which mirrored the analysis of Toulmin). Pollock's work was significant precisely because it brought <b>defeasibility</b> so close to philosophical logicians. The failure of logicians to dismiss <b>defeasibility</b> in epistemology (as Cambridge's logicians had done to Hart decades earlier) landed defeasible reasoning in the philosophical mainstream.|$|E

50|$|<b>Defeasibility</b> as a {{means of}} {{controlling}} an investigative or social process: Here, justification {{is the result of the}} right kind of procedure (e.g., a fair and efficient hearing), and defeasible reasoning provides impetus for pro and con responses to each other. <b>Defeasibility</b> has to do with the alternation of verdict as locutions are made and cases presented, not the changing of a mind with respect to new (empirical) discovery. Under this view, defeasible reasoning and defeasible argumentation refer to the same phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Defeasibility</b> as an anytime algorithm: Here, it {{is assumed}} that calculating {{arguments}} takes time, and at any given time, based on a subset of the potentially constructible arguments, a conclusion is defeasibly justified. Isaac Levi has protested against this kind of <b>defeasibility,</b> but it is well-suited to the heuristic projects of, for example, Herbert A. Simon. On this view, the best move so far in a chess-playing program's analysis at a particular depth is a defeasibly justified conclusion. This interpretation works with either the prior or the next semantical view.|$|E
5000|$|In logic, defeasible {{reasoning}} {{is a kind}} of reasoning that is rationally compelling though not deductively valid. The distinction between <b>defeasibility</b> and indefeasibility may be seen {{in the context of this}} joke: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Defeasibility</b> as corrigibility: Here, {{a person}} learns {{something}} new that annuls a prior inference. In this case, defeasible reasoning provides a constructive mechanism for belief revision, like a {{truth maintenance system}} as envisioned by Jon Doyle.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} time (in the mid-1960s), two more {{students}} of Hart and Austin at Oxford, Brian Barry and David Gauthier, were applying defeasible reasoning to political argument and practical reasoning (of action), respectively. Joel Feinberg and Joseph Raz were beginning to produce equally mature works in ethics and jurisprudence informed by <b>defeasibility.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Guilt" [...] is the {{obligation}} {{of a person who}} has violated a moral standard to bear the sanctions imposed by that moral standard. In legal terms, guilt means having been found to have violated a criminal law, though law also raises 'the issue of defences, pleas, the mitigation of offences, and the <b>defeasibility</b> of claims'.|$|E
5000|$|In modern argumentation theories, {{arguments}} {{are regarded as}} defeasible passages from premises to a conclusion. <b>Defeasibility</b> means that when additional information (new evidence or contrary arguments) is provided, the premises may be no longer lead to the conclusion (non-monotonic reasoning). This type of reasoning {{is referred to as}} defeasible reasoning. For instance we consider the famous Tweedy example: ...|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{distinct}} difference between those who theorize about defeasible reasoning {{as if it were}} a system of confirmational revision (with affinities to belief revision), and those who theorize about <b>defeasibility</b> as if it were the result of further (non-empirical) investigation. There are at least three kinds of further non-empirical investigation: progress in a lexical/syntactic process, progress in a computational process, and progress in an adversary or legal proceeding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Defeasibility</b> {{had always}} been closely related to argument, rhetoric, and law, except in epistemology, where the chains of reasons, and the origin of reasons, were not often discussed. Nicholas Rescher's Dialectics {{is an example of}} how {{difficult}} it was for philosophers to contemplate more complex systems of defeasible reasoning. This was in part because proponents of informal logic became the keepers of argument and rhetoric while insisting that formalism was anathema to argument.|$|E
50|$|Philosophers {{in moral}} theory and rhetoric had taken <b>defeasibility</b> largely for granted when American epistemologists rediscovered Wittgenstein's {{thinking}} on the subject: John Ladd, Roderick Chisholm, Roderick Firth, Ernest Sosa, Robert Nozick, and John L. Pollock all began writing with new conviction about how appearance as red was only a defeasible reason for believing something to be red. More importantly Wittgenstein's orientation toward language-games (and away from semantics) emboldened these epistemologists to manage rather than to expurgate prima facie logical inconsistency.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Defeasibility</b> is the {{property}} of something - such as a contract, a proposition or an understanding - that can be annulled, invalidated, or similarly [...] "defeated". In law, {{it refers to the}} possibility of a contract or other legal agreement being terminated by circumstances that arise later, or of legal reasoning being overturned. In philosophy - especially in epistemology, ethics, or the philosophy of law - it refers to the possibility of a particular principle, rule or understanding being overridden in appropriate circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Both {{situational}} crisis {{communication theory}} and image repair theory assume organizations should protect their reputation and image through appropriate {{responses to the}} crisis. Therefore, how to draft effective message to defend the crisis becomes {{the focal point of}} crisis communication research. Image repair theory provides series of options that organizations usually adopt including denial, evade responsibility, reduce offensiveness, corrective action, and mortification. Specifically, denial strategy contains two sub-strategies, simple denial and shift blame. Evade responsibility strategy includes provocation, <b>defeasibility,</b> accident, good intention. Reduce offensiveness strategy garners bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, attack accuser, and compensation.|$|E
50|$|The {{etymology}} of defeasible usually {{refers to}} Middle English law of contracts, where {{a condition of}} defeasance is a clause that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though defeat, dominate, defer, defy, deprecate and derogate are often {{used in the same}} contexts as defeasible, the verbs annul and invalidate (and nullify, overturn, rescind, vacate, repeal, debar, void, cancel, countermand, preempt, etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of <b>defeasibility</b> than those words beginning with the letter d. Many dictionaries do contain the verb, to defease with past participle, defeased.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Defeasibility</b> as {{shorthand}} for preconditions: Here, {{the author of}} a set of rules or legislative code is writing rules with exceptions. Sometimes a set of defeasible rules can be rewritten, with more cogency, with explicit (local) pre-conditions instead of (non-local) competing rules. Many non-monotonic systems with fixed-point or preferential semantics fit this view. However, sometimes the rules govern a process of argument (the last view on this list), so that they cannot be re-compiled into a set of deductive rules lest they lose their force in situations with incomplete knowledge or incomplete derivation of preconditions.|$|E
5000|$|Yet another {{possible}} {{candidate for the}} fourth condition of knowledge is indefeasibility. <b>Defeasibility</b> theory maintains {{that there should be}} no overriding or defeating truths for the reasons that justify one's belief. For example, suppose that person S believes he saw Tom Grabit steal a book from the library and uses this to justify the claim that Tom Grabit stole a book from the library. A possible defeater or overriding proposition for such a claim could be a true proposition like, [...] "Tom Grabit's identical twin Sam is currently in the same town as Tom." [...] When no defeaters of one's justification exist, a subject would be epistemologically justified.|$|E
5000|$|Klein {{is widely}} {{known for his}} work on skepticism. His most {{influential}} work, however, is on the nature of knowledge, where he has long defended the <b>defeasibility</b> theory. His recent work defends infinitism about justification. On this view, to be justified in believing P is to possess a reason R1 to believe P, and a reason R2 to believe R1, and a reason R3.....and so on, ad infinitum. Justification is, so to speak, [...] "turtles all the way down." [...] He has also recently advocated a picture of knowledge according to which one can have knowledge of p even if the justification for the belief that p is essentially based on false premises. Klein calls these [...] "useful falsehoods".|$|E
5000|$|Knowledge and Justification is {{the book}} that {{established}} Pollock as a major figure in epistemology. It appeared {{at a time when}} American philosophy, and especially American epistemology, was obsessed with criteria and the analysis of {{what does it mean to}} know?. The Gettier problem, for example, was one of the most popular problems of the day: why is it that knowledge is not exactly [...] "justified, true belief"? Pollock's book steps back from analytic criteria, which are presumably necessary and sufficient conditions. His epistemic norms are governed by defeasible reasoning; they are ceteris paribus conditions that can admit exceptions. Several other epistemologists (notably at Brown University, such as Ernest Sosa,and especially Roderick Chisholm), as well as his Arizona colleague Keith Lehrer, had written about <b>defeasibility</b> and epistemology. But Pollock's book, which combined a broad scope and a crucial innovation, brought the ideas into the philosophical mainstream.|$|E
5000|$|Keith Lehrer and Thomas Paxson (1969) {{proposed}} another response, {{by adding}} a <b>defeasibility</b> condition to the JTB analysis. On their account, knowledge is undefeated justified true belief — {{which is to say}} that a justified true belief counts as knowledge if and only if it is also the case that there is no further truth that, had the subject known it, would have defeated her present justification for the belief. (Thus, for example, Smiths justification for believing that the person who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket is his justified belief that Jones will get the job, combined with his justified belief that Jones has ten coins in his pocket. But if Smith had known the truth that Jones will not get the job, that would have defeated the justification for his belief.) However, many critics (such as Marshall Swain 1974) have argued that the notion of a defeater fact cannot be made precise enough to rule out the Gettier cases without also ruling out a priori cases of knowledge [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{notion of}} meta-explanation is {{important}} in behavioral scenarios that involve conflicting agents. In these scenarios, implicit of or explicit conflict {{can be caused by}} contradictory agents' interests, as communicated in their explanations for why they behaved in a particular way, by a lack of knowledge of the situation, or by a mixture of explanations of multiple factors. In many cases to assess the plausibility of explanations, one must analyze two following components and their interrelations: (1) explanation at the actual object level (explanation itself) and (2) explanation at the higher level (meta-explanation). Comparative analysis of the roles of both is conducted to assess the plausibility of how agents explain the scenarios of their interactions. Object-level explanation assesses the plausibility of individual claims by using a traditional approach to handle argumentative structure of a dialog. Meta-explanation links the structure of a current scenario with that of previously learned scenarios of multi-agent interaction. The scenario structure includes agents' communicative actions and argumentation defeat relations between the subjects of these actions. The data for both object-level and meta-explanation can be visually specified,and a plausibility of how agent behavior in a scenario can be visually explained. Meta-explanation in the form of machine learning of scenario structure can be augmented by conventional explanation by finding arguments in the form of <b>defeasibility</b> analysis of individual claims, to increase the accuracy of plausibility assessment.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} collects five {{papers that}} discuss potential {{consequences of the}} <b>defeasibility</b> of knowledge. Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 5 provide arguments {{for a number of}} important epistemological consequences of the <b>defeasibility</b> of knowledge. Chapter 4 discusses consequences that others have claimed the <b>defeasibility</b> of knowledge to have. Chapter 1 argues that closure principles for knowledge are in tension with the <b>defeasibility</b> of knowledge. Chapter 2 argues that one of Williamson's famous arguments against the KK principle relies in a problematic way on a closure principle that is incompatible with defeat. Chapter 3 argues that a view on which knowledge just is belief safe from error is in tension the <b>defeasibility</b> of knowledge. Chapter 4 discusses two arguments to the effect that defeat by higher-order evidence sometimes involves the violation of rational ideals or rules of rational belief formation. As part of a response to an objection to contextualism about 'know', Chapter 5 investigates a number of social epistemological consequences of the <b>defeasibility</b> of knowledge.

He permits an ethical override of the logic and language of law, as a strongly desirable power granted the wise jurist in a system that is truly justice-seeking. The most significant push for <b>defeasibility</b> has been felt in the community that has attempted to model legal reasoning with computer programs. The AI and Law community, an international group of interdisciplinarians, visited the concept of <b>defeasibility</b> two decades ago.

40|$|In one {{standard}} sense, <b>defeasibility</b> is {{a feature of}} inferences, and one that seems to defy classical first order logic: An inference is defeasible when its putative conclusion is rendered doubtful {{by the addition of}} premises (thus violating monotonicity). The main argument of this paper is that certain types of inferences are defeasible in ways that render the putative conclusion genuinely indeterminate. The discussion, and most of the examples, focus on pragmatic inferences, legal inferences and on some overlapping cases, that is, cases in which legal <b>defeasibility</b> is actually a matter of pragmatics. I also argue that legal presumptions and the open-endedness of possible exceptions to legal rules behave differently, and are not susceptible to the kind of <b>defeasibility</b> discussed here. The upshot of the discussion is to show that <b>defeasibility</b> in law sometimes generates a genuine kind of legal indeterminacy. From a legal point of view, the conclusion would be neither here nor there. In such cases, decision-makers must make their judgments on the basis of considerations not dictated by the relevant law...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{approaches}} to defeasible reasoning {{have been concerned}} mostly with one aspect of <b>defeasibility,</b> viz. that of arguments, in which {{the focus is on}} normal-ity of the premise. In this paper we are interested in an-other aspect of <b>defeasibility,</b> namely that of defeasible modes of reasoning. We do this by adopting a preferen-tial modal semantics that we defined in previous work and which allows us to refer to the relative normality of accessible worlds. This leads us to define preferen-tial versions of the traditional notions of knowledge, be-liefs, obligations and actions, to name a few, as studied in modal logics. The resulting preferential modal logics make it possible to capture, and reason with, aspects of <b>defeasibility</b> heretofore beyond the reach of modal for-malisms...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give a general {{analysis}} of dyadic deontic logics that {{were introduced in}} the early seventies to formalize deontic reasoning about subideal behavior. Recently it was observed that they are closely related to nonmonotonic logics, theories of diagnosis and decision theories. In particular, we argue that two types of <b>defeasibility</b> must be distinguished in a defeasible deontic logic: overridden <b>defeasibility</b> that formalizes cancelling of an obligation by other conditional obligations and factual <b>defeasibility</b> that formalizes overshadowing of an obligation by a violating fact. We also show that this distinction is essential for an adequate analysis of notorious `paradoxes' of deontic logic such as the Chisholm and Forrester `Paradoxes'. 1 Introduction In recent years defeasible deontic logic has become increasingly popular as a tool to model legal reasoning in expert systems [McCarty, 1992; Meyer and Wieringa, 1994; Jones and Sergot, 1994], because defeasible reasoning i [...] ...|$|E
40|$|When a {{legal rule}} {{requires}} us to drive on the right, notarize our wills, or refrain from selling bootleg liquor, {{how are we to}} describe and understand that requirement? In particular, how does the logical form of such a requirement relate to the logical form of other requirements, such as moral requirements, or the requirements of logic itself? When a general legal rule is applied or distinguished in a particular case, how can we describe that process in logical form? Such questions have come to preoccupy modern legal philosophy as its methodology, drawing on the philosophy of logic, becomes ever more sophisticated. This book gathers together some of the most prominent legal philosophers in the Anglo-American and civil law traditions to analyse the logical structure of legal norms. They focus on the issue of <b>defeasibility,</b> which has become a central concern for both logicians and legal philosophers in recent years. The book is divided into four parts. Part One is devoted to unravelling the basic concepts related to legal <b>defeasibility</b> and the logical structure of legal norms, focusing on the idea that law, or its components, are liable to implicit exceptions, which cannot be specified before the law's application to particular cases. Part Two aims to disentangle the main relations between the issue of legal <b>defeasibility</b> and the issue of legal interpretation, exploring the topic of <b>defeasibility</b> as a product of certain argumentative techniques in the law. Part 3 of the volume is dedicated {{to one of the most}} problematic issues in the history of jurisprudence: the connections between law and morality. Finally, Part 4 of the volume is devoted to analysing the relationships between <b>defeasibility</b> and legal adjudication...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} in formalizing effects of actions {{on a world}} {{in the presence of}} constraints have mostly concentrated on non-defeasible specifications, where the effect of actions and constraints are strictly specified. In this paper we show how to incorporate <b>defeasibility</b> into the specifications. In our approach we consider extensions of the high level language A of Gelfond and Lifschitz and introduce defeasible constraints and effect propositions. While direct semantics of A does not need a logical language, our semantics is defined using extended logic programming. This is due to the <b>defeasibility</b> of the specification. ...|$|E
40|$|In this essay, {{we intend}} to show that Peter Klein and Marshall Swain <b>defeasibility</b> {{theories}} do not resolve the Gettier problem. Klein postulates, to any Gettier counterexample, {{that there is a}} true proposition which, when associated with evidence-e of S, genuinely defeats the justification of p to S. Swain postulates that, to any Gettier-type counterexample, there is a true proposition which, when associated with the set of reasons-R of S, ultimately defeats the justification of S to believe p. To show that Klein an Swain proposals do not resolve that problem, this essay presents two Gettier-type counterexamples for which there are no genuine defeaters of justification of p by e to S and there are no defeaters not ultimately defeated of the justification of the belief of S that p by R. After doing that, we try to show that the obtained conclusion regarding Klein and Swain <b>defeasibility</b> theories can be extended to any <b>defeasibility</b> theory of knowledge...|$|E
