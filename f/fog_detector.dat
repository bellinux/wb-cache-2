50|$|A {{coastguard}} {{station is}} located south of South Gare Lighthouse.To the immediate {{south of the}} coastguard station is a short steel frame tower.This tower houses a radar antennae, an automatic <b>fog</b> <b>detector</b> and a vertical set of four sectored red and white leading lights for navigation purposes.There is second <b>fog</b> <b>detector</b> system mounted on the Fairway Buoy in Tees Bay outside the river entrance.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, an {{experimental}} foghorn was installed, replacing the previous 19th century system. A diaphone system providing 4 blasts of 1.5 seconds once every minute was installed on Inchcolm, operated by radio telephone from Inchkeith. This {{was replaced with}} an electrically operated system controlled by an automatic <b>fog</b> <b>detector</b> in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bell was}} {{established}} at Roche's Point in 1864 to warn mariners in poor visibility. [...] This {{was replaced by}} a siren fog signal on 1 December 1898. [...] The fog signal changed again in 1949 when a diaphone was installed with a character of one two-second blast every thirty seconds. [...] In 1995 when the lighthouse was automated an electric fog signal (ELG 300-04) replaced the diaphone. [...] This electric fog signal was connected to a <b>fog</b> <b>detector</b> which activated the fog signal if visibility fell below three nautical miles. The electric fog signal had a range of four nautical miles. On 11 January 2011 the Commissioners of Irish Lights, despite much opposition, discontinued all Irish fog signals. [...] This brought an end to a long era of fog signaling at Roche's Point.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFreezing of gait (FOG) is {{a common}} symptom in Parkinsonism, which affects the gait pattern and is {{associated}} to a fall risk. Automatized FOG episode detection would allow systematic assessment of patient state and objective evaluation of the clinical effects of treatments. Techniques have been proposed in the literature to identify FOG episodes based on the frequency properties of inertial sensor signals. Our objective here is to adapt and extend these <b>FOG</b> <b>detectors</b> in order to include other associated gait pattern changes, like festination. The proposed approach {{is based on a}} single wireless inertial sensor placed on the patient's lower limbs. The preliminary experimental results show that existing frequency-based freezing detectors are not sufficient to detect all FOG and festination episodes and that the observation of some gait parameters such as stride length and cadence are valuable inputs to anticipate the occurrence of upcoming FOG events...|$|R
50|$|The station {{originally}} {{consisted of}} the small two-story light tower, a single Victorian residence, and a small barn. In 1898, a bell house was constructed, and a 4000 lb bell was added that was operated by weights. A second keeper was assigned at that time, and the quarters were expanded to accommodate two families. In 1947, the fog signal changed to an air horn. In 1949, the Trinidad Civic Club constructed a facsimile of the tower in a park overlooking the harbor and installed the original lens in its structure as a memorial to those lost or buried at sea. The 4,000-pound bell is displayed alongside the tower. In the late 1960s, the Coast Guard razed the original dwelling and barn and constructed the present triplex. The fog signal was discontinued when the station was automated in 1974. However, the complaints from the citizens of Trinidad Head were so vocal that the Coast Guard was forced to install the present ELG 300, operated by a <b>fog</b> <b>detector.</b> The new fog signal is operated in the original bell house. The original tower remains essentially unchanged.|$|E
