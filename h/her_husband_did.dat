During the journey to the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling the peer that several members of the party were convinced of Gordon-Cumming's guilt. Edward Somerset decided to consult his cousin, Arthur Somerset, and the two men suggested that Lycett Green inform the prince's senior courtier, Lord Coventry.|$|E

25|$|When Olga came to Russia as Cäcilie, <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>did</b> {{not like}} her birth name and chose for her the name Olga Fyodorovna, which she took upon her {{conversion}} to the Orthodox faith. The marriage {{took place on}} 28 August 1857 at the Chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Grand Duke Michael loved his wife deeply all his life and was under her strong influence, they were like polar opposites and this only seemed to cement their alliance. Michael Nikolaevich was a kind, calm, rather dull man {{who would have been}} completely happy to devote himself only to the artillery and his family, and he did not shine with exceptional intellect. On the other hand, Olga Fyodorovna was lively, sharp-tongued, witty society-lady, very fond of malicious tales and gossips – according to some of her contemporaries, gossip was her main raison d'être, or purpose for existing.|$|E
500|$|University of Michigan scholar Diane Sampson, {{publishing}} in {{a collection}} entitled [...] "Bad" [...] Mothers: The politics of blame in twentieth-century America, saw Baird as trying to establish motherhood as a 'site' in elaborating her qualifications for Attorney General during her confirmation hearings, an effort that was subverted by her affluence and her earning far more than <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>did.</b> [...] Sampson concluded that [...] "The dissonance between Baird's rhetorical stance and her lived life was jarring" [...] and that her case presented [...] "culturally accepted signifiers of a bad mother".|$|E
500|$|... 1970 was a {{traumatic}} {{year for the}} Lansbury family, as Peter underwent a hip replacement, Anthony suffered a heroin overdose and entered a coma, and in September the family's Malibu home was destroyed in a brush fire. They then purchased Knockmourne Glebe, a farmhouse constructed in the 1820s which was located {{near the village of}} Conna in rural County Cork, and, after Anthony quit using cocaine and heroin, took him there to recover from his drug addiction. He subsequently enrolled in the Webber-Douglas School, his mother's alma mater, and became a professional actor, before moving into television directing. Lansbury and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>did</b> not return to California, instead dividing their time between County Cork and New York City.|$|E

500|$|Following the election, Ann Romney {{received}} {{an offer to}} appear on the spring 2013 season of Dancing with the Stars, but although she was a fan of the show, she declined: [...] "I would've loved to have done it, and I am turning 64, and I started thinking about it. I'm not really as flexible as I should be." [...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>did.</b> [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – {{a lot of people around}} us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But the good news is we like each other." [...] In October 2013, she published, and made promotional appearances for, The Romney Family Table: Sharing Home-Cooked Recipes & Favorite Traditions, a cookbook that made the New York Times Best Seller list.|$|E
500|$|Ida Skelton, {{who held}} {{multiple}} jobs {{to support her}} family {{after the death of}} <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>did</b> not suggest that her youngest son had run away from home to become an entertainer, but [...] "his destiny had caught up with him at an early age". She let him go with her blessing. Times were tough during the Great Depression, and it may have meant one less child for her to feed. Around 1929, while Skelton was still a teen, he joined [...] "Doc" [...] R.E. Lewis's traveling medicine show as an errand boy who sold bottles of medicine to the audience. During one show, when Skelton accidentally fell from the stage, breaking several bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed. Both Lewis and Skelton realized one could earn a living with this ability and the fall was worked into the show. He also told jokes and sang in the medicine show during his four years there. Skelton earned ten dollars a week, and sent all of it home to his mother. When she worried that he was keeping nothing for his own needs, Skelton reassured her: [...] "We get plenty to eat, and we sleep in the wagon." ...|$|E

As far as is known, Benjamin Cardozo led a celibate life. The fact that Cardozo was unmarried and was personally tutored by the writer Horatio Alger (who {{had been accused of}} inappropriate sexual relations with young boys) has led some of Cardozo's biographers to insinuate that Cardozo was homosexual, but no real evidence exists to corroborate this possibility.

2500|$|Because {{of their}} past affiliations with the Communist Party, Garrett and Parks became embroiled with the House Un-American Activities Committee, {{although}} only Parks was forced to testify. He willingly {{admitted that he had}} been a member of the party and initially refused to name others, but later did so. Despite this he found himself on the Hollywood blacklist. Garrett also had trouble finding work, although as the mother of two young sons she did not mind being unemployed as much as <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>did.</b> Parks formed a highly successful construction business, and eventually the couple owned many apartment buildings scattered throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Rather than sell them upon completion, Parks decided to retain ownership and collect rents as a landlord, a decision that proved to be extremely profitable. During this period, the couple occasionally performed in Las Vegas showrooms, summer stock productions, and touring companies of Broadway shows.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a honeymoon}} in Germany, Italy and France, the newlyweds went to Sweden, where an {{official}} ceremonial reception awaited {{them with the}} state flags of Russia and Sweden waving in Stockholm. In the beginning, the marriage looked successful. The couple set up their home in the Swedish countryside {{in the province of}} Södermanland. They spent the summer there, returning in October to Stockholm. Maria added Swedish to the other five languages she spoke, and became popular in her new country. The Swedes felt she worked harder than <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>did.</b> She was well liked by her father-in-law Gustaf V, who appreciated her [...] "effervescence, charm, and unconventionality." [...] Maria Pavlovna, known in Sweden as the Duchess of Södermanland, [...] was pregnant by the fall, but she quickly realized that she had little in common with her husband. Their relationship was cold. She had little interest in him and he in her. The couple's only child was born on 8 May 1909. He was Prince Lennart, Duke of Småland, later Count of Wisborg (1909–2004) ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{characteristic}} of Neocolonialism is that Colonial powers continue {{to exploit the}} resources of their colonized counterpart for economic or political interests. [...] "Wild Seed" [...] exhibits neocolonialism {{in the relationship between}} Doro and Anyanwu and the relationship between Doro and his descendants. Doro uses Anyanwu's children in order to continue his exploitation of her supernatural abilities. He notes that [...] "Her children would hold her even if <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>did</b> not." [...] Anyanwu does not want to endanger her children by attempting to escape or kill Doro. Even after she tries {{to start a new life}} on a plantation, he breeds with her to pass on her supernatural abilities to his children. He has a vested interest in her powers, and he refuses to let her go. Anyanwu's children face the same struggle when attempting to escape Doro. Doro threatens them with death in order to keep them under his control. He purposely creates villages for his people so that if they decide to leave they will be left with nothing. They rely on Doro for kinship and protection. In return, Doro uses them for his own gains.|$|E
