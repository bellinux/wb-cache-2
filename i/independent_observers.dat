5|$|After the December {{completion}} of the 2010 presidential election, Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% {{of the vote in}} elections. The runner-up opposition leader Andrei Sannikov received less than 3% of the vote; <b>independent</b> <b>observers</b> criticized the election as fraudulent. When opposition protesters took to the streets in Minsk, many people, including most rival presidential candidates, were beaten and arrested by the state militia. Many of the candidates, including Sannikov, were sentenced to prison or house arrest for terms which are mainly and typically over four years. Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis, activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round of protests characterized by wordless hand-clapping.|$|E
5|$|China has {{installed}} a grassroots network of officials throughout Xinjiang, its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern Xinjiang, the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all family members are unemployed, the government arranges for {{one person in the}} household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new apartment blocks. However, <b>independent</b> <b>observers</b> believe that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset must change for there to be any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the new policy could attract more Han immigration, and further alienate the Uyghur population.|$|E

25|$|The {{scale of}} the crisis led to {{warnings}} of an imminent disaster, with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan warning {{about the risk of}} genocide. The {{scale of the}} Janjaweed campaign led to comparisons with the Rwandan Genocide, a parallel denied by the Sudanese government. <b>Independent</b> <b>observers</b> noted that the tactics, which included dismemberment and killing of noncombatants, including young children and infants, were more akin to the ethnic cleansing used in the Yugoslav wars and warned that the region's remoteness meant that {{hundreds of thousands of people}} were effectively cut off from aid. The Brussels-based International Crisis Group had reported in May 2004 that over 350,000 people could potentially die as a result of starvation and disease.|$|E
25|$|After an {{adjournment}} {{of three}} weeks, Collingwood presented his summation on 12–16 December 1949. He said that perpetrators {{of war crimes}} could not be absolved of guilt by claiming that they were only following orders when such orders were unlawful under international law. He stated that it was immaterial whether or not Manstein {{was aware of the}} mass killings in his area; he should have known, and he should have tried {{to put a stop to}} it. He remarked that the testimony of Manstein's fellow soldiers was not corroborated by <b>independent</b> <b>observers,</b> and thus should not be relied upon too heavily. Regarding Manstein's use of the scorched earth tactic, Collingwood pointed out that it was not done out of any military necessity, but had been planned and ordered well in advance. The court adjourned until 19 December to consider the verdict.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Ortega and Sergio Ramírez {{were elected}} {{president}} and vice-president, and the FSLN won an overwhelming 61 out of 96 {{seats in the}} new National Assembly, having taken 67% of the vote on a turnout of 75%. Despite international validation of the elections by multiple political and <b>independent</b> <b>observers</b> (virtually all from among U.S. allies), the United States refused to recognize the elections, with President Ronald Reagan denouncing the elections as a sham. According to a study, since the 1984 election was for posts subordinate to the Sandinista Directorate, the elections were no more subject to approval by vote than the Central Committee of the Communist Party is in countries of the East Bloc. Daniel Ortega began his six-year presidential term on January 10, 1985. After the United States Congress turned down continued funding of the Contras in April 1985, the Reagan administration ordered a total embargo on United States trade with Nicaragua the following month, accusing the Sandinista government of threatening United States security in the region.|$|E

25|$|The {{territory}} of Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney tribes in the 4thmillenniumBC. Until the 15th century, it was inhabited by Amerindian tribes {{which became a}} colony of Spain until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when Cuba gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1952. Further unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the July 26 Movement, which afterwards established communist rule {{under the leadership of}} Fidel Castro. Since 1965, the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba. A point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Cuba {{is one of the few}} remaining Marxist–Leninist socialist states, where the role of the vanguard Communist Party is enshrined in the Constitution. <b>Independent</b> <b>observers</b> have accused the Cuban government of numerous human rights abuses, including arbitrary imprisonment.|$|E

500|$|Along with {{choosing}} {{members for}} the National Assembly, Belarusian voters {{were presented with}} a referendum regarding presidential term limits. Before the vote, President Alexander Lukashenko was only allowed to serve two terms before the Constitution required him to step down. The voter turnout for the referendum was nearly 90%, with 77.3% of the voters agreeing to eliminating term limits. The changes were implemented on October 17, 2004. Like the 1996 referendum, {{the validity of the}} vote was brought into question. According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), many polling places went without <b>independent</b> <b>observers.</b> The OSCE believed that the standards of the vote did not meet OSCE requirements for [...] "free and fair elections". Data from other non-governmental organizations (NGO) point out that 50% of voters did not participate in the referendum, so they contend that the results reported by the government are flawed. Two years later, Lukashenko ran in the 2006 election and won 83% of the vote during the first ballot. With no term limits, Lukashenko states that, depending on his health, he will not retire from politics and might run for re-election in 2011.|$|E

Traditional reproducibility study was supplemented by refilling of data by an <b>independent</b> <b>observer,</b> thereby creating three data sets for comparison. Materials and methods. Twenty prospectively recorded electronic forms from each department were selected randomly from the Danish National Vascular Registry.

Refilling was performed blinded to the original forms. Conclusions. A high degree of accuracy of clinical data can be achieved.
