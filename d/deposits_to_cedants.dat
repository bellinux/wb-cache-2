40|$|INTRODUCTION: Academic {{libraries}} have {{experimented with}} a variety of services <b>to</b> encourage article <b>deposit</b> <b>to</b> institutional repositories, with varying degrees of success. Universities now face the challenge of meeting federal agency public access requirements. Following the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy public access directive in 2013, Oregon State University (OSU) initiated an article <b>deposit</b> service <b>to</b> help faculty meet funding agency requirements and facilitate <b>deposit</b> of articles <b>to</b> both federal agency repositories and the institutional repository. This case study describes the article deposit form developed by the library <b>to</b> encourage article <b>deposits</b> <b>to</b> the institutional repository and federal agency repositories, the processes and people put in place <b>to</b> request and <b>deposit</b> the articles, and the impact of the service on the number of articles <b>deposited</b> <b>to</b> federal agency repositories. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT: In the two years since the article deposit service was initiated, a total of 102 articles have been deposited by the library to the PubMed Central or PAGES federal agency repositories. The inclusion of a request for faculty to indicate federal funding in the article deposit form has not resulted in increased article self deposits. Identifying and requesting National Institutes of Health and U. S. Department of Energy funded articles from faculty for <b>deposit</b> <b>to</b> the institutional repository and to the agency repositories has also not received substantial uptake. The majority of articles that have been <b>deposited</b> <b>to</b> federal agency repositories by the library were received after library staff reviewed bibliographies of grant funded research for compliance with public access policies. NEXT STEPS: As a result, the library is now working with the university office of research to promote a service that asks faculty for a bibliography of their articles that result from NIH or DOE funding, identifies those that need <b>to</b> be <b>deposited</b> <b>to</b> the agency repositories, and provides a link to the library’s article deposit form for them <b>to</b> initiate article <b>deposits</b> <b>to</b> the institutional repository and to agency repositories...|$|R

Typically, the majority of users <b>deposit</b> <b>to</b> online bookies using Moneybookers or Neteller. Some attempts <b>to</b> <b>deposit</b> using a Visa or MasterCard may fail. The same is true of online bank transfers. In order to circumvent these blocks, savvy internet users have started to use ewallet services for depositing. These services add a middle layer to disguise the nature of transactions, enabling users to get around the blocks by first <b>depositing</b> <b>to</b> an ewallet and then using that ewallet to fund an online betting account in Rupees. This is important because it circumvents legal issues that may have arisen about Foreign Exchange law.|$|R
