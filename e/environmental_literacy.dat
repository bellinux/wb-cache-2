40|$|The {{adoption}} of multidisciplinary approaches to foster scientific research {{in public health}} and strengthen its impact on society is nowadays unavoidable. <b>Environmental</b> health <b>literacy</b> (EHL) may {{be defined as the}} ability to search for, understand, evaluate, and use environmental health information to promote the {{adoption of}} informed choices, the reduction of health risks, the improvement of quality of life and the protection of the environment. Both public health and <b>environmental</b> health <b>literacy</b> involve access to and dissemination of scientific information (including research findings), individual and collective decision-making and critical thinking. Specific experiences in <b>environmental</b> health <b>literacy</b> have been developed within the Italian National Asbestos Project (Progetto Amianto) in Latin American countries where the use of asbestos is still permitted, and in Italy where a specific effort in EHL has been dedicated to the risks caused by the presence of fluoro-edenite fibers in the town of Biancavilla (Sicily).

40|$|Reporting data back {{to study}} {{participants}} is increasingly being integrated into exposure and biomonitoring studies. Informal science learning opportunities are valuable in <b>environmental</b> health <b>literacy</b> efforts and report back efforts are filling an important gap in these efforts. Using the University of Arizona’s Metals Exposure Study in Homes, this commentary reflects on how community-engaged exposure assessment studies, partnered with data report back efforts are providing a new informal education setting and stimulating free-choice learning.

40|$|Abstract Research {{has shown}} that {{personal}} health behaviors and actions established early in life are often carried through adulthood. Thus, working with children to increase <b>environmental</b> health <b>literacy</b> may improve the <b>environmental</b> health <b>literacy</b> of future adults, potentially improving {{the health of the}} Nation. Given the amount of time children spend in school, this setting could be an ideal place to address environmental health with children. According to social cognitive theory, observation is one way in which learning takes place. Consequently, the environmental behaviors and attitudes modeled by teachers would likely impact the environmental behaviors and attitudes learned by students. A research study including 101 pre-service teachers from a large Midwestern university was conducted to determine participants’ knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding environmental health. Results indicated major deficiencies in basic knowledge as well as many unfavorable environmental behaviors. On average, participants answered only 49. 7 % of knowledge items correctly. Less than half (46. 0 %) recycle bottles or cans “often” or “almost always. ” Given these results, pre-service teachers are likely ill-prepared to address <b>environmental</b> health <b>literacy</b> in their classrooms. Teacher education programs need to address this deficiency in pre-service teachers through the implementation of new courses focused on environmental health or the redesign of current courses to include environmental health content...|$|R

We conducted 14 interviews with parents who had participated in the University of Arizona’s Metals Exposure Study in Homes and analyzed their responses using NVivo, a qualitative data management and analysis program. Key findings were that participants used the data to cope with their challenging circumstances, the majority of participants described changing their families’ household behaviors, and participants reported specific interventions to reduce family exposures. The strength of this study is that it provides insight into what people learn and gain from such results communication efforts, what participants want to know, and what type of additional information participants need to advance their <b>environmental</b> health <b>literacy.</b> This information can help improve future report back efforts and advance environmental health and justice...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimated}} 11 {{million people}} in the US have home wells with unsafe levels of hazardous metals and nitrate. The national scope of the health risk from consuming this water has not been assessed as home wells are largely unregulated and data on well water treatment and consumption are lacking. Here, we assessed health risks from consumption of contaminated well water on the Crow Reservation by conducting a community-engaged, cumulative risk assessment. Well water testing, surveys and interviews were used to collect data on contaminant concentrations, water treatment methods, well water consumption, and well and septic system protection and maintenance practices. Additive Hazard Index calculations show that the water in more than 39 % of wells is unsafe due to uranium, manganese, nitrate, zinc and/or arsenic. Most families’ financial resources are limited, and 95 % of participants do not employ water treatment technologies. Despite widespread high total dissolved solids, poor taste and odor, 80 % of families consume their well water. Lack of <b>environmental</b> health <b>literacy</b> about well water safety, pre-existing health conditions and limited environmental enforcement also contribute to vulnerability. Ensuring access to safe drinking water and providing accompanying education are urgent public health priorities for Crow and other rural US families with low <b>environmental</b> health <b>literacy</b> and limited financial resources...|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{availability of}} portable digital devices, {{such as the}} iPad, {{has led to the}} tablet outstripping earlier technologies in terms of its impact on early childhood. In many households, iPads have become the device of choice for family entertainment being used, amongst other things, for on-demand TV, games and interactive stories. Early literacy practices have fallen under the sway of the iPad, which appeals to young children because of its size, weight, portability and intuitive touch-screen interface (Merchant, 2014). As a result of this, and a whole host of other <b>environmental</b> factors, <b>literacy</b> development for many children born in the 21 st Century has come to be infused with digital technology. This raises important issues for parents, carers and educators. For a start the commercial and economic stakes are high. But also there are some crucially important questions about learning and development that educators are only just beginning to consider.
