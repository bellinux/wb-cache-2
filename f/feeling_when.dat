5|$|With massive {{radio and}} video play, Blink-182 played to larger crowds {{when they began}} touring in support of Enema of the State. The Loserkids Tour {{commenced}} {{in the autumn of}} 1999 and was the band's first arena tour. The band was forced to postpone remaining dates of a spring European tour in 2000 when both DeLonge and Barker came down with strep throat. The band played to sold-out audiences and performed worldwide during the summer of 2000 on The Mark, Tom and Travis Show Tour. The tour was staged as a drive-in movie, with a giant retro billboard suspended from the ceiling, and films were projected on the screen behind the band– including vintage gay porn as a joke. The tour {{was one of the most}} anticipated rock tours of the season and the band headed out on the road with Bad Religion and Fenix TX. Barker broke one of his fingers during an altercation with two men who kept flirting with his girlfriend in Ohio, and Damon Delapaz, guitarist of Fenix TX, stepped in on drums for Barker. Hoppus recalled an overwhelming emotional <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> the band sold out the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles.|$|E

Each leaf is matte green with an underneath pale green appearance; moreover, the leaf is covered with abundant soft fuzz, yielding an almost velvety <b>feeling.</b> <b>When</b> a fresh leaf is rubbed or broken, an aromatic scent is exuded, evoking a forest odor. The wood is a dull brown approaching yellow, {{and it has not}} been used extensively for milling.|$|E
500|$|... "Something Special" [...] is a pop ballad {{that begins}} acoustically, and was {{inspired}} by Robin Thicke and John Mayer because of its honesty. Usher discussed the song: [...] "It's about the <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> you're in real love. It could be about my son or my wife." ...|$|E

60|$|Such {{had been}} her <b>feelings</b> <b>when</b> she protested {{that she would not}} be Augusta Gresham's bridesmaid, and offered to put her neck beneath Beatrice's foot; when she drove the Lady Margaretta out of the room, and gave her own opinion as to the proper {{grammatical}} construction of the word humble; such also {{had been her}} <b>feelings</b> <b>when</b> she kept her hand so rigidly to herself while Frank held the dining-room door open for her to pass through.|$|R
500|$|Furtado {{said she}} was unsure what [...] "Say It Right" [...] is about, but that it encapsulates her <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> she wrote it and [...] "taps into this other sphere"; in an {{interview}} for The Sunday Times, it was mentioned that it is about her breakup with DJ Jasper Gahunia, {{the father of her}} daughter. [...] "In God's Hands", another song on the album, was also inspired by the end of their relationship.|$|E
500|$|Following the tour, Capitol Records {{was taken}} over by EMI. All of the {{material}} that had been recorded for Auf der Maur, including outtakes, demos and rehearsal recordings, were seized by EMI's red tape. Following months of negotiations, Auf der Maur won the rights to the recordings and was subsequently dropped from Capitol/EMI in 2006. Reflecting on the experience, Auf der Maur said there is [...] "a gross <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> you merge your heart with a corporate structure." [...] Auf der Maur took the experience into consideration when considering labels to release Auf der Maurs follow-up, Out of Our Minds (2010), which was self-released.|$|E
500|$|On September 12, 2012, Def Jam France {{announced}} via Twitter that Rihanna {{would release}} a new single {{the following week}} and that her seventh studio album will be released in November. However, the tweet was shortly deleted and replaced with another clarifying that more information will be given on September 13. In an interview with iHeartRadio at their annual music festival in September, Rihanna confirmed [...] "Diamonds" [...] as her new single and {{said that it would}} first be played on American radio beginning September 26. She described it as an easy-going, but optimistic song that is [...] "happy and hippy" [...] rather than dance-oriented and said that the song [...] "gives me such a great <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> I listen to it. The lyrics are very hopeful and positive, but it's about love." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{really love}} Holby and I'm {{surprised}} how much. What thrills me about Holby {{is that you}} get back what you put in. The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, {{while still}} grieving {{the loss of}} her daughter, Rice took a {{previously}} written short story and turned it into her first novel, the bestselling Interview with the Vampire. She based her vampires on Gloria Holden's character in Dracula's Daughter: [...] "It established to me what vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive people. I was really just going with that <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> writing Interview With the Vampire. I didn't do a lot of research." [...] After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says, [...] "What you see when you're in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you can't control it and you go crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Duets" [...] was {{generally}} well received by critics, {{many of whom}} contrasted it favorably with the preceding season two episodes. The New York Times Rebecca Milzoff called it {{the best of the}} season to that point [...] "in terms of old-school Glee", and indeed, both Lisa Respers France of CNN and Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post found it a reminder of why they originally loved the show. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summarized: [...] "This was a return to that honeymoon <b>feeling,</b> <b>when</b> Glee first surprised, scandalized and satisfied you." [...] TV Guide Damian Holbrook and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson appreciated the lack of gimmicks; the former explained [...] "No Britney numbers. No forced guest stars. No reasons to check out. It's amazing how satisfying a show can be when the characters we invested in a year ago get to do something more than set-dress a stunt." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labelled it [...] "easily the strongest character episode so far this season". While The Atlantic Kevin Fallon opined that the series finally achieved the correct [...] "tonal balance of comedy and drama", his colleague Meghan Brown provided one of few dissenting reviews; she called it a lazy, nonsensical episode which contributed to a building [...] "sophomore slump". MTV's Aly Semigran found it lackluster after [...] "Grilled Cheesus", and although Anthony Benigno of the Daily News deemed it an improvement on the previous episode, he concluded that it was not one of the season's best.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the track}} is on-street using 35G-section grooved tram rail, with BS11-80A [...] {{flat-bottom}} rail elsewhere. The railway track was supplied by British Steel Corporation Track Products of Workington and laid on sleepers consisting of concrete blocks with steel ties which gives a spring <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> travelling on these sections. The track is laid {{on a bed of}} ballast which in turn rests on a prepared formation. Street crossings are usually laid with grooved tramway rails.|$|E
2500|$|Lo-fi {{music is}} also a {{favourite}} of Parker's, and he incorporated it heavily {{in the early days}} of Tame Impala, heard prominently on the Tame Impala EP. With the release of Innerspeaker, Parker went for a different approach to a lo-fi sound, aiming more for a more cosmic and sonic wall of sound, helped by mixer Dave Fridmann. Parker explained [...] "It sounds more cohesive, like an organism. It has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> it's absolutely blaring at you. I love that sound." ...|$|E

2500|$|Viewers saw Natalie and Barry’s {{marriage}} sour {{towards the}} end of 2002 when she was momentarily tempted by the charms of his scheming half-brother Nathan (Doug Allen), and then, in the New Year’s Eve episode, she was shown to rekindle a secret “steamy affair” with old flame, Ricky, which continued into 2003. [...] Speed commented “Natalie's always had strong feelings for Ricky. And now she's grown tired of being a mother to baby Jack and Barry!…family is everything to her, so she would have to feel very strongly indeed about someone to put her marriage at risk. As for Ricky, I suppose Natalie's always held a torch for him. He was her first love who finished with her, so she's been left with a kind of 'what if?' <b>feeling.</b> <b>When</b> Natalie was younger she was easily seduced, {{and a little bit of}} that remains. She can be easily swayed if someone is nice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Limerence {{develops}} and is sustained {{when there}} is a certain balance of hope and uncertainty. The basis for limerent hope is not in objective reality but in reality as it is perceived. The inclination is to sift through nuances of speech and [...] of behavior for evidence of limerent hope. [...] "Lovers, of course, are notoriously frantic epistemologists, second only to paranoiacs (and analysts) as readers of signs and wonders." [...] "Little things" [...] are noticed and endlessly analyzed for meaning. Such excessive concern over trivia may not be entirely unfounded, however, as body language can indicate reciprocated feeling. What the limerent object said and did is recalled with vividness. Alternative meanings for the behaviors recalled are sought. Each word and gesture is permanently available for review, especially those interpreted as evidence in favor of reciprocated <b>feeling.</b> <b>When</b> objects, people, places or situations are encountered with the limerent object, they are vividly remembered, especially if the limerent object [...] interacted with them in some way.|$|E
2500|$|General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler {{persuaded the}} {{government}} {{that it was not}} financially viable to modify existing production cars to comply with the new regulations, and that instead each company would be put to the enormous expense of producing new, safety-compliant vehicles. Accordingly, the government requirements were reduced, which led to the deletion of several safety features from the production Pacer—for example the roll bar over the passenger compartment, and the bump in the roof that accommodated it. The design of the Pacer was strong for a small car, making it solid and heavy with protection features that included strong and massive bumpers, as well as wide B-pillars that factory information bulletins described their [...] "roll bar like characteristics." [...] Even with the Pacer's large glass area, passengers are not near the windows because they all bow out from around the occupants. The Pacer's wide stance also makes it stable and provides a unique <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> inside the car, giving credence to the marketing phrase used by AMC that [...] "you only ride like a Pacer if you're wide like a Pacer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Miller's {{success in}} the 2010 Olympic Games has been contrasted with his 2006 results. [...] Miller's {{explanation}} for his belated success was simple: [...] "Most likely it’s because I decided that’s what I wanted to do.” [...] At the 2010 games, his coaches stated that he [...] "helps inspire ," [...] a very different attitude from that of four years previously. [...] Miller himself said that the difference was that in 2006, his role as [...] "poster boy" [...] for the Olympics, after the corruption scandals associated with the 2002 Winter Olympics (bid scandal and figure skating scandal), was [...] "the absolute thing I despise {{the most in the}} world" [...] and [...] "really draining on my inspiration, my level of passion." [...] Ultimately, the publicity [...] "had been happening for a year, and it was just too much." [...] By contrast, in 2010, he noted that he was not so proud of the medals themselves but of the [...] "absolutely amazing" [...] <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> [...] "you ... magically ski at your absolute best."

2500|$|When {{recording}} {{began in}} New York bass guitarist Paul Simonon was busy making a film called Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, {{and he was}} replaced briefly by Ian Dury and the Blockheads bassist Norman Watt-Roy; this later caused some bad <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> Watt-Roy and keyboard player Mickey Gallagher, a fellow Blockhead, claimed they were responsible for co-composing the song [...] "The Magnificent Seven", as the song {{was based on a}} tune of theirs. Dread, too, was upset that he was not credited as the album's producer, although he was credited with [...] "Version Mix". Other guests on the album include singer Ellen Foley (Jones' partner at the time), guitarist Ivan Julian formerly of the Voidoids, former Eddie and the Hot Rods member Lew Lewis, and Strummer's old friend and musical collaborator Tymon Dogg, who plays violin, sings on and wrote the track [...] "Lose This Skin"; he later joined Strummer's band the Mescaleros. Gallagher's children also made appearances: his two sons, Luke and Ben, singing a version of [...] "Career Opportunities" [...] from the band's first album, and his daughter Maria singing a snippet of [...] "The Guns of Brixton", from London Calling, {{at the end of the}} track [...] "Broadway".|$|E
2500|$|I was {{absolutely}} gobsmacked. I said, “This is horrible. Horrible!” And it’s a very slow, sinking <b>feeling</b> <b>when</b> you’re watching the movie, {{and the first}} scene comes out, and you’re like, “Oh, that’s a really bad scene.” But you say, “Well, that’s okay, the next one’ll be better.” And you somehow try to convince yourself that it’s going to get better… and it just gets worse. And I was like, “Wow. That was crazy.” I mean, I really didn’t see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie. Now, of course, it has a whole other life {{as a sort of}} inadvertent… satire. No, “satire” isn’t the right word. But it’s inadvertently funny. So it’s found its place. It provides entertainment, though not in the way I think it was originally intended. It was just… maybe the wrong material with the wrong director and the wrong cast.Showgirls was universally derided by film critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 19% based on 48 reviews with the consensus; [...] "Vile, contemptible, garish, and misogynistic -- and that might just be exactly Showgirls' point."
