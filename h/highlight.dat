40|$|Objective Physicians {{typically}} {{respond to}} {{roughly half of}} the clinical decision support prompts they receive. This {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that selectively <b>highlighting</b> prompts in yellow would improve physicians' responsiveness. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial using the Child Health Improvement Through Computer Automation clinical decision support system in 4 urban primary care pediatric clinics. Half of a set of electronic prompts of interest was <b>highlighted</b> in yellow when presented to physicians in 2 clinics. The other half of the prompts was <b>highlighted</b> when presented to physicians in the other 2 clinics. Analyses compared physician responsiveness to the 2 randomized sets of prompts: <b>highlighted</b> versus not <b>highlighted.</b> Additionally, several prompts deemed high priority were <b>highlighted</b> during the entire study period in all clinics. Physician response rates to the high-priority <b>highlighted</b> prompts were compared to response rates for those prompts from the year before the study period, when they were not <b>highlighted.</b> Results Physicians did not respond to prompts that were <b>highlighted</b> at higher rates than prompts that were not <b>highlighted</b> (62 % and 61 %, respectively; odds ratio 1. 056, P =. 259, NS). Similarly, physicians were no more likely to respond to high-priority prompts that were <b>highlighted</b> compared to the year before, when the prompts were not <b>highlighted</b> (59 % and 59 %, respectively, χ 2 = 0. 067, P =. 796, NS). Conclusions <b>Highlighting</b> reminder prompts did not increase physicians' responsiveness. We provide possible explanations why <b>highlighting</b> did not improve responsiveness and offer alternative strategies to increasing physician responsiveness to prompts...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} of protein surfaces determines both affinity and specificity of protein-protein interactions. Matching of hydrophobic contacts and charged groups on both {{sites of the}} interface are crucial to ensure specificity. Here, we propose a <b>highlighting</b> scheme, YRB, which <b>highlights</b> both hydrophobicity and charges in protein structures. YRB <b>highlighting</b> visualises hydrophobicity by <b>highlighting</b> all carbon atoms that are not bound to nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The charged oxygens of glutamate and aspartate are <b>highlighted</b> red and the charged nitrogens of arginine and lysine are <b>highlighted</b> blue. For a set of representative examples, we demonstrate that YRB <b>highlighting</b> intuitively visualises segments on protein surfaces that contribute to specificity in protein-protein interfaces, including Hsp 90 /co-chaperone complexes, SNARE complex and a transmembrane domain. We provide YRB <b>highlighting</b> in form of a script that runs using the software PyMOL...|$|R
