40|$|Abstract: The {{increasing}} {{requirements of}} car body manufacturers concerning formability and load of sheet metal structures necessitate new approaches in forming technology. Especially the requirements as regards local loads and local forming behaviour {{of the components}} vary significantly. In the field of welding technology there is a verified effect of emerging higher strengths in the welding seam. Using a laser, similar effects {{can be applied to}} change the material properties locally. In the current investigation the use of a laser beam allows for creating very small heat-affected areas of a width from 0. 5 mm up to 5 mm. These areas are characterised by a significantly higher hardness and strength. Depending on the sheet metal material, areas of higher and lower hardness can be produced. Using laser heat-affected zones in sheet metal makes it possible to increase the drawing depth without necking or cracks. The heat-affected zones increased the stiffness in the critical necking area and hence moved the critical strains to the surrounding area.

40|$|Stamping {{failures}} consist of, broadly speaking, either tearing (excessive {{local strain}} energy) or wrinkling (insufficient or inappropriate local strain energy). Good parts are produced when the strain energy or plastic work is effectively distributed during the forming process such that tears and wrinkles are eliminated. The process window framed by tearing and wrinkling limits can be rather small for some materials, notably aluminum alloys. At present, {{there are no}} established methods of directly controlling the forming energy distribution within the tool during a stamping operation. All current commercial methods attempt plastic strain control at the sheet boundary by various binder geometries and pressure profiles. While improvements by active control of draw beads and binder pressure have led to improved stamping performance, these methods still broadly rely on tool geometry to set the energy distribution. We have recently developed and demonstrated a method for more directly controlling the distribution of forming energy in a stamping operation based on an extension of electromagnetic (EM) impulse forming. We now have techniques for embedding and operating EM pulse actuator coils in stamping tools. These coils can be operated in a single high power pulse or {{as a series of}} lower energy pulses occurring several times during the forming stroke. A single high power pulse can provide the advantage of increased material forming limits of high velocity forming. However, applying a series of lower power pulses can increase forming limits without exposing the tooling and coil to large shock loads. Multiple pulses reduce the maximum strain levels by engaging more of the part material in the forming process which mimics (eliminates) the use of lubricants. Conventional production stamping rates are technically obtainable with proper integration of the EM impulse circuit with the forming press and tooling. This paper focuses on the basic design approach of our multiple pulse technique and integrated process forming results. Comparisons to other augmented stamping processes as well as conventional stamping are presented in terms of both simple metrics, such as <b>draw</b> <b>depth</b> and strain distributions...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{study of the}} isothermal and non-isothermal warm formability of an AA 3003 aluminum alloy brazing sheet is presented. Forming limit diagrams were determined using warm limiting dome height (LDH) experiments with in situ strain measurement based on digital image correlation (DIC) techniques. Forming limit curves (FLCs) were developed at several temperature levels (room temperature, 100 ºC, 200 ºC, 250 ºC, and 300 ºC) and strain-rates (0. 003, 0. 018, and 0. 1 s- 1). The formability experiments demonstrated that temperature has {{a significant effect on}} formability, whereas forming speed has a mild effect within the studied range. Elevating the temperature to 250 C improved the formability more than 200 % compared to room temperature forming, while forming at lower speeds increased the limiting strains by 10 % and 17 % at room temperature and 250 ºC, respectively. Non-isothermal deep draw experiments were developed considering an automotive heat exchanger plate. A parametric study of the effects of die temperature, punch speed, and blank holder force on the formability of the part was conducted. The introduction of non-isothermal conditions in which the punch is cooled and the flange region is heated to 250 C resulted in a 61 % increase in <b>draw</b> <b>depth</b> relative to room temperature forming. In order to develop effective numerical models of warm forming processes, a constitutive model is proposed for aluminum alloy sheet to account for temperature and strain rate dependency, as well as plastic anisotropy. The model combines the Barlat YLD 2000 yield criterion (Barlat et al., 2003) to capture sheet anisotropy and the Bergstrom (1982) hardening rule to account for temperature and strain rate dependency. Stress-strain curves for AA 3003 aluminum alloy brazing sheet tested at elevated temperatures and a range of strain rates were used to fit the Bergstrom parameters, while measured R-values were used to fit the yield function parameters. The combined constitutive model was implemented within a user defined material subroutine that was linked to the LS-DYNA finite element code. Finite element models were developed based on the proposed material model and the results were compared with experimental data. Isothermal uniaxial tensile tests were simulated and the predicted responses were compared with measured data. The tensile test simulations accurately predicted material behaviour. The user material subroutine and forming limit criteria were then applied to simulate the isothermal warm LDH tests, as well as isothermal and non-isothermal warm deep drawing experiments. Two deep draw geometries were considered, the heat exchanger plate experiments developed as part of this research and the 100 mm cylindrical cup draw experiments performed by McKinley et al. (2010). The strain distributions, punch forces and failure location predicted for all three forming operations were in good agreement with the experimental results. Using the warm forming limit curves, the models were able to accurately predict the punch depths to failure as well as the location of failure initiation for both the isothermal and non-isothermal deep draw operations...|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} addresses the formability of two magnesium sheet alloys, a conventional AZ 31 B and a rare earth alloyed ZEK 100. Both alloys had a nominal thickness of 1. 6 mm. Both Limiting Dome Height (LDH) and Cylindrical Cup Draw experiments were performed between room temperature and 350 °C. To examine {{the effect of}} sheet directionality and anisotropy, LDH experiments were performed in both the sheet rolling and transverse directions. In addition, strain measurements were performed along both sheet orientations of the cylindrical cup and LDH specimens for which the geometry is symmetric. The LDH tests were used to study the formability of ZEK 100 and AZ 31 B (O and H 24 tempers) magnesium alloy sheet between room temperature and 350 °C. At room temperature, AZ 31 B-O and AZ 31 B-H 24 exhibit limited formability, with dome heights of only 11 - 12 mm prior to the onset of necking. In contrast, the dome heights of ZEK 100 at room temperature reached 29 mm (a 140 % improvement over AZ 31 B). Increasing the temperature above 200 °C did not affect the relative ranking of the three sheet samples, however it did reduce the magnitude of the difference in dome heights. The rare earth alloyed ZEK 100 had pronounced benefits at intermediate temperatures, achieving an LDH of 37 mm at 150 °C; this dome height was only reached by AZ 31 B at a much higher temperature of 250 °C. To further characterize the formability of ZEK 100, forming limit curves (FLCs) were developed from the LDH tests in both the rolling and transverse directions. Comparisons to AZ 31 B were made at selected temperatures. Surface strain data was collected with an in situ digital image correlation (DIC) system incorporating two cameras for stereo observation. Results from these experiments further highlighted the enhanced formability relative to AZ 31 B over the entire temperature range between room temperature and 350 °C, with the most dramatic improvements between room temperature and 150 °C. The plane strain forming limit (FLC 0) for ZEK 100 at 150 °C was 0. 4 which equals that of AZ 31 B at 250 °C. At higher temperatures (300 °C), the two alloys exhibited similar performance with both achieving similar dome heights at necking of 37 mm (AZ 31 B) and 41 mm (ZEK 100). To round out the investigation of ZEK 100 for industrial applications, cylindrical cup deep drawing experiments were performed on ZEK 100 sheet between 25 °C and 250 °C under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. Draw ratios of 1. 75, 2. 00 and 2. 25 were considered {{to examine the effects of}} draw ratio on <b>draw</b> <b>depth.</b> The effect of sheet anisotropy during deep drawing was investigated by measuring the earring profiles, sheet thickness and strain distribution along both the rolling and transverse directions. Isothermal test results showed enhanced warm temperature drawing performance of ZEK 100 over AZ 31 B sheet; for example, a full draw of 203. 2 mm (8 ”) blanks of ZEK 100 was achieved with a tool temperature of 150 °C, whereas a tool temperature of 225 °C was needed to fully draw AZ 31 B-O blanks of this diameter. Non-isothermal deep draw experiments showed further improvement in drawability with significantly lower tooling temperatures required for a full cup draw using ZEK 100. ZEK 100 achieved a full draw of 228. 6 mm (9 ") blanks with a die and blank holder temperature of 150 °C and a cooled punch (25 °C) while the same size blank of AZ 31 B required a die and blank holder temperature 225 °C and a cooled punch (150 °C). Temperature process windows were developed from the isothermal and non-isothermal results to show a direct comparison of drawing behaviour between ZEK 100 and AZ 31 B. Overall, ZEK 100 offers significantly improved forming performance compared to AZ 31 B, particularly at temperatures below 200 °C. This lower temperature enhanced formability is attractive since it is less demanding in terms of lubricant requirements and reduces the need for higher temperature tooling...|$|E

One solution {{in this area is}} for the aerospace and automotive industries to produce lighter vehicles that are more fuel efficient. Magnesium alloys provide that solution as they have a high strength to weight ratio and can contribute to reducing the overall weight of the vehicle. Over the past few years many researchers have tried shaping these alloys using various forming techniques. These studies have shown however, that the formability of these alloys is very difficult to predict. The material properties of magnesium alloys would suggest that they are ideal for sheet metal forming, yet their formability is still inferior to many other alloys used in sheet metal forming. In order to overcome this unpredictability in shaping Mg alloys it is necessary to introduce a range of failure that will predict fracture over a range of <b>draw</b> <b>depths</b> rather than a single depth.
