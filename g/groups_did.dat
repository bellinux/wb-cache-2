5|$|Founded in 1875 as the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, Temple Sinai is {{the oldest}} synagogue in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. It grew out of Oakland's Hebrew Benevolent Society, which had been {{organized}} in 1862 by eighteen merchants and shopkeepers from several foreign countries—predominantly Polish Jews from Posen. Although Hebrew Benevolent Societies typically ceased operations upon the founding of a synagogue, Oakland's was unusual in continuing to function independently {{for a number of}} years (the two <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> not merge until 1881).|$|E
5|$|People in the Vanni districts {{considered}} themselves separate from Tamils of the Jaffna peninsula {{but the two}} <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> intermarry. Most of these married couples moved into the Vanni districts where land was available. Vanni consists {{of a number of}} highland settlements within forested lands using irrigation tank-based cultivation. An 1890 census listed 711 such tanks in this area. Hunting and raising livestock such as water buffalo and cattle is a necessary adjunct to the agriculture. The Tamil-inhabited Vanni consists of the Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, and eastern Mannar districts. Historically, the Vanni area has been in contact with what is now South India, including during the medieval period (see Vanniar). Northern Tamils follow customary laws called Thesavalamai, codified during the Dutch colonial period.|$|E

5|$|Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have {{histories}} of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included {{the demolition of}} the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority {{to make up for}} a shortfall of over $100million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver.|$|E
5|$|Girls {{wanted to}} become part of the {{movement}} almost as soon as it began. Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910, a parallel movement for girls, sometimes named Girl Scouts. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910, at the request of the girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally. In 1914, she started Rosebuds—later renamed Brownies—for younger girls. She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert's wife Olave Baden-Powell, who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards, though co-educational youth <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> exist. By the 1990s, two thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.|$|E
5|$|From {{the spring}} of 1944, the Corps focused {{increasingly}} on fighting the Partisans penetrating Serbia from Bosnia and the Sandžak, and the first clashes with Chetnik <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> not occur until 1944. On 5 January 1944, combat with the Partisans in Klenak resulted {{in the deaths of}} three Cossacks of the 1st Regiment. On 18 January, the 5th Regiment was formed in Obrenovac. The 3rd Regiment outfought a 2,400-strong Partisan force advancing towards Jošanička Banja on 31 March. On 28 April, the 1st Regiment prepared defences along the Drina in Zvornik, Bajina Bašta and Loznica areas expecting the 16th and 17th Partisan Divisions to attempt a crossing there. On 30 April, the headquarters of the 4th Regiment was moved to Aleksinac. On 1–2 May, the 5th Regiment fought the Partisans in the village of Mravinci, sustaining casualties of 11 killed and 25 wounded. That summer, the Corps mediated an agreement between one group of Chetniks and the Germans in which the two parties agreed to fight the Partisans in Serbia. On 18 July, the 5th Regiment fought in Jošanička Banja and its regimental headquarters was moved there from Obrenovac, with battalion headquarters being established in Zvečan, Jošanička Banja, Ušće and Vučitrn. Elements of the 3rd and 5th Regiments fought the Partisans on 4–5 August near the village of Rudnik. The Partisans attacked the positions of the 5th Regiment in Leposavić on 24 August.|$|E

25|$|A {{characteristic}} {{trait of}} the movement was its defensive nature. Indeed, few offensive actions such as sabotages or occupation of localities have been recorded.

25|$|In their {{attempts}} to assert control in India, the British faced fierce resistance in some regions while easily conquering others. British officials sought 'martial races' accustomed to hunting, or from agricultural cultures from hilly or mountainous regions {{with a history of}} conflict. Others were excluded due to their 'ease of living' or branded as seditious agitators. The doctrine of 'martial races' postulated that the qualities that make a useful soldier are inherited and that most Indians, {{with the exception of the}} specified <b>groups,</b> <b>did</b> not have the requisite traits that would make them warriors.|$|E

These studies showed that the hypothalamus of heterosexual men and homosexual women both respond to estrogen. Also, the hypothalamus of homosexual men and heterosexual women both respond to testosterone. The hypothalamus of all four <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> {{not respond to the}} common odors, which produced a normal olfactory response in the brain.|$|E

In fact, most leftist <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> not have a well-established vision or plan for pursuing women's rights.
