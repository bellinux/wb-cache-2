Later telescopic observations confirmed Io's distinct reddish-brown polar regions and yellow-white equatorial band.|$|E

50|$|Work of {{breathing}} of a rebreather has two main components: Resistive work {{of breathing}} is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the flow restriction {{of the gas}} passages causing resistance to flow of the breathing gas, and exists in all applications {{where there is no}} externally powered ventilation. Hydrostatic work of breathing is only applicable to diving applications, and is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> pressure between the lungs of the diver and the counterlungs of the rebreather. This pressure <b>difference</b> is generally <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> hydrostatic pressure caused by a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depth between lung and counterlung, but can be modified by ballasting the moving side of a bellows counterlung.|$|R

5|$|The {{biological}} half-life of strontium in humans has variously been reported as from 14 to 600 days, 1000 days, 18 years, 30 years and, at an upper limit, 49 years. The wide-ranging published {{biological half-life}} figures are explained by strontium's complex metabolism within the body. However, by averaging all excretion paths, the overall biological half-life {{is estimated to}} be about 18 years. The elimination rate of strontium is strongly affected by age and sex, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> bone metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The term baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{originates}} in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions {{accept it as}} a theological concept.

As a result, Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of the sacraments of initiation into the church, as being synonymous with regeneration, as being synonymous with Christian perfection, or as being a second work of grace that empowers a person for Christian life and service.|$|E

During preparations for one of many cancelled operations, Linnete II, his disagreement with Brereton over a risky operation caused him to threaten resignation, which, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> military culture, Brereton regarded as tantamount to disobeying an order.

5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E

Another similar species, A.magniverrucata, is differentiated from A.abrupta {{by a number of}} characteristics: the universal veil is clearly separated from the flesh of the cap; the volval warts disappear more quickly because the surface of the cap cuticle gelatinizes; the partial veil is more persistent; the spores are smaller and roughly spherical; {{on the underside of the}} partial veil, the stem has surface fibrils that are drawn upward so as to somewhat resemble a cortina (a cobweb-like protective covering over the immature spore bearing surfaces); A.magniverrucata has a known distribution limited to the south western coast of North America.|$|E
