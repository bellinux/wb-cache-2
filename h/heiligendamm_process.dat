50|$|The <b>Heiligendamm</b> <b>process</b> is an {{initiative}} that will institutionalize high-level {{dialogue between the}} G8 and the five most important emerging economies, known as the O5 (Outreach 5): China, Mexico, India, Brazil and South Africa. The framework will also seek establishment of a common G8/G5 platform at the OECD.|$|E

Here the <b>Heiligendamm</b> Dialogue <b>Process</b> (HDP) {{can play an important}} role as a forum for intensive, policy-specific, and in-depth reform debates. The <b>Heiligendamm</b> Dialogue <b>Process,</b> created by the G 8 in 2007, may play an important role as a forum for intensive, policy-specific, and in-depth reform debates, providing a contribution to giving North-South relations a new and more inclusive shape. The present paper analyses what results the HDP has generated thus far, inquiring into the conditions required {{if it is to be}} continued successfully. The paper offers suggestions for various reform scenarios, taking current global dynamics into account (in particular the G 20 financial summit). The study is based on the premise that global problems like the financial crisis or climate change can be effectively addressed only with the aid of a more inclusive and representative coordination body at the top level of global governance.

50|$|In 2006, Weidmann {{began working}} at the Federal Chancellery, where he was {{responsible}} for preparing the content and strategy of the G-20 round which was formed to counter the effects of the financial crisis. When he started, he was the youngest department head in the German government. Chancellor Angela Merkel promoted him in December 2009 to the influential role of the Sherpa of the G8 summits as she considers the G8 round to be only a pre-summit of the G20 round in the field of the world-wide financial system as well as that most other subjects need a wider context than the G8 as well (compare <b>Heiligendamm</b> <b>Process</b> for G8+5).|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} and political rise of China has led to considerable controversy regarding potential repercussions for the current global governance architecture. At least two opposing scenarios are conceivable: China’s adaptation to the rules and norms system shaped by developed countries or {{the pursuit of a}} distinctive policy approach, a possibility that involves the danger of clashing regulatory policies. A recent and increasingly dynamic trend giving substance to the phenomenon of China’s rising importance is the growth of outward foreign direct investments (OFDI) by Chinese enterprises. Against this background, the present paper investigates the evolution and change of Chinese international investment policy-making, with a particular focus on bilateral investment treaties (BITs) as the most important legal instrument for the governance of global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. China has been a committed signatory of BITs since the early 1980 s (120 treaties up to 2007). It is thus the second most active contracting party to BITs worldwide, surpassed only by Germany. The traditional Chinese BIT approach, however, has only cautiously supported the legal protection of FDI. As a mere capital-importer, China concluded BITs that contained serious reservations and safeguards intended to preserve policy spaces for the regulation of incoming investments. Starting {{at the end of the}} 1990 s the Chinese government initiated a decisive policy shift towards a liberal BIT approach characterized by high levels of substantive and procedural investment protection. Upon examining a representative sample of Sino-foreign BITs, this study concludes that the policy shift was a pro-active decision of the Chinese government intended to introduce liberal treaty provisions first and foremost with developing countries which are the main destination of Chinese OFDI. A further explanation for this development may be found in the great importance attached to the promotion of OFDI through the “Going Global” strategy announced by the Chinese government at the end of the 1990 s. In sum, this paper concludes that China has adopted a complementary rather than a competitive approach in the field of global FDI governance. China has fully agreed to standards of the current international liberal regime for FDI protection and has become an important global player in this context. This policy shift will yield consequences for China itself by levelling the playing field for international investors. Furthermore, developing countries that have concluded BITs with China will face a further reduction of their legal and regulatory autonomy, which is already limited by treaties with developed countries. China’s BIT policy, therefore, contradicts the widespread rhetoric of a mutual beneficial South-South cooperation. Lastly, the emerging complementarity of investment policies between China and developed countries at the bilateral level gives rise to the possibility of enhanced cooperation between both at higher levels, for instance as part of the <b>Heiligendamm</b> <b>Process</b> between G 8 countries and emerging countries...|$|E
