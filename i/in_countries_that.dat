5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> had often difficult {{relations with the}} United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style. His strong views on Iraq's reconstruction efforts after the war in 2003 were in part responsible for a wholesale change in the Bush administration's strategy to stabilize the war-torn nation. He also advocated engagement with Sudan {{at a time when}} White House officials and the C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in Khartoum.|$|E

5|$|Cowpeas seeds {{provide a}} rich source of {{proteins}} and calories, as well as minerals and vitamins. This complements the mainly cereal diet <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> grow cowpeas as a major food crop. A seed can consist of 25% protein and has very low fat content. Cowpea starch is digested more slowly than the starch from cereals, which is more beneficial to human health. The grain is {{a rich source}} of folic acid, an important vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects in unborn babies.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for natural family planning, and contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty. The Church's rejection of condom use is widely criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> promote condom use alone.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale is a source for production of synthetic crude oil and it is seen as a solution towards increasing domestic production of oil <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> are reliant on imports.|$|E

Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> previously had a weak currency.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
5|$|SI {{has become}} the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both {{everyday}} commerce and science. The change to SI {{had little effect on}} everyday life <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> used the metric system – the metre, kilogram, litre and second remained unchanged as did {{the way in which they}} were used – most of the changes only affected measurements in the workplace. The CGPM has a role of recommending changes, but no formal role in the enforcement of such changes—another inter-governmental organisation, the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) provides a forum for harmonisation of national standards and legislation in respect of metrology.|$|E

5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E
5|$|One way {{to advance}} {{emergency}} medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> currently lack it. Without such recognition, {{it is difficult to}} set up training programs or recruit potential students, as they face the uncertainly of training to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommended}} that rotavirus vaccine {{be included in}} all national immunisation programmes. The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49-92 percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17-55 percent. In Mexico, which in 2006 {{was among the first}} countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months, and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by 70 percent. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by rotavirus have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction of the vaccine.|$|E

If international knowledge spillovers are symmetric, innovation cost is lower <b>in</b> the <b>country</b> <b>that</b> has the larger market. However, if a small-market country can absorb the international knowledge spillovers better than a large-market country, the innovation cost may be lower <b>in</b> the small-market <b>country.</b> When the innovation cost is lower <b>in</b> the <b>country</b> <b>that</b> has a large market, the growth rate increases with agglomeration, which is generated by a reduction in the transportation costs.
