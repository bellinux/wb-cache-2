25|$|Doc Holliday {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{recognizable}} figures in the American Old West, but he is most remembered for his friendship with Wyatt Earp and his role in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Holliday's friendship with the lawman has been a staple of popular sidekicks in American Western culture, and Holliday himself became a stereotypical image of a deputy and a loyal companion in modern times. He is typically portrayed in films as being loyal to his friend Wyatt, whom <b>he</b> <b>sticks</b> with during the duo's greatest conflicts, such as the Gunfight at the OK Corral and Earp's vendetta, even with the ensuing violence and hardships which they both endured. Together with Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday has become a modern symbol of loyalty, brotherhood, and friendship.|$|E

Michelle Erica Green {{reviewed}} the episode on behalf of TrekNation in September 2007, comparing certain elements of the episode to Casablanca and the series finale [...] "". These included the ending where time distortions caused Data to be replicated three times in [...] "We'll Always Have Paris" [...] compared to the similar situation with three Picards in [...] "All Good Things...". Overall she thought that the episode was better than she recalled previously. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] described the episode as too simple, especially the ending which he said was [...] "they give Data a canister, which <b>he</b> <b>sticks</b> into a hall of mirrors; problem solved".|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "I don't crave fame. It's kind of goofy. I didn't {{want to be a}} public figure. I wanted to be an actor, not a movie star. But I love rock 'n' roll-there, I'd rather be a rock star. That would be cool." [...] He said that [...] "like all soap actors," [...] <b>he</b> <b>sticks</b> with the script the majority of the time, [...] "but every now and then he goes off the page," [...] commenting, [...] "You get to direct yourself. You come up with a little bit. It's improvisational. Maybe you're doing it just for your castmates, but the audience catches on." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{generally}} received well by critics. The New York Times highlighted Heath's Grammy Award-nominated What If We album {{as one of}} the best Grammy nominees in Christian music that year, saying; [...] "Mr. Heath's sense of wonder is firmly intact — 'Give Me Your Eyes,' which is nominated for best gospel song, is a breezy statement of humble devotion." [...] The song was featured on USA Todays top ten [...] "pick of the week" [...] playlist in the beginning of March 2009; the magazine's editor and music critic Brian Mansfield said, [...] "Grammy and Dove Award nominations are attracting a second look for Heath's song about seeing life's big picture." [...] Jesus Freak Hideout's Matthew Watson said of Heath's future music efforts: [...] "it could be really outstanding if <b>he</b> <b>sticks</b> to more upbeat songs like 'Give Me Your Eyes'." ...|$|E
500|$|Erlewine {{commented that}} on its release, Power {{received}} [...] "strong reviews". In contemporary reviews, The New York Times described Power as [...] "Constantly menacing, the album affords no breathing room." [...] The review noted: [...] "Ice-T makes the claustrophobia work by spinning ever denser rhymes and more concrete images, remaining {{as intense as}} his subject. Power has the oppressive detail of a novel. Though Ice-T indulges in gallows humor... he allows no release. If this is {{the life of a}} gangster, it is also hell." [...] The review commented that along with Eazy-E's album Eazy-Duz-It, the rappers come off as [...] "unenlightened when it comes to women. Whatever their rough spots, Power and Eazy-Duz-It represent the makings of a brutal new music scene." [...] Robert Christgau, writing for the Village Voice, gave the album a B+ rating, noting that Ice-T had [...] "his own sound—flat, clipped, quick-lipped. And when <b>he</b> <b>sticks</b> to his subject, his narrative style is as gripping and understated as Islam's samples." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald opined that Ice-T's [...] "odd attempts at making a moral point become lost amidst the nauseating imagery, though the music's malevolent power is impossible to deny".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: [...] "Hans is a little Dutch boy, {{the son of a}} poor fisherman. He, like all children of Holland, is early impressed {{with the fact that the}} safety of the whole community depends on the strength of the dike. He is sent upon an errand to his aunt late one evening. Walking along the foot of the dike, he discovers a tiny hole, through which the water is pouring. Realizing that if left to flow through even this small aperture, the water would soon break down the dike and flood the village, <b>he</b> <b>sticks</b> his tiny finger in the hole, and waits for someone to come to his assistance. Night comes on. His family decided he has stayed with his aunt, and do not worry about him. In the morning he is found almost unconscious from fatigue and exposure, by his little sister who has been searching for him. She runs back and notifies the villagers, who come to his assistance, repair the dike, and carry the little hero back to the village in triumph. He is received by the burgomaster and praised by the minister. By his night's heroism he has made himself a place in history, and will always be known as 'the little hero of Holland.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Stevenson gave a {{presentation}} at an emergency {{session of the}} Security Council. In his presentation, which attracted national television coverage, he forcefully asked Soviet UN representative Valerian Zorin if his country was installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, and when Zorin appeared reluctant to reply, Stevenson punctuated with the demand [...] "Don't wait for the translation, answer 'yes' or 'no'!" [...] When Zorin replied that [...] "I am not in an American court of law, and therefore do not answer a question put {{to me in the}} manner of a prosecuting counsel...you will have your answer in due course", Stevenson retorted, [...] "I am prepared to wait for my answer until Hell freezes over." [...] Stevenson then showed photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane which proved the existence of nuclear missiles in Cuba, just after Zorin had implied they did not exist. Stevenson also attended several meetings of the EXCOMM at the White House during the Missile Crisis, where he boldly proposed to make an exchange with the Soviets: if they would remove their missiles from Cuba, the United States would agree to remove its obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey. However, he faced strong opposition from some other EXCOMM members, who regarded such an exchange as a sign of weakness. According to Kennedy adviser and Stevenson friend George W. Ball, who was present, these members [...] "intemperately upbraided Stevenson... outraged and shrill." [...] However, President Kennedy remarked [...] "You have to admire Adlai, <b>he</b> <b>sticks</b> to his position even when everyone is jumping on him", and Robert Kennedy wrote that [...] "Stevenson has since been criticized for the position he took at the meeting...although I disagreed strongly with his recommendations, I thought he was courageous to make them, and I might add that they made as much sense as some others considered during that period of time." [...] Stevenson remarked [...] "I know that most of those fellows will consider me a coward for the rest of my life for what I said today, but perhaps we need a coward in the room when we are talking about nuclear war." [...] In fact, the Kennedy Administration did remove the Jupiter-class MRBMs from Italy and Turkey some six months after the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, and there is evidence that President Kennedy privately agreed that, if the Soviets would remove their missiles from Cuba, he would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy at a later date. [...] The deal was kept a secret for many years, however, and Stevenson was thus given no credit for his original suggestion.|$|E
