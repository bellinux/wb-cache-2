We share {{the same type of}} {{religion}} and boyhood background; we got our start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; we both served in public life at or near the top. And I like to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.|$|E
25|$|The last {{period was}} really victorious for NAER MATARON. We {{composed}} the harshest and most extreme music {{we ever had}} for our new album. So the next big step was taken, as we are now proud to announce our signing to Season of Mist. We are more strong and enthusiastic than ever before and <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are also supported henceforth in the same spirit. To this point, we wish to extend our salute to the hordes that supported our black metal war machine throughout the last 13 years and especially thank Michael and Season of Mist for giving us the chance to deliver {{what will be the}} most extreme and uncompromising work of NAER MATARON to date.|$|E

A lot of times producers or songwriters leak records because they feel {{if you put the}} song out there it would go [...] Usually a leak that far in advance of an album release puts the song in serious jeopardy of being excluded from the final track list. It was frustrating. I felt like you work hard to get in the studio to work with Beyoncé. [...] I was blessed... that song turned out [...] have nine lives.|$|E
5000|$|According to Barry Karr {{from the}} Center for Inquiry, Wiseman has not written a typical skeptic book wherein he seeks {{information}} {{in order to}} debunk paranormal phenomena.

5000|$|Davis is {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of storytelling; not just the profession, but also storytelling in everyday life. He <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{connect with one another}} through the stories <b>that</b> <b>we</b> tell each other across the family dinner table or at a bar after work. [...] He believes that stories are really about identity, about who <b>we</b> are, and <b>that</b> technology may be all about moving information but it is in our stories that wisdom is passed down.|$|R

His party colleague Kyösti Kallio urged in his Nivala {{address on}} 5 May 1918: [...] "We must rebuild a Finnish nation, {{which is not}} divided into the Reds and Whites....We have to establish a democratic Finnish republic, where all the Finns can <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are true citizens and members of this society." [...] In the end, many of the moderate Finnish conservatives followed the thinking of Lauri Ingman, who wrote in spring 1918: [...] "A political turn more to the right will not help us now, instead it would strengthen the support of socialism in this country." ...|$|E
500|$|Coldplay {{announced}} {{details about}} [...] "X" [...] in March 2004 while {{the album was}} being recorded. Their initial plans were {{to stay out of}} the public eye throughout the year. Lead singer Chris Martin stated, [...] "We really <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have to be away for a while and we certainly won't release anything this year, because I think people are a bit sick of us." [...] This plan was not carried out, because of the pressure their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head had induced; but they were trying [...] "to make the best thing that anyone has ever heard".|$|E
500|$|Charity Wakefield {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Marianne Dashwood. The actress revealed, [...] "Marianne is the embodiment of youth and hope. I was so excited to be offered the part because I felt that it was a role which I could really attack. I understand her character and <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have lots in common." [...] Dan Stevens was chosen to play Edward Ferrars, Elinor's love interest. The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character. Stevens became ill with tonsillitis during the shoot, and quipped that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series.|$|E

The author raises {{the issue of whether}} economic, social and cultural exchanges and changes will lead to a rethinking of models of social integration. He <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are not dealing with a simple standardization that replaces the world’s diverse cultures but rather with a process that reveals to what extent the world is made up of coherent diversities that at present must deal with a new coherence...|$|R

During the Los Angeles protests, a plane flew overhead trailing a large sign that read [...] "Honk if you think Scientology is a cult." [...] 150 protesters demonstrated in Clearwater, Florida, and a local organizer for Anonymous told The Tampa Tribune, [...] "We <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{have an obligation to}} educate the public about the things that have gone on and hopefully make the Church of Scientology understand that they have to change." ...|$|E
500|$|The Upper Peninsula press {{continued}} {{to report on}} Heikkinen’s every move, as he returned home shortly before Christmas, before heading west {{to play in the}} East-West Shrine Game. On his departure for California, The Bessemer Herald said: “Ralph has made every major All America team in the nation this year[...] [...] [...] Our nation has had many great men to emulate. The children of the Ramsay school not only have these in common with all others, but we have our own local hero who has gained national repute as a gentleman, scholar and last, but not least, a great athlete. To say that we are proud of Ralph is putting it mild. We <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are very honored to have had him as a student of the Ramsay school.” ...|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Ernest W. Howard of the Women's Patriotic Committee on National Defense castigated the {{slackness}} of Congress for not {{picking up}} on the bill's perceived dangers: [...] "Those {{of us who have}} been in the study and research work of the United Nations, we <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are experts in this ... you as Senators with all the many commitments and the many requirements, are not able to go into all these things." [...] John Kaspar, a White Citizens' Council organizer who had achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in Clinton, Tennessee, declared that [...] "almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish ... one particular race is administering this particular thing." [...] He argued that Jews were nationalists of another country who were attempting to [...] "usurp American nationality".|$|E

500|$|Catt, Stone and Blackwell went {{together}} to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the [...] "triumvirate" [...] of women's suffrage, were called {{away from the}} convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen [...] "I come before this committee with the sense which I always <b>feel,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are handicapped as women in {{what we try to}} do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes..." [...] Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as [...] "Solitude of Self". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot {{primarily}} in the anamorphic format on 35mm film, with key sequences filmed on 65mm, and aerial sequences in VistaVision. Nolan did not shoot any footage with IMAX cameras as he had with The Dark Knight. [...] "We didn't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{were going to be}} able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film given that it deals with a potentially surreal area, the nature of dreams and so forth, I wanted it to be as realistic as possible. Not be bound by the scale of those IMAX cameras, even though I love the format dearly". In addition Nolan and Pfister tested using Showscan and Super Dimension 70 as potential large format high frame rate camera systems to use for the film, but ultimately decided against either format. Sequences in slow motion were filmed on a Photo-Sonics 35mm camera at speeds of up to 1000 frames per second. Wally Pfister tested shooting some of these sequences using a high speed digital camera, but found the format to be too unreliable due to technical glitches. [...] "Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one useable piece and it didn't end up in the film. Out of the six times we shot with the Photo-Sonics camera and 35mm running through it, every single shot was in the movie." [...] Nolan also chose not to shoot any of the film in 3D as he prefers shooting on film using prime lenses, which is not possible with 3D cameras. Nolan has also criticized the dim image that 3D projection produces, and disputes that traditional film does not allow realistic depth perception, saying [...] "I think it's a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D. The whole point of cinematic imagery is it's three dimensional... You know 95% of our depth cues come from occlusion, resolution, color and so forth, so the idea of calling a 2D movie a '2D movie' is a little misleading." [...] Nolan did test converting Inception into 3D in post-production but decided that, while it was possible, he lacked the time to complete the conversion to a standard he was happy with. In February 2011 Jonathan Liebesman suggested that Warner Bros were attempting a 3D conversion for Blu-ray release.|$|E

5000|$|Particularly {{when there}} is so much to do, and it {{sometimes}} <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> push <b>that</b> boulder up the mountain only to have it tumble down again, I remain mindful of Camus' choice to interpret the myth of Sisyphus through a lens of hope. Camus writes that while some might see only futility in the task at hand, he chooses instead to see the nobility of the very effort. He notes, [...] "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy." [...] Franzese, 2017 ...|$|R

2500|$|On 9 October 2006, it was {{confirmed}} that the second series of Life on Mars would be the last.

2500|$|According to Horney we {{can have}} two views of our self: the [...] "real self" [...] and the [...] "ideal self". The real self is who and what we {{actually}} are.

The real self has the potential for growth, happiness, will power, realization of gifts, etc., but it also has deficiencies. The ideal self is used as a model to assist the real self in developing its potential and achieving self-actualization. (Engler 125) But {{it is important to know}} the differences between our ideal and real self.|$|E

If we're not being controlled, we'll just do what we want." [...] Chan's comments prompted angry responses from several prominent figures in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
