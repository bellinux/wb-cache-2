60|$|The various printings of 1601 {{reveal how}} Mark Twain's 'Fireside Conversation' {{has become a}} part of the American printer's lore. But more important, its many printings {{indicate}} that it has become a popular bit of American folklore, particularly for men and women who have a feeling for Mark Twain. Apparently it appeals to the typographer, who devotes to it his worthy art, as well as to the <b>job</b> <b>printer,</b> who may pull a crudely printed proof. The gay procession of curious printings of 1601 is unique in the history of American printing.|$|E
6000|$|Arthur Weldon, in his {{capacity}} as advertising manager, wrote to all the national advertisers asking their patronage for the Millville Daily Tribune. The letters were typewritten by the office stenographer on newly printed letterheads that Fitzgerald, the <b>job</b> <b>printer,</b> had prepared. Some of the advertisers were interested enough in Arthur's novel proposition to reply with questions as to the circulation of the new paper, where it was distributed, and the advertising rates. The voting man answered frankly that they had 27 subscribers already and were going to distribute 400 free copies every day, for a time, as samples, with the hope of increasing the subscription list. [...] "I am not sure you will derive any benefit at all from advertising in our paper," [...] he added; [...] "but {{we would like to have}} you try it, and you can pay us whatever you consider the results warrant." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a hitch somewhere; McGaffey muttered naughty words {{under his}} breath and plied {{wrenches}} and screwdrivers {{in a way that}} brought a thrill of anxiety, approaching fear, to every heart. The press started half a dozen times, only to be shut down abruptly before it had printed a single impression. McGaffey counseled with Larry, who shook his head. Fitzgerald, the <b>job</b> <b>printer,</b> examined the machinery carefully and again McGaffey screwed nuts and regulated the press. Then he turned on the power; the big cylinder revolved; the white paper reeled out like a long ribbon and with a rattle and thump the first copy of the Millville Daily Tribune was deposited, cut and folded, upon the table placed to receive it. Patsy made a rush for it, but before she could reach the table half a dozen more papers had been piled above it, and gathering speed the great press hummed busily and the pile of Tribunes grew as if by magic.|$|E
50|$|Prior to Secession, the South {{manufactured}} {{relatively few}} books, but imported them heavily from Northern {{cities such as}} New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. In 1860, there were only four major book publishers in the South, although there were numerous small <b>job</b> <b>printers.</b> Of even greater concern {{was the fact that}} the South manufactured little of its own paper and ink. After Secession, these were no longer available from the North, and the South began to expand its own printing and manufacture of paper and ink. Shortages of these supplies, however, were chronic and often severe.|$|R
50|$|The Leadenhall Press {{was founded}} by Andrew White Tuer (1838-1900) as the {{publishing}} division of the London partnership of Field & Tuer, following a move to 50 Leadenhall Street in 1868. The firm began as <b>job</b> <b>printers,</b> stationers, and manufacturers in 1862, when Tuer joined with Abraham Field (1830-1891), an established producer of registers and log books. Among their early successes was the invention by Tuer of Stickphast Paste, a clean, vegetable-based product that quickly became the standard office paste (and which was still being manufactured under new ownership {{as late as the}} mid 20th century).|$|R

5000|$|Jacob R. Brussel (June 21, 1899 [...] - [...] October 1979) was an {{antiquarian}} bookseller and publisher in New York City whose firm J.R. Brussel also dealt in erotica. For many years Brussel operated a shop, under various names including Atlantis and Ortelius, on New York's famous Fourth Avenue book row, initially {{in partnership with}} Samuel Weiser as [...] "Weiser's Book Shop" [...] until Weiser moved out to open his own shop across the street. He published large numbers of erotic and sexological reprints of works {{in the public domain}} in small editions, employing a <b>job</b> <b>printer</b> in a cellar around the corner, as well as the unauthorized bootleg [...] "Medvsa" [...] edition of Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller and the first part of Oragenitalism by Gershon Legman, a young employee in the Brussel bookshop. Others who worked in the shop in this era included Sol M. Malkin, (later the founder of AB Bookman's Weekly), Keene Wallis, and Mahlon Blaine. The shop's book scout was Jake's brother Ike Brussel, later billed as [...] "the last of the great scouts". In early 1940 the shop was raided by police and Brussel was sentenced to three years in jail on obscenity charges. After the war he carried on the storefront business while focusing largely on publishing under various imprints, including Brussel and Brussel, New York Medical Press, and United Book Guild.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} known Tijuana bible arrests occurred in Terre Haute in 1926, when a cache of bibles was discovered in a school locker at Wiley High School. Police traced the source back to a highly respected local newspaper editor named Charles Jewett (managing editor of the Terre Haute Star) and his son, a <b>job</b> <b>printer.</b> A federal charge was also placed against them {{because some of the}} bibles had been shipped across state lines to Rochester, Minn. [...] "Jewett was arrested following an investigation by authorities of the origin of a book of indecent pictures in which popular comic strip characters figure." [...] a local newspaper reported. [...] "The arrests grew out of an investigation, which had been quietly going on for three or four weeks, following the finding that several Wiley high school boys were in possession of an obscene publication based on a current strip in the Sunday papers. Further inquiry led to a search of the printing offices conducted by Jackson Jewett, under the name of the Jewett Printing Company, where a number of zinc etchings, from which the strips were printed, together with a quantity of booklets, bound and ready for distribution, were seized. It was said {{at the time that the}} elder Jewett had taken the contract for printing the strips and had attended to their distribution." [...] Charles Jewett was sentenced to six months in a state workhouse, and father and son left Terre Haute afterward. It is not known today which particular bibles were involved, but {{the earliest}} bibles are sometimes dated to 1925, particularly early [...] "Tillie and Mac" [...] and [...] "Maggie and Jiggs" [...] stories which were issued without covers or titles at the time, and were not always 8 pages long. The Kinsey Institute has in its possession an early Tillie and Mac story involving Mac finding a used condom in Tillie's wastebasket ("I wondered where that had gone," [...] she says brightly), which has an archivist's notation [...] "First seen Oklahoma 1926." ...|$|E
