40|$|The {{differences}} in k epsilon model predictions of plane and axisymmetric expansion flows is investigated. The prediction of the coaxial jet for different velocity ratios of the annular to central jet is presented. The effects of inlet kinetic {{energy and the}} energy dissipation rate profiles are investigated for swirling and nonswirling flows. The effects of <b>expansion</b> <b>ration</b> and Reynolds number on the reattachment length are also presented. The {{results show that the}} inlet k and epsilon profiles have the most significant effect on the reattachment length and flow redevelopment for the case of coaxial jet of high velocity ratio. A comparison of k epsilon model predictions for the pipe expansion flow by the PHOENICS and TEACH codes reveals some discrepancies in the predicted results. TEACH prediction seems to produce unrealistic kinetic energy profiles in some regions of the flow. PHOENICS code produces a long tail in the recirculation region under certain conditions...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{low-cost}} {{rocket engine}} was designed, fabricated, and successfully hot fire tested {{over a wide}} range of interface conditions and operating parameters. The engine used low enthalpy hydrogen (45 to 70 R, 200 to 390 psia) and oxygen (139 to 163 R, 210 to 480 psia) propellants pressure-fed directly from facility cryogenic tanks. The engine demonstrated excellent performance, with 97 % average combustion efficiency, and absence of combustion instabilities. Engine design chamber pressure was 300 psia, yielding about 16, 500 pounds thrust at sea level with a 3 : 1 <b>expansion</b> <b>ration</b> test nozzle. The engine used a fixed-element injector based on TRW's unique coaxial pintle design, but was operated at 60 %, 80 %, and 100 % thrust levels by throttling facility propellant valves. The engine was tested at propellant mixture ratios (O/F) from 5. 8 to 8. 4; design O/F was 6. 6. To document combustion stability, in five tests RDX explosive pulse guns were detonated in radial and tangential directions across the combustion chamber during steady-state operation. The largest disturbance consisted of simultaneous detonation of a 20 -grain radial gun and a 40 -grain tangential gun. In no case was an instability, either feed system mode or chamber acoustic mode, excited. High-frequency piezoelectric pressure transducers documented stable recovery from disturbance overpressures within 40 milliseconds of peak pressure. A total of 67 firing tests, accumulating 149 seconds of firing time above 10 % P(sub c), were performed. Since parametric testing required run durations of only 2 to 3 seconds, a heat sink combustion chamber was employed for most runs. To evaluate the feasibility of a low-cost ablative system for a flight engine design, one 20 -second continuous firing was conducted with a silicone rubber chamber/throat/nozzle liner cast in one piece directly into the engine. The ablative engine operated at the equivalent of 309 seconds sea level specific impulse, when adjusted to a 98 % efficient 6 : 1 <b>expansion</b> <b>ration</b> nozzle, and 430 seconds vacuum specific impulse, when adjusted to a 98 % efficient 50 : 1 expansion ratio nozzle. This engine and test series represent an initial subscale demonstration of a new booster-class engine that eliminates the cost and complexity associated with regenerative cooling and typical engine cycles. This paper presents a description of the engine design and discussion and summary data plots of the performance measured during the parametric testing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{numerical}} investigation {{the effect of}} inclination angle of the vertical face of a backward-facing step on the heat transfer performance utilizing Nanofluid for laminar flow. Al 2 O 3 is the nanoparticle used in this investigation, and water is the base fluid. The finite volume technique is used to solve the momentum and energy equation in 2 D backward facing step geometry with an <b>expansion</b> <b>ration</b> of 1. 5. The effect of Re on Nu is investigated for the Reynolds numbers 40, 100 and 150 and for different volume fractions of the nanoparticles of 2 %, 4 % and 6 % for all simulations. Nusselt number distribution at the bottom wall is computed. Pressure losses also reported for different Reynolds numbers and entropy is studied {{for a range of}} Reynolds numbers and for different volume fractions of Nanofluid. The results are validated with available literature. Four angles of inclination of the vertical step is investigated 90 o, 97. 5 o, 105 o and 115 o. The effect of the inclination angle on the heat transfer showed that the heat transfer was enhanced with a decrease in the inclination angle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The article {{shows that}} pin elastic {{couplings}} are not functionally elastic ones. Their endurance improvement {{is associated with}} their power intensity increase (stock of resilience). Another way is to replace elastic elements material (rubber) for more endurable and power-consuming polyurethane elastomers. Besides power capacity can be increased by elastic element mass <b>expansion</b> and the <b>ration</b> of the element mass to the coupling mass.
