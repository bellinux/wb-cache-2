The reasons are many, but the most <b>important</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the completed cathedral would have required demolishing the city wall.

In contrast, those who worked on the first generation proof did not know how many sporadic groups there were, and in fact some of the sporadic groups (e.g., the Janko groups) were discovered while proving other cases of the classification theorem. As a result, many of the pieces of the theorem were proved using techniques that were overly general.|$|E
