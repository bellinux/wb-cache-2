5|$|In Glenfinnan, the Hogwarts Express crosses a viaduct, {{as it has}} in {{the past}} films. Aerial scenes were shot in Glen Coe, in Clachaig Gully, and Glen Etive, which, at the time of filming, was one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in Scotland without snow, making it ideal for a backdrop.|$|E
5|$|Before the Mexican–American War, {{when this}} area was ceded to the United States, the main trade route through this part of Mexico was the Old Spanish Trail. This trail {{extended}} from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Los Angeles. The trail had multiple routes; however, the main route proceeded north towards Moab, Utah, one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> where the Colorado River can be crossed without having to traverse steep cliffs. The modern US491 roughly correlates with the main route of the Old Spanish Trail between Cortez, Colorado and its northern terminus.|$|E

5000|$|Children in Holbrooks {{now have}} <b>fewer</b> <b>places</b> {{to play as}} various pockets of land, once open spaces between development, are being {{swallowed}} up to in-fill, although Holbrooks Park, on Holbrook Lane, remains the area's largest open space.|$|R
5|$|Didsbury {{was one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> between Stretford and Stockport {{where the}} River Mersey could be forded, which made it {{significant}} for troop movements during the English Civil War, in which Manchester was on the Parliamentarian side. The Royalist commander, Prince Rupert, stationed himself at Didsbury Ees, to the south of Barlow Moor. It is also likely that Bonnie Prince Charlie crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in 1745, in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby, and again in his subsequent retreat.|$|E
5|$|Northern Bloomsburg and Scott Township {{include a}} small oxbow lake of Fishing Creek; {{the area around}} this lake {{is known as the}} Turkey Hill Oxbow. The lake is located between Interstate 80 and the forests on the side of Turkey Hill. The oxbow is on a flood plain and {{includes}} grasses, forested wetlands, and areas of open water. In wet periods of the year, the Turkey Hill Oxbow lake receives overflow from the waters of Fishing Creek while during dry periods it contains water in only a <b>few</b> <b>places.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Old Red Sandstone Continent {{became a}} part of the supercontinent Pangaea in the Permian (299–252 Ma), during which proto-Britain {{continued}} to drift northwards. Scotland's climate was arid at this time and some fossils of reptiles have been recovered. However, Permian sandstones are found in only a <b>few</b> <b>places</b> - principally in the south west, on the island of Arran, and on the Moray coast. Stone quarried from Hopeman in Moray has been used in the National Museum and Scottish Parliament buildings in Edinburgh.|$|E

50|$|Defence Engineering and Science Group {{students}} attend a selection consisting of interviews and various planning exercises without the fitness {{aspect of the}} other selections. There are <b>fewer</b> <b>places</b> for DESG students (12-15 per year), and so fewer boards than the other forces.|$|R
50|$|Many {{species of}} birds inhabit the lake area {{including}} the endemic San Cristóbal mockingbird and white-cheeked pintail. Due to its status as an isolated source of fresh water, {{it is also one}} of the <b>few</b> <b>place</b> to witness frigatebirds preening their feathers.|$|R
5|$|The Senate was the {{predominant}} political {{institution in the}} Roman Republic. The Senate's authority derived primarily from custom and tradition. It {{was also one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in which free political discussion could take place. The Senate's principal role was as an advisory council to the consuls on matters of foreign and military policy, and it exercised a great deal of influence over consular decision-making.|$|E
5|$|The {{corncrake}} {{can be seen}} at {{the bridge}} of Banagher in the summer. Once a common summer visitor to Ireland, corncrakes have suffered drastic population declines over the last few decades and are threatened with global extinction. Conservation efforts have focused on changing harvesting times to avoid the nesting season, May to August. The hay meadows of the callows support large numbers of these birds – one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in the world where this globally threatened species is still common.|$|E
5|$|M-72 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a state highway by 1919 along a segment of its current route. It was extended southward in the mid-1920s and westward in the 1940s. One section of the modern highway added to M-72 in 1940 previously existed as M-208 in the 1930s east of Grayling. Another section of highway near Empire was disconnected {{from the rest of}} M-72 until the gap was eliminated later in the decade. All of M-72 was completely paved by the early 1960s. The highway was rerouted in a <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in the 1950s, and the last new segment shifted in 1973 near Kalkaska.|$|E

25|$|Alternation {{of stress}} on short or {{circumflex}} pre-desinential syllable with desinential accentuation (among these, all cases in plural number, except some in -a, -ė, -is (gen. -ies), -us types). The number of polysyllabic words of {{this pattern is}} marginal, two common nouns and <b>few</b> <b>place</b> names.|$|R
50|$|To {{increase}} mobility, {{the train}} {{does not have}} centre poles, leaving standing riders with <b>fewer</b> <b>places</b> to hold. There are swinging handles hanging from a lateral pole {{along the length of}} each car near the ceiling, except near car ends, where an overhead ventilation unit is located.|$|R
5|$|Open {{heart surgery}} in India {{was at a}} nascent stage in the 1970s and early 1980s. After Panday {{returned}} to India from Canada, he joined the King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College (KEM), in which he performed hundreds of open heart surgeries. The hospital was run on a government grant and generally catered {{to the middle class}} and poor, as the surgery was at the cost of the government. The hospital was one of the very <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in India where heart surgery was performed. Panday was the chief of the second unit at KEM.|$|E
5|$|The {{group of}} animals most {{integral}} to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. <b>Few</b> <b>places</b> in the Everglades stay submerged {{from one year to}} the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal community as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also {{play an important role in}} the food chain. Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the impala – spanning across southern and eastern Africa – has remained intact to a great extent, although it has disappeared from a <b>few</b> <b>places,</b> such as Burundi. The range extends from central and southern Kenya and northeastern Uganda in the east to northern KwaZulu-Natal in the south, and westward up to Namibia and southern Angola. The black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia; the status of this subspecies has not been monitored since the 2000s. The common impala has a wider distribution, and has been introduced in protected areas in Gabon and across southern Africa.|$|E
50|$|The Delta Watershed park is {{a popular}} {{destination}} for local riders. It {{is one of the}} <b>few</b> <b>place</b> to mountain bike in Delta. There are other locations but they are mainly paved trails with no features - for instance Burns Bog trails (by Great Pacific Forum) and the Boundary Bay Dike.|$|R

50|$|The tournament {{was held}} mostly in bad weather, and the stadia had <b>few</b> {{protected}} <b>places.</b> <b>Few</b> western European nations had qualified, of which most were eliminated early. Fans from the Eastern neighbor states were hindered by political circumstances.|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} super Barcelona {{has often been}} political. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona {{gradually}} became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as {{a focal point for}} Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a <b>few</b> <b>places</b> where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 600 {{grizzly bears}} {{live in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{with more than half}} of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. Black bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears. Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.|$|E

5|$|On May 7, 2005, {{during an}} {{official}} state visit to Latvia, Bush {{was awarded the}} Order of the Three Stars presented to him by President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga. A <b>few</b> <b>places</b> outside the United States bear Bush's name. In 2005, the Tbilisi City Council voted to rename a street {{in honor of the}} U.S. president. Previously known as Melaani Drive, the street links the Georgian capital's airport with the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier. A street in Tirana, formerly known as Rruga Puntorët e Rilendjes, situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007. In Jerusalem, a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush.|$|E
