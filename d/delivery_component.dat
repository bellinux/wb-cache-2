This article {{suggests a}} multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) for achieving the dual goals of program optimization and program evaluation in the behavioral intervention field. Methods. MOST {{consists of the}} following three phases: (1) screening, in which randomized experimentation closely guided by theory is used to asses an array of program and/or <b>delivery</b> <b>components</b> and select the components that merit further investigation; (2) refining, in which interactions among the identified set of components and their interrelationships with covariates are investigated in detail, again via randomized experiments, and optimal dosage levels and combinations of components are identified; and (3) confirming, in which the resulting optimized intervention is evaluated {{by means of a}} standard randomized intervention trial. In order to make the best use of available resources, MOST relies on design and analysis tools that help maximize efficiency, such as fractional factorials. Results. A slightly modified version of an actual application of MOST to develop a smoking cessation intervention is used to develop and present the ideas. Conclusions. MOST has the potential to husband program development resources while increasing our understanding of the individual program and <b>delivery</b> <b>components</b> that make up interventions.

40|$|Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is {{a leading}} therapy in {{patients}} suffering from intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TACE is a transarterial therapy that involves injection of particles and chemotherapeutic agents to the tumour site. Once administrated, the particles block the {{blood flow to the}} tumour while also allowing targeted delivery. Several therapies have proven to increase survival in people suffering from HCC where drug eluting beads (DEBs) have become a frequently used method. Despite their success, DEBs are limited to drugs that interact with the embolizing material’s functional groups. Also, the embolizing beads must be calibrated to a patient’s blood vessel size where smaller sized beads will display faster release rates. In order to overcome these disadvantages, a Particle-in-Particle (PIP) system is proposed. Small microparticles (1 – 3 µm) are to be manufactured to suit a specific drug where they will function as a drug <b>delivery</b> <b>component.</b> These microparticles are then to be encapsulated into larger microparticles (100 – 1000 µm) which will act as an embolizing component of the PIP system.

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of interventions to increase physical activity among women experiencing disadvantage, and the intervention factors (i. e. physical activity measure, delivery mode, delivery channel, setting, duration, use of theory, behavioural techniques, participant age, risk of bias) associated with effectiveness. We conducted a meta-analysis of controlled trials using random-effects models and meta-regression. Seven databases were searched for trials among healthy women (18 – 64 years), which included a physical activity intervention, any control group, and statistical analyses of a physical activity outcome at baseline and post-intervention. Nineteen studies were included (n =  6, 339). Because of substantial statistical heterogeneity (χ 2  =  53. 61, df =  18, P <  0. 0001, I 2  =  66 %), an overall pooled effect is not reported. In subgroup analyses, between-group differences were evident for delivery mode, which modestly reduced heterogeneity (to 54 %). Studies with a group <b>delivery</b> <b>component</b> had a standardized mean difference of 0. 38 greater than either individual or community-based delivery. Programs with a group delivery mode significantly increase physical activity among women experiencing disadvantage, and group delivery should be considered an essential element of physical activity promotion programs targeting this population group. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Water loop {{maintenance}} {{components to}} maintain the water quality of the Advanced Spacesuit Water Membrane Evaporation (SWME) water recirculation loop have undergone a comparative performance evaluation with a recirculating control loop which had no water quality maintenance. Results show that periodic water maintenance can improve performance of the SWME. The SWME is a heat rejection device under development at the NASA Johnson Space Center to perform thermal control for advanced spacesuits. One advantage of this technology {{is the potential for}} a significantly greater degree of tolerance to contamination when compared to the existing sublimator technology. The driver for the evaluation of water recirculation maintenance components was to enhance the robustness of the SWME through the leveraging of fluid loop management lessons learned from the International Space Station (ISS). A patented bed design that was developed for a United Technologies Aerospace System military application provided a low pressure drop means for water maintenance in the SWME recirculation loop. The bed design is coupled with high capacity ion exchange resins, organic adsorbents, and a cyclic methodology developed for the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Transport Water loop. The maintenance cycle included the use of a biocide <b>delivery</b> <b>component</b> developed for the ISS to introduce a biocide in a microgravity compatible manner for the Internal Active Thermal Control System (IATCS).

This review, therefore, aims at understanding the determinants of low cervical cancer screening in Nigeria in order to contribute in reducing {{the burden of the}} disease. Literature were obtained from Global Health, Popline and PubMed databases; WHO and other relevant websites using Eldis search engine; and from libraries in the University of Leeds and WHO in Geneva. Conceptual framework for analyzing the determinants of cervical cancer screening uptake among Nigerian women was formed by inserting service <b>delivery</b> <b>component</b> of the WHO health system framework into a modified Health Belief Model. Wrong perception of cervical cancer and cervical cancer screening due to low level of knowledge about the disease and inadequate cervical cancer preventive were identified as the major determinants of low cervical cancer screening uptake in Nigeria. Among women, belief in being at risk and/or severity of cervical cancer was low just as belief on benefits of cervical cancer screening, unlike high belief in barriers to screening. Support from the community and screening skills among health-workers were inadequate. Improving uptake of cervical cancer screening will reduce the burden of the disease. Therefore, researchers and other stakeholders interested in prevention of cervical cancer should carry-out studies to identify interventions that could address the key determinants of low cervical cancer screening among Nigerian women...|$|E
