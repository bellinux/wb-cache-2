5000|$|The {{most common}} {{rationale}} offered by parapsychologists {{to explain the}} lack of a repeatable demonstration of <b>ESP</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> psi phenomena is to say that ESP in particular and psi phenomena in general are elusive or jealous phenomena.

The use of the nonfalsifiable hypothesis is permitted in parapsychology to a degree unheard of in any scientific discipline.

40|$|Abstract. The MAP {{method is}} a wide spread {{technique}} used in many signal processing problems, e. g., image restoration, denoising and 3 D reconstruction. When {{there is a large}} number of variables to estimate, the MAP method leads to an huge set of linear or non-linear equations which must be numerically solved using time consuming algorithms. This paper proposes a fast method to compute the MAP estimates in large scale problems, based on the solution of a linear or linearized set of equations by low pass filtering the ML solution. A family of space varying IIR filters is derived from the MAP criterion with data dependent coefficients. <b>Other</b> <b>filter</b> expressions can be derived by the same approach, using different assumptions about the prior <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>filter</b> design strategies. The filter approach proposed in this paper is much faster than the calssic solution and provides additional insights about the structure of the problem.

30|$|Many {{researches}} used two-stage {{approach that}} first detects location of impulse noise and then apply median <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>filters</b> derived from median on those detected locations only to avoid blurring. To detect impulsive noise, Vijaykumar et al.

This algorithm fails in regions with high density of noise as more than two differences will be greater that threshold. Jampur et al. [24] and Luo [25] used fuzzy-based techniques to detect impulse noise and then applies heuristic median and median filters respectively on those detected pixels. Heuristic median filter uses average of non-noisy pixels that results in an average filter which causes blurring.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} representation, the “modulation spectrum,” where modulation frequency exists {{jointly with}} regular Fourier frequency, <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>filter</b> channel index, {{has been previously}} investigated. Accurate modulation filters would offer, for example, new approaches for signal separation and noise reduction. However, a filtering operation on modulation frequency components {{has yet to be}} carefully defined. Most previous studies on modulation filtering assumed that the amplitude modulation envelope is real and non-negative, which has recently been shown to be incorrect. Distortions appear when the non-negative envelope assumption fails. Beginning with a more appropriate envelope assumption that allows the envelope to go negative, we propose three properties which modulation filtering systems should satisfy. Any modulation filtering method which satisfies these properties will yield distortion-free results. An implementation of modulation filtering based on a short-time Fourier transform followed by independent coherent demodulation for each frequency channel is then proposed. Satisfaction of the properties is confirmed and an example result of modulation filtering on speech signal is illustrated. 1...|$|R

Using elastic cloud storage and computation makes {{them even more}} attractive. However cloud providers such as Amazon and Windows Azure separate their storage and compute resources even within the same data center. Transferring data from storage to compute thus uses core data center network bandwidth, which is scarce and oversubscribed. As the data is unstructured, the infrastructure cannot automatically apply selection, projection, <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>filtering</b> predicates at the storage layer. The problem is even worse if customers want to use compute resources on one provider but use data stored with other provider(s).

It uses static analysis of application code to generate filters that are safe, stateless, side effect free, best effort, and transparent to both storage and compute layers.
