The influence of the economies of scale in <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> and terminal operations {{are taken into account}} in the analysis. In the model the transport costs are defined and related to different transport operations and conditions (e. g. share of empty kilometres, capacity usage of terminals, etc.) in order to analyse the sensitivity of the cost performance of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport.</b> By doing this it is possible to analyse to what extent intermodal freight transport is competitive with road-only transport in terms of transport costs and specific operations and conditions (both in shipping and terminal). The conclusions prove that roundtrips, drop & pick operations in pre- and end-haulage and smaller containers (20 ft instead of 40 ft) considerably improve the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport,</b> while the relative high cost operations in small terminals reduce the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport...</b>|$|R

40|$|Future {{climate change}} is {{expected}} to affect <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in most main natural waterways in Europe. For the river Rhine it is expected that, in summer, more and longer periods with low water levels will occur. In periods of low water levels <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> vessels have to reduce their load factors and, as a result, transport prices per tonne will increase. One possible consequence of these higher transport prices is a deterioration of the competitive position of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> compared with rail and road transport, and thus a change in modal split. We study this issue using a GIS-based software model called NODUS which provides a tool for the detailed analysis of freight transportation over extensive multimodal networks.

40|$|Future climate {{conditions}} {{are likely to}} affect <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in Europe. According to some climate scenarios, in summer, in the river Rhine, periods with low water levels are likely to occur more often and become more serious. Then <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> carriers will experience more severe restrictions on the load factor of their inland ships, which implies a stronger reduction in transport capacity in the market. Transport prices will rise under such conditions. Some studies reviewed in this paper find that at extremely low water levels, the price per tonne for <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in the river Rhine area will almost double. These increased transport prices result in welfare losses. For the dry summer in 2003, the losses for North West Europe are estimated to sum up to around € 480 million. Increased transport prices trigger adaptation. <b>Inland</b> <b>waterway</b> carriers may use smaller vessels, and shippers {{have the opportunity to}} shift from <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> to alternative transport modes in periods with low water levels.

40|$|In its White Paper on Transport, the European Commission recognizes {{intermodal}} transport {{as an alternative}} solution to road transport.

40|$|Climate {{change may}} affect inland {{waterway}} transport through disturbances in waterway hydrology: longer periods with strong water swells and drops. To allow fully loaded barges, the water level must be neither too high (limited air draught) nor too low (limited draught). Therefore, the water level impacts the load factor of barges and thus the transportation costs. Moreover, in winter, ice jams can paralyze inland waterway traffic on the river. In this paper, the effect of various climatological changes on the capacity of inland waterway in terms of barge transport is examined. The paper focusses {{on the development of}} a methodology for assessing the sensitivity of inland waterway systems to climatological changes and takes into account an experts' opinion survey that provides insight into the perceived likelihood of the different scenarios that are investigated.

30|$|Freight {{transport}} {{is fundamental}} to the prosperity of nations {{both within and outside}} of Europe. Central Europe consists of a dense network of road, railways and inland waterways (IWT) gradually becoming less dense as the periphery is approached and population densities reduce (TRANSVisions 2009). The transport of goods adds place and time utility to the product, which in turn facilitates a positive contribution to a region’s gross domestic product (GDP). The positive contributions of transport services include economic growth and job creation, amongst others. Conversely, transport is generally associated with negative effects, such as congestion, emissions and noise (which are acute in the central regions). Transport modes (road, rail and IWT) increasingly aim to address these negative impacts and be efficient, competitive and sustainable. Today’s transport offers a global service inline with global supply chains therefore requiring the participation of national and international actors. In Europe, the desire to make transport more sustainable, efficient and competitive is expressed as part of the EU Transport White Paper 2011 (European Commission 2011). This overarching policy document sets targets for greater use of rail freight and <b>inland</b> <b>waterways</b> <b>transport,</b> in both the near and the longer term futures. Specifically, the paper targets a modal shift from road to more sustainable modes (rail freight & IWT) of 30  % by 2030 and 50  % by 2050 for distances greater than 300  km.|$|E

The development of the main waterway in Colombia, The Magdalena River, has increased the interest of private and governmental participants. While the issues of navigability, waterways infrastructure and inland waterways ports (IWP) have been addressed extensively in recent plans, studies and projects, few studies deal with issues related to <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> <b>Transport</b> (IWT) governance structure and policy framework. In order to fill this gap, this research project explored and compared different aspects of the Colombian and the Dutch IWT model. The emphasis was on issues related to IWT policies, role of institutions {{in the development of the}} IWT and the IWT promotion plans and strategies. The research based its findings on interviews with Colombian IWT executives and experts. Weaknesses, limitations and opportunities of the Colombian inland waterway transportation system (IWS) were found. Further, applicable aspects of the Dutch IWT model to the Colombia IWS were identified. The results indicated a lack of three essential factors in the Colombian IWS model: 1) well-structured policies and regulations, 2) coordination between governmental entities at national, regional and local level and 3) innovation and support of IWT promotion policies. Thus, the conclusion reflected the importance of adopting some aspects of the Dutch IWT model in order to improve and develop an efficient IWS in Colombia.
