Overhead costs, the variables {{that occur in the}} July-August-September amounted to IDR 4, 769, 313. 83 which means that the actual cost is less than its budget. Total difference in costThe difference consists of the sum of the variable costs and semi-variable overhead amounting to IDR 5, 330, 664. 83 by a margin of <b>fixed</b> <b>overhead</b> cost of IDR 561, 351. 00. While the variable overhead costs that occurred in the period October - November-December amounted to IDR 3, 348, 794. 05 which means that the actual cost is less than budgeted. The difference can be based on the sum of the difference in variable costs and semi-variable overhead for IDR 3, 910, 145. 05 with <b>fixed</b> <b>overhead</b> costs amounting IDR 561, 351. 00 (Profitable).
