5|$|Shakespeare makes {{reference}} to Birnam Wood {{being used as}} camouflage for Malcolm Canmore’s army before the battle at Dunsinane with MacBeth. There is an ancient tree, the Birnam Oak, standing a few hundred metres from the centre of Birnam. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> {{have been part of}} Birnam Wood {{at the time of the}} battle 900 years ago, and remains part of the legend.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown creeper}} has {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be a}} subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, but has closer affinities to short-toed treecreeper, and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson's treecreeper is a more recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome b mtDNA sequence and song structure that indicate that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> be a distinct species from C. familiaris.|$|E
5|$|The name Dunster {{derives from}} an earlier name Torre ("tor, rocky hill"), {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book written twenty years after the Norman conquest. The origin of the prefix is uncertain, although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> refer to Dunn, a Saxon noble who held land in nearby Elworthy and Willett before the conquest, giving Dunestore meaning Dunn's craggy hill.|$|E

5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> {{be that he}} fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period {{leading up to the}} battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 difficult. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> {{have been}} these Inquisitors who, in 1543, decided that Mercator was eminent {{enough to be}} sacrificed. His name {{appeared}} {{on a list of}} 52 Lutheran heretics which included an architect, a sculptor, a former rector of the university, a monk, three priests and many others. All were arrested except Mercator who had left Leuven for Rupelmonde on business concerning the estate of his recently deceased uncle Gisbert. That made matters worse for he was now classified as a fugitive who, by fleeing arrest, had proved his own guilt.|$|E

5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers {{were highly}} skilled, {{and before the}} end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> be that this wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.|$|E
5|$|The Sicilian {{historian}} Diodorus Siculus, {{writing in}} the 1st century BC in his Bibliotheca Historica, also provides {{an account of the}} Battle of Plataea. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's, but given that it was written much later, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been derived from Herodotus's version. The Battle is also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias of Cnidus, and is alluded by other authors, such as the playwright Aeschylus. Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E

5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
5|$|While Alvarado was {{consolidating}} {{his power}} in the Ulúa valley, Juan de Chávez's expedition in southern Higueras had met stiff resistance. They had marched up the Naco valley to the Peñol de Cerquín ("Rock of Cerquín"), which had been bypassed by Alvarado on his initial incursion. The Peñol de Cerquín was a formidable rocky butte that had been fortified by the natives. A great number of Indians had amassed at the fortress, which dominated the whole of southern Honduras. The natives were entrenched in the fortress, and determined to resist any Spanish attempt to pass. It is not known who led the indigenous resistance at this time, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been Lempira, a war leader who would later distinguish himself against the invading Spanish.|$|E
5|$|It {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium-254, which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms,Es|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=122|pages=411–417|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90435-2|first10=R.

L.|displayauthors=9}} to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories, and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of ultraheavy elements. However, given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> be discovered in the near future through other reactions, and indeed attempts to synthesise it in 2019 and 2020 are currently planned at laboratories at Japan and Russia. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet, and it is also possible, due to drip instabilities, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible. No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals, such as unhexpentium, due to their extremely high atomic number: they would require new, more powerful technology to make.|$|E

5|$|This latter {{theory is}} not heraldically tenable as the {{quarters}} in an achievement {{after the first}} and pronominal quarter brought into the family by marriage to heraldic heiresses cannot meaningfully exist {{on their own to}} represent the person who now quarters them. It is more probable then that the arms of the College really are those of Archbishop Rotherham and were assumed to be those of the College by John Speed who saw them on one of its buildings in 1605 when preparing his map. Lawrence Hall in Ship Street was given to Rotherham in 1476 and leased to Jesus in 1572. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have displayed the Archbishop’s arms in its structure as did the building {{on the south side of}} the front quad of Lincoln which he completed. These arms for Jesus College could not be confused with those of Lincoln as that College, since 1574, already had a complex tripartite coat granted to it by Richard Lee, Portcullis Pursuivant, in which the colour of the stags in the centre section had been changed to Or (gold) and their attitude to statant.|$|E
5|$|To sustain this {{military}} machine and meet other state expenses, {{large amounts of}} revenue were necessary. Greater Poland had some natural resources used for trade, such as fur, hide, honey and wax, but those surely did not provide enough income. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Prague in Bohemia, a city built of stone, was the main center for the exchange of trading commodities {{in this part of}} Europe. From Kraków, the Slavic traders brought tin, salt, amber and whatever other products they had, most importantly slaves; Muslim, Jewish, Hungarian and other traders were the buyers. The Life of St. Adalbert, written {{at the end of the}} 10th century by John Canaparius, records the fate of many Christian slaves sold in Prague as the main curse of the time. Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th-century Gniezno Doors. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> be that the territorial expansion financed itself by being the source of loot, of which the captured local people were the most valuable part. The scale of the human trade practice is arguable, however, because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near-gord settlements, where they could serve the victors in various capacities and thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state. Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and central Europe. The slave trade not insufficient to meet all revenue needs, the Piast state had to look for other options.|$|E
5|$|Warelwast {{served the}} king as an envoy to Pope Urban II in 1095, when {{the king was}} seeking to have the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm of Canterbury, removed from office. He visited the pope with another royal clerk, Gerard, with orders to recognize Urban as pope in return for Anselm's deposition, {{at least according to}} Eadmer, an Anselm partisan. The two clerks travelled very quickly, as they did not leave before 28February 1095 and were back in England by 13May 1095. Eadmer claimed that the ambassadors were supposed to acquire a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, for the king to give to his new choice as archbishop. But although the king may have instructed his envoys to attempt to secure these objects, he was probably willing to negotiate and to settle for less. The two clerks returned with a papal legate, Walter of Albano, who accepted the king's recognition of Urban but refused to allow Anselm's deposition. The king did nevertheless manage to secure recognition of his royal rights in the church, and a concession that no papal legates or communications would be sent without his approval. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> be that the king always regarded Anselm's deposition as unlikely.|$|E
