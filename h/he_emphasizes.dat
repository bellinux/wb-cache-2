25|$|Quinet fled Louis Napoléon’s 1851 coup d’état to Brussels until 1858 {{and then}} fled to Veytaux, Switzerland, until 1870. His wife had died some time previously, {{and he now}} married Hermione Asachi (or Asaky), the {{daughter}} of Gheorghe Asachi, a Romanian poet. In Brussels, Quinet lived for some seven years, during which he published Les Esclaves ("The Slaves", 1853), a dramatic poem, Marnix de Sainte-Aldégonde (1854), {{a study of the}} Reformer in which <b>he</b> <b>emphasizes</b> Sainte-Aldégonde's literary merit, and some other books.|$|E
25|$|Comim {{uses the}} history of the {{economics}} of growth in order to illustrate the historical nature of the concept of applied economics. He first discusses the perspective of the theorists’ views of the applied dimension of their work and examines each {{from the perspective of the}} work carried out at the Department of Applied Economics (DAE) at Cambridge University. <b>He</b> <b>emphasizes</b> the divergences concerning economists’ understanding of the proper use of economic theory, divergences that might ultimately reveal the influence of distinct practices as far as applied economics is concerned and the role of institutional environments.|$|E
25|$|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (recurring season 2, main cast season 3–5)– {{a crooked}} strip mall lawyer who {{represents}} Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer Robert Evans. I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. <b>He</b> <b>emphasizes</b> interesting words. He has loads of attitude {{in almost every}} line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then I go out and I do Saul.|$|E

25|$|Defeating ISIS: Who They Are, How They Fight, What They Believe is a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism against ISIS. It {{was written by}} Malcolm Nance, a former {{cryptology}} analyst, with a foreword by Richard Engel. Nance's thesis in the work is that ISIS {{is not part of}} Islam, and instead functions as destructive extremist group. <b>He</b> <b>emphasizes</b> a majority of those harmed by ISIS are themselves Muslim. The book traces the history of the movement from Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and discusses their combat and recruiting tactics. Nance offers a four-point plan to defeat ISIS, including airpower and special forces, Internet tactics, strengthening the Syrian military, and engaging Arab world states.|$|E
25|$|Nance {{provides}} {{a discussion on}} suicide attacks, and stresses that in most cases those who commit suicide by bombing other individuals are generally not psychotic in nature. <b>He</b> <b>emphasizes</b> that these individuals {{are for the most}} part logical and smart people with extremist religious viewpoints. While not attempting to explain their acts, Nance notes it is crucial to comprehend terrorists' thought processes so that law enforcement officials may attempt to anticipate them. The book goes over common tactics used by clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents. Nance notes such organizations are a key component to terror operations, and require additional study. He gives forth an analysis of different types of clandestine cell systems, explaining common methodologies, covert communication methods, and from where they recruit their agents.|$|E
25|$|Ovid tells {{this story}} in the Fasti, his long-form poetic work on the Roman calendar. It may explain why the Matronalia, a festival celebrated by married women in honor of Juno as a goddess of childbirth, {{occurred}} {{on the first day}} of Mars' month, which is also marked on a calendar from late antiquity as the birthday of Mars. In the earliest Roman calendar, March was the first month, and the god would have been born with the new year. Ovid is the only source for the story. He may be presenting a literary myth of his own invention, or an otherwise unknown archaic Italic tradition; either way, in choosing to include the story, <b>he</b> <b>emphasizes</b> that Mars was connected to plant life and was not alienated from female nurture.|$|E

25|$|Musashi {{spent many}} years {{studying}} Buddhism and swordsmanship. He was an accomplished artist, sculptor, and calligrapher. Records also show that he had architectural skills. Also, {{he seems to have}} had a rather straightforward approach to combat, with no additional frills or aesthetic considerations. This was probably due to his real-life combat experience; although in his later life, Musashi followed the more artistic side of bushidō. He made various Zen brush paintings, calligraphy, and sculpted wood and metal. Even in The Book of Five Rings <b>he</b> <b>emphasizes</b> that samurai should understand other professions as well. It should be understood that Musashi's writings were very ambiguous, and translating them into English makes them even more so; that is why so many different translations of The Book of Five Rings can be found. To gain further insight into Musashi's principles and personality, one could read his other works, such as Dokkodo and Hyoho Shiji ni Kajo.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Barth, liberalism, and fundamentalism {{goes far beyond}} the issue of inerrancy, however. From Barth's perspective, liberalism, as understood {{in the sense of}} the 19th century with Friedrich Schleiermacher and Hegel as its leading exponents and not necessarily expressed in any particular political ideology, is the divinization of human thinking. This, to him, inevitably leads one or more philosophical concepts to become the false God, thus attempting to block the true voice of the living God. This, in turn, leads to the captivity of theology by human ideology. In Barth's theology, <b>he</b> <b>emphasizes</b> again and again that human concepts of any kind, breadth or narrowness quite beside the point, can never be considered as identical to God's revelation. In this aspect, Scripture is also written human language, which bears witness to the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ. Scripture cannot be considered as identical to God's self-revelation, which is properly only Jesus Christ. However, in his freedom and love, God truly reveals himself through human language and concepts, with a view toward their necessity in reaching fallen humanity. Thus Barth claims that Christ is truly presented in Scripture and the preaching of the church, echoing a stand expressed in his native Swiss Reformed Church's Helvetic Confession of the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{historians are}} also not {{unanimous}} about {{who led the}} missions to Rome and Constantinople. According to Yordan Ivanov the second mission was led by Sondoke, while Venedikov suggests it was Stazis. According to Gyuzelev the leading person in the Bulgarian delegation was Peter which was made clear during the Council of Constantinople. <b>He</b> <b>emphasizes</b> that according {{to the story of}} Anastasius Bibliothecarius the gifts to the Roman legates were sent through Peter. Peter is the person of the Bulgarian delegation in Constantinople who spoke at the Council. Gyuzelev also pays attention to the letters of Pope John VIII. Letters were sent to Boris I (16 April 878 and May 879), to Doks— brother of Boris I (April 878), to Peter (16 April 878) and to high ranking boils including Peter (in the letter of May 879). In the letter of April 878 addressed personally to Peter the Pope called him comita (Petrum comitem). It has been suggested that under comita the Pope did not mean a regional governor but comes palatii, i. e. the first person in the court of the ruler. Gyuzelev concludes that Peter's role in the events between 866 and 879 is more important than that of the ichirgu-boil Stazis and therefore Peter must have been kavhan at least during that period.|$|E
