40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{investigation}} of the combined heat, ice, and water balances {{was carried out in}} the Marukh glacier basin (west Caucasus) in 1966 [...] 67 to 1976 - 77, according to the <b>International</b> <b>Hydrological</b> Decade <b>programme.</b> Averaged glacier mass balance for these II years appears to be- 55 g cm- 2 year- 1 according to stake measurements, and- 51 g cm- 2 year- 1 according to geodetic measurements. The variability of accumulation is estimated as Cv = 0. 15 and of ablation as Cv = 0. 11. Thus, the variation in accumulation governs the oscillations in glacier balance. The inner nourishment of the glacier was also taken into account. The glacier mass balance is closely related to the relation between the accumulation and ablation areas. The "transient" values of both figures during the whole period of ablation can be used for this relation. The forms of the accumulation and ablation fields are similar from year to year and from one 10 day period to another. The areas o...|$|R

It might seem a paradox to spend time and money on water management in 'wet' zones, but this designation contains some extremely marked variations in annual rainfall, rain falls copiously for a short period and is followed by months of scorching heat. The Centre will address the many problems of water management which are common to the countries of this region: deforestation water pollution, erosion etc. It will also work with the Caribbean region, which has to contend with the specific hydrological problems which affect islands: infiltration of seawater, water shortage sewage disposal in small land masses, degradation of the shoreline, etc. Mike Bonell UNESCO/lnternational <b>Hydrological</b> <b>Programme</b> 1 rue Miollis, 75732 Paris cedex 15, FRANCEUNESCO {{will open a}} centre for research on the problems of water resources in Latin America and the Caribbean in Panama City, as a result of an agreement signed on 13 November, 1992 in Paris.

We compare two major international collaboration programs in Earth and environmental sciences, the International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) and the <b>International</b> <b>Hydrological</b> Program (IHP). High mutual dependence, a positive international scientific reputation, and bottom-up funding structure explain the IGBP's capability to effectively organize international collaboration; low mutual dependence, intergovernmental decision structures, and organizational barriers to growth hinder effective capacity building by the IHP. We conclude that future collaboration programs focusing on cumulative global change research should consider the relative strengths of both collaboration models...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{and timely}} flash floods forecasting, especially, in ungauged and poorly gauged basins, {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and challenging problems to be solved by the <b>international</b> <b>hydrological</b> community. In changing climate and variable anthropogenic impact on river basins, as well as due to low density of surface hydrometeorological network, flash flood forecasting based on “traditional” physically based, or conceptual, or statistical hydrological models often becomes inefficient. Unfortunately, most of river basins in Russia are poorly gauged or ungauged; besides, lack of hydrogeological data is quite typical. However, the developing economy and population safety necessitate issuing warnings based on reliable forecasts. For this purpose, a new hydrological model, MLCM 3 (Multi-Layer Conceptual Model, 3 rd generation) has been developed in the Russian State Hydrometeorological University. The model showed good results in more than 50 tested basins...|$|R
