A system of ground stations was to be developed to collect <b>data</b> <b>transmitted</b> by the satellite, observe the satellite's orbit, and transmit commands to the satellite.

The server and client negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data is transmitted (see Algorithm below). The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected).|$|E
25|$|If {{a filling}} station allows {{customers}} to pay at the register, {{the data from}} the dispensers may be transmitted via RS232, RS485 or Ethernet to the point of sale, usually inside the filling station's building, and fed into the station's cash register operating system. The cash register system gives a limited control over the fuel dispenser, and is usually limited to allowing the clerks to turn the pumps on and off. A separate system is used to monitor the fuel tank's status and quantities of fuel. With sensors directly in the fuel tank, the data is fed to a terminal in the back room, where it can be downloaded or printed out. Sometimes this method is bypassed, with the fuel tank <b>data</b> <b>transmitted</b> directly into an external database.|$|E

25|$|Interpretation of the <b>data</b> <b>transmitted</b> {{from the}} craft was {{published}} in the journal Science. As per the peer reviewed data the presence of water ice has been confirmed and that the site had a wetter and warmer climate in the recent past. Finding calcium carbonate in the Martian soil leads scientists to believe that the site had been wet or damp in the geological past. During seasonal or longer period diurnal cycles water may have been present as thin films. The tilt or obliquity of Mars changes far more than the Earth; hence times of higher humidity are probable. The data also confirms the presence of the chemical perchlorate. Perchlorate makes up a few tenths of a percent of the soil samples. Perchlorate is used as food by some bacteria on Earth. Another paper claims that the previously detected snow could lead to a buildup of water ice. The reports leaves the question of presence of organic compounds open ended since heating the samples containing perchlorate would have broken down the organic material.|$|E
25|$|Fortunately, Galileo possessed an {{additional}} low-gain antenna that {{was capable of}} transmitting information back to Earth, although since it transmitted a signal isotropically, the low-gain antenna's bandwidth was significantly less than what the high-gain antenna's would have been; the high-gain antenna was to have transmitted at 134kilobits per second, whereas the low-gain antenna was only intended to transmit at about 8 to 16bits per second. Galileo low-gain antenna transmitted with a power of about 15 to 20watts, which, {{by the time it}} reached Earth and had been collected by one of the large aperture (70 m) NASA Deep Space Network antennas, had a total power of about âˆ’170dBm or 10zeptowatts (watts). Through the implementation of sophisticated technologies, the arraying of several Deep Space Network antennas and sensitivity upgrades to the receivers used to listen to Galileo signal, data throughput was increased to a maximum of 160bits per second. By further using data compression, the effective data rate could be raised to 1,000bits per second. The data collected on Jupiter and its moons was stored in the spacecraft's onboard tape recorder, and transmitted back to Earth during the long apoapsis portion of the probe's orbit using the low-gain antenna. At the same time, measurements were made of Jupiter's magnetosphere and transmitted back to Earth. The reduction in available bandwidth reduced the total amount of <b>data</b> <b>transmitted</b> throughout the mission, although 70% of Galileo science goals could still be met.|$|E

The jamming {{was described by}} various press publications as either the first instance of high-technology terrorism, or the most widely watched instance of electronic graffiti in the world.

Members of Congress showed interest, with those coming from states with extensive rural areas showing more sympathy to owners of satellite dishes. The hijacking raised concerns over satellite-borne communications: that <b>data</b> <b>transmitted</b> by business and military users would become potential targets. MacDougall's action led to him being immediately regarded as coming close to being a folk hero amongst disgruntled satellite dish owners who felt unfairly treated.
