5|$|In 1909, Liliʻuokalani {{brought an}} {{unsuccessful}} {{lawsuit against the}} United States under the Fifth Amendment seeking {{the return of the}} Hawaiian Crown Lands. The US courts invoked an 1864 Kingdom Supreme Court decision over a case involving the Dowager Queen Emma and Kamehameha V, using <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her.</b> In this decision the courts found that the Crown Lands were not necessarily the private possession of the monarch in the strictest sense of the term.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{eccentric}} member of staff is Alan Statham (Mark Heap), an overbearing, stuttering and pedantic consultant radiologist, whose everyday actions regularly border on insanity. He is desperately and hopelessly {{in love with}} Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood), the 48-year-old head of human resources with an increasingly sardonic attitude. Their relationship is an open secret, with student doctor Boyce (Oliver Chris), often {{using it as a}} weapon against them, bullying Alan constantly. Joanna's human resources staff also use <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her,</b> in particular Kim Alabaster (Sally Bretton), who has a bad attitude towards most of the people she meets, and Naughty Rachel (Katie Lyons), who earned her nickname due to her love of sex. The other HR staff include Harriet Schulenburg (Olivia Colman), an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage, and Karen Ball (Lucinda Raikes), who divides her time between doing much of the office's work, trying to attract Martin's affections, and being bullied by Kim and Rachel.|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 1992, Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old {{woman from}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, ordered a 49-cent {{cup of coffee}} from the drive-through window of a local McDonald's {{restaurant}} located at 5001 Gibson Boulevard Southeast. Liebeck was in the passenger's seat of a 1989 Ford Probe which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the coffee cup between her knees and pulled {{the far side of}} the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap. Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants; they absorbed the coffee and held <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> skin, scalding her thighs, buttocks, and groin.|$|E

500|$|Leslie calls {{a meeting}} and apologizes to Raul, who in turn apologizes as well and offers Leslie a check for $35,000 {{to fill in the}} pit. Leslie fears it may be [...] "dirty money", but accepts. During a photo {{opportunity}} later, Raul sets up a video camera and asks Leslie say [...] "Viva Venezuela" [...] and [...] "Viva Chavez" [...] to <b>it.</b> <b>Against</b> <b>her</b> wishes, Leslie reluctantly does so. When Raul starts speaking Spanish to the camera, Leslie asks April to translate, and learns Raul is discussing his [...] "Committee to Humiliate and Shame America". A furious Leslie tears up the $35,000 check and shouts [...] "Viva America", prompting Raul to declare Pawnee is no longer their sister city and storm out. Leslie insists she will raise the money to build the park without them and Tom, inspired by her example, secretly puts all the tip money he made from the Venezuelans into the park donation jar. The episode ends with Leslie and Tom later receiving an online video from April, who tells them she and Donna are vacationing with Jhonny (JC Gonzalez) in his Venezuelan palace, which is watched over by armed guards.|$|E
2500|$|A L. acervorum queen eats eggs {{by picking}} up the egg with her mandibles and {{manipulating}} <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> mouthparts with her forefeet. [...] She pierces the egg’s membranous skin and laps the egg’s fluid through the hole. [...] When {{the contents of the}} egg are emptied, typically after a few minutes, the queen will then discard the remaining skin by either dropping it to the floor or placing it on the mouthparts of a larva (which then eats the skin).|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with his}} sister, Andrew notices Bree's {{increasing}} alcohol consumption, and uses <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her.</b> When Bree refuses to let Andrew access his trust fund {{to buy a}} car, he calls her a [...] "mean old drunk", and she slaps him. Andrew emotionally blackmails Justin into punching him {{in the same place}} Bree slapped him. He then hires a lawyer to file for emancipation from his mother, whom he accuses of hitting him while drunk. Andrew tries to persuade her in [...] "There Is No Other Way" [...] to just let him go, but she refuses saying she hasn't [...] "set him right" [...] yet. Andrew, after consultation with his lawyer, tells Bree in [...] "Could I Leave You?" [...] that he will accuse her of molesting him if he does not get his way.|$|E

60|$|Then Mary drew up the pebble once {{or twice}} more, and let Rollo see <b>it</b> fall <b>against</b> <b>her</b> hand. Rollo {{observed}} {{that it was a}} very regular arc.|$|R
2500|$|In their {{accounts}} of the descent of Christ's body from the Cross, the evangelists relate the story only {{in connection with the}} Entombment of Christ. According to the canonical gospels, Joseph of Arimathea took Christ's body and prepared it for burial. John (19:38–42) adds one assistant, Nicodemus. None of these accounts mention Mary. During the Middle Ages, the narrative of the Passion became more elaborate, and more attention was paid to the role of Christ's mother. One example is the anonymous 14th-century text, Meditationes de Vita Christi, perhaps by Ludolph of Saxony. Barbara Lane suggests this passage from the Vita Christi might lie behind many paintings of the Deposition, including Rogier's: [...] "Then the lady reverently receives the hanging right hand and places <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> cheek gazes upon it, and kisses it with heavy tears and sorrowful sighs." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{an unusually}} urgent prod, Tiha dropped a stone and was duly goaded while she sank {{to her knees}} and with one arm scooped <b>it</b> in <b>against</b> <b>her</b> side, regained her feet, and waddled on.|$|R
60|$|She {{had opened}} a {{rosewood}} work-box, {{and was looking}} at a photograph. Having contemplated it a little while she pressed <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> bosom, and put it again in its place.|$|E
60|$|Malinche said no more. Her {{dark eyes}} {{were full of}} tears, but with the habit of {{submission}} natural to Mexican women, she simply took Roger's hand and placed <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> forehead.|$|E
6000|$|And the woman, {{placing his}} hand and {{pressing}} <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> heart, said, as a great woman had said before her, [...] "A tent and a crust of bread with you, Richard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see why—why {{it should}} make trouble between us, Lettie," [...] he faltered. She made a swift gesture of repulsion, whereupon, {{catching}} {{sight of her}} hand, she hid <b>it</b> swiftly <b>against</b> <b>her</b> skirt again.|$|R
60|$|FRANK [after a pause of stupefaction, {{raising the}} rifle] Youll {{testify before the}} coroner that it's an accident, Viv. [He takes aim at the {{retreating}} figure of Crofts. Vivie seizes the muzzle and pulls <b>it</b> round <b>against</b> <b>her</b> breast].|$|R
60|$|During {{all these}} {{movements}} the dowager {{had a difficult}} game to play. It was unbecoming her to encourage the strife, and <b>it</b> was <b>against</b> <b>her</b> wishes to suppress it; she therefore moralized with the peer, and frowned upon her daughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a dear, {{but you are}} very, very stupid," [...] she said, and as {{she spoke}} she caught my hand and pressed the palm of <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> cheek. [...] "What do you feel?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly {{she felt}} {{his hands on her}} waist. She did not move, her heart beat too furiously; but a sort of prayer fluttered up from <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> lips. In the grip of those heavy hands was such quivering force! ...|$|E
6000|$|With a quick indrawn breath she pounced upon it. [...] "At last," [...] she said, [...] "you give me {{something}} for which I can be grateful to you." [...] And on the words she laid the point of <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b> breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it was somethign of a nouriceship, I believe; and she {{remained}} here, because her two grandsons {{were engaged in}} your service.

6000|$|... "Good!" [...] he answered, {{and that}} {{satisfied}} her better than {{if he had}} entered into those subtleties which {{she had tried to}} express: {{it was more like a}} man. He had his arm about her again, and she put down her hand on his to press <b>it</b> closer <b>against</b> <b>her</b> heart.|$|R
60|$|Snatching a bloom of the lilies {{into her}} hand, {{the hand that}} he had kissed, Masouda pressed <b>it</b> convulsively <b>against</b> <b>her</b> breast, till the red juice ran from the crushed flower and stained her like a wound.

60|$|The wicked {{woman was}} greatly {{pleased with the}} success of her trick, {{for as long as she}} had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm, and Dorothy could not use <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her,</b> even had she known how to do so.|$|E

60|$|Yet, as {{she went}} home again with the young man, {{she put her hand}} on his arm tentatively, a little bit ashamed, her hand pleaded that he would not hold <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>her,</b> her recusancy. But he was obscured. He seemed to become blind, as if he were not there with her.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{looked at}} him. He looked at Elizabeth. There was a pause, while he summed her up.

In this instance, also, suicide was averted and the domestic differences were arranged.|$|R
