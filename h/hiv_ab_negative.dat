40|$|Background: Although, in {{the past}} the risk of {{transfusion}} transmitted viral infections were high in hemophilia patients, but introduction of viral inactivation methods in 1985,decreased the risk of human immunodeficiency and hepatitis C and B viruses transmission significantly. The aim of study was seroprevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) and human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIVAb) in hemophiliacs in west Azarbaijan of Iran, born in 1985 - 2010. Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, fifty patients with hereditary bleeding disorders born in 1985 - 2010, from total 250 patients who had been registered in Urmia Hemophilia Society were enrolled through the year 2010 to assess their seroprevalence for HCV <b>Ab,</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab</b> and HBs Ag. Thirty five of 50 patients had hemophilia. Also; we performed a subset analysis for hemophilia patients. Results: All 50 patients with hereditary bleeding disorders including 35 patients with hemophilia were seronegative for <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab</b> and HBs Ag. HCV-Ab was detected in serum of 3 of 50 (6 %) patients with bleeding disorders. After subset analysis for hemophilia (A and B) patients, we found HCV infection in 8. 57 % (3 of 35) of hemophiliacs. Conclusion: In this study prevalence of HCV infection was very smaller than similar studies in Iran and other countries. This study shows the safety of using viral inactivated factor concentrates and recombinant factors after year 1985. None of Hemophiliacs were seropositive for <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab</b> and HBs Ag...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of hepatitis viruses in hemodialysis patients {{has been reported}} to be much greater than in the general population. Attention to local data, effectively guides health planners so that they can control infections and prevent nosocomial transmissions. Objectives: This cross sectional study was carried out to determine the {{prevalence of}} hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and hepatitis D (HDV) viruses, as well as the human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) in dialysis centers in the Kerman Province, in the southeast of Iran. Patients and Methods: All hemodialysis patients (n = 228) in 7 centers were enrolled in the study. Hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg), HCV antibodies (Ab), HDV <b>Ab</b> and <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab</b> were measured using speciﬁc enzyme linked immunoassay kits (ULTRA kit, bioMérieux, France) and conﬁrmed by a qualitative PCR assay. Results: The studied group was comprised of 92 (40. 4 %) females and 136 (59. 6 %) males. The mean age of the patients was 51 ± 9. 5 years and the duration of hemodialysis was 39. 7 ± 7. 9 months. Positive HBsAg was found in 7 % of cases, HCV Ab in 7 %, and patients with both viruses were detected in 1. 7 % cases. <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab</b> and HDV <b>Ab</b> were <b>negative</b> in all cases. Out of the other risk factors, frequency of blood transfusions was signiﬁcantly correlated with positive HCV Ab (P < 0. 008). Conclusions: Prevalence of HBV and HCV in hemodialysis patients was moderate to low in the Kerman Province, as {{in other parts of the}} country.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the rate of}} seropositivity to hepatitis B and C and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections among children with β-thalassemia major receiving multiple transfusions in Ahmedabad, India, compared with healthy controls. Materials and Methods: The study was performed during January 2007 to January 2009 on multi-transfused children suffering with β-thalassemia major registered in the Prathama Blood Centre, Ahmedabad; Jeevandeep hospital, Ahmedabad; and Red Cross Blood Centre, Ahmedabad, and investigated for the prevalence and development of transfusion-transmitted infections. Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg), anti-Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Antibodies (<b>Ab),</b> and <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab</b> were checked using a fourth-generation Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Positive tests were confirmed by western blots. Healthy blood donors {{were used for the}} control group. Results: Hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HCV <b>Ab,</b> and <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab</b> were positive in one of 96 (1. 04 %; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) = 0. 17 - 1. 3), 24 of 96 (25 %; 95 % CI = 11. 4 - 14. 2), and one of 96 (1. 04 %; 95 % CI = 0. 12 - 1. 3), respectively. The rate of anti-HCV Ab was significantly higher in multi-transfused children suffering with β-thalassemia major. In thalassemia patients, the rate of positive anti-HCV Ab was significantly higher than that for positive HBsAg (P< 0. 001) and <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab</b> (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: It is concluded that HCV is the current major problem in multi-transfused children with thalassemia major and more careful pretransfusion screening of blood for anti-HCV must be introduced in blood centers...|$|R

40|$|Pre{{clinical}} {{and early}} human clinical studies of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) {{to prevent and}} treat HIV infection support the clinical utility and potential of bNAbs for prevention, postexposure prophylaxis, and treatment of acute and chronic infection. Observed and potential limitations of bNAbs from these recent studies include the selection of resistant viral populations, immunogenicity resulting {{in the development of}} antidrug (Ab) responses, and the potentially toxic elimination of reservoir cells in regeneration-limited tissues. Here, we review opportunities to improve the clinical utility of <b>HIV</b> <b>Abs</b> to address these challenges and further accomplish functional targets for anti-HIV Ab therapy at various stages of exposure/infection. Before exposure, bNAbs’ ability to serve as prophylaxis by neutralization may be improved by increasing serum half-life to necessitate less frequent administration, delivering genes for durable in vivo expression, and targeting bNAbs to sites of exposure. After exposure and/or in the setting of acute infection, bNAb use to prevent/reduce viral reservoir establishment and spread may be enhanced by increasing the potency with which autologous adaptive immune responses are stimulated, clearing acutely infected cells, and preventing cell–cell transmission of virus. In the setting of chronic infection, bNAbs may better mediate viral remission or “cure” in combination with antiretroviral therapy and/or latency reversing agents, by targeting additional markers of tissue reservoirs or infected cell types, or by serving as targeting moieties in engineered cell therapy. While the clinical use of <b>HIV</b> <b>Abs</b> has never been closer, remaining studies to precisely define, model, and understand the complex roles and dynamics of <b>HIV</b> <b>Abs</b> and viral evolution {{in the context of the}} human immune system and anatomical compartmentalization will be critical to both optimize their clinical use in combination with existing agents and define further strategies with which to enhance their clinical safety and efficacy...|$|R

Therefore, they have a disproportionate burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this study, the prevalence and associated characteristics of hepatitis B and HIV infections were assessed in young prisoners. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, prevalence of HBV and HIV infections was assessed among young prisoners during 2008 - 2009. A checklist consisting of demographic, social, and risk factors was filled out and blood was drawn for their tests. Sera were analyzed for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBs Ab), hepatitis B core antibody (HBc <b>Ab)</b> and <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab,</b> and Western blot test was performed on antibody-positive HIV. Results: A total number of 160 young prisoners (147 boys and 13 girls) were evaluated. The {{mean age of the}} subjects was 16. 59 ± 1. 24 year.

This study was aimed to determine the performance of HIV combination assays in Taiwan, where the HIV- 1 seroprevalence is 0. 007 % and HIV- 2 infection has never been reported. Methods: Performance of three fourth-generation HIV Ag/Ab combination assays (Dia. Pro, Wantai, and Bio-Rad) and one third-generation <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab</b> immunoassay (AxSYM <b>HIV</b> 1 / 2 gO) was assessed. Results: A total of 152 specimens, including 86 confirmed HIV-seropositive and 66 HIV-seronegative samples, were used in the study. The sensitivity of four assays varied from 98. 8 % to 100 %, and specificity varied from 98. 5 % to 100 %. Performance of the 75 equivocal samples, the HIV status of which was confirmed later, in terms of negative prediction varied from 81. 8 % to 87. 5 %. The Bio-Rad and Dia.

40|$|In Italy, {{drug abusers}} {{are the major}} risk {{category}} for HIV infection, representing 67 % of all the reported cases of AIDS. This can in part explain the higher incidence of the infection observed in Italian females (17. 7 %) {{in comparison with the}} data reported in Europe (11. 5 %) or in the U. S. (8. 5 %). Therefore, anti-HIV screening in newborns reflects the serologic pattern of the respective mothers and can provide a useful tool in evaluating the incidence of the infection in a relatively unselected population. Furthermore, the data collected can provide a good predictive parameter for the rate at which pediatric AIDS will develop. Blood samples were collected on filter paper for routine screenings from 39, 102 consecutive newborns in 92 hospital nurseries, from eight different Italian regions, during the period June 1988 -April 1989. Blood-saturated disks were screened for anti-HIV antibodies (<b>HIV</b> <b>Ab)</b> using an ELISA; positive results were confirmed using a Western blot.

40|$|Background: A {{substantial}} {{proportion of}} HIV-infected {{individuals in the}} UK are unaware of their status and late presentations continue, especially in low prevalence areas. Fourth generation antigen/antibody rapid test kits could facilitate earlier diagnosis of HIV in non-clinical settings but lack data on performance under programmatic conditions. Methods and Findings: We evaluated the performance of Determine HIV- 1 / 2 Ag/Ab Combo Test (Determine Combo), a rapid test with indicators for both HIV antibodies and p 24 antigen, in participants recruited from community outreach and hospital-based sexual health clinics. HIV infection was confirmed using laboratory enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA), Line Immuno Assay (LIA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In total, 953 people underwent HIV testing. <b>HIV</b> antibody (<b>Ab)</b> prevalence was 1. 8 % (17 / 953). Four false positive rapid tests were identified: two antibody and two p 24 antigen (Ag) reactions. Of participants diagnosed as <b>HIV</b> <b>Ab</b> positive, 2 / 17 (12 %) were recent seroconverters based on clinical history and HIV antibody avidity test results. However, none of these were detected by the p 24 antigen component of the rapid test kit. There were no other true positive p 24 Ag tests. Conclusion: These data lend support to an increasing body of evidence suggesting that 4 th generation rapid HIV tests have little additional benefit over 3 rd generation HIV kits for routine screening in low prevalence settings and have high rates of false positives.

Recently, we reported that TYK 2 promoter variant serves as a putative virus-induced diabetes susceptibility gene associated with deteriorated interferon-dependent antiviral response. TYK 2 is also related to HIES, that is, Th 2 cell-dependent. Therefore, TYK 2 promoter variant may be also associated with the pathogenesis of T 1 D, modulating Th 1 /Th 2 balance. Research Design and Methods: We assessed the association between anti- GAD Ab, IgE levels, and TYK 2 promoter variant among 313 T 1 D patients, 184 T 2 D patients, and 264 YH controls in the Japanese. Results: T 1 D patients had elevated IgE (median, 56. 7  U/ml; p <  0. 0001) compared with T 2 D patients (22. 5  U/ml) and controls (43. 3  U/ml). Contrary to our expectations, there was no correlation between TYK 2 promoter variant and IgE levels. We found that T 1 D could be subtyped as four groups based on anti-GAD Ab and IgE profile: Subtype 1, anti-GAD Ab positive and non-elevated IgE (47. 0 %); Subtype 2, anti-GAD <b>Ab</b> <b>negative</b> and non-elevated IgE (35. 1 %); Subtype 3, anti-GAD Ab positive and elevated IgE (10. 9 %); and Subtype 4, anti-GAD <b>Ab</b> <b>negative</b> and elevated IgE (7. 0 %). In Subtype 2, a significantly higher incidence was observed in T 1 D cases carrying the TYK 2 promoter variant (OR, 2. 60; 95 %CI, 1. 03 – 6. 97; p =  0. 032), and also showing a flu-like syndrome at diabetes onset (OR, 2. 34; 95 %CI, 1. 27 – 4. 35; p =  0. 003).

40|$|Objectives: In this trial, {{our purpose}} was to {{determine}} the distribution of blood groups in Tokat region and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) patient group and to investigate the impact of blood groups on fatal prognosis of the disease. Material and Method: Demographic and laboratory values and blood groups of patients were recorded. In addition, distribution of blood groups among blood donors who referred to the blood center during same time interval was determined. Results: Distribution of blood groups among CCHF patients and donors in blood center were found to be similar to Turkish data (P> 0. 05). On the other hand, a discrepancy was determined in blood group distribution of CCHF patients with a fatal outcome, with a significantly high rate of <b>AB</b> Rh <b>negative</b> blood group in this patient group (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: We suggest that blood group may be associated with mortality in CCHF patients and <b>AB</b> Rh <b>negative</b> blood group may be an indicator of poor prognosis.

40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{literature}} describing metabolic and histological data in adult-onset autoimmune diabetes. This subgroup of diabetes mellitus affects at least 5 % of clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients (T 2 DM) and it is termed Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA). We evaluated indexes of insulin secretion, metabolic assessment, and pancreatic pathology in clinically diagnosed T 2 DM patients with and without the presence of humoral islet autoimmunity (Ab). A total of 18 patients with at least 5 -year duration of clinically diagnosed T 2 DM were evaluated in this study. In those subjects we assessed acute insulin responses to arginine, a glucose clamp study, whole-body fat mass and fat-free mass. We have also analyzed the pancreatic pathology of 15 T 2 DM and 43 control cadaveric donors, using pancreatic tissue obtained from all the T 2 DM organ donors available from the nPOD network through December 31, 2013. The presence of islet Ab correlated with severely impaired b-cell function as demonstrated by remarkably low acute insulin response to arginine (AIR) when {{compared to that of}} the <b>Ab</b> <b>negative</b> group. Glucose clamp studies indicated that both Ab positive and A...|$|R
