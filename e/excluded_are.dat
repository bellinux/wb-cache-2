[...] Purchases of used items, exports and all business transactions would not be taxed. Also <b>excluded</b> <b>are</b> investments, such as purchases of stock, corporate mergers and acquisitions and capital investments. Savings and education tuition expenses would be exempt as they would be considered an investment (rather than final consumption).|$|E
500|$|The NOC {{issued a}} report of its own {{analysing}} {{the root causes of}} the 13 May violence, suggesting that even in the civil service, a traditional Malay employer, non-Malays outnumbered the Malays in many areas, with substantial Malay majorities only in the Police and Armed Forces. The report concluded: [...] "Allegations that the non-Malays are <b>excluded</b> <b>are</b> regarded by the Malays as deliberate distortion. The Malays who already felt excluded in the country's economic life, now began to feel a threat to their place in the public services. No mention was ever made by non-Malay politicians of the almost closed-door attitude to the Malays by non-Malays in large sections of the private sector in this country." ...|$|E
500|$|Human {{rights are}} rights {{taken to be}} universal, of {{considerable}} importance, and relate to the individual and not collectively; among other things, they can grant freedoms, claims, immunities and powers. The European Convention on Human Rights was drawn up {{in the wake of}} the Second World War to uphold such rights. The United Kingdom ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1951, and accepted the right of individual petition to the European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg, in 1966. The Human Rights Act 1998 made most Convention rights directly enforceable in a British court for the first time. <b>Excluded</b> <b>are</b> Articles 1 and 13, which the government argued were fulfilled by the Act itself, and therefore were not relevant to rights enforced under it. The Human Rights Act has had a considerable effect on British law, and remains an Act of [...] "fundamental constitutional importance".|$|E
50|$|The queen <b>excluder</b> <b>is</b> a mesh grid, {{usually made}} of wire or plastic, sized such that worker bees can pass through, but queens ({{generally}}) cannot. When used, {{it is generally}} placed between the hive body and the honey supers. The purpose of the queen <b>excluder</b> <b>is</b> to keep the queen from laying eggs in the honey supers, {{which can lead to}} darker honey and can also complicate extraction. Many beekeepers reject the use of queen excluders, however, claiming that they create a barrier for workers and result in lower levels of honey collection and storage.|$|R

500|$|Douglas' {{new houses}} embrace {{a range of}} sizes and types, and include {{substantial}} country houses, such as Oakmere Hall and Abbeystead House; cottages, such as the pair known as Tai Cochion; workers' houses, {{such as those in}} Port Sunlight; and terraces of houses built for speculation, including 6–11 Grosvenor Park Road and 1–11 and 13 Bath Street in Chester. Work carried out on grand houses included additions to Vale Royal Abbey and Hawarden Castle. Works associated with houses include entrance gates for Mostyn Hall and a set of kennels at Croxteth Hall. Many of Douglas' new houses have been designated as listed buildings. Listed buildings are divided into three grades according to their importance. This list consists of work carried out by Douglas in designing new houses, additions and modifications to pre-existing houses, and structures related to houses such as kennels and gates. The details have been taken mainly from the Catalogue of Works in the biography by Edward Hubbard. Not all structures in these categories are included. If a building is listed, it has been included. Some unlisted buildings have been included because they are of interest, or they demonstrate that Douglas worked in areas at a distance away from his office in Chester. The works <b>excluded</b> <b>are,</b> on the whole, small houses, cottages and outbuildings. [...] Works attributed to Douglas by Hubbard on stylistic grounds together with evidence of a local association, even though they are not confirmed by other reliable evidence, are included. Where this is the case, it is stated in the Notes column. Unexecuted schemes are not included.|$|E

Described by the publishers as a [...] "distillation of what's best in its bigger brother", it includes the Notes by the Editor, all the articles, reviews and obituaries and the reports on all England's Test matches for the year in question. <b>Excluded</b> <b>are</b> the statistics and other cricket reports contained within the Almanack proper.|$|E
2500|$|However, <b>excluded</b> <b>are</b> {{examples}} {{like two}} touching circles that share {{a point to}} form a figure-8; at the shared point a satisfactory chart cannot be created. Even with the bending allowed by topology, {{the vicinity of the}} shared point looks like a [...] "+", not a line. A [...] "+" [...] is not homeomorphic to a closed interval (line segment), since deleting the center point from the [...] "+" [...] gives a space with four components (i.e. pieces), whereas deleting a point from a closed interval gives a space with at most two pieces; topological operations always preserve the number of pieces.|$|E
2500|$|Northeastern Minnesota is an irregularly-shaped region {{composed}} of the northeasternmost {{part of the state}} north of Lake Superior, the area around Jay Cooke State Park and the Nemadji River basin southwest of Duluth, and much of the area east of U.S. Highway 53 that runs between Duluth and International Falls. [...] <b>Excluded</b> <b>are</b> parts of the beds of glacial lakes Agassiz and Upham, the latter now occupied by the upper valley of the Saint Louis River and its tributary the Cloquet.

50|$|Another main {{complaint}} {{is that there}} are exceptions to the guidelines. There are three crimes that do not follow the guidelines. This includes DWIs, drug trafficking, and sexual offenses. The reason for these three being <b>excluded</b> <b>is</b> that it was felt that there should be stricter punishments for these crimes then the guidelines would allow. This has caused them to <b>be</b> <b>excluded</b> and they <b>are</b> punished under the old set of rules.|$|R
2500|$|... "In our evening {{exercises}} {{there has}} prevailed a varied range and compass of topics, fitted {{to bring out}} earnest thought and many-sided comments. Essays, criticism, poems, short stories, reviews of noted books, characterizations of great writers, social studies, descriptive sketches and brief discussions, occupy the hour. [...] The only topics <b>excluded...</b> <b>are</b> those which touch the realm of politics or the domain of religion. [...] In our literary symposia controversy has no place. With all our freedom and variety of opinion, my colleagues will bear me witness, our discussions have never degenerated into personality or rancor. [...] Catholics and Protestants, Democrats and Republicans, we have met upon the common ground of literary and social good fellowship." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Excluded</b> <b>are</b> souls {{conceived}} as inhabiting another world. Yet just as gods {{are not necessarily}} spiritual, demons may also be regarded as corporeal; vampires for example are sometimes described as human heads with appended entrails, which issue from the tomb to attack the living during the night watches. The so-called Spectre Huntsman of the Malay Peninsula {{is said to be}} a man who scours the firmament with his dogs, vainly seeking for what he could not find on Earth -a buck mouse-deer pregnant with male offspring; but he seems to be a living man; there is no statement that he ever died, nor yet that he is a spirit. The incubi and Succubi of the Middle Ages are sometimes regarded as spiritual beings; but they were held to give proof of their bodily existence, such as offspring (though often deformed). Belief in demons goes back many millennia. The Zoroastrian faith teaches that there are 3,333 Demons, some with specific dark [...] responsibilities such as war, starvation, sickness, etc.|$|E

If each station complex's platforms are counted as separate stations, then {{the total number of}} stations in operation as of December 26, 2015 would be 334. [...] The unique station count of 278 excludes: the Erligou, Tongyunmen and Beiyunhe East Stations on Line 6; the Shuangjing and Fatou Stations on Line 7; the National Art Museum Station on Line 8; the Taoranqiao, Pingleyuan, Chaoyang Park and Gaojiayuan Stations on Line 14; the Wangjing East Station on Line 15; and the Yizhuang Railway Station on the Yizhuang Line, which were not in use as of December 26, 2015. [...] Also <b>excluded</b> <b>are</b> the three restricted stations of Line 1, which are no longer used. [...] The total station count of 334 excludes the stations listed above and treats the Gongyixiqiao Station as two stations, as the southern terminus for Line 4 and northern terminus for the Daxing Line, even though through-train service have effectively transformed the two lines into a single line for which the Gongyixiqiao Station is (usually) not a terminus but a single station.|$|E
