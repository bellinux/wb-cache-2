40|$|A {{comparative}} {{survey of}} {{indoor and outdoor}} air quality (AQ) for an enclosed (GL 1) and a semi-enclosed (UST 1) <b>car</b> <b>park</b> in Hong Kong was conducted from August to December 2000. Seventy-two canister samples were collected and analysed for one hundred C- 3 -C- 12 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. Carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide, temperature, relative humidity and particulate matter were also measured. The CO levels at GO complied with local AQ objectives for Indoor <b>Car</b> <b>Parks</b> and ASHRAE guidelines, but were more than double those of the outdoor air. The PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations were also found to be higher in the indoor environments. High mass fractions of aliphatic and aromatic compounds detected at GL 1 showed that fuel evaporation and motor vehicular exhaust were the major contributors to the VOCs. In addition, the number and abundance of VOC species {{were higher in the}} enclosed environment than outdoors. The high indoor/outdoor (I/O) AQ ratios and poor I/O correlations at GL sites showed that the existing ventilation system at the site was inefficient. <b>Enclosed</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> with their intrinsic source emissions are unlike other indoor public places.

40|$|LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) {{is gaining}} in {{popularity}} {{as an alternative}} choice of vehicle fuel since it is less costly and more environmentally friendly when compared with conventional fuels as gasoline and diesel. However, there are risks of LPG leakage from an LPG tank {{which leads to a}} VCE (Vapor Cloud Explosion) inside an <b>enclosed</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> Pressure waves generated by the explosion may reflect on walls or in corners, leading to high overpressures. For this reason, vehicles equipped with LPG tanks are restricted from entering underground or enclosed car parks in Belgium and across Europe. This paper addresses this problem by using a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) package to simulate the vapor cloud explosion inside an <b>enclosed</b> <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> The simulation was performed by using FLACS, which is a specialized commercial CFD package targeting at gas dispersion and explosion. The simulation was performed based on the geometry of a partially closed car park with the size of 30 × 30 × 2. 4 m. Main structures like columns and ceiling beams as well as vehicles were modeled. The simulations of VCE determine the maximum overpressures as well as the development of the flame inside and outside the car park domain. Parameters studied in this paper are: the presence of vehicles and the vent openings of the car park. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide some fundamental study in understand the consequence of an LPG vapor cloud explosion by looking into these parameters and their effects. The work presented in this paper is part of the project of a QRA (quantitative risk assessment) for enclosed car parks with vehicles equipped with LPG tanks. The results obtained in this early stage of the project were based on a 'worst-case' scenario by using a stoichiometric vapor cloud which is hardly probable under realistic circumstances. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Benzene, toluene, {{ethylbenzene}} and xylenes (BTEX) {{are common}} {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) found in urban airsheds. Elevated levels of VOCs {{have been reported in}} many airsheds at many locations, particularly those associated with industrial activity, wood heater use and heavy traffic. Exposure to some VOCs has been associated with health risks. There have been limited investigations into community exposures to BTEX using personal monitoring to elucidate the concentrations to which members of the community may be exposed and the main contributors to that exposure. In this cross sectional study we investigated BTEX exposure of 204 non-smoking, non-occupationally exposed people from four Australian cities. Each participant wore a passive BTEX sampler over 24 h on five consecutive days in both winter and summer and completed an exposure source questionnaire for each season and a diary for each day of monitoring. The geometric mean (GM) and range of daily BTEX concentrations recorded for the study population were benzene 0. 80 (0. 04 – 23. 8 ppb); toluene 2. 83 (0. 03 – 2120 ppb); ethylbenzene 0. 49 (0. 03 – 119 ppb); and xylenes 2. 36 (0. 04 – 697 ppb). A generalised linear model was used to investigate significant risk factors for increased BTEX exposure. Activities and locations found to increase personal exposure included vehicle repair and machinery use, refuelling of motor vehicles, being in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> and time spent undertaking arts and crafts.

40|$|Recent {{efforts to}} {{investigate}} car-park fires {{and understand the}} related mechanisms have fostered the need for analyses of suppression performance against this type of fire scenario. This work aims at providing an insight into the ability of sprinklers and water-mist systems to control and extinguish a fire within an <b>enclosed</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> {{through a series of}} real-scale experiments. Three cars were employed in each test: the central one was ignited by a heptane pool fire and the adjacent ones served as targets. Two configurations were explored: in the first one, a nozzle was placed directly at the vertical axis of the ignition source, whereas the ignition source was located between the area coverage of four nozzles in the second one. The sprinkler system mainly served as a reference; two values of discharge density were evaluated for water mist at high operative pressure and a biodegradable surfactant was also tested against the most challenging configuration. A quantitative analysis of free-burn and discharge phases by temperature measurements was coupled with radiant heat-flux measurements and an assessment of post-fire damage. Sprinkler and water-mist systems were capable of containing the fire spread and thermally controlling the fire, thus preventing structural damage. The water mist’s ability to overpower the plume and reach the burning surfaces proved more effective than that of sprinklers, especially as no nozzles were located right above the ignition surface. The higher discharge density showed better capability of preventing re-ignition phenomena and suppression was attained in both the investigated configurations, which suggests that a certain amount of flux is also needed to achieve flame cooling. The additive had promising impact on suppression performance; however, more tests are required to specifically explore its ability to enhance thermal control...|$|E

40|$|Car parking has {{developed}} differing technologies. Fire protection techniques {{have to develop}} accordingly to ensure the optimum levels of protection. In the present case the parking technology allowed {{the design of a}} 10 storey high, <b>enclosed</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with fire-resisting outer walls. Cars are parked in open-fronted (fire-resisting) concrete cells by automatic machinery which operates through an atrium-like space through the entire height of the building. Maintenance and fire service access is via routes outside this large, single fire compartment; opening via fire-resisting doors into the rear of each cell. During normal operation, the entire multi-storey fire compartment is unoccupied. This means in turn that there is little difficulty in meeting the requirements under the Building Regulations. Zone model methods are used to assess whether the initial fire cell is likely to flash over, increasing the size of the fire and developing a threat of fire spread to the cell immediately above. It is suggested that for cells larger than 3 -car, there is a likelihood of “runaway ignition ” leading to loss of the building. For unsprinklered cells of 3 or fewer cars a smoke and heat exhaust ventilation system protecting fire-fighter access and/or minimising damage to cars on higher storeys, needs to be of an impractically large fan capacity of about 110 m 3 /s to 150 m 3 /s. The same methods show that, with sprinklers to prevent flashover in a cell, the fan capacity needed to allow fire-fighter access with good visibility reduces to around 30 m 3 /s or to about 38 m 3 /s to prevent damage to cars on higher storeys. Design fires, both sprinklered and unsprinklered, are based on the recently published BS 7346 - 7 : 2006 which assumes sprinklers will allow the original vehicle to continue burning while preventing spread to adjacent vehicles...|$|E
