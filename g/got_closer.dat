5|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the Mongol forces most probably never reached Pagan. They were held at bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya, Yazathingyan and Thihathu, and probably never <b>got</b> <b>closer</b> than 160km north of Pagan. (An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army.) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. At any rate, the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to Tagaung. They remained there as the treaty was now void.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{lost the}} April 8 {{national}} championship game against Midwest number one seed Louisville by an 82–76 score. Albrecht scored 17 first-half points on 4-for-4 three-point shooting. Burke scored 24 points {{in the championship game}} and made the seven-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but was called for a foul, resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never <b>got</b> <b>closer</b> than 4 points the rest of the game.|$|E

On 6 June Nana Sahib's forces (including the rebel soldiers) attacked the British entrenchment at 10:30 AM. The British were not adequately prepared for the attack, but managed to defend themselves for a long time, as the attacking forces were reluctant to enter the entrenchment. Nana Sahib's forces had been led to falsely believe that the entrenchment had gunpowder-filled trenches that would explode if they <b>got</b> <b>closer.</b>|$|E

Against Middlesex, he took ten for 63, and against Surrey twelve for 108. However, his harmlessness on the best pitch of the season at The Oval made {{sure that he was}} not chosen for The Ashes tour that winter. 1895 was disappointing as a batsman and bowler, but his fielding made him a vital member of Yorkshire's eleven.

25|$|William Louis ordered {{trenches}} to be dug {{towards the}} fortress and sconces {{to be built}} around the city. As a result, all the roads that were administered to the city was thus {{cut off from the}} outside. The siege lines around Coevorden was virtually complete except on the East part of city which was marshy and no siege work could be done. Engineers and pioneers were sent to the city moat so that a cover trench could be made on the fortress. Digging begun and soon the trench itself was four to five feet deep (about 1.5 meters) and twelve feet wide (approximately four meters). An attack by pioneers and soldiers on a village suburb was attempted whilst the siege lines <b>got</b> <b>closer.</b> However, the attack was repulsed by the garrison in the city but determined they attacked again the next day and managed to occupy the suburb.|$|E
25|$|This {{same year}} of 572 Miro led an {{expedition}} against the Runcones.

Finally, in 576, he entered Galicia itself, disturbing the boundaries of the kingdom, but Miro sent ambassadors and obtained from Leovigild a temporary peace. It was probably during this period that the Suevi also sent some ambassadors to the Frankish king Gontram, who were intercepted by Chilperic I near Poitiers, being later imprisoned for a year, as recorded by Gregory of Tours.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, Book I of Euclid's Elements {{dealt with}} {{equality}} of areas between two-dimensional figures. The mathematician Archimedes used {{the tools of}} Euclidean geometry {{to show that the}} area inside a circle is equal to that of a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, in his book Measurement of a Circle. (The circumference is 2r, and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area r2 for the disk.) Archimedes approximated the value of π (and hence the area of a unit-radius circle) with his doubling method, in which he inscribed a regular triangle in a circle and noted its area, then doubled the number of sides to give a regular hexagon, then repeatedly doubled the number of sides as the polygon's area <b>got</b> <b>closer</b> and closer to that of the circle (and did the same with circumscribed polygons).|$|E
25|$|On 31 July Tartar sighted a {{schooner}}. Maxwell set off {{to prevent}} the schooner from entering the narrow and intricate channel between the island of Saona and San Domingo {{where it would be}} difficult for him to pursue. As Tartar <b>got</b> <b>closer</b> he saw that the schooner was using her sweeps to aid her. Her behaviour made Maxwell suspect that his quarry was a privateer so he pursued her until neither vessel could progress farther. At that point, Maxwell was unable to get Tartar into a position from which she could use her broadside. Instead, he sent in a cutting out party in three boats. As the boats set out, their quarry fired a gun, hoisted French colours, and then opened fire on the boats. The schooner was not able to deter the attack and the British captured her with no more casualties than two men wounded. The French lost nine killed and six wounded, as well as three missing, presumed drowned when they tried to swim to shore. Maxwell sent the wounded to San Domingo under flag of truce, but kept the other Frenchmen prisoners, there being no English prisoners available for exchange. The privateer was Hirondelle, under the command of Captain La Place. She was armed with ten 4-pounder guns and had been out of San Domingo for two days. She had been active during the French Revolutionary Wars and for the past two years also, having frequently escaped pursuit due to her speed.|$|E

As we <b>got</b> <b>closer</b> to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design." [...] Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire [...] "felt like I had arrived at [...] vision, that the person had arrived." [...] Fassbender later added that he and Danny Boyle decided on this look during filming, and wanted to [...] "give the audience kind of a payoff." ...|$|E
