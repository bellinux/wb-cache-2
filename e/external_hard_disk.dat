5|$|The PowerBook100 was {{the first}} PowerBook to {{incorporate}} SCSI Disk Mode, which allowed it {{to be used as}} an <b>external</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> on a desktop Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to the desktop, without the need for the 100's optional floppy disk drive. A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more than a year later.|$|E
25|$|<b>External</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives {{typically}} connect via USB; variants using USB2.0 interface {{generally have}} slower data transfer rates {{when compared to}} internally mounted hard drives connected through SATA. Plug and play drive functionality offers system compatibility and features large storage options and portable design. , available capacities for <b>external</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives ranged from 500GB to 10TB.|$|E
25|$|While {{floppy disk}} drives {{still have some}} limited uses, {{especially}} with legacy industrial computer equipment, they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater capacity, such as USB flash drives, flash storage cards, portable <b>external</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives, optical discs, ROM cartridges, and storage available through computer networks.|$|E

25|$|Features such as {{biometric}} security or multiple interfaces (for example, Firewire) {{are available at}} a higher cost. There are pre-assembled <b>external</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives that, when taken out from their enclosures, cannot be used internally in a laptop or desktop computer due to embedded USB interface on their printed circuit boards, and lack of SATA (or Parallel ATA) interfaces.|$|E
25|$|Particularly {{with the}} advent of USB, {{external}} hard disks have become widely available and inexpensive. <b>External</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives currently cost less per gigabyte than flash drives and are available in larger capacities. Some hard drives support alternative and faster interfaces than USB 2.0 (e.g., IEEE 1394 and eSATA). For consecutive sector writes and reads (for example, from an unfragmented file), most hard drives can provide a much higher sustained data rate than current NAND flash memory, though mechanical latencies seriously impact hard drive performance.|$|E
25|$|Backup and Restore Center {{also known}} as Windows Backup Status and Configuration replaces NTBackup {{although}} Windows NT Backup Restore Utility is available for download. Backup and Restore Center operates in two modes: (a) Backup or restore selected files or (b) Complete PC Backup. If using Complete PC Backup, incremental snapshots are stored on <b>external</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> or optical media, and the complete system can be restored to protect against hardware failure or severe software damage. Automatic scheduling of file backups is not available in Vista Home Basic. Complete PC Backup is not available in Vista Home Basic and Home Premium.|$|E

25|$|The console {{contains}} 2GB of DDR3 {{system memory}} consisting of four 512MB DRAM chips {{with a maximum}} bandwidth of 12.8GB/s. This is 20 times the amount found in the Wii. Of this, 1GB is reserved for the operating system and is unavailable to games. The memory architecture allows the CPU and GPU to access both the main DDR3 memory pool and the eDRAM cache memory pool on the GPU, removing the need for separate, dedicated memory pools. The console includes either an 8GB (Basic) or 32GB (Deluxe (NA) / Premium (WW)) internal eMMC flash memory, expandable via SD memory cards up to 32GB and USB <b>external</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives up to 2TB.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "pippin" [...] {{was used}} by Apple prior to the Apple Pippin platform. The Apple ProFile, an <b>external</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive for the Apple III and Apple Lisa, used the code name [...] "Pippin" [...] during development.|$|E
2500|$|Among developers, [...] "Pippinized" [...] is a {{reference}} to creating CD-ROM titles designed to boot on a Pippin device. The system and application software is prepared on the <b>external</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive, and {{with the use of}} a dongle available only to developers, is tested by booting off the hard disk drive on the Pippin system. After the CD-R is made, the disc had to be sent out to an authorized CD stamping house to be authenticated. RSA's public/private key system was used to create the authentication system on the Pippin platform.|$|E

A computer-controlled sun protection in the box window is responsive to both the changing position of the sun {{as well as to the}} individual needs of users, it is integrated into the control of the technical equipment. Waste heat generated by solar radiation is dissipated in the box on the window vents to the outside and relieves the building cooling.|$|R
