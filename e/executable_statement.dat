Since assignment, CALL, RETURN, and IF statements together account for 93 percent of all <b>executable</b> <b>statements,</b> special care is given to ensure that these statements can be implemented efficiently. A highly compact instruction encoding scheme is presented, which can reduce program size by a factor of 3. Unlike a Huffman code, which utilizes variable length fields, this method uses only fixed length (1 -byte) opcode and address fields. The most frequent instructions consist of a single 1 -byte field. As a consequence, instruction decoding time is minimized, and the machine is efficient with respect to both space and time. © 1978, ACM. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In the correct-by-construction {{programming}} methodology, {{programs are}} incrementally derived from their formal specifications, by repeatedly applying transformations to partially derived programs.

Typically these other assumptions are made in an ad hoc fashion and may result in unnecessary rework, or worse, complete exclusion of some of the alternative solutions. In this work, we present rules for propagating assumptions through annotated programs. We show how these rules can be integrated in a top-down derivation methodology to provide a systematic approach for propagating the assumptions, materializing them with <b>executable</b> <b>statements</b> at a place different from the place of introduction, and strengthening of loop invariants with minimal additional proof efforts...|$|R

This model consists mainly of object class specifications. The methods in these classes are specified using pre and post-conditions. The intent of this thesis is to support the transformation of post-conditions to code statements. A post-condition is first categorized as dependent or independent relative to other post-conditions. Post-conditions are further divided into actions and constraints. Actions {{can be converted to}} <b>executable</b> <b>statements.</b> Constraints can be converted to pre-conditions using weakest pre-condition analysis.

Although previous work has studied syntactic equivalence and small-scale, coarse-grained program-level and function-level semantic equivalence, {{it is not}} known whether significant fine-grained, code-level semantic duplications exist. Detecting such semantic equivalence is also desirable because it can enable many applications such as code understanding, maintenance, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the first algorithm to automatically mine functionally equivalent code fragments of arbitrary size - down to an <b>executable</b> <b>statement.</b> Our notion of functional equivalence is based on input and output behavior. Inspired by Schwartz 2 ̆ 7 s randomized polynomial identity testing, we develop our core algorithm using automated random testing: (1) candidate code fragments are automatically extracted from the input program; and (2) random inputs are generated to partition the code fragments based on their output values on the generated inputs. We implemented the algorithm and conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation of it on the Linux kernel 2. 6. 24. Our results show that there exist many functionally equivalent code fragments that are syntactically different (i. e., they are unlikely due to copying and pasting code).

We randomly selected test and validation sets of 50 recommendations each from the National Guideline Clearinghouse and randomly extracted 3 recommendations from each guideline. We tested the ability of a preliminary palette of action types to categorize guideline-prescribed activities and expanded it to accommodate several unanticipated actions. Ultimately, the following actions were sufficient to categorize all 405 actions: Prescribe, Perform therapeutic procedure, Educate/Counsel, Test, Dispose, Refer/Consult, Conclude, Monitor, Document, Advocate, Prepare, and No recommendation.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} model is discussed {{which allows the}} hierarchic definition of high-level input driven objects, called input-output tools, from any set of basic input primitives. An input-output tool {{is defined as a}} named object. Its most important elements are the input rule, output rule, internal tool definitions, and a tool body consisting of <b>executable</b> <b>statements.</b> The input rule contains an expression with tool designators as operands and with operators allowing for sequencing, selection, interleaving, and repetition. Input rules are similar in appearance to production rules in grammars. The input expression specifies one or more input sequences, or input patterns, in terms of tool designators. An input parser tries, at run-time, to match (physical) input tokens against active input sequences. If a match between an input token and a tool designator is found, the corresponding tool body is executed, and the output is generated according to specifications in the tool body. The control structures in the input expression allow a variety of input patterns from any number of sources. Tool definitions may occur in-line or be stored in a library.

This work describes a process to systematize and make explicit the translation of document-based knowledge into workflow-integrated clinical decision support systems. Design: This approach uses the Guideline Elements Model (GEM) to represent the guideline knowledge. Imple-mentation requires a number of steps to translate the knowledge contained in guideline text into a computable format and to integrate the information into clinical workflow. The steps include: (1) selection of a guideline and specific recommendations for implementation, (2) markup of the guideline text, (3) atomization, (4) deabstraction and (5) disambiguation of recommendation concepts, (6) verification of rule set completeness, (7) addition of explanations, (8) building <b>executable</b> <b>statements,</b> (9) specification of origins of decision variables and insertions of recommended actions, (10) definition of action types and selection of associated beneficial services, (11) choice of interface components, and (12) creation of requirement specification.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{approach}} to specification, development, and verification of object-oriented frameworks employing separate interface inheritance and implementation inheritance hierarchies. In particular, we illustrate how our method of framework specification and verification can be used to specify Java Collections Framework, which {{is a part of the}} standard Java Development Kit 2. 0, and ensure its correctness. We propose to associate with Java interfaces formal descriptions of the behavior that classes implementing these interfaces and their subinterfaces must deliver. Verifying behavioral conformance of classes implementing given interfaces to the specifications integrated with these interfaces allows us to ensure correctness of the system. The characteristic feature of our specification methodology is that the specification language used combines standard <b>executable</b> <b>statements</b> of the Java language with possibly nondeterministic specification statements. A specification of the intended behavior of a particular interface given in this language can serve asa precise documentation guiding implementation development. Since subtyping polymorphism in Java is based on interface inheritance, behavioral conformance of subinterfaces to their superinterfaces is essential for correctness of object substitutability in clients. As we view interfaces augmented with formal specifications as abstract classes, verifying behavioral conformance amounts to proving class refinement between specifications of superinterfaces and subinterfaces. Moreover, the logic frameworkthatwe use also allows verification of behavioral conformance between specifications of interfaces and classes implementing these interfaces. The uniform treatment of specifications and implementations and the relationships between them permits verifying correctness of the whole framework and its extensions...|$|R
40|$|Automatically {{generating}} a program from its specification eliminates a large source of errors {{that is often}} unavoidable in a manual approach. While a general purpose code generator is impossible to build, {{it is possible to}} build a practical code generator for a specific domain. This thesis investigates the theory behind Booster — a domain specific, object based specification language and automatic code generator. The domain of Booster is information systems — systems that consist of a rich object model in which the objects refer to each other to form a complicated network of associations. The operations of such systems are conceptually simple (changing the attributes of objects, adding or removing new objects and creating or destroying associations) but they are tricky to implement correctly. The thesis focuses on the theoretical foundation of the Booster approach, in particular on three contributions: semantics, model completion, and code generation. The semantics of a Booster model is a single abstract data type (ADT) where the invariants and the methods of all the classes in the model are promoted {{to the level of the}} ADT. This is different from the traditional view that considers each class as a separate ADT. The thesis argues that the Booster semantics is a better model of object oriented systems. The second important contribution is the idea of model completion — a process that augments the postconditions of methods with additional predicates that follow from the system’s invariant and the method’s original intention. The third contribution describes a simple but effective code generation technique that is based on interpreting postconditions as <b>executable</b> <b>statements</b> and uses weakest preconditions to ensure that the generated code refines its specification.

40|$|We {{look at how}} both logical {{restructuring}} and improvements available from successive versions of Fortran allow us to reduce the complexity (measured {{by a number of}} the com-monly used software metrics) of the Level 1 BLAS code used to compute the modified Givens transformation. With these reductions in complexity we claim that we have improved both the maintainability and clarity of the code; in addition, we report a fix to a minor problem with the original code. The performance of two commercial Fortran restructuring tools is also reported. 1 In t roduct ion The Level 1 BLAS [LHKK 79], originally published in Fortran 66 [ANS 66], implemented a number of common vector operations and were designed to be used as building blocks for linear algebra software. Hopkins [Hop 96] used knot counts [WHH 79] and path counts [Nej 88] to identify routines from the Level 1 BLAS which might benefit from code restructuring Two sets of routines, *NRM 2, used to compute the Euclidean orm of a vector and *ROTMG, for computing the modified Givens transformation, were identified as having Extremely high metric values given their relatively low number of <b>executable</b> <b>statements.</b> The restructuring ofthe *NRM 2 routines, along with a dramatic decrease in the metric values, was reported by Hopkins [Hop 96]; the *ROTMG routines are considered here. Following {{a brief description of the}} software metrics used to compare versions of the *ROTMG routines, we present a fiowgraph of the published code and look at how two Fortran code restruc-turing tools fared on this original source. We then compare the metric values obtained for the original and automatically restructured code with hand-coded Fortran 66 and Fortran 77 versions. Section 5 looks at how the metric values may be reduced further by using Fortran 90 and we show how the use of some of the new facilities available in Fortran 90 may be used to improve these routines further. Finally we look briefly at the testing of the new routine and report a fix to a minor problem in the original code. 2 Mod i f ied G ivens Rotat ion Mat r ix The input values to *ROTMG, dl, d 2, Xl and Yl, define a two-vector [al, a 2] T in the partitioned form as a 2 0 d ~ Y...|$|R
40|$|Verifying {{critical}} numerical software {{involves the}} generation of test data for floating-point intensive programs. As the symbolic execution of floating-point computations presents significant difficulties, existing approaches usually resort to random or search-based test data generation. However, without symbolic reasoning, {{it is almost impossible}} to generate test inputs that execute many paths with floating-point computations. Moreover, constraint solvers over the reals or the rationals do not handle the rounding errors. In this paper, we present a new version of FPSE, a symbolic evaluator for C program paths, that specifically addresses this problem. The tool solves path conditions containing floating-point computations by using correct and precise projection functions. This version of the tool exploits an essential filtering property based on the representation of floating-point numbers that makes it suitable to generate path-oriented test inputs for complex paths characterized by floating-point intensive computations. The paper reviews the key implementation choices in FPSE and the labeling search heuristics we selected to maximize the benefits of enhanced filtering. Our experimental results show that FPSE can generate correct test inputs for selected paths containing several hundreds of iterations and thousands of <b>executable</b> floating-point <b>statements</b> on a standard machine: this is currently outside the scope of any other symbolic-execution test data generator tool...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two main}} {{approaches}} in studying human values: the macro-global approach and the micro or individual approach. Within the first approach there are three major models. The first views values as absolute universals that should be: the second views values as the actual relative patterns of behavior: and the third scales values to natural self-actualizing, modern or urban humans. Within the micro-approach, there are four models. The first places more focus on the affective psycho-dynamic part of values: the second views values as cognitive representations. The decision making model views values as independent dimensions which guide decisions, and the action model reveals the built-in discrepancy between the espoused values and values in use. Most of these models lack the dynamic and the comprehensive perspective which combines the micro and macro analytic levels. The alternative model proposed in this thesis suggests three levels for rediscovering value dynamics and four approaches to measure them. The first level is the signification process that triggers global activation spreadings with intensity equal to {{the significance of the}} perceived object to the individual's survival and growth values or their derivatives. There are three kinds of signification: object-signification, values-signification, and self-signification. Self-signification is the core of valuation dynamics at this level and the source of valuepathy and psychological health. The second level in addressing value dynamics may be performed by analyzing the value system as self programming mechanisms. Values and their derivatives, which are the reference criteria in the signification process, are materialized in micro, or intrasystem, and macro, or inter-system, programming. On the micro-processing level {{there are two kinds of}} dynamic processes: the valuative states formation, like anticipation and familiarity and their specific derivatives, such as attitudes, preferences, and likings. The second is the value programming and packaging mechanisms. Within these packaging mechanisms there are different kinds of internal processing subroutines and algorithms. Within these programming mechanisms there are two kinds of statements: declarative, or non-executable, statements, which are these kinds of abstract universal values, and <b>executable,</b> or command, <b>statements,</b> which are either negative or positive, imperative or conditional self-orders. At this level, values are selfprescriptive programs and algorithms that function to secure a base line of readiness for effective coping. The third level of addressing value dynamics is the level of real time macro-processing. The individual develops through significating and coping to outside events his network of automated and non-automated personal survival and growth strategies which are dependent on both his valuative competencies and environmental availabilities. Flexibility, which is characterized by the selectivity syndrome inherent in it, is the source of different valuative competencies to plunge, to transcend, to balance, and to automate. Four measurement approaches have been proposed to check the validity and practicality of this model. The first centers on the assessment of valuative maturities and competencies. The second focuses on examining value processing dynamics. The third emphasizes evaluating valuepathy and its manifestation. The fourth combines all the available techniques in a value contextual analysis through task and case studies. Four extensions, or clarifications, of this model have been proposed to extend it to cover and explain macro-analysis, value contents, supernatural and natural belief systems, and to develop it to be more specific through sub-modeling of the specific areas of behavior...|$|R
