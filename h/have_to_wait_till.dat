500|$|The first {{official}} trailer for X-Men: Days of Future Past {{was released in}} October 2013. Jason Callina of Herald News gave the trailer a positive response, saying, [...] "it is fantastic to see characters that I grew up with in the flesh...we still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> the end of May to see if Fox succeeded, but for now they have my interest". Ben Child of The Guardian criticized the trailer {{for the amount of}} characters that will appear in the film. Child wrote, [...] "overloading the movie with superheroes might please fans of the comic books, but the rest of us will be chewing on our own spleens when the umpteenth brightly coloured dude turns up to spout one line of dialogue, then drop off the map".|$|E
500|$|Excluding the cephalophines (duikers), tragelaphines (spiral-horned antelopes) and the neotragines, most African bovids are gregarious and territorial. Males {{are forced}} to {{disperse}} on attaining sexual maturity, and must form their own territories, while females {{are not required to}} do so. Males that do not hold territories form bachelor herds. Competition takes place among males to acquire dominance, and fights tend to be more rigorous in limited rutting seasons. With the exception of migratory males, males generally hold the same territory throughout their lives. In the waterbuck, some male individuals, known as [...] "satellite males", may be allowed into the territories of other males and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> the owner grows old so they may acquire his territory. Lek mating, where males gather together and competitively display to potential mates, is known to exist among topis, kobs, and lechwes. The tragelaphines, cattle, sheep, and goats are gregarious and not territorial. In these species, males must gain absolute dominance over all other males, and fights are not confined to territories. Males, therefore, spend years in body growth.|$|E
