5|$|Richard Wagner {{was born}} to an ethnic German family in Leipzig, where his family lived at No. 3, the Brühl (The House of the Red and White Lions) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> quarter. He was baptized at St. Thomas Church. He was the ninth child of Carl Friedrich Wagner, who was a clerk in the Leipzig police service, and his wife, Johanna Rosine (née Paetz), the {{daughter}} of a baker. Wagner's father Carl died of typhus six months after Richard's birth. Afterwards his mother Johanna lived with Carl's friend, the actor and playwright Ludwig Geyer. In August 1814 Johanna and Geyer probably married—although no documentation of this has been found in the Leipzig church registers. She and her family moved to Geyer's residence in Dresden. Until he was fourteen, Wagner was known as Wilhelm Richard Geyer. He almost certainly thought that Geyer was his biological father.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{cooperation}} between the FVdG and the political parties in the Ruhr region {{was part of a}} nationwide trend after Paul Levi, an anti-syndicalist, became chairman of the KPD in March. Moreover, Rudolf Rocker, a communist anarchist and follower of Kropotkin, joined the FVdG in March 1919. He returned via The Netherlands in November 1918 after living in exile in London, where he had been active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> anarchist scene. Augustin Souchy, more of a Landauer-esque anarchist, also joined the federation in 1919. Both rapidly gained influence in the organization and—as anti-Marxists—were opposed to close collaboration with communists.|$|E
5|$|With the {{censorship}} of Polish theater (and the virtual {{end of the}} Polish radio and film industry), underground theaters were created, primarily in Warsaw and Kraków, with shows presented in various underground venues.

Four large companies and more than 40smaller groups were active throughout the war, even in the Gestapo's Pawiak prison in Warsaw and in Auschwitz; underground acting schools were also created.
