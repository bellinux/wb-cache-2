Holme Dunes NNR is accessed from Holme-next-the-Sea. It has a visitor centre, three bird <b>hides,</b> one of which has disabled access, and a 4km (2.5mi) nature trail. The other reserves are all adjacent to the A149. Titchwell Marsh RSPB is just west of Titchwell village and has a visitor centre, café and <b>hides.</b> Most of the reserve and its facilities are wheelchair accessible, but {{the last part of the}} footpath to the beach is rough, and crosses a steep bank. The two bird <b>hides</b> at Holkham NNR can be reached from the end of Lady Anne's Drive in Holkham village; there is also a car park further east on Beach Road, Wells-next-the-Sea.

40|$|AbstractA <b>hidden</b> algebra is {{a special}} case of coalgebra. A <b>hidden</b> {{congruence}} on a <b>hidden</b> algebra corresponds to a bisimulation equivalence on the corresponding coalgebra. The paper generalizes the notion of <b>hidden</b> congruence to that of <b>hidden</b> bisimulation between two different <b>hidden</b> algebras. We first define <b>hidden</b> bisimulation between two <b>hidden</b> algebras having the same signature. A <b>hidden</b> bisimulation {{is in fact a}} bisimulation between the corresponding coalgebras. We then define <b>hidden</b> simulation between two <b>hidden</b> algebras having different signatures related by a vertical signature morphism. We prefer to call this relation simulation because it is unidirectional, due to the signature morphism. For the last case, the relationship between simulation and refinement is discussed...|$|R

40|$|As a single-hidden-layer {{feedforward}} neural network, {{an extreme}} learning machine (ELM) randomizes the weights between the input layer and the <b>hidden</b> layer {{as well as}} the bias of <b>hidden</b> neurons, and analytically determines the weights between the <b>hidden</b> layer and the output layer using the least-squares method. This paper proposes a two-hidden-layer ELM (denoted TELM) by introducing a novel method for obtaining the parameters of the second <b>hidden</b> layer (connection weights {{between the first and second}} <b>hidden</b> layer and the bias of the second <b>hidden</b> layer), hence bringing the actual <b>hidden</b> layer output closer to the expected <b>hidden</b> layer output in the two-hidden-layer feedforward network. Simultaneously, the TELM method inherits the randomness of the ELM technique for the first <b>hidden</b> layer (connection weights between the input weights and the first <b>hidden</b> layer and the bias of the first <b>hidden</b> layer). Experiments on several regression problems and some popular classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed TELM can consistently outperform the original ELM, as well as some existing multilayer ELM variants, in terms of average accuracy and the number of <b>hidden</b> neurons...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{models and}} e#cient algorithms for detecting groups (communities) functioning in communication networks which attempt to <b>hide</b> their functionality [...] <b>hidden</b> groups. A <b>hidden</b> {{group is a}} group that is planning some activity using some public communication network.

We develop a model and algorithms for detecting such <b>hidden</b> groups, in particular we exploit the non-random nature of the <b>hidden</b> group communiations with respect to the general background communications. Our results reveal the properties of the background network activity and <b>hidden</b> group communication dynamics that make detection of the <b>hidden</b> group easy, as well as those that make it di#cult. We di#erentiate between two types of <b>hidden</b> groups: in a trusting (or non-secretive) <b>hidden</b> group, members are willing to communicate messages to other members via non-hidden group members; in a non-trusting (or secretive) <b>hidden</b> group, all information that must be passed among <b>hidden</b> group members cannot be passed via non-hidden group members...|$|R

5|$|Wool and <b>hides</b> {{were the}} major exports {{in the late}} Middle Ages. From 1327 to 1332, the {{earliest}} period for which figures survive, the annual average was 5,700 sacks of wool and 36,100 leather <b>hides.</b> The disruption of the Wars of Independence, which not only limited trade but damaged much of the valuable agricultural land of the Borders and Lowlands, meant that this fell in the period 1341–42 to 1342–43 to 2,450 sacks of wool and 17,900 <b>hides.</b> The trade recovered to reach a peak in the 1370s, with an annual average of 7,360 sacks, but the international recession from the 1380s saw a reduction to an annual average of 3,100 sacks. The introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to the wool trade from the early fifteenth century. Despite a levelling-off, in the Low Countries there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-sixteenth century. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large-scale cloth production and only poor-quality rough cloths {{seem to have been}} significant.|$|E
