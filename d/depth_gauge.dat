25|$|Also called combo consoles, {{these are}} usually hard rubber or tough plastic moldings which enclose the SPG and have {{mounting}} sockets for other diver instrumentation, such as decompression computers, underwater compass, timer and/or <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> and occasionally {{a small plastic}} slate on which notes can be written either before or during the dive. These instruments would otherwise be carried somewhere else such as strapped to the wrist or forearm or in a pocket and are only regulator accessories for convenience of transport and access, and {{at greater risk of}} damage during handling.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{the maximum}} {{depth of the}} water is known, and is quite shallow, a diver must monitor the depth and {{duration}} of a dive to avoid decompression sickness. Traditionally this was done by using a <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> and a diving watch, but electronic dive computers are now in general use, as they are programmed to do real-time modelling of decompression requirements for the dive, and automatically allow for surface interval. Many can be set for the gas mixture to be used on the dive, and some can accept changes in the gas mix during the dive. Most dive computers provide a fairly conservative decompression model, {{and the level of}} conservatism may be selected by the user within limits. Most decompression computers can also be set for altitude compensation to some degree.|$|E

25|$|Technical dives {{in waters}} where the diver's vision is {{severely}} impeded by low-visibility conditions, caused by turbidity or silt out and low light conditions due to depth or enclosure, require greater competence. The combination of low visibility and strong current can make dives {{in these conditions}} extremely hazardous, particularly in an overhead environment, and greater skill and reliable and familiar equipment are needed to manage this risk. Limited visibility diving can cause disorientation, potentially leading to loss of sense of direction, loss of effective buoyancy control, etc. Divers in extremely limited visibility situations depend on their instruments such as dive lights, pressure gauges, compass, <b>depth</b> <b>gauge,</b> bottom timer, dive computer, etc., and guidelines for orientation and information. Training for cave and wreck diving includes techniques for managing extreme low visibility, as finding {{the way out of}} an overhead environment before running out of gas is a safety-critical skill.|$|E

2500|$|The hull {{was built}} in three {{sections}} composed of [...] thick steel with an aluminium alloy conning tower bolted to the top. The conning tower contained armoured glass windows to allow the pilot to see out. The hydroplanes and rudder were made of wood and trying to control them while tracking the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge,</b> compass and periscope made the craft hard to handle. Adding to the pilotâ€™s difficulties, the craft lacked compensating and trimming tanks, making staying at periscope depth a near impossibility. The Biber had two diving tanks, one in the bow section {{and one in the}} stern.|$|E
2500|$|... {{a routine}} dive in the Baltic {{turned into an}} {{emergency}} when the boat sank out of control. She hit the bottom stern-first with a thump. The <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> read the submarine was in severe difficulty, having taken on tons of water, poisonous chlorine gas was leaking from the batteries {{and there was the}} danger of an explosion. U-557 had also suffered her first death; a mechanic sustained fatal head injuries in the after torpedo room. A human chain of sailors was formed, passing buckets of sea water to each other, in an attempt to shift some of the weight from the stern to the bow. After many hour's toil, the boat pivoted so that the bow hit the bottom. But the sheer weight of water (about 40 tons) prevented U-557 from reaching the surface. The boat, having exhausted its supply of compressed air, stayed on the sea bed. The crew, {{under the direction of the}} Chief Engineer, rocked the boat by moving rapidly from stern to bow and back again. The submarine eventually worked herself free. After 20 hours, U-557 surfaced and sailed on to Kiel.|$|E
2500|$|Uncontrolled rate of ascent can {{increase}} risk of decompression sickness and lung overexpansion injury even when diving within the no-stop {{limits of the}} decompression tables, so the skills of buoyancy control during ascent are important for diver safety and are included to some extent in all entry level training, but the criteria for competence vary among the certification agencies. Most, if not all, agencies require the diver {{to be able to}} limit ascent rate {{and to be able to}} achieve neutral buoyancy at a specified depth during an ascent without significantly overshooting the target depth, while using only a <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> or dive computer as a reference to depth and ascent rate, but this is a skill which requires considerable practice to master, and few learners can achieve true competence in the short time provided for practicing the skill in recreational entry level diver training. The skills involve venting the buoyancy compensator and where applicable, the dry suit at a rate which provides neutral or slight negative buoyancy at all stages of the ascent, or for highly skilled practitioner, just sufficient positive buoyancy to cause ascent at the desired rate, and neutral buoyancy when a stop is required. Most dry suits intended for scuba diving are fitted with an automatic dump valve, which can be adjusted to provide an approximately constant volume of gas in the suit, so the diver can concentrate on controlling ascent rate by venting the buoyancy compensator. These skills become critical when [...] decompression stops are required, and even divers with excellent buoyancy control will often make use of aids to ascent rate and depth control to reduce risk. Shot lines are used at all levels of diving, and are in common use during entry level training, as a visual aid to ascent rate and depth control, and as a fall-back physical aid. The skills of deploying and using surface marker buoys and decompression buoys are generally considered advanced skills for recreational divers, but may be considered entry level skills for professional divers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} {{approach to}} survey is {{to carry out}} three-dimensional surveying by divers using <b>depth</b> <b>gauges</b> and tape measurements. Research shows that such measurements are typically less accurate than similar surveys on land. Where it is not practical or safe for divers to physically visit a site, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) enable observation and intervention with control by personnel located at the surface. The low technology approach of measuring using tape measures and <b>depth</b> <b>gauges</b> can be replaced with a more accurate and quicker high technology approach using acoustic positioning. ROV technology was used during the Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project. The [...] "Mardi Gras Shipwreck" [...] sank some 200 years ago about 35 {{miles off the coast}} of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of divers now use electronic, wrist-worn dive computers. A dive computer or decompression meter is a device used by a scuba diver to measure the time and depth of a dive so that a safe ascent profile can be calculated and displayed so that the diver can avoid decompression sickness. Diving watches and <b>depth</b> <b>gauges</b> are however still commonly used by divers as backup instruments for overcoming dive computer malfunctions.|$|R
25|$|The use of bourdon tube, diaphragm, {{and digital}} <b>depth</b> <b>gauges</b> may require {{adjustment}} for use at altitude. Capillary gauges {{have been shown}} to be a conservative method for measurement of compensated depth at altitude. Modern dive computers detect changes in altitude or accept it as a user input and automatically adjust their calculation of a safe decompression regime for a dive at that altitude. If an altitude-aware computer is not used, altitude decompression tables must be used.|$|R
50|$|Best safety {{requires}} that the chain is properly sharpened. One key sharpening parameter is the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> setting. The <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> is the small steel protuberance {{in front of each}} cutting tooth. The difference in height between the leading cutting edge and the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> determines the thickness of the wood chip taken by the cutter. If the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> is too low, the cutter takes too deep a bite from the wood, the saw becomes difficult to control and the chances of kickback increase.|$|E
50|$|A diver uses a <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> with {{decompression}} {{tables and}} a watch to avoid decompression sickness. A common {{alternative to the}} <b>depth</b> <b>gauge,</b> watch and decompression tables is a dive computer. A <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> and an oxygen analyser/oxygen sensor {{can be used to}} measure the partial pressure of oxygen of the breathing gas, which is necessary to avoid oxygen toxicity.|$|E

50|$|Very early {{chainsaws}} used tooth configurations {{very similar}} to conventional hand saws. These were very simple saw teeth following a wave pattern (left, centre, right, centre) with no <b>depth</b> <b>gauges</b> as such, relying purely on bar pressure to limit the cutting rate. They were inefficient and slow in use, and were soon superseded by chipper chain. They required great skill {{and a lot of}} time to sharpen in the field leading to extended downtime between sessions.|$|R
2500|$|All are fish-eaters, dining {{on small}} eels, fish, and even water snakes. They dive from the surface, though many species make a {{characteristic}} half-jump as they dive, presumably to give themselves a more streamlined {{entry into the}} water.
