5|$|The US Chief of Army Staff, General Martin Dempsey, said Pakistan's {{anger was}} {{justified}} {{as it had}} {{a reason to be}} furious given the loss of life. However, Dempsey did not apologise, saying he did not know <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> incident and an inquiry was still being conducted. A senior advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Pakistan and Afghanistan may be on a course toward military conflict. Hamid Karzai contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister to discuss the NATO strike and gave his condolences over the deaths of soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Born in Braco in Perthshire, Scotland, McGregor {{first became}} {{interested}} in football after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at Ardoch. He served an apprenticeship as a draper in Perth, and in 1870, following the example of his brother Peter, moved to Birmingham, and opened his own drapery business in Aston, an area just outside the city. Upon his arrival in the English Midlands he became involved with a local football club, Calthorpe, which had been formed by a fellow Scot, Campbell Orr. McGregor was enthusiastic <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays {{to allow him to}} watch matches, and he later sold football kits at the shop, which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E

25|$|Between 5 November – 21 December 1984, Cardiacs {{performed}} {{their first}} major British support tour, supporting Marillion at the personal invitation of Marillion’s vocalist, Fish. Whilst the tour afforded the band {{a new level}} of publicity, generally they were not well received by Marillion's fanbase. On most dates of the tour, the band was pelted with a variety of makeshift missiles. During the 13 December show at the Hammersmith Apollo, Fish himself was indignant <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Marillion fans and their hostile behaviour to come onstage during Cardiacs' set and berate the audience about it. The band eventually ducked out of the last three days of the Marillion tour.|$|E

Late in his life he reportedly told three of his sons, a retired Utah judge, and {{a friend in the}} Salt Lake City public defender's office that he had committed the hijacking.

The first such friendship was with Piers Dunkerley, 13 years old in 1934 when Britten was aged 20. Other boys Britten befriended were the young David Hemmings and Michael Crawford, both of whom sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s. Hemmings later said, [...] "In {{all of the time}} that I spent with him he never abused that trust", and Crawford wrote [...] "I cannot say <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> kindness of that great man... he had a wonderful patience and affinity with young people.

500|$|The {{criticism}} of Vrba {{stems from the}} tension between what Ruth Linn calls survivor and expert discourse. Bauer referred to Vrba's memoir as [...] "not a memoir in the usual sense", alleging that it [...] "contains excerpts of conversations of {{which there is no}} chance that they are accurate and it has elements of a second-hand story that does not necessarily correspond with reality". When writing about himself and his personal experiences, Vrba's account is an important and true one, Bauer wrote, but he argued that Vrba was not justified in seeing himself as an expert on Holocaust history. Vrba often dismissed the opinion of historians. Regarding the numbers killed at Auschwitz, he said that Bauer and historian Raul Hilberg did not know <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> history of Auschwitz.|$|E
500|$|Unsuspecting readers {{followed}} {{the story of}} Knickerbocker and his manuscript with interest, and some New York city officials were concerned <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> missing historian that they considered offering a reward for his safe return. Riding the wave of public interest he had created with his hoax, Irving—adopting the pseudonym of his Dutch historian—published A History of New York on December 6, 1809, to immediate critical and popular success. [...] "It took with the public", Irving remarked, [...] "and gave me celebrity, as an original work was something remarkable and uncommon in America". Today, the surname of Diedrich Knickerbocker, the fictional narrator of this and other Irving works, has become a nickname for Manhattan residents in general and was adopted by New York City's NBA team, the New York Knickerbockers.|$|E

500|$|Despite William Plomer's {{original}} {{thought about}} the state of the manuscript, editors Jonathan Cape were concerned <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> story to pass the manuscript to Kingsley Amis to read on holiday, paying him £35/15 shillings for his thoughts and advice, although Amis' subsequent suggestions were not used by Cape. Cape had taken the step because they thought the novel was thin and [...] "feeble". Raymond Benson has noted that the thinness comes from a lack of the rich detail and descriptions which are normally present in Fleming's work, but which are missing from The Man with the Golden Gun; Benson suggests that these details were normally worked into the second draft by Fleming, but their absence shows that no such additional work was done on this occasion. The Man with the Golden Gun was published posthumously, eight months after its author's death.|$|E
500|$|The concerts were a {{considerable}} financial outlay for Bache, {{who did not}} have a regular salary until 1881 and had to sustain himself through teaching. By 1873, he wrote, he had to [...] "decide whether I shall sacrifice myself entirely to the production of Liszt's orchestral and choral works (which after all can never be immortal as Bach, Beethoven and Wagner: here I feel that Bülow is right). Or shall I make my own improvement the object of my life, and not spend a third of my income in one evening." [...] Bülow became concerned <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation to waive his fee after one concert he conducted, and to contribute £50 out of his own pocket. Liszt was also concerned, writing, [...] "For years [...] has sacrificed money for the performance of my works in London. Several times I advised him against it, but he answered imperturbably, 'That is my business.'" [...] Whenever Bache was asked about finances for the concerts, he would tell whoever was asking that the cost was [...] "a just recompense" [...] and add that even if Liszt had charged him for his lessons {{at the same rate as}} the average village piano teacher, he would still be deeply in his debt.|$|E
500|$|The lockout {{prompted}} indifference {{among most}} American sports fans, {{who thought that}} greed was shown by both sides; the latter was a similar sentiment to what fans voiced during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. A CBS News–New York Times poll conducted in October 1998 showed that, while most fans' opinion of professional basketball was unaffected by the work stoppage, 29percent reported that their views had become more negative. The same poll showed that fans backed the NBPA in the dispute by a 36–29 margin, while the general public supported the owners 24percent to 22percent. One-quarter of basketball fans {{who responded to the}} poll stated {{that they did not know}} <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lockout to give an opinion, along with 45percent of the general public. Media members were frequently critical of the owners and players. Sportswriter Tony Kornheiser described the labor dispute as one [...] "between tall millionaires and short millionaires." [...] An article in Newsweek termed the lockout [...] "an incomprehensible and unconscionable dispute between rival gangs of millionaires". Time Bill Saporito believed that each side was damaged by the lockout, in terms of financial losses and negative publicity. Stern said that he had made concessions in the agreement, while Hunter said that the parties [...] "both blinked." ...|$|E
