25|$|The Club van 100 is the {{official}} list of Football players who have appeared in one hundred or more official matches for AFC Ajax. The club currently has a total of 150 members with Daley Blind being the latest addition. The record for league appearances is held by Mr. Ajax himself Sjaak Swart, who appeared in 463 league matches for Ajax 1. There is a beneficiary team called Lucky Ajax, which was initiated by Sjaak Swart. Lucky Ajax participate {{in at least one}} match a year, usually in the name of charity, and commonly at football ceremonies to bid farewell to retiring players. One of the prerequisites for playing on Lucky Ajax, which is invitational only, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a member of the Club van 100, having made at least 100 official match appearances for Ajax in the first team of the club.|$|E

500|$|While the Australian {{team lost}} the Ashes {{for the first}} time in twenty years, Johnson spent the winter of 1953 calling Australian rules {{football}} matches for local radio station 3AW and writing columns for The Argus newspaper. [...] Later that year, the Victorian Cricket Association appointed him to succeed the retired Hassett as captain of Victoria. [...] In the middle of the season, at a mutual friend's New Year's Eve party, Hassett approached Johnson to discuss his form. [...] Taking a confrontational approach, Hassett said to Johnson, [...] "The problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not getting stuck in. [...] You're not trying." [...] When Johnson protested, Hassett continued [...] "If you have got any brains, you will start taking this game seriously. [...] Because if you do you will end up captaining Australia next year." ...|$|E
500|$|King {{has since}} been {{critical}} of his performance, which he describes as his [...] "most lackluster". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as [...] "probably the odd man out at that point", he stated he [...] "didn't participate as much because of that". [...] Hanneman said: [...] "We go through dry spells sometimes, but {{the good thing about}} having two guitar players that can write music <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell." [...] King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels [...] vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and [...] "added too much singing". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: [...] "There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally. Again, I was probably wanting something else." ...|$|E

"The most {{important}} thing to bear in mind when arrested <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a volunteer of a revolutionary Army, that you have been captured by an enemy force, that your cause is a just one, that you are right and that the enemy is wrong and that as a soldier you have taken the chance expected of a soldier and that there is {{nothing to be ashamed of}} in being captured.|$|E

2500|$|Sites such as Facebook are {{becoming}} increasingly popular tools for methods of ending relationships and friendships, proving that although new media is {{being used as a}} tool for connecting with individuals, it is now creating new problems associated with disconnecting from others. Instead of the traditional phone call or face-to-face interaction between individuals, people are now starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status, knowing full well that their significant other will see it shortly. The problem with that <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship. In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook. New media websites have made our private lives much more public, {{especially when it comes to}} breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed [...] "single" [...] relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was more}} parrying between Cotton and the court, but the exchanges were not {{recorded}} in the transcript of the proceedings. [...] Hutchinson next asked the court for leave to [...] "give you the ground of what I know to be true." [...] She then addressed the court with her own judgment, becoming both didactic and prophetic and claiming her source of knowledge to be direct, personal revelation from God. [...] She ended her statement by prophesying, [...] "if you go on in this course [...] you begin, you will bring a curse upon you and your posterity, and {{the mouth of the}} Lord hath spoken it." [...] "The judges were aghast," [...] historian Emery Battis writes. [...] "She had defied the Court and threatened the commonwealth with God's curse." [...] Cotton attempted to defend her but was challenged by the magistrates, until Winthrop ended the questioning. A vote was taken on a sentence of banishment, only the only dissenters were the two remaining deputies from Boston, Colburn and Coddington. [...] Winthrop then read the order: [...] "Mrs. Hutchinson, the sentence of the court you hear <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> banished from out of our jurisdiction as being a woman not fit for our society, and are to be imprisoned till the court shall send you away." ...|$|E
