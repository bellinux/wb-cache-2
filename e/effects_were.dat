5|$|In Louisiana and Mississippi, <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> minor, {{and limited}} to {{moderate}} rain {{up to three}} inches (76mm).|$|E
5|$|As Josephine {{passed to}} the south of the Cape Verde islands on September2, outer rain bands {{produced}} minor rainfall, totaling around 0.55inches (14mm). There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> minor.|$|E
5|$|As Typhoon Meranti never {{threatened}} any land masses, no watches or warnings {{were issued}} {{in response to}} the storm. Although Meranti passed near Wake Island as a tropical depression, no <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> recorded.|$|E
30|$|Although {{spillover}} <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> {{likely to}} occur, {{the question is}} to what extent it invalidates a DiD application. What {{is required for the}} identification of a treatment <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> that second round, or indirect <b>effects,</b> <b>are</b> of a lower order of magnitude compared to the direct effect. At least in large data sets, a significant treatment <b>effect</b> should <b>be</b> discernible even if the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> biased to some extent.|$|R
30|$|The {{review of}} {{literature}} and experiments indicate the presence of Pre-Darcy effect. Contributing factors to Pre-Darcy <b>effect</b> <b>are</b> discussed and some reasons causing this <b>effect</b> <b>are</b> postulated. The experiments also show that this <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> significant.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} reasons to think this <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> real. Firstly, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> seen in such {{a wide range of}} patients, medical and surgical, unselected and selected. Secondly, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> very {{consistent}} in terms of the degree of difference (10-15%). Thirdly, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> seen in many developed countries on several continents, all of which have a ‘Saturday/Sunday weekend concept’.|$|R
5|$|Emmy passed within 135miles (215km) of the Lesser Antilles, {{though only}} minor <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> experienced. No damage was {{reported}} in the Azores, though strong winds from the hurricane caused a Venezuelan air force C-130 flight to crash near Lajes Field, killing all 68 aboard.|$|E
5|$|Forming {{near the}} Cape Verde Islands, Igor {{prompted}} {{the issuance of}} tropical storm watches for the southern islands on September8. Though the storm passed relatively close to the region, only minimal <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> recorded. Once the cyclone tracked away from Cape Verde, the watches were discontinued on September9.|$|E
5|$|In 1727, an {{underground}} fire {{was reported in}} nearby Hinxhill, while a larger earthquake struck the town on 1 June 1756. The 2007 Kent earthquake, which registered 4.3 on the Richter magnitude scale, was felt in Ashford, though its <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> greatest in Folkestone.|$|E
50|$|On a hero's turn, Start of Turn <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> resolved, {{then one}} card may be played, then one power may be used, then one card may be drawn, then End of Turn <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> resolved. If a hero has lost all hit points, then instead Start of Turn <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> resolved, one {{incapacitated}} ability may be used, then End of Turn <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> resolved.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the price}} changes from [...] to [...] the {{magnitude}} of the price <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> represented by the rectangle [...] and {{the magnitude of}} the quantity <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> given by rectangle [...] The price <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> the loss of revenue from selling the original quantity at the lower price; the quantity <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> the added revenue earned at the new price on the newly induced units sold.|$|R
50|$|The {{next set}} of {{substituent}}s are the halogens, for which the substituent <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still positive but much more modest. The {{reason for this is}} that while the inductive <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still negative, the mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> positive, causing partial cancellation. The data also show that for these substituents, the meta <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> much larger than the para effect, due to the fact that the mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> greatly reduced in a meta substituent. With meta substituents a carbon atom bearing the negative charge is further away from the carboxylic acid group (structure 2b).|$|R
5|$|In 1923 an Act of Parliament {{was passed}} authorising {{abandonment}} of the railway. its <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> auctioned on 8 August 1924 and the final general meeting wound the company up on 7 July 1925. The debenture holders received 70% of the nominal value of their holdings and the shareholders received nothing.|$|E
5|$|In Louisiana, {{damage was}} light, as the {{majority}} of Hanna's convective activity was to the east. Rainfall was mostly less than 1inches (25mm), and little rise in tide was reported. Little or no damage occurred in neighboring Mississippi, where similar <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> reported.|$|E
5|$|In post-production, {{the visual}} <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> handled by Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs. The {{military}} aircraft they created was so realistic that the Indian Air Force called {{to check the}} producer's permission of using an actual MiG-21.|$|E
3000|$|... ■ If the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> positive, it {{indicates}} this land use type should be expanded, and {{the bigger the}} numerical value of the <b>effect</b> <b>is,</b> the bigger the market effect to the land use will <b>be.</b> If the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> negative, {{it indicates}} this land use type should be reduced, and the bigger the absolute value of the <b>effect</b> <b>is,</b> the bigger the market effect to the land use is.|$|R
5000|$|The Paschen-Back <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> the {{splitting}} {{of atomic}} energy {{levels in the}} presence of a strong magnetic field. This occurs when an external magnetic field is sufficiently large to disrupt the coupling between orbital (...) and spin (...) angular momenta. This <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> the strong-field limit of the Zeeman effect. When , the two <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> equivalent. The <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> named after the German physicists Friedrich Paschen and Ernst E. A. Back.|$|R
50|$|This <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{created by}} Ben Harris {{in the mid}} 1980s. The <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> sold under the name Cosmosis: The Original Floating Match. Harris's original <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> intended {{to be used with}} a regular playing card from a normal deck of playing cards.|$|R
5|$|Myst: Masterpiece Edition was {{an updated}} version of the {{original}} Myst, released in May 2000. It featured several improvements over the original game, with the images re-rendered in 24-bit truecolor instead of the original Mysts 8-bit color. The score was re-mastered and sound <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> enhanced.|$|E
5|$|No land <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> {{reported}} in Nicaragua but a four-year-old girl drowned {{on a boat}} that sank amidst high winds and waves {{at the mouth of}} the Kukra River.|$|E
5|$|Nonfatal health <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the health <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> {{headache}} and constipation. The overall profile of adverse <b>effects</b> <b>is</b> {{comparable to that}} of palonosetron (see Palonosetron#Adverse effects); no common adverse <b>effects</b> can <b>be</b> attributed to netupitant.|$|R
50|$|Demcizumab {{has been}} known to cause many adverse effects in patient. The most common side <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> hypertension, fatigue, anemia, and headaches. More adverse <b>effect</b> <b>are</b> nausea, hypoalbuminemia, dizziness, and dyspnea occurred. Finally, some {{uncommon}} side <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> heart related illness forming half way through the study.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} metal salts on the {{oxidation}} reaction of (acetylphenyl) ferrocenes was determined. For the p- and m-isomers, the <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> accelerated, {{but for the}} o-isomer, the <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> suppressed. This suppressing <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> related to the chelate ring containing the substrate and the metal ion. ...|$|R
5|$|Numerous make-up <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> {{created by}} make-up {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore, including an exploding head using raw meat. There were concerns by producers {{that some of}} the <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> too graphic, but after a viewing by a staff member's son, they decided to broadcast it uncut. The episode has subsequently been included in some best episode lists of the series, and won one of three Primetime Emmy Awards for The Next Generations first season. Controversial when originally broadcast, it was initially banned from broadcast in the United Kingdom, and required a warning before airing in Canada.|$|E
5|$|September 5, 2008– Hurricane Hanna moves ashore {{near the}} South Carolina– North Carolina border, packing strong winds and torrential rains. Aside from minor {{structural}} damage, the storm's <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> generally minor.|$|E
5|$|The effects crew {{focused on}} using in-camera tricks {{to realize the}} probe; {{post-production}} <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> time-consuming, so lighting <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> done on stage while filming. Model shop supervisor Jeff Mann filled the probe's antenna with tube lamps and halogen bulbs that were turned on in sequence for different exposures; three different camera passes for each exposure were combined for the final effect. After watching the first shot, the team found the original, whalelike probe design lacking in menace. The modelmakers repainted the probe a shiny black, pockmarked its surface for greater texture and interest, and re-shot the scene. Although they wanted to avoid post-production effects work, the opticals team had to recolor the antenna ball in a blue hue, as the original orange looked too much like a spinning basketball.|$|E
2500|$|The anti-greenhouse <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> a {{mechanism}} similar and symmetrical to the greenhouse effect: greenhouse <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> about atmosphere letting radiation in, while not letting thermal radiation out, which warms the body surface; anti-greenhouse <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> about atmosphere NOT letting radiation in, while letting thermal radiation out, which lowers the equilibrium surface temperature. Such an <b>effect</b> has <b>been</b> cited about Titan ...|$|R
50|$|This {{interesting}} <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered by}} Joaquim da Costa Ribeiro in 1944. The Brazilian physicist observed that solidification and melting of many dielectrics {{are accompanied by}} charge separation. A thermo-dielectric <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> demonstrated with carnauba wax, naphthalene and paraffin. Charge separation in ice was also expected. This <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> observed during water freezing period, electrical storm <b>effects</b> can <b>be</b> caused by this strange phenomenon. <b>Effect</b> <b>was</b> measured by many researches - Bernhard Gross, Armando Dias Tavares, Sergio Mascarenhas etc. César Lattes (co-discoverer of the pion) supposed that this <b>was</b> the only <b>effect</b> ever to <b>be</b> discovered entirely in Brasil.|$|R
50|$|On the environment's turn, Start of Turn <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> resolved, one card is played, and the End of Turn <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> resolved.|$|R
5|$|Throughout its existence, the {{hurricane}} remained relatively close to land, so consequently its <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> felt in many areas. Much {{of the northern}} Caribbean received moderate to heavy rainfall along with gusty winds during its passage; although only Haiti reported damage from it. Its <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> far more severe in Mexico where an estimated 4,000 people were killed by record-breaking floods triggered by {{the hurricane}}. The city of Monterrey received the worst damage: {{more than half of}} the structures in the city were flooded, hundreds were destroyed, and 20,000 people were left homeless. Damage from the storm in the country was estimated to have exceeded $50million (1909USD; $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Arlene caused light {{rainfall}} across southeastern Mississippi, typically between 1 and 2inches (25 to 50mm). <b>Effects</b> <b>were</b> generally minimal.|$|E
5|$|Additional optical <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> {{provided}} by Visual Concept Engineering (VCE), a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back. VCE provided effects including phaser beams, the Enterprise reactor, additional sand on Ceti Alpha V, and an updated transporter effect. Meyer {{and the production}} staff were adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter, as had {{been done in the}} original television series. Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid-transport, although much of the matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports.|$|E
50|$|A {{corollary}} of the Pygmalion <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> {{the golem}} <b>effect,</b> in which low expectations {{lead to a}} decrease in performance; both <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> forms of self-fulfilling prophecy. By the Pygmalion effect, people internalize their positive labels, and those with positive labels succeed accordingly. The idea behind the Pygmalion <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> that increasing the leader's expectation of the follower's performance will result in better follower performance. Within sociology, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> often cited with regard to education and social class.|$|R
40|$|Two {{models of}} how interfeature causal {{knowledge}} affects classification were evaluated. First, a causal status <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> stronger for probabilistic versus deterministic causal links (Expt. 1). Second, a causal status <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> stronger for essentialized categories (Expt. 2) although only for probabilistic causal links (Expt. 3).

5000|$|Glucocorticoids such as {{cortisol}} affect carbohydrate, fat, {{and protein}} metabolism, and have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative, and vasoconstrictive <b>effects.</b> Anti-inflammatory <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by blocking {{the action of}} inflammatory mediators (transrepression) and inducing anti-inflammatory mediators (transactivation). Immunosuppressive <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by suppressing delayed hypersensitivity reactions by direct action on T-lymphocytes. Anti-proliferative <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by inhibition of DNA synthesis and epidermal cell turnover. Vasoconstrictive <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by inhibiting the action of inflammatory mediators such as histidine.|$|R
