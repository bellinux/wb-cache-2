5|$|At {{the extreme}} of {{interactions}} are galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other.

The more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is torn apart.

5|$|The {{design for}} the ships was drawn up between 1910 and 1912. Consideration was given to {{equipping}} the new ships with triple turrets mounting the 30.5cm (12in) guns of the preceding s, but after examining the gun turrets of the Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts of the , {{it was determined that}} the triple gun turrets still had too many problems. Among these deficiencies were increased weight, reduced ammunition supply and rate of fire, and loss of fighting capability <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the turrets was disabled. It was therefore decided to arm the new vessels with eight 38cm guns instead of twelve 30.5cm guns.|$|E

5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module.

The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Sampson {{noted that}} earlier studies {{had found that}} the horns and frills of ceratopsians most likely had a {{function}} in intraspecific display and combat, and that these features would therefore have resulted from sexual selection for successful mating. Likewise, in 1997 Horner concluded that such ornamentation was used by males to establish dominance and that females would have preferred well-equipped males as their offspring would then inherit these traits, conferring a reproduction benefit. Dodson thought that in the Centrosaurinae in general the display value of the frill had been reduced compared to the nasal and supraorbital ornamentation. Sampson in 1995 rejected {{the possibility that the}} difference in skull ornamentation between Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus represented sexual dimorphism, for three reasons. Firstly, the extensive Einiosaurus bone beds did not contain any specimens with bosses, as would have been expected <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the sexes had them. Secondly, Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus are found in strata of a different age. Thirdly, in a situation of sexual dimorphism usually only one of the sexes shows exaggerated secondary sexual characters. Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus however, each have developed a disctinct set of such traits.|$|E
5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. <b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|E
5|$|ReCore is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. It centers around Joule Adams {{and her three}} robotic machines known as corebot companions, whose function is to aid her in combat and puzzle solving; these types of machines are amenable to improvement, should players find the blueprints and materials to do so, which grants upgrades to their attack and defense. The machines' cores can be swapped between them, changing their abilities in succession, and their frames are rearrangeable. Players can level up Joule's weapons and vitality. Ranged weapons have three kinds of ammunition that serve the purpose of taking down an enemy with a matching color: red, blue and yellow. Furthermore, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Joule's corebots matches the color of an enemy, it will thus inflict more damage in combat. Joule also wields a grappling hook that she uses to extract her enemies' energy cores after {{a certain amount of}} damage is done. Joule must dodge, jump or dash quickly to avoid taking damage while engaged in enemy conflict.|$|E
