5000|$|Chronic {{stress is}} a term {{sometimes}} used to differentiate between acute stress. Definitions differ, and may be {{along the lines of}} continual activation of the stress response, stress that causes an allostatic shift in bodily functions, or just as [...] "prolonged stress". For example, results of one study demonstrated that individuals who reported relationship conflict lasting one month or longer have a greater risk of <b>developing</b> <b>illness</b> and show slower wound healing. Similarly, the effects that acute stressors have on the immune system may be increased when there is perceived stress and/or anxiety due to other events. For example, students who are taking exams show weaker immune responses if they also report stress due to daily hassles. While responses to acute stressors typically do not impose a health burden on young, healthy individuals, chronic stress in older or unhealthy individuals may have long-term effects that are detrimental to health.|$|E
50|$|A {{study by}} E. M. Goldberg and S. L. Morrison {{looked at the}} {{relationship}} between schizophrenia and social class. They {{wanted to find out}} if men, before they had been admitted to a mental hospital, drifted down the occupational scale to unskilled jobs because of their <b>developing</b> <b>illness,</b> or if it was because they were born into families with a lower social class attainment, that they developed their mental illness. They looked at men who had their first admission in a mental hospital between the ages of 25-34. They also looked at their fathers' occupation, in order to see if the social class they grew up in {{played a role in the}} development of schizophrenia. They found the men had grown up in families whose social class was similar to the general population. So the social class they grew up in did not seem to be a contributor to the development of their schizophrenia.|$|E
50|$|Social stress {{also makes}} people more sick. People who have fewer social {{contacts}} are {{at greater risk}} for <b>developing</b> <b>illness,</b> including cardiovascular disease. The lower one’s social status, the more likely he or she is to have a cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neoplastic, pulmonary, renal, or other chronic diseases. These links are not explained by other, more traditional risk factors such as race, health behaviors, age, sex, or access to health care. In one laboratory study, researchers interviewed participants to determine whether they had been experiencing social conflicts with spouses, close family members and friends. They then exposed the participants to the common cold virus and found that participants with conflict-ridden relationships were two times more likely to develop a cold than those without such social stress. Social support, especially in terms of support for socioeconomic stressors, is inversely related to physical morbidity. A study that investigated social determinants of health in an urban slum in India found that social exclusion, stress, and lack of social support are significantly related to illnesses, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes.|$|E

After Agha Jaan's second heart attack, Wali kidnapped Faarah from her house and drove her to his summer resort, locking her in a room so she {{would not be able to}} escape. Once Faarah calmed down, Wali made an agreement with her; that if she agreed to live with Agha Jaan for three months, he would give her a divorce so she could marry her cousin Moeez (Ahmad Zeb) whom which he thought she loved. Following the agreement Faarah developed affection towards Agha Jaan when she realizes his mistakes and lies told by her uncle Tajamul Arsalan (Behroze Sabzwari) and mother, and eventually develops a soft corner for Wali. Behroze, Zuhra and Moeez's truth was revealed to Ruhi after which she regretted her doings and was locked up by Moeez. He kidnapped Faarah to retain her inheritance to invest in his business, where Wali saved Faarah and gets wounded of gun shot. Moeez ended up in jail, while Ruhi breaks all ties from her brother and reunites with Agha Jaan and her in-laws apologizing for her doings.

A sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay for anti-Norwalk virus blocking activity was applied to whole serum and to separate IgM and IgG fractions obtained by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The peak IgM response occurred at about 2 weeks after illness, but IgM was detectable at lower titers for up to 21 weeks after infection. The IgM response was seen in volunteers who became ill, whether or not prechallenge total serum antibody was present. On long-term (27 to 42 months) rechallenge, volunteers who were previously ill and had produced IgM antibody again <b>developed</b> <b>illness,</b> and a secondary IgM response greater than the first was detected.

Invasive metastatic disease found in the chest can be differentiated according to area as follows: pulmonary parenchyma (nodes and/or carcinomatosis lymphangitis), pleural cavity (pleural effusion and/or tumor), pericardial effusion and the thoracic wall. The appearance of pulmonary parenchymal metastases secondary to breast cancer can be further categorized into three types, neoplastic lymphangitis, multiple and single pulmonary nodes. Pleural effusion is the commonest thoracic affection in patients with this pathology. It is accepted that 46 % of patients with disseminating breast cancers will develop pleural metastases where the presentation is pericardial effusion, and possible cardiac tamponade. Finally, metastatic disease may be found localized to within the thoracic wall. Breast cancer can produce diverse problems in the thoracic wall, and local recurrence is most frequent at the mastectomy site...|$|E

Given the nature of mental illness, interactions may {{have the potential to}} uniquely impact patients. This study set out to systematically review studies reporting experiences and perceptions of patients with mental illness’ clinical interactions with medical students. This includes which factors encourage patients to interact with medical students, and if patients perceive negative and positive effects from these interactions. Method Studies reporting patient experiences of involvement in undergraduate medicineal were included. A standardized search of online databases was carried out independently by two authors and consensus reached on the inclusion of studies. Data extraction and quality assessment were also completed independently, after which a content analysis of interventions was conducted and key themes extracted. Studies were included from peer-reviewed journals, in any language. Results Eight studies from five countries were included, totaling 1088 patients. The majority of patients regard interacting with medical students as a positive experience. Patients described feeling comfortable with medical students, and the majority believes it is important for students to “see real patients”.

40|$|Background: Despite {{worsening}} {{health the}} chronically ill oldest older persons have expressed feelings of inner strength, {{which can be}} understood as resilience. The objective was to describe and compare the characteristics of resilience in two different age groups of chronically ill oldest older persons living at home and who n eeded help from home nursing care. Design: Cross-sectional design was used to describe and comp are the resilience qualities between the two age groups. Methods: The inclusion criteria were 80 years or older, living at home with chronic disease, receiving help from home nursing care, and with the capacity to be interviewed. A sample of 120 oldest older women (n = 79) and men (n = 41) separated in two age groups, aged 80 - 89 and 90 + years, participated in the study. Resilience characteristics were measured by Resilience Scale. Results: The whole group of oldest older people was vulnerable in relation to the characteristics of perseverance, self-reliance, and existential aloneness. Despite reduced physical health they reported a meaningful life, and equ animity. Even if {{there were no significant differences}} between the age groups among the oldest older persons in the characteristics of Resilience Scale (RS), in the characteristic of meaning there was a tendency of interaction between age and how much help from home nursing care the participants received.

40|$|Background: Psychiatric {{illnesses}} like {{bipolar disorder}} are increasingly {{understood to be}} neurodevelopmental disorders with clinical, psychological, and biological indicators recognizable long before {{the emergence of the}} full-blown syndromes. Methods: This paper is a selective review of findings from studies of high-risk children of affected parents that inform the knowledge of illness risk and development markers of bipolar disorder. We specifically focus on candidate clinical, biological, and psychological risk indicators that could serve as targets for future early intervention and prevention studies. Results: There is convergent evidence from prospective studies that bipolar disorder typically debuts as depressive episodes after puberty. In some high-risk children, sleep and anxiety disorders precede mood disorders by several years and reflect an increased vulnerability. An association between early exposure to adversity (eg, exposure to parental illness, neglect from mother) and increased risk of psychopathology may be mediated through increased stress reactivity evident at both behavioral and biological levels. Inter-related psychological processes including reward sensitivity, unstable self-esteem, rumination, and positive self-appraisal are risk factors for mood disorders. Disturbances in circadian rhythm and immune dysfunction are associated with mood disorders and may be vulnerability markers influenced by these other risk factors. Conclusions: There is accruing evidence of a number of measurable and potentially modifiable markers of vulnerability and <b>developing</b> <b>illness</b> in youth at familial risk for bipolar disorder. Longitudinal studies of multiple biological and psychological risk processes in high-risk offspring, both individually and together, will improve our understanding of illness onset and lead to the development of specific early interventions...|$|E
