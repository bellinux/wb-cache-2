40|$|A {{critical}} feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> Uruguay Round negotiations was <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> a new {{and more}} effective system of dealing with international trade disputes, known as the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). <b>The</b> original <b>GATT</b> dispute settlement system comprised rudimentary remnants of a more thorough framework contained in the defunct Havana Charter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Trade Organization (ITO). By <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uruguay Round negotiations in Punta del Este in 1986, the effectiveness and credibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> dispute settlement system was being very seriously questioned. The primary reason for <b>the</b> increasing lack <b>of</b> confidence in <b>the</b> system was <b>the</b> propensity <b>of</b> <b>GATT</b> contracting countries to ignore <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> Panels, resulting in a stalemate in a number of high profile trade disputes. Several trade disputes between the EU and the United States discussed were initiated under <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> dispute settlement system but remained unresolved. These disputes became increasingly acrimonious as a direct consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> system to enforce a satisfactory resolution. This paper provides an outline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> and WTO dispute settlement systems underlie several recent trade disputes. The first two sections deal with <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> system <b>of</b> settling trade disputes. The first details <b>the</b> key elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> dispute settlement system while the second considers its performance in resolving disputes.

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this article}} is to argue that the {{multilateral}} framework offered by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is preferable to alternative approaches to <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> international institutions for promoting world trade. Multilateral economic arrangements such as <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> have as their object and purpose a vision of a peaceful world. But such a vision has not been exploited to mobilize domestic and international consensus on negotiated agreements. If <b>the</b> institutional objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> is seen as a contribution to world peace, a smoothly functioning world trade regime becomes {{a means to an end}} rather than merely an end in itself. To provide operational force to this institutional objective, we examine critically the historical origins, intent, and purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> arrangement, focusing particularly on its 2 ̆ 2 peace-keeping 2 ̆ 2 goals. We argue that 2 ̆ 2 non-substantive 2 ̆ 2 concepts—such as good faith, sympathetic consideration, reasonableness, best efforts and the like which play an important and constructive role in <b>the</b> coordination <b>of</b> domestic markets—are also important in promoting the coordination and peace-keeping goals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GATT.</b> This article is organized into four parts.

40|$|By freeing Europe's {{regional}} and international trade from tariffs and other trade barriers, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has often been hailed as {{a key factor in}} promoting the post-war economic recovery in Western Europe and in preventing a return to <b>the</b> disaster <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interwar period.
