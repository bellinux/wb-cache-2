40|$|International audienceUnderstanding {{the failure}} {{mechanism}} of silicon based negative electrodes for lithium ion batteries {{is essential for}} solving the problem of low coulombic efficiency and capacity fading on cycling and to further implement this new very energetic material in commercial cells. To reach this goal, several techniques are used here: post mortem 7 Li MAS NMR and SEM, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and three-electrode-based electrochemical analysis. 7 Li MAS NMR analyses of the charged batteries demonstrate that the {{major part of the}} lithium lost during the charge of batteries is not trapped in LixSi alloys but instead at the surface of the Si particles, likely as a degradation product of the liquid electrolyte. Observed by SEM, a <b>dead</b> <b>electrode</b> has a thick "SEI" layer at its surface. EIS and incremental capacity analyses demonstrate that the growth of this layer is responsible for the failure of the electrode through a continuous decrease of its active surface area associated with a rise of the electrode polarization. It is demonstrated that the main cause of capacity fade of Si-based negative electrodes is the liquid electrolyte degradation in the case of nano Si-particles formulated with the carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder. This degradation results in the formation of a blocking layer on the active mass, which further inhibits lithium diffusion through the composite electrode...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{developed}} an electrical modulation method for attachment and detachment of microorganisms. Living microorganisms suspended in non-nutritive media such as PBS(âˆ’) and artificial seawater were attracted by and selec-tively attached to {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO) /glass electrode regions to which a negative potential was applied. The microorganisms suspended in LB medium and glucose so-lution were not attracted to the ITO <b>electrode.</b> <b>Dead</b> micro-organisms were not attracted to the ITO electrode. The living microorganisms were retrieved after detachment from the ITO electrode by application of a high-frequency trian-gular wave potential. When we applied this method to separate microorganisms from deep-sea sediment, bacteria belonging to 19 phyla and 23 classes were collected without undesirable high molecular weight contaminants such as humic acids. At the phylum and class level, respectively, 95 and 87 % of the phylotypes among electrically retrieved bacteria were common to the gene clones from the direct sediment DNA extraction. This technique is a novel useful method to prepare bacterial cells in a single population or a community for metagenomic analyses...|$|R
40|$|According to a {{continuous}} medium theory, in very thin ferroelectric films with real metallic <b>electrodes</b> (or <b>dead</b> layers near the electrodes) the domain structure reduces to sinusoidal distribution of ferroelectric polarization. Such a sinusoidal structure was considered in 1980 s for para-ferroelectric phase transition in a capacitor with <b>dead</b> layers near <b>electrode.</b> We give {{a review of}} this theory and its further development for the case of real metallic electrodes. The goal of the general theory is to consistently interpret the experimental data in very thin films with real metallic electrodes. This is illustrated on a recent experimental data for 5 - 30 nm BaTiO 3 films with SrRuO 3 /SrTiO 3 electrodes. The screening length by real metallic electrodes is very small small (< 1 A), {{but it has a}} profound effect on ferroelectric properties and its phase behavior. This general theory also allows to formulate the important open problems and show paths towards their solution. In particular, this is a problem of finding parameters of the system, which can sustain the ferroelectric memory over a desired lifetime.
