50|$|Union Fire Company, {{sometimes}} called Benjamin Franklin's Bucket Brigade, was a volunteer fire department formed in Philadelphia in 1736 {{with the assistance}} of Benjamin Franklin. It was the first <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>organization</b> in Philadelphia, although it was followed within the year by establishment of the Fellowship Fire Company. The fire company was formed on 7 December 1736 after a series of publications in the Pennsylvania Gazette by Franklin and others pointing out the need for more effective handling of fires in Philadelphia and remained active until approximately 1820.|$|E
40|$|Fire {{fighting}} {{which used}} to be performed by volunteers thanks to the efforts of citizens in the Ottoman Empire has been organized in various ways {{from the beginning of the}} 18 th century onwards, when the first <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>organization</b> was established. Fire fighting services offered by local and central governments across the world is de-centralized in Turkey, in other words conducted by local administrations. An effective fire fighting service directly affecting the safety of those who make use of this service aims to minimize the loss of lives. On the other hand, a small mistake made by fire fighters and victims jeopardizes their lives. The present study is primarily intended to investigate, in terms of “effectiveness problems”, the organization of fire fighting services over time and current methods by which fire fighting services are put into action. It also aims to study the ways related services are offered within the context of the relationship between local and central governments. “The urgent need to reform emergency response institutions” marks the basic suggestion of the study, in which several other suggestions are made to solve the problems concerning fire fighting services. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{accidents}} in The Netherlands in {{different kinds of}} industries, like fire works storage, catering and energy industry, triggered the Dutch government to start a national program to enhance the enforcement of industrial safety at the regional and municipal level. Stimulated by this program the Province of Zeeland developed its own external safety program. It explains the role external safety in major hazard control and in the co-ordination of land use planning. The pressure for land has for long been large in the Netherlands and the chance of major {{accidents in}}fluencing neighboring land has been strictly regulated. Part {{of the program is}} a feasibility study on introducing the concept of inherently safer solutions to undustry and local authorities. TNO executed a communication and exploration project for introducing this concept to the industry of Zeeland and other involved actors like licensing authorities and the regional <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>organization.</b> Part of it was a search for examples of successful implementation of the concept. Ultimate goal of the Province is to enhance solutions directed at decreasing the most prominent hazards at source {{in this part of the}} Netherlands. These hazards concern large chemical facilities, production sites with large quantities of dangerous goods, large cooling installations and propane or LPG tanks.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the fire {{protection}} program (FPP) is to provide assurance, through a defense-in-depth design, that a fire will not prevent the performance of necessary safe plant shutdown functions and will not significantly {{increase the risk of}} radioactive releases to the environment in accordance with General Design Criteria 3 and 5. The fire protection program consists of fire detection and extinguishing systems and equipment, administrative controls and procedures, and trained personnel. The CMEB review of the fire protection program includes a review of the evaluation of potential fire hazards described in the applicant's Safety Analysis Report (SAR), and a review of the description of the fire protection system design showing the system characteristics and layout which define the 'fire prevention" and "fire protection " portions of the program.

50|$|In contrast, Janice Harper {{suggests}} that workplace mobbing is typically found in organizations {{where there is}} limited opportunity for employees to exit, whether through tenure systems or contracts that {{make it difficult to}} terminate an employee (such as universities or unionized organizations), and/or where finding comparable work in the same community makes it difficult for the employee to voluntarily leave (such as academic positions, religious institutions, or military). In these employments, efforts to eliminate the worker will intensify to push the worker out against his or her will through shunning, sabotage, false accusations and a series of investigations and poor reviews. Another form of employment where workers are mobbed are those that require the use of uniforms or other markers of group inclusion (law enforcement, <b>fire</b> <b>fighting,</b> military), <b>organizations</b> where a single gender has predominated, but the other gender is beginning to enter (STEM fields, <b>fire</b> <b>fighting,</b> military, nursing, teaching, and construction). Finally, she {{suggests that}} organizations where there are limited opportunities for advancement can be prone to mobbing because those who do advance are more likely to view challenges to their leadership as threats to their precarious positions. Harper further challenges the idea that workers are targeted for their exceptional competence. In some cases, she suggests, exceptional workers are mobbed because they are viewed as threatening to someone, but some workers who are mobbed are not necessarily good workers. Rather, Harper contends, some mobbing targets are outcasts or unproductive workers who cannot easily be terminated, and are thus treated inhumanely to push them out. While Harper emphasizes the cruelty and damaging consequences of mobbing, her organizational analysis focuses on the structural, rather than moral, nature of the organization. Moreover, she views the behavior itself, which she terms workplace aggression, as grounded in group psychology, rather than individual psychosis—even when the mobbing is initiated due to a leader's personal psychosis, the dynamics of group aggression will transform the leader's bullying into group mobbing—two vastly distinct psychological and social phenomena.|$|R
40|$|Background:   Elevator-related {{accidents}} are uncommon, but can cause significant injury. However, little data exist on {{these types of}} accidents. To compile and analyze accident data involving elevators {{in an effort to}} eliminate or at least significantly reduce such accidents. Methods: In this retrospective study we investigated 1, 819 cases of elevator-related accidents during a four-year period (1999 - 2003) in Tehran. The data were obtained from the Tehran Safety Services & <b>Fire</b> <b>Fighting</b> <b>Organization</b> (TSFO) that is officially and solely responsible to conduct rescue missions of civilians in Tehran. Results: The number of elevator accidents has increased steadily during the four year study period. During these four years here was a positive upward trend for serious injuries and mortality resulting from elevator accidents. Technical problems were the main cause with 74. 5 %, followed by power loss and overcapacity riding with 11. 5 % and 7. 9 %respectively. Sixty-three individuals sustained serious injury and 15 people {{died as a result of}} elevator accidents. The number of accidents was significantly higher in summer (x 2 = 18. 32, P= 0. 032) and a considerable proportion of incidences (54 %, 947 cases out of 1819) occurred between 5 and 12 pm.
