25|$|Other {{branches}} of physics also received attention {{during the period}} of the Scientific revolution. William Gilbert, court physician to Queen Elizabeth I, published an important work on magnetism in 1600, describing how the earth itself behaves like a <b>giant</b> <b>magnet.</b> Robert Boyle (1627–91) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated the gas law named for him; he also contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry. Another important factor in the scientific revolution was the rise of learned societies and academies in various countries. The earliest of these were in Italy and Germany and were short-lived. More influential were the Royal Society of England (1660) and the Academy of Sciences in France (1666). The former was a private institution in London and included such scientists as John Wallis, William Brouncker, Thomas Sydenham, John Mayow, and Christopher Wren (who contributed not only to architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in Paris, was a government institution and included as a foreign member the Dutchman Huygens. In the 18th century, important royal academies were established at Berlin (1700) and at St. Petersburg (1724). The societies and academies provided the principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific results during and after the scientific revolution. In 1690, James Bernoulli showed that the cycloid is the solution to the tautochrone problem; and the following year, in 1691, Johann Bernoulli showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will form a catenary, the curve with the lowest possible center of gravity available to any chain hung between two fixed points. He then showed, in 1696, that the cycloid is the solution to the brachistochrone problem.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{properties}} of the <b>giant</b> Keplerate molecular <b>magnet</b> Mo 72 Fe 30, as a function of applied magnetic field, using the correlator product state (CPS) tensor network ansatz. The magnet is modeled with an S = 5 / 2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the 30 -site icosidodecahedron lattice, a model for which exact diagonalization is infeasible. The CPS ansatz produces significant improvements in variational energies relative to previous studies using the density matrix renormalization group, a result of its superior ability to handle strong correlation in two dimensional spin systems. The CPS results reaffirm that the ground state energies adhere qualitatively to the parabolic progression of the rotational band model (RBM), but show important deviations near 1 / 3 of the saturation field. These deviations predict anomalous behavior in the differential magnetization and heat capacity that cannot be explained by the RBM alone. Finally, we show that these energetic deviations originate from a qualitative change in the ground state that resembles a finite size analogue of a phase transition.

He tries desperately to get it open, but nothing works. Eventually two business men come by and try to help him out, but to no avail. This gathers the attention of many passers-by who begin to congregate and watch the action. Several people (including a strong man, a repair man and a police officer) try to open the door but it remains stuck. Eventually a firefighter tries to break open the glass roof of the phone booth when the phone booth company appears. They unbolt the booth and take the booth (with the man inside it) away on their truck. The crowd cheers and gladly waves the man away. The man watches frantically as he is carted across town. He tries to scream for help from people, but everyone just smiles and waves. Eventually the truck stops next to another truck also carrying a man stuck in a phone booth. The two men try to communicate but cannot. After many hours the truck arrives at a massive underground warehouse. The phone booth is lifted up in the air by a <b>giant</b> <b>magnet</b> and the truck drives away.

40|$|The ARES Directorate at JSC has {{researched}} the physical processes that create planetary magnetic fields through dynamo action since 2007.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{a neglected}} {{area in the}} history of the physical sciences [...] the history of the study of magnetism. Examining the study of magnetism and terrestrial magnetism in Great Britain from the 1750 s to the 1830 s allows for discussing the changing motives, methods, and results of magnetic and geomagnetic studies. The changes in magnetic studies are comparable to dramatic transformations in other areas of experimental physics, including the studies of heat, light, and electricity;With the publication of De Magnete, William Gilbert intimately linked the earth 2 ̆ 7 s magnetism to magnetism by arguing the earth was a <b>giant</b> <b>magnet.</b> Though subsequent Cartesian theories assumed the circulation of a material magnetic fluid, they retained the Gilbertian notion that the earth and ordinary magnets had the same causes. Because the analogy persisted into the nineteenth century, theories of magnetism and terrestrial magnetism were frequently discussed together;The impetus for collecting geomagnetic data changed between 1750 and 1835. Around 1800, the discovery of ship magnetism lent important practical reasons for understanding magnetism. As well, magnetic collecting took on new importance with renewed Arctic exploration in 1818. Tracing the changing motives behind and methods of collecting magnetic data reveals its shifting practical, scientific, and symbolic importance;Mystery and confusion surrounded the study of magnetism from 1750 to 1790. While important, the study of magnetism was much less studied than electricity. Though most endorsed circulating fluid theories, there was little consensus regarding the causes of terrestrial magnetism. In the meantime, many speculated that unifying principles, such as Newton 2 ̆ 7 s ether, linked all phenomena together;From 1780 to 1820, mathematical and quantitative imponderable fluid theories of Aepinus and Coulomb displaced the qualitative circulating fluid theories. In Britain, John Robison and several others made known Aepinian theory. Scottish methodology and Laplacian science played vital roles in changing the face of British experimental physics;Between 1820 and 1840, magnetic theories changed with the discovery of electromagnetism and subsequent flood of experimentation. Challenges to Laplacian orthodoxy supposed that magnetism, electricity, heat, light, chemical action, and rotation were intimately connected. Meanwhile, the Humboldtian-cosmical approach altered the understanding of geomagnetism as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{magnetosphere}} is a 400 year old science {{that began with the}} publication by Gilbert, in 1600, of his hypotheses that the Earth was a <b>giant</b> <b>magnet.</b> Since then we have learned many things about the magnetosphere, particularly in the last 40 years of the space age, but we still have many unanswered questions. In spite of the many thousands of observations of this system we still lack a global understanding of how it works. This is due to its large size and tenuous nature that mean that any measurement made of the fields or particles involved only give one a knowledge of the local conditions at a given time. To gain a global perspective through such observations would require the simultaneous operation of thousands of satellites spread throughout the magnetospheric system in addition to observations made on the ground. Such a program would be impractical at least from financial considerations. What is needed for the advancement of magnetospheric physics is to develop the same capabilities that astrophysicists, solar physicists and meteorologists have been using for years [...] - the ability to stand back from the object under study and see it in its entirety. The challenge for doing this for the magnetosphere is that the particle densities are very low and the material is, for the most part, not luminous. In the last 25 years several ideas have been proposed that would allow at least the imaging of certain portions of the magnetosphere. These include imaging of the plasmasphere through the resonant scattering of solar 304 A from He+ ions, imaging of various hot plasma populations (i. e. the ring current, plasmasheet, upflowing ionospheric ions, etc.) from the neutral atoms that result when ions of these populations charge exchange with the hydrogen geocorona, and imaging the aurora at various wavelengths in the far ultraviolet. In addition, a novel technique for probing various boundaries in the magnetosphere by bouncing low frequency radio waves off of them has been extensively studied. Such a technique is analogous to the way the under water world can be probed with sonar. About five years ago NASA convened a science working group to study the possibility of flying a magnetospheric imaging mission. This resulted in a number of proposals for such a mission, one of which was selected to be the first MIDEX mission, to be launched in early 2000. The mission is called IMAGE (Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration) and its P. I. is J. Burch at SwRI. The IMAGE spacecraft will carry imagers to view the plasmasphere, aurora, ring current, inner plasmasheet, and upflowing ionospheric ions as well as a radio sounder to probe the location, shape and dynamics of the magnetopause, plasmapause, etc. Between its selection last April and the non advocacy mission review, which takes place next spring, the IMAGE teams needs to further refine the design of the mission and its instruments. The theory and modeling (T&M) subgroup of this team has the task of demonstrating what kind of images the instruments on IMAGE will see as well as showing that useful scientific information can be extracted from such images. As a central element to the efforts of the T&M subgroup we have decided to simulate and create synthetic images for the magnetic cloud event of October, 1995. In this event a large cloud, with high plasma densities and strong magnetic fields, ejected from the sun collided with the earth's magnetosphere triggering a three day period of intense magnetic storms and substorms. This event was observed from a number of different spacecraft and on the ground so we have a good data set to work with. In our work we will place the IMAGE spacecraft in the magnetosphere on its proposed orbit, with its proposed instruments, to see what it would see had it been there. Existing models of the plasmasphere, ring current and magnetopause will be run for this event to give the structures for the imaging instruments. There are several models which are lacking and which need to be developed. These include a model for the cusp, the inner plasmasheet and the upflowing ions. My task this summer was to develop the upflowing ion model and use it to create synthetic images...|$|E
