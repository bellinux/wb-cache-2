40|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} are {{a diverse}} set of plant compounds {{believed to have}} numerous functions in plant–environment interactions. The large chemical diversity of secondary metabolites undoubtedly arises from an equally diverse set of enzymes responsible for their biosynthesis. However, {{little is known about}} the evolution of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism. We are studying the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, a large group of secondary metabolites, in Arabidopsis to investigate the evolution of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism. Arabidopsis contains natural variations in the presence of methylsulfinylalkyl, alkenyl, and <b>hydroxyalkyl</b> glucosinolates. In this article, we report the identification of genes encoding two 2 -oxoglutarate–dependent dioxygenases that are responsible for this variation. These genes, AOP 2 and AOP 3, which map to the same position on chromosome IV, result from an apparent gene duplication and control the conversion of methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolate to either the alkenyl or the <b>hydroxyalkyl</b> form. By heterologous expression in Escherichia and the correlation of gene expression patterns to the glucosinolate phenotype, we show that AOP 2 catalyzes the conversion of methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates to alkenyl glucosinolates. Conversely, AOP 3 directs the formation of <b>hydroxyalkyl</b> glucosinolates from methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates. No ecotype coexpressed both genes. Furthermore, the absence of functional AOP 2 and AOP 3 leads to the accumulation of the precursor methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{influence}} of molecular structure (branched vs linear) on product {{formation in the}} heterogeneous oxidation of unsaturated organic aerosol is investigated. Particle phase product isomers formed from the reaction of squalene (C 30 H 50, a branched alkene with six CC double bonds) and linolenic acid (C 18 H 30 O 2, a linear carboxylic acid with three CC double bonds) with OH radicals are identified and quantified using two-dimensional gas chromatography−mass spectrometry. The reactions are measured at low and high [O 2] (∼ 1 % vs 10 % [O 2]) to understand the roles of <b>hydroxyalkyl</b> and hydroxyperoxy radical intermediates in product formation. A key reaction step is OH addition to a CC double bond to form a <b>hydroxyalkyl</b> radical. In addition, allylic alkyl radicals, formed from H atom abstraction reactions by <b>hydroxyalkyl</b> or OH radicals play important roles in the chemistry of product formation. Functionalization products dominate the squalene reaction at ∼ 1 % [O 2], with the total abundance of observed functionalization products being approximately equal to the fragmentation products at 10 % [O 2]. The large abundance of squalene fragmentation products at 10 % [O 2] is attributed to the formation and dissociation of tertiary hydroxyalkoxy radical intermediates. For linolenic acid aerosol, the formation of functionalization products dominates the reaction at both ∼ 1 % and 10 % [O 2], suggesting that the formation and dissociation of secondary hydroxyalkoxy radicals are minor reaction channels for linear molecules.
