Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the sexual acts, they return to the car.|$|E

50|$|Platypus apicalis {{can be a}} pest in {{high quality}} timber plantations. It vetors fungi that develop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> {{altering}} its colour.

Two or three of the colonists instantly followed, and a moment later three or four Indians who had been lying on the ground leaped up and darted like phantoms <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood.</b>|$|R

They heard the loud words of Maenck as he ordered his three remaining men <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> on foot. As he advanced, Barney looked to the magazine of his carbine and the cylinder of his revolver.|$|R

5|$|A month later, Jennifer is {{beginning}} to look pale, so she accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E
5|$|Although Montcalm {{and other}} French {{officers}} attempted to stop further attacks, others did not, and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British. At this point, the column dissolved, as some {{tried to escape}} the Indian onslaught, while others actively tried to defend themselves. Massachusetts Colonel Joseph Frye reported that he was stripped of much of his clothing and repeatedly threatened. He fled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> and did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August.|$|E

5|$|During the night, {{three of}} the militia's horses wandered off; the next day, June 25, three men {{went in search of}} the animals while the rest stayed behind. At the cabin, seven Native American braves {{appeared}} in the distance. The troops immediately began pursuing the natives, who fled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> instead of reporting the sighting to Dement. The Native American warriors, as had been done other times {{during the course of the}} war, set an ambush for the militia men in the forest. The militia pursued the natives <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and, as they entered the forest, the natives opened fire, the volley instantly killed two militia men and wounded another. The militia retreated and formed a battle line but the native forces would not relent. The rest of Dement's company attempted to rescue the outmatched militia men but were unable to beat back the native warriors. Black Hawk's band attacked the militia men, again forcing the beleaguered force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn.|$|E
5|$|Father Sébastien Rale {{was widely}} {{suspected}} of inciting the Norridgewock tribe against the New Englanders, and Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley {{put a price}} on his head. In the winter of 1705, 275 British soldiers under the command of Colonel Winthrop Hilton were dispatched to seize Rale and sack the village. The priest was warned in time, however, and escaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> with his papers, but the militia burned the village and church.|$|E

60|$|And {{then quickly}} {{he turned his}} horse, and without giving the beast time to steady himself he rammed him at the fence. The leap out of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> field was difficult, but that back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> was still worse. The up-jump was higher, and the ditch which must be first cleared was broader. Nor did he take it at the easiest part {{as he had done}} on that day when he rode his own horse and then Graham's back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood.</b> But he pressed his animal exactly at the spot from which his rival had fallen. There were still the marks of the beast's struggle, as he endeavoured to save himself before he came down, head foremost, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ditch. The bank had been {{somewhat}} narrowed and pared away, and it was clearly the last place in the face of <b>the</b> whole opening <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> which a rider with his senses about him would have selected for his jump.|$|R
