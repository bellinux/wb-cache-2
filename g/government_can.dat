5|$|The Brander–Spencer {{model is}} an {{economic}} model in international trade originally developed by James Brander and Barbara Spencer in the early 1980s. The model illustrates a situation where, under certain assumptions, a <b>government</b> <b>can</b> subsidize domestic firms to help them in their competition against foreign producers {{and in doing so}} enhances national welfare. This conclusion stands in contrast to results from most international trade models, in which government non-interference is socially optimal.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Assembly has the {{authority}} to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation known as Acts of the Assembly in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh <b>Government</b> <b>can</b> then also enact more specific secondary legislation.|$|E

Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become Acts of the Scottish Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Canada is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, {{these may be}} grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal <b>government</b> <b>can</b> initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made {{by the federal government}} to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which <b>government</b> <b>can</b> censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E

5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the <b>government</b> <b>can</b> censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E
5|$|The investigation, {{which was}} {{launched}} in January 2015, also aims to determine whether bearer bonds were provided as investment vehicles to UBS clients before the expiration of its 2009 deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The agreement lapsed in October 2010. Should UBS have violated the agreement, the federal <b>government</b> <b>can</b> make new allegations against UBS on charges stemming from the violation. In such a case, prosecutors would likely ask for significant fines and for UBS to be put under regulatory oversight.|$|E
5|$|The king is {{the head}} of state and {{commander-in-chief}} of the army. He can declare war and peace, ratify laws and treaties, convene and close legislative sessions, call and postpone elections, dismiss the government and dissolve the parliament. The appointed <b>government</b> <b>can</b> also be dismissed through a majority vote of no confidence by the elected House of Representatives. After a bill is proposed by the government, it must be approved by the House of Representatives then the Senate, and becomes law after being ratified by the king. A royal veto on legislation can be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses. The parliament also has the right of interpellation.|$|E

5|$|During his {{campaign}} and presidency, President George W. Bush endorsed {{the idea of}} background checks at gun shows. Bush's position was that the gun show loophole should be closed by federal legislation since the gun show loophole was created by previous federal legislation. President Bush ordered {{an investigation by the}} U.S. Departments of Health, Education, and Justice {{in the wake of the}} Virginia Tech shootings in order to make recommendations on ways the federal <b>government</b> <b>can</b> prevent such tragedies. On January 8, 2008 he signed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) into law. Goals and objectives that the NIAA sought to address included: The gap in information available to NICS about such prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments. Filling these information gaps will better enable the system to operate as intended, to keep guns out of the hands of persons prohibited by federal or state law from receiving or possessing firearms.|$|E
5|$|Rights of {{a person}} arrested under {{ordinary}} circumstances is laid down in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The rights {{of a person}} arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the Preventive Detention Act. Under preventive detention, the <b>government</b> <b>can</b> imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Parliament holds {{legislative}} power {{and consists of}} the Queen and the House of Representatives. It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950. The supremacy of Parliament, over the Crown and other government institutions, was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand. The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition {{with the majority of}} seats. If no majority is formed, a minority <b>government</b> <b>can</b> be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured. The Governor-General appoints ministers under advice from the Prime Minister, who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition. Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the Prime Minister, is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions. Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively, and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions.|$|E
5|$|The law {{governing}} aviation in the UK {{is defined}} by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which is updated periodically with amendments, the latest being the Civil Aviation Act 2006. The government department responsible for legislating changes in national policy and long term strategy relating to aviation is the Department for Transport (DfT). At the operational level the independently run Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulates economic, safety, and consumer protection aspects, as well as airspace policy, although these responsibilities are being increasingly ceded to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). International aspects of air transport are regulated by agreements made within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as established by the Chicago Convention, whilst most new legislation is now made at the European level through the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). As a consequence, other than in airport development, there are few aspects of the air transport industry in which the <b>government</b> <b>can</b> act in isolation.|$|E

40|$|By definition, {{government}} regulation of economic behaviour seeks to achieve outcomes {{that would not}} be achieved by a purely private system. However, there are many different channels through which <b>governments</b> <b>can</b> affect the economic behaviour of the private sector. At one extreme, <b>governments</b> <b>can</b> simply try to overrule market forces entirely by declaring that certain actions will (or will not) be taken. There are, however, more sophisticated methods that attempt to work through market forces rather than simply trying to put administrative directives in place of market forces. How <b>governments</b> <b>can</b> influence economic behaviour A classic set of government channels of influence is provided by Murray Weidenbaum. In addition to traditional {{government regulation}}, the channels include: • Government payrolls • Government purchases • Transfer payment...|$|R
