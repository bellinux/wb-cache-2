40|$|Abstract—TerraSAR-X {{is a high}} {{resolution}} synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite launched in June 2007. Its active phased array X-Band antenna hosts 384 transmit/receive modules con-trolling the beam steering in azimuth and elevation direction. Precise modelling of the antenna is only possible if the actual characteristics of each individual transmit/receive module are known. A calibration network records the <b>internal</b> <b>instrument</b> behaviour characterising the instrument stability over time. The antenna performance can be monitored with an innovative char-acterisation mode based on the so-called PN Gating method.
