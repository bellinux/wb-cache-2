40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{inequality}} of experience of dental caries, based on race/ethnicity, among Brazilian adolescents aged 15 to 19 years in 2010 and test whether socioeconomic indicators fully explain ethnic differences in dental caries. Data from a National Oral Health Survey conducted in Brazil in 2010 was analysed. Race/ethnicity was self-assigned and modified to White, African <b>descents,</b> East Asian <b>descents,</b> Mixed Race and Indigenous <b>descents.</b> The prevalence of caries experience by race/ethnic group in 2010 (n = 5, 367) was calculated. Further analysis included conceptual hierarchical modelling and mediation analysis. Caries experience was 76. 9 % in 15 to 19 year old Brazilians in 2010. While African <b>descents</b> were 32 % more likely to have caries experience than Whites, Mixed Race were 69 % more likely to have caries experience than Whites. Hierarchical conceptual modelling analysis confirmed the highly significant association between caries and race/ethnicity. Mixed Race and East Asian <b>descents</b> were 1. 44 (95 % CI 1. 24 - 1. 67) and 1. 81 (95 % CI 1. 02 - 3. 20) times more likely to experience caries than Whites after adjusting for age, sex, education and income. The difference in the likelihood of experiencing caries between Whites and African <b>descents</b> was not statistically significant after adjusting for years of education and family income. The results of mediation analysis confirmed that inequality of caries experience between Whites and Mixed Race and East Asian <b>descents</b> was mediated through education and income. The likelihood that Mixed Race and East Asian <b>descents</b> would experience caries compared to Whites was attenuated, by 14. 8 % and by 9. 5 % respectively, after adjusting for years of education and income. Data analysis demonstrated that Whites have benefited more from the significant reduction in dental caries experience in 15 to 19 year old Brazilians, as compared to African <b>descents</b> and Mixed Race. Education and income fully explained ethnic inequalities in experience of dental caries between Whites and African <b>descents,</b> and largely explained inequalities between Whites and Mixed Race...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently, Bouvel and Pergola {{initiated}} {{the study of}} a special class of permutations, minimal permutations with a given number of <b>descents,</b> which arise from the whole genome duplication–random loss model of genome rearrangement. In this paper, we show {{that the number of}} minimal permutations of length 2 d− 1 with d <b>descents</b> is given by 2 d− 3 (d− 1) cd, where cd is the d-th Catalan number. For fixed n, we also derive a recurrence relation on the multivariate generating function for the number of minimal permutations of length n counted by the number of <b>descents,</b> and the values of the first and second elements of the permutation. For fixed d, {{on the basis of this}} recurrence relation, we obtain a recurrence relation on the multivariate generating function for the number of minimal permutations of length n with n−d <b>descents,</b> counted by the length, and the values of the first and second elements of the permutation. As a consequence, the explicit generating functions for the numbers of minimal permutations of length n with n−d <b>descents</b> are obtained for d≤ 5. Furthermore, we show that for fixed d≥ 1, there exists a constant ad such that the number of minimal permutations of length n with n−d <b>descents</b> is asymptotically equivalent to addn, as n→∞...|$|R

The Mac OS version was ported by programmer Duane Johnson, who previously worked on the 3dfx versions of the original <b>Descent</b> and <b>Descent</b> II. In the United States, the game only sold 52,294 copies by April 2000. <b>Descent</b> 3 was also ported to Linux platforms by Loki Entertainment Software after {{an agreement with the}} game's publisher. The port, which features a multiplayer mode optimized for 16 players, was released in July 2000. In 2014, the game was made available on the Steam digital distribution service.|$|E

These photos would later be included in the game so that players could use them as their multiplayer profiles. Outrage also released two game demos that allowed customers to try the game before purchasing it. The second demo included a single-player level and several multiplayer matches which could be played through a matchmaking service provided by Outrage. From March to August 1999, Interplay also held a <b>Descent</b> 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players could compete against each other in multiplayer matches.
