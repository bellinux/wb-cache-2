A wide variation in the biochemical properties was observed among the STEC, with 14 distinct biotypes identified. Biotype 1 was the most common, found in 29 % of the strains. <b>Enterohaemolysin</b> production was detected in 29 % of the strains. Most of the bacterial strains (95 %) carried one or more plasmids and considerable heterogeneity in size and combinations was observed. Seven distinct plasmid profiles were identified. The most common profile, characterised {{by the presence of}} a single plasmid of ~ 90 kb, was found in 50 % of these strains. These data indicate extensive diversity among STEC strains.

STEC was recovered from 126 (15. 3 %) cattle, 135 (11. 3 %) pigs, 135 (66. 8 %) sheep, 31 (73. 8 %) goats, 4 (1 %) chicken, and 15 (1. 6 %) food samples. Of all STEC isolates, 21. 5, 25. 8 and 15 % produced <b>enterohaemolysin,</b> alpha-haemolysin, and aerobactin respectively, 1. 6 % displayed localized adherence (LA) to HEp- 2 cells, 27. 6 % were sorbitol negative, and 30 % were resistant to antibiotics. Only 14 (3. 1 %) of the STEC isolates belonged to human infection-associated serogroups (O 26, O 55, O 111, O 128 and 0157), designated as enterohaemorrhagic E. coil (EHEC). This study revealed that STEC are prevalent in domestic animals, {{and to a lesser extent}} in food of animal origin in Serbia, but the absence of a EHEC phenotypic profile (characteristic serogroup, LA, <b>enterohaemolysin</b> production) in most animal STEC strains may explain the low incidence of human STEC infection in this part of the world...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and its characteristics were determined among hospitalized patients with diarrhoea {{and children with}} diarrhoea in an urban slum community of Dhaka city using sensitive culture and PCR methods. Stool samples were collected from 410 patients with diarrhoea enrolled in the 2 % surveillance system (every 50 th patient attending the hospital with diarrhoeal disease is included) at the ICDDR,B hospital and from 160 children of 2 â€“ 5 years of age with diarrhoea living in an urban slum in Dhaka, between September 2004 and April 2005. Shiga toxin genes (stx) were detected by multiplex PCR in the enrichment broth of nine samples (2. 2 %) from hospitalized patients and 11 samples (6. 9 %) from the community patients. STEC was isolated from five stool samples with positive PCR results using a colony patch technique. All five isolates were positive in the Vero cell assay and PCR fragments of stx genes were confirmed by sequencing. Two isolates were positive for the E. coli attaching-and-effacing (eae) gene and four were positive for the <b>enterohaemolysin</b> (hlyEHEC) gene and <b>enterohaemolysin</b> production.

40|$|Typical and {{atypical}} enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) {{are considered}} important bacterial causes of diarrhoea. Considering the repertoire of virulence genes, atypical EPEC (aEPEC) is a heterogeneous group, harbouring genes {{that are found}} in other diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes, such as those encoding haemolysins. Haemolysins are cytolytic toxins that lyse host cells disrupting {{the function of the}} plasma membrane. In addition, these cytolysins mediate a connection to vascular tissue and/or blood components, such as plasma and cellular fibronectin. Therefore, we investigated the haemolytic activity of 72 aEPEC isolates and determined the correlation of this phenotype with the presence of genes encoding <b>enterohaemolysins</b> (Ehly) and cytolysin A (ClyA). In addition, the correlation between the expression of haemolysins and the ability of these secreted proteins to adhere to extracellular matrix (ECM) components was also assessed in this study. Our findings demonstrate that a subset of aEPEC presents haemolytic activity due to the expression of Ehlys and/or ClyA and that this activity is closely related to the ability of these isolates to bind to ECM components...|$|R

40|$|Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is an {{important}} foodborne pathogen associated with both outbreaks and sporadic cases of human disease, ranging from uncomplicated diarrhoea to haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). STEC affects children, elderly and immuno-compromised patients. STEC is capable of producing Shiga toxin type 1 (Stx 1), type 2 (Stx 2) or both, encoded by stx 1 and stx 2 genes, respectively. These strains are likely to produce putative accessory virulence factors such as intimin (encoded by eae), an <b>enterohaemolysin</b> (EhxA) and an autoagglutinating protein commonly associated with eae-negative strains (Saa), both encoded by an enterohaemorrhagic plasmid. Several studies have confirmed that cattle are the principal reservoir of STEC (O 157 and non-O 157 :H 7 serotypes) {{and many of these}} serotypes have been involved in HUS and HC outbreaks in other countries. Transmission of STEC to humans occurs through the consumption of undercooked meat, vegetables and water contaminated by faeces of carriers and by person-to-person contact.

A clonal relationship was demonstrated for each outbreak according to serotype, plasmid profiling, ribotyping, and MLST. In addition, isolates demonstrated highly similar virulence profiles, as all isolates were positive for F 11 pili and possessed genes encoding aerobactin (iucD), increased serum survival (iss), temperature-sensitive hemagglutatin (tsh) and colicin V plasmid operon genes (cva/cvi). However, only 20 % of the isolates produced colicin V and 42 % exhibited serum resistance. All strains with O group O 111 {{and a single}} O 18 ac strain (demonstrating non-clonal DNA profiles) were positive for enteroaggregative heat stabile toxin (EAST 1), while isolates of a single outbreak all possessed the enteroaggreative toxin gene (astA).

40|$|BACKGROUND 				 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli or Vero cytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) are characterised by {{the ability}} to produce either one or both cytotoxins {{referred}} to as Shiga toxin 1 (Stx 1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx 2). VTEC infection may result in life-threatening conditions such as haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Due to different methods of monitoring and identification of these bacteria in recent years, the existing data on reported cases of VTEC infections probably do not reflect reality. Our study of VTEC strains isolated in different regions of Slovenia, showed serogroups, major virulence factors and specific epidemiological data that {{can serve as a}} basis for further laboratory and epidemiological surveillance of VTEC infections. METHODS A total of 66 VTEC strains, isolated from stool samples of patients with diarrhoea from the year 1993 to 2009, were collected at NIPH (National Institute of Public Health). The data of patientâ€™s age and gender, onset of illness and clinical manifestation of disease were gathered. The serogroups of isolated strains were determined with antisera following manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The ability to produce verocytotoxins was tested using the reversed passive latex agglutination method. The presence of genes for intimin (eae), <b>enterohaemolysin</b> (ehxA) and verotoxins (vtx 1 and vtx 2) were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS Infection with VTEC was encountered throughout the year, but most people were ill in the summer and autumn months. More than half of patients (57. 6 %) were younger than five years. Collected VTEC strains belonged to serogroups O 17, O 26, O 91, O 103, O 111, O 113, O 126, O 128, O 145, O 148 and O 157 (the most frequent were O 157 and O 26). A high percentage of VTEC strains showed the presence of intimin (86. 4 %) and <b>enterohaemolysin</b> (86. 4 %) genes. The gene for vtx 1 was found in 22. 7 % of strains, the vtx 2 in 57. 6 % of strains, while the presence of both genes was determined in 19. 7 % of strains. The presence of the vtx 2 gene was determined in all strains associated with HUS and TTP, most of them possessed the eae and ehxA genes too. These patients were mostly older people and young children. CONCLUSIONS Most infections with VTEC occurred in the warmer months of the year, most patient were small children. The severity of VTEC infection is determined by several factors such as the E. coli serogroup, the type of Shiga toxin produced and presence of other virulence genes. The most common serogroups among the study strains were O 157 and O 26. VTEC O 26 has been the most commonly isolated serogroup in recent years, nevertheless more and more different serological groups began to emerge. In all strains associated with HUS and TTP, the vtx 2 gene was determined. Further typing of verocytotoxin encoding genes will contribute to assess the risk for complications with VTEC infection. The study provides insights about the age of the patients, seasonal distribution of disease, serogroups and genotypes of the agent...|$|E

In particular, the O 26 serogroup is able to cause a large spectrum of illnesses in humans which have a significant public health impact as they may range from haemorrhagic colitis (HC) to haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). It is known that VTEC organisms are associated with animal reservoirs, i. e. ruminants, and foods of animal origin, especially undercooked meat and raw milk, are often involved in outbreaks. In this study, 250 minced beef samples collected at retail outlets in southern Italy were tested for the presence of E. coli O 26 and the isolates were characterized and studied for their antimicrobial resistance properties. Three minced beef samples (1. 2 %) tested positive for E. coli O 26; one isolate per positive sample was characterized. One isolate harboured the genes encoding for virulence factors intimin (eaeA) and <b>enterohaemolysin</b> (hlyA), while none presented verocytotoxin-encoding genes (stx 1 and stx 2) and all were negative at the verotoxicity assay. All the isolates showed resistance properties to at least four antimicrobial agents tested and two were multi-drug resistant (MDR).

The study was carried out to investigate the occurrence of EPEC as a cause of infectious diarrhoea in children younger than 2 years of age and characterize their virulence genes. Materials and Methods: During the study period, a total of 656 faecal specimens from children with diarrhoea and 54 from healthy children were analyzed. E. coli isolates were serotypically identified with EPEC polyvalent and monovalent antisera. The isolated EPEC were examined for the presence of the attaching and effacing (eaeA), bundle-forming pilus (bfpA), Shiga like toxins (stx 1 and stx 2), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli <b>enterohaemolysin</b> (EHEC hlyA) and EPEC adherence factor (EAF) genes by the PCR assay. Results: The study has shown that 22 (3. 4 %) had diarrhoea due to EPEC, while no EPEC isolates were detected in asymptomatic children. The highest number of the EPEC isolated belonging to polyvalent 2. The primers encoding virulence genes were subjected to all the EPEC isolates. Only 9. 1 %, 27. 3 %, and 9. 1 % isolates gave positive re sults with intimin (eaeA), bfbA and (EAF) genes, respectively. None of the isolates were positive for stx 1, stx 2, and hlyA genes. Typical EPEC (eaeA +, bfpA +) was diagnosed in two isolates, while, atypical EPEC was manifested in four isolates. Conclusions: According to the results, the frequency of EPEC isolates in Najaf was lower than what has been suspected and the investigation including the use of molecular technique and serotyping, are necessary to allow precise identification and epidemiological study of these pathogens...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} whether 17 Escherichia coli O 157 :H 8 strains isolated from patients with diarrhoea in the United Kingdom were putative pathogens. METHODS: The strains had been isolated {{by the use}} of O 157 antiserum, available for the detection of Vero cytotoxin (VT) producing strains of E coli O 157 that are usually of flagellar (H) type 7, but may also be non-motile. The strains were examined for VT production, for their ability to adhere to HEp- 2 cells, and for hybridisation with several DNA probes that recognise pathogenic properties of E coli. Their ability to ferment sorbitol and to produce beta-glucuronidase was also investigated, as these tests are used to discriminate VT positive O 157 strains. RESULTS: The O 157 :H 8 strains did not produce VT. All gave localised attachment to HEp- 2 cells, associated with a positive fluorescence-actin staining test, and all hybridised with the E coli attaching and effacing (eae) probe. In addition to the difference in VT production, O 157 :H 8 strains could be distinguished from VT positive O 157 strains by their beta-glucuronidase activity, their failure to produce <b>enterohaemolysin,</b> and their lack of hybridisation with the CVD 419 probe derived from a plasmid in an O 157 :H 7 strain. CONCLUSIONS: The 0157 :H 8 strains had in vitro properties characteristic of the class of E coli that causes attaching and effacing lesions in epithelial intestinal cells. They may therefore be considered a putative cause of diarrhoea but their prevalence remains to be established. Several O 157 :H 8 strains failed to ferment sorbitol in agar plates and therefore could be misidentified as VT positive O 157 strains.

In addition, the production of Shiga toxin (Stx), cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) -V and EHEC haemolysin (EHEC-Hly) was studied, and the phage type (PT) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types were determined. All nine isolates carried eae-Î³, efa 1, EHEC-hlyA, etpD, sfpA and fliC; eight also harboured the cdt-V gene cluster and five were positive for stx 2. None of the isolates harboured stx 1, stx 2 c, stx 2 d, stx 2 e, katP or espP. All isolates harbouring the corresponding genes also produced Stx 2 and CDT-V in titres ranging from 1 : 32 to 1 : 128 and from 1 : 2 to 1 : 4, respectively. None of the isolates expressed EHEC-Hly on <b>enterohaemolysin</b> agar. Seven isolates belonged to PT 88 and two had a PT 88 variant pattern. Seven isolates showed a close genetic relationship, with a PFGE similarity index (SI) of 92 â€“ 98 %. Two isolates, temporally the first and last, obtained 5 years apart, were the most divergent (SI of 71 %and 85 %, respectively). The study demonstrated that SF E. coli O 157 :Hâˆ’ isolates from Finland are closely related and show {{a close relationship with}} SF E. coli O 157 strains isolated in Germany. This finding suggests a clonality of SF E. coli O 157 :Hâˆ’ isolates from different geographical regions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is an {{important}} cause of bloody diarrhoea (BD), non-bloody diarrhoea (NBD) and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). In Argentina and New Zealand, the most prevalent STEC serotype is O 157 :H 7, {{which is responsible for}} the majority of HUS cases. In Australia, on the other hand, STEC O 157 :H 7 is associated with a minority of HUS cases. The main aims of this study were to compare the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of STEC O 157 strains isolated between 1993 and 1996 from humans in Argentina, Australia and New Zealand, and to establish their clonal relatedness. Results Seventy-three O 157 STEC strains, isolated from HUS (n = 36), BD (n = 20), NBD (n = 10), or unspecified conditions (n = 7) in Argentina, Australia and New Zealand, were analysed. The strains were confirmed to be E. coli O 157 by biochemical tests and serotyping. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the stx 1, stx 2 and rfb O 157 genes and a genotyping method based on PCR-RFLP was used to determine stx 1 and stx 2 variants. This analysis revealed that the most frequent stx genotypes were stx 2 / stx 2 c (vh-a) (91 %) in Argentina, stx 2 (89 %) in New Zealand, and stx 1 / stx 2 (30 %) in Australia. No stx 1 -postive strains were identified in Argentina or New Zealand. All strains harboured the eae gene and 72 strains produced <b>enterohaemolysin</b> (EHEC-Hly). The clonal relatedness of strains was investigated by phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The most frequent phage types (PT) identified in Argentinian, Australian, and New Zealand strains were PT 49 (n = 12), PT 14 (n = 9), and PT 2 (n = 15), respectively. Forty-six different patterns were obtained by Xba I-PFGE; 37 strains were grouped in 10 clusters and 36 strains showed unique patterns. Most clusters could be further subdivided by Bln I-PFGE. Conclusion STEC O 157 strains isolated in Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand differed from each other in terms of stx -genotype and phage type. Additionally, no common PFGE patterns were found in strains isolated in the three countries. International collaborative studies of the type reported here are needed to detect and monitor potentially hypervirulent STEC clones. </p...|$|E

Verificou-se alfa-hemolisina em oito (6, 7 %) linhagens, isoladas de cinco casos de mastite clÃ­nica e trÃªs de mastite subclÃ­nica e em nenhuma das estirpes detectou-se enteroemolisina. A presenÃ§a de siderÃ³foros foi encontrada em 11 (9, 2 %) linhagens, sete de mastite clÃ­nica e quatro de subclÃ­nica. Em duas (1, 7 %) estirpes isoladas de mastite subclÃ­nica, identificou-se enterotoxina STa. Observou-se efeito citopÃ¡tico em cÃ©lulas vero compatÃ­vel com a produÃ§Ã£o de verotoxina-VT em cinco (4, 2 %) linhagens, duas de mastite clÃ­nica e trÃªs subclÃ­nicas. Em uma (0, 8 %) linhagem isolada de mastite clÃ­nica, detectou-se efeito citopÃ¡tico compatÃ­vel com o fator necrosante citotÃ³xico. Nenhuma estirpe apresentou-se sorbitol-negativa no MacConkey-sorbitol, tampouco aglutinou com o sorotipo O 157 :H 7. Os antimicrobianos mais efetivos foram polimixina B (97, 5 %) e norfloxacina (95, 8 %). Observou-se multi-resistÃªncia a dois ou mais antimicrobianos em 24 (20 %) estirpes, principalmente com o uso de ampicilina e ceftiofur. The {{occurrence}} of different virulence factors and O 157 :H 7 serotype investigation in 120 Escherichia coli strains isolated from clinical (80 cases) and subclinical (40 cases) bovine mastitis was evaluated. Alpha-haemolysin was detected in 8 (6. 7 %) strains (5 clinical and 3 subclinical cases). None strain showed <b>enterohaemolysin</b> production. E. coli growth under iron restriction conditions (siderophores production) {{was observed in}} 11 (9. 2 %) strains (7 clinical and 4 subclinical cases). STa enterotoxin was detected in 2 (1. 7 %) strains from subclinical cases. Cytotoxic effect in vero cells compatible with verotoxin-VT production was observed in 5 (4. 2 %) strains (2 clinical and 3 subclinical cases). One strain (0. 8 %) isolated from clinical mastitis showed cytophatic effect in vero cells compatible with cytotoxic-necrotic-factor production. None strain showed non-sorbitol fermenting colonies using sorbitol MacConkey agar and agglutination with specific anti-sera for E. coli O 157 :H 7 serotype investigation. Polymixin B (97. 5 %) and norfloxacin (95. 8 %) were the most effective drugs. Multiple-drug resistance for 2 or more antimicrobials was observed in 24 (20. 0 %) strains, mainly with use of ampicillin and ceftiofur...|$|E
