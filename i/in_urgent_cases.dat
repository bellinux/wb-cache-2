2500|$|In its beginnings, {{the council}} {{was a place}} of debate amongst the ministers over {{government}} policy. However, since the formation of real political parties {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, these debates were moved from the council to informal ministerial meetings where government policy could be coordinated – usually held every Wednesday. As a result, the primary function of the council today is to grant royal assent, which is done by the counter-signatures of the sovereign and a minister. Before granting the assent, a relevant minister explains the general aim of the bill brought before the council. According to section 22 of the Danish constitution, a bill must be granted assent within thirty days of its passing by parliament, at the latest, for it to become an Act. <b>In</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>cases,</b> or if a passed law will be in conflict with this time limit if only signed at the next scheduled council meeting, the responsible minister for the law is also allowed to visit the royal institution at a separate meeting ahead of the scheduled council meeting, and ask for royal assent. [...] The sovereign cannot be held responsible for any granted assent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{middle of}} the century was marked by the dissensions between the Kann and Kulp parties. The Kulp party, to which many {{influential}} men belonged, endeavored to harmonize the ancient constitution of the community with new measures {{for the benefit of}} the people; but their efforts were thwarted by the wealthy Kann family, whose influence was predominant both in the government of the community and among the people. In 1750 the two parties effected a compromise, which was, however, of but short duration. The community was further excited by Jonathan Eybeschütz's amulet controversy. In 1756 the Jews received permission to leave their street <b>in</b> <b>urgent</b> <b>cases</b> on Sundays and feast days for the purpose of fetching a physician or a barber or mailing a letter, but they were required to return by the shortest way. In 1766 the Cleve divorce controversy began to excite the rabbinate of Frankfurt also. At the coronation of Joseph II. the Frankfurt Jews were permitted for the first time to appear in public, when they swore allegiance to the emperor (May 28, 1764). The community of Frankfurt rendered great service in suppressing Eisenmenger's [...] "Entdecktes Judenthum", confiscating all the copies in 1700. Eisenmenger sued the community for 30,000 gulden. Although he lost his case, proceedings were several times renewed with the aid of King Frederick I of Prussia, and only in 1773 was the community finally released from all claims brought by Eisenmenger's heirs.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: General {{practices}} increasingly use telephone triage {{to manage}} patient flows. During triage, {{the urgency of}} the call and required type of care are determined. This study examined the organization and adequacy of telephone triage in general practices in the Netherlands. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study using a web-based survey among practice assistants including questions on background characteristics and triage organization. Furthermore, practice assistants were asked to assess the required type of care of written case scenarios with varying health problems and levels of urgency. To determine the adequacy of the assessments, a comparison with a reference standard was made. In addition, the association between background characteristics and triage organization and the adequacy of triage was examined. SETTING: Daytime general practices. SUBJECTS: Practice assistants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Over- and under-estimation, sensitivity, specificity. RESULTS: The response rate was 41. 1 % (n = 973). The required care was assessed adequately in 63. 6 % of cases, was over-estimated in 19. 3 %, and under-estimated in 17. 1 %. The sensitivity of identifying patients with a highly urgent problem was 76. 7 % and the specificity was 94. 0 %. The adequacy of the assessments of the required care was higher for more experienced assistants and assistants with fixed daily work meetings with the GP. Triage training, use of a triage tool, and authorization of advice were not associated with adequacy of triage. CONCLUSION: Triage by practice assistants in general practices is efficient (high specificity), but potentially unsafe <b>in</b> highly <b>urgent</b> <b>cases</b> (suboptimal sensitivity). It is important to train practice assistants <b>in</b> identifying highly <b>urgent</b> <b>cases.</b> Key points General practices increasingly use telephone triage to manage patient flows, but {{little is known about the}} organization and adequacy of triage in daytime practices. Telephone triage by general practice assistants is efficient, but potentially unsafe <b>in</b> highly <b>urgent</b> <b>cases.</b> The adequacy of triage is higher for more experienced assistants and assistants with fixed daily work meetings with the general practitioner...|$|R
