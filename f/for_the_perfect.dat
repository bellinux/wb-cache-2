5|$|In 1969, Wilder {{relocated}} to Paris, accepting {{a leading role}} in Bud Yorkin's Start the Revolution Without Me, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but {{he would not be able}} to do the film for at least a year, so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Joseph M. Wilson, {{a lawyer}} by trade with degrees from Amherst College (B.A.), the University of Pennsylvania (M.A.), the University of Southern California (J.D.), and Harvard University (M.A.), was {{appointed}} principal {{and with the}} support of alumni and parents, was able to secure more funding and additional autonomy from the Baltimore City Public Schools. Wilson introduced the IB Diploma Program in 1998. The turnaround Wilson orchestrated led to a quick resurgence and restoration of the school's academic reputation. Enrollment, student performance, {{and the quality of the}} colleges and universities to which graduates matriculated improved, which attracted critical acclaim from education professionals and international media attention. In 2000, City College was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School, the highest academic honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education. In 2001, the Toronto National Post reported on its search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> high school in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. One subject of the prominent feature article was Baltimore City College and its turnaround.|$|E
5|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{is one of}} {{only two}} films {{directed}} by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular, used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black (2005) and Saawariya (2007), said that he and others in his field look to Mughal-e-Azam as a source of inspiration for art direction. It has also been used as a model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing to her heart condition, and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth season}} of 30 Rock premiered on October 15, 2009. Like the {{previous}} season, it also consisted of 22 episodes. A recurring story arc {{early in the}} season revolved around Jack's request that Liz cast a new actor for TGS, and Liz's subsequent search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> comedian, much to the dismay of Jenna and Tracy, who fear losing their spotlight. The latter half of the season focused on complementary story arcs: Jack's inability to choose between his two girlfriends, Liz's inability to find a boyfriend to live up to her expectations, and Jenna's relationship with a Jenna Maroney impersonator. The season has also featured such guest stars as Julianne Moore, Jon Bon Jovi, Cheyenne Jackson, Sherri Shepherd, Will Forte, Elizabeth Banks, Michael Sheen, Matt Damon, and James Franco.|$|E

Under the guise of starting an all-black league, Rickey sent scouts all around the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico, looking <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> candidate to break the color line.

Once married, Ben immediately meets Cassidy while chasing a soul, and she fits every criteria for his perfect girl. Sara, far crueler and more shrewd than she initially lets on, forbids Ben to see Cassidy, though she has no qualms about her own extramarital affairs that she keeps secret from Ben. Ben is eventually able to negotiate a compromise with Sara after discovering she is pregnant with her married boyfriend Esteban's child.|$|E

25|$|The {{final years}} of Starkey's life were devoted to resurrecting his medical {{practice}} and manufacturing income-producing medicines. However, he never wandered far from his chymistry lab and his quest for Van Helmont's alchahest or the philosophers' stone. No doubt he continued his search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> liquor alchahest, a medicinal solvent whose purpose was similar to theriac, an antidotal compound that was consumed to preserve health and prevent illness. Starkey's success in producing his alchahest was limited, and his quest for the philosophers' stone never came to fruition. Although he continued to produce medical treatises, three political pamphlets that he wrote in 1660 along with public disputes he engaged in with other medical practitioners and the Royal College of Physicians further tainted his career.|$|E
25|$|Since casting Harley, however, Lloyd Webber {{had also}} begun to regret his artistic choices. As {{production}} continued on the show, {{the bulk of the}} score was revealing itself to be far more classical and operatic, entirely unsuited to Harley's rough, contemporary voice. Wanting instead a performer with a more classic, melodic voice, as described in the original book, he began yet another search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> actor to play his Phantom. Crawford's landing of the role was due largely in part to the coincidence that Sarah Brightman, had taken lessons with the same vocal coach as Crawford. She and her husband had arrived early for her lesson, and it was while waiting that they chanced to hear him practising a piece from Handel's Atalanta, namely the aria Care Selve. Intrigued, Lloyd Webber inquired of Mr. Adam as to the identity of his student. Soon after, Crawford was called in for an audition and was hired nearly on the spot.|$|E
25|$|After {{dealing with}} Jimmy Hart's stable the Fabulous Ones {{suddenly}} {{got a whole}} different team challenging them for the gold. Luke Williams and Jonathan Boyd (The Sheepherders) had entered the CWA {{in the fall of}} 1982 and soon came head to head with the Fabulous Ones. The Fabulous Ones / Sheepherder feud stands {{as one of the most}} memorable and bloody feuds. A feud that would rage on in several promotions between 1982 and 1987. The “pretty boy”, well polished Fabulous Ones and the ugly, brawling savage Sheepherders made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> opponents and repeatedly drew big gates all over the country. The matches started out pretty evenly with the Fabulous Ones and the Sheepherders splitting the decisions but soon turned brutal and often without a definite winner. In December, 1982 the Sheepherders won the Southern Tag Team Championship from Lane and Keirn which only turned the intensity of the matches up a notch. Between late December and Mid February the two teams traded the belts back and forth 4 times with the Fabulous Ones ending up with possession of them in the end. On March 28 the Sheepherders wrestled their last match in the Mid-South Coliseum before leaving the CWA giving the Fabulous Ones (Kayfabe) credit for running them out of Memphis.|$|E
