40|$|Background/Aim. Fracture {{toughness}} determines functional crown strenght {{and prevents}} damages on ceramics during mastication. There {{is a lack}} of relevant literature data about fracture toughness of crowns made by <b>feather-edge</b> preparation. Mechanical testing of ceramic samples is supposed to show if <b>feather-edge</b> tooth preparation is a successful method for making ceramic crowns without any risk of reduction of their mechanical properties. This research was done to establish effects of <b>feather-edge</b> tooth preparation on fracture toughness of single zirconia ceramic crowns. Methods. The research was performed as an experimental study. Sixty (60) ceramic crowns were made on non-carious extracted human premolars. Thirty (30) crowns were {{made on the basis of}} <b>feather-edge</b> preparation (experimental group I). The group II included 30 crowns made on 1 mm rounded shoulder. Crowns fabrication was executed on a copy mill production system “Zirkonzahn” (Zirkonzahn GMBH, Gais, Germany). The spherical compression test was used to determine fracture toughness, using 6 mm diameter ceramic ball. Fracture load for damaging ceramic crown was recorded on a universal testing machine - Zwick, type 1464, with the speed of 0. 05 mm/min. Results. The results of this research introduced significant differences between fracture toughness of ceramic samples in every examined group. However, fracture toughness of crowns from both group was above 2 000 N, what was double beyond a recommended value. The mean value of fracture toughness in the <b>feather-edge</b> group was 2 090 N, and in shoulder group it was 2 214 N. Conclusion. This research showed a high fracture toughness of zirconia crowns made on <b>feather-edge</b> preparation. The examined crowns showed a fracture resistance at a sufficient distance in relation to the minimum values of functional loads. Further research of functional loads of these crown is necessary, as well as research of marginal adaptation of cemented crowns and gingival inflammatory response...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} different cervical finish line designs on the marginal adaptation of a zirconia ceramic. Four different marginal finish lines (c: chamfer, mc: mini-chamfer, fe: <b>feather-edge</b> and s: rounded shoulder) were prepared on phantom incisors. Die models for each preparation group (N = 28, n = 7 per finish line design group) were made of epoxy resin. Y-TZP (ICE Zirkon) frameworks were manufactured by a copy-milling system (Zirconzahn) using prefabricated blanks and tried on the master models for initial adaptation of the framework; they were then sintered, followed by veneering (Zirconzahn). The finished crowns were cemented with a polycarboxylate cement (Poly F) under 300 g load and ultrasonically cleaned. The specimens were sliced and the marginal gap was measured, considering absolute marginal opening (AMO) and marginal opening (MO) for each coping under a stereomicroscope with image processing software (Lucia). The measurements were statistically analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis, Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests at a significance level of alpha = 0. 01. Means of AMO measurement (microm) for the <b>feather-edge</b> finish line (87 +/- 10) was significantly {{lower than that of}} the chamfer (144 +/- 14), shoulder (114 +/- 16) and mini-chamfer finish line types (114 +/- 11) (p < 0. 01). Means of MO measurements was the lowest for <b>feather-edge</b> finish line (68 +/- 9) (p < 0. 01) and then, in ascending order, shoulder (95 +/- 9), mini-chamfer (97 +/- 12) and chamfer (128 +/- 10). The cervical finish line type had an influence on the marginal adaptation of the tested zirconia ceramic. Although the <b>feather-edge</b> finish line resulted in lower AMO and MO values, with its proven mechanical disadvantage, it cannot be recommended in clinical applications of zirconia crowns. This type of finish line has acted solely as a control group to test the null hypothesis in the current study. For better marginal adaptation, both shoulder and mini-chamfer finish line types could be suggested for zirconia crowns...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissociation}} {{of marine}} hydrate that surrounds continental margins {{is thought to}} be an agent for past and future climate change. As the water depth decreases landwards, the base of the hydrate stability zone progressively shallows until hydrate can occur at or immediately below the seabed where an increase in bottom water temperature can cause dissociation. But the true extent of these most vulnerable hydrate deposits is unknown. Here we use exceptional quality three-dimensional (3 -D) seismic reflection imagery offshore of Mauritania that reveals a rare example of a bottom simulating reflection (BSR) that intersects the seabed and delineates the <b>feather-edge</b> of hydrate. The BSR intersects the seabed at the ∼ 636 m isobath but along the 32 km of the margin analysed, the intersection is highly irregular. Intersections and seismic evidence for hydrate less than ∼ 4. 3 m below the seabed occur in seven small, localised areas that are 0. 02 – 0. 45 km 2 in extent. We propose gas flux below the dipping base of the hydrate to these places has been particularly effective. The intersections are separated by recessions in the BSR where it terminates below the seabed, seawards of the 636 m isobath. Recessions are areas where the concentration of hydrate is very low or hydrate is absent. They are regions that have been bypassed by gas that has migrated landwards along the base of the hydrate or via hydraulic fractures that pass vertically through the hydrate stability zone and terminate at pockmarks at the seabed. An irregular <b>feather-edge</b> of marine hydrate may be typical of other margins...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Marine {{geophysical}} {{surveys show}} that the Escarpment is the buried <b>feather-edge</b> of a thick pile of flood basalts of early Eocene age, over-lying a thinner, more widespread layer of basalts of late Palaeocene age. The Escarpment does not, therefore, define the continent-ocean boundary in the southern Norwegian Sea, but instead marks the contemporary shoreline separating terrestrially erupted basalt flows in the north from a restricted shallow-water shelf to the south. The basalts overlie 5 - 6 km of Mesozoic sediments, which have completely buried a large conical flat-topped seamount of similar dimensions to Anton Dohrn and Rosemary Bank. We call this newly postulated body the Brendan seamount. The Mesozoic sediments {{are at least as}} old as early Cretaceous in age, therefore precluding the possibility that the mid-Cretaceous seafloor spreading episode (supposed by some to have created the Rockall Trough) could have also created the thin crust inferred to underlie the Faeroe-Shetland Trough and Mbre Basin. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [107]- 113) Cahokia was {{the largest}} prehistoric Mississippian mound center in the eastern United States. Despite its prominence, relatively {{little is known about}} the timing or significance of construction of the over 100 mounds that mark the site. During the 1995 SIUE/UNM archaeological field school, excavations were conducted near one of the site's principal mounds, Mound 48, on the western edge of the Grand Plaza, in the central ceremonial precinct. The field methodology employed to investigate Mound 48 is termed "feather-edge" testing. The technique is very low impact in that it does not require excavations that would destroy any part of the mound. Instead, information about the sequence of events that took place before, during, and after the construction of the mound is gathered from test units placed around its base. For this thesis, analysis of the ceramic assemblage, soil stratigraphy, and the various types of archaeological features found in excavation were conducted to determine the chronology of events centered around Mound 48 and the relation of these events to what was occurring simultaneously in and around the Grand Plaza and surrounding site center. Through analysis of the above materials, it was determined that occupation of the area adjacent to Mound 48 first took place late in the Edelhardt phase of the Emergent Mississippian period. Construction of the mound was begun during the subsequent Lohmann phase of the Mississippian period, and an elite occupation of the mound's summit occurred approximately 150 years later, during the Moorehead phase. Finally, occupation of Mound 4 8 's summit ceased late in the Mississippian period, after Cahokia had declined in population and influence. If <b>feather-edge</b> testing could be used on the many mounds at Cahokia for which such chronological information is still lacking, a larger, more cohesive picture of the timing of large scale construction could be established. Further, the significance of this sequence of events in terms of the development and decline of Cahokia may be more clearly understood. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
40|$|Up to 30 m of phosphatic sediments {{of early}} and middle Miocene Pungo River Formation were {{deposited}} in the north-south-trending Aurora Embayment of North Carolina. These sediments thin to approximately 10 to 15 m over the Cape Lookout High, a pre-Miocene feature which forms the southern boundary of the Aurora Embayment. The western and updip limit of the formation parallels a regional north-south structural hingeline or White Oak Lineament. The formation thins to a <b>feather-edge</b> at this lineament and thickens rapidly {{to the east and}} southeast. Deposition of the Pungo River Formation extended some unknown distance {{to the west of the}} White Oak Lineament, the present updip erosional limit. 	The Pungo River Formation consists of the four major sediment sequences in the Aurora Area (units A, B, C, and D as described by Riggs and others, 1982 b) and three lateral facies (units BB, CC, and DD). Phosphate sedimentation was concentrated in units A, B, and C which are laterally correlative throughout most of the study area. However, the muddy phosphorite quartz sands of unit B and possibly the phosphorite quartz sands and carbonate sediments of unit C grade downdip to the southeast into an 11 -m-thick diatomaceous facies (unit BB). Units A, B, and C grade into a slightly phosphatic, calcareous, quartz sand facies (unit CC) to the south, in the area of the Cape Lookout High, which probably represents a shoaling environment. Dolomitic unit D, of the northern and eastern portions of the Aurora Embayment, grades laterally into calcareous unit DD in the central portion of the embayment. 	Allochemical phosphate grains of the intraclastic variety dominate all sediment units in the formation. However, unit A contains abundant pelletal phosphate in the fine to very fine sand-size fraction. The highest phosphate concentrations occur along the upper shelflike basin margin in the west-central portion of the Aurora Embayment. Updip to the west, the phosphate concentration decreases within each unit which also thins due to subsequent erosion. Major facies changes within the sediment units have resulted in decreased phosphate contents downdip to the east and south within the Aurora Embayment. 	Within the Aurora Area, units A through C of the Pungo River Formation are generally characterized by the cyclic deposition consisting of decreasing terrigenous and increasing phosphate sedimentation upward through the units; the deposition of each unit culminated with the formation of a carbonate cap-rock. The depositional pattern of these regionally persistent and cyclical lithologies suggests that units A through C were deposited during a major transgression. The overlying unit D was deposited during the early stages of a subsequent regressive phase. Truncation of the units by erosion took place prior to the deposition of the Pliocene Yorktown Formation. Thus, this extensive erosion has produced an apparent offlap configuration of the Pungo River units that actually represents a major transgressive or onlap sediment sequence and an early stage regressive sequence...|$|R
40|$|The {{pinch-out}} {{geometry of}} large sandbodies, such as fluvial or turbiditic palaeochannel margins and deltaic sand wedges, is of a crucial {{importance to the}} evaluation of many stratigraphic hydrocarbon traps and can generally be recognized in extensive outcrops or high-resolution seismic sections. Far more difficult to recognize and model are the digitate, <b>feather-edge</b> pinchouts of successions composed of sheet-like sandstone beds, such as turbidite lobes or shore-derived mid-shelf tempestites, where the individual beds may peter out at highly varied basinward distances. Both turbidites and tempestites are expected to pinch out seawards, but their actual thinning rates and pinchout geometries are little-known and unpredictable. Can the lateral variation of sheet-like bed characteristics be empirically defined? In the present pilot study, more than 3750 closely-spaced (2 - 10 m lateral spacing) measurements of the lateral thickness changes in 146 turbidite and tempestite beds have been collected over lateral outcrop distances of up to 640 m. Turbidites have been measured in the Miocene Marnoso Arenacea Formation of the Northern Apennines, Italy, and the Late Cretaceous Akveren Formation of the Central Pontides, north-central Turkey, with supplementary smaller datasets from the Eocene Kusuri Formation of the Central Pontides and the Miocene Monte Fumaiolo Formation of the Northern Apennines. Tempestites have been measured in the late Miocene Karpuzçay Formation in the Manavgat Basin of Central Taurides, south-western Turkey. The spatial direction of bed thinning relative to the palaeocurrent direction has been taken into account. The datasets show that both turbidites and tempestites have a log-normal thickness frequency distribution, a trend that has been also commonly reported from bed-to-bed thickness measurements of vertical successions. In terms of an exceedence frequency plot with logarithmic scales, the log-normal distribution can be approximated by straight-line segments, {{which means that the}} bed thicknesses are self-similar (fractal) within their particular ranges. The statistical method of least-square regression has been used to identify lateral bed-thinning trends, which appear to be consistent for each genetic category of beds, but dependent upon the bed thickness range – as the downflow bed thinning rate apparently changes significantly with the bed thickness. Assuming the bed segments measured in outcrop sections represent downflow-thinning segments of unconfined (non-ponded) basin-plain turbidites and shelf tempestites, their thinning rates can be stacked together according to the local bed-thickness ranges to represent the pinchout geometry of a whole single bed. The stacking of local trends into a laterally continuous bulk trend seems to be justified {{by the fact that the}} thinner bed segments are finer-grained and composed of proportionally thinner divisions. The synthetic bulk trend appears to be a concave-upward function that flattens exponentially in the downflow direction. The range-related trend equations allow the pinchout distance of every bed in a turbiditic or tempesitic succession encountered in a well to be predicted and the net spatial pinch-out of a given bed succession to be modelled. However, the trend equations are considered to be tentative, as they require veritication on a wider database. In addition, the statistical analysis revealed occurrence of bed-top undulations in both turbidites and tempestites, which are subtle to gentle and are visually unrecognizable in outcrop sections. Fourier analysis indicates statistically significant, cyclic waveform components in these undulations, with wavelengths of up to 300 m and amplitudes from a few centimetres to 60 cm. The tops of thinner beds have less pronounced and more irregular subtle undulations. The origin of the bed-top undulations is unknown, but there are several wave-like hydrualic phenomena, such as internal waves, to which they may possibly owe their formation...|$|R
