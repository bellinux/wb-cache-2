In this paper a model {{is presented to}} calculate effective permittivities and polarimetric backscattering coefficients of multispecies-layered media. The same physical description is consistently used in the derivation of both permittivities and scattering coefficients. The strong permittivity fluctuation theory is extended {{to account for the}} multiple species of scatterers with a general ellipsoidal shape whose orientations are randomly distributed. Under the distorted Born approximation, polarimetric scattering coefficients are obtained. These calculations are applicable to the special cases of spheroidal and spherical scatterers. The model is used to study effects of scatterer shapes and multispecies mixtures on polarimetric signatures of heterogeneous media. The multispecies model accounts for moisture content in scattering media such as snowpack in an ice sheet. The results indicate a high sensitivity of backscatter to moisture with a stronger dependence for drier snow and ice grain size is important to the backscatter.

This variety played a great role in increasing total grain yields in the Kuban Region. It also was an important gene source for Russian and world breeding. This variety has initiated and was for many years a party to research molecular biological mechanisms of wheat <b>frost</b> resistance <b>formation.</b> The article summarizes data about the peculiarities of functioning of protein-synthesizing system it sprouts (coleoptilies) under the influence of hardening temperature (4 oC) : translational activity in vitro, poliribosomts, degree of polyadenilation and stability of total mRNA and specific mRNA translational elongation factor Î± subunit 1 (eEF- 1 Î±).

40|$|ABSTRACT. Frost {{flowers are}} {{transient}} crystal structures that form on new and young sea ice surfaces. They have {{been implicated in}} a variety of biological, chemical, and physical processes and interactions with the atmosphere at the sea ice surface. We describe the atmospheric and radiative conditions and the physical and thermal properties of the sea ice and atmosphere that form, decay, and destroy frost flowers on young sea ice. <b>Frost</b> flower <b>formation</b> occurred during a high-pressure system that caused air temperatures to drop to âˆ’ 30 ËšC, with relative humidity of 70 % (an undersaturated atmosphere), and very calm wind conditions. The sea ice surface temperature at the time of frost flower initiation was 10 Ëš â€“ 13 ËšC warmer than the air temperature. Frost flowers grew on nodules raised above the mean surface height by 5 mm, which were 4 Ëš â€“ 6 ËšC colder than the bare, brine-wetted, highly saline sea ice surface that provided the necessary moisture. The cold nodules created potential water vapour supersaturation zones above them with respect to air over the brine skim. Frost flowers formed and grew overnight in the absence of shortwave radiation, while the net longwave radiation was negative and dominated the net all-wave radiation balance at the surface. The observed crystal habits of the frost flowers were long needles, betraying their origin from the vapour phase at temperatures between âˆ’ 20 ËšC and âˆ’ 30 ËšC. After a night of growth, frost flowers decayed in association with increased solar radiation, a net surface radiation balance of 0 W m- 2, increased air and surface temperatures, increased wind speed, and decreased relative humidity. We hypothesize that these conditions increased vertical mixing, which eroded near-surface water vapour saturation and initiated sublimation. The frost flowers finally were rapidly destroyed by snowfall...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of artificial snow {{and the use}} of snow additives in ski resorts have increased considerably during the last 20 years. Their ecological consequences are the subject of envi-ronmental concerns. This review compiles studies about the ecological implications of ski pistes preparation in general and of artificial snow production. The main direct impacts of ski piste preparation on the vegetation are related to the compaction of the snow cover, namely the induction of soil <b>frost,</b> the <b>formation</b> of ice layers, mechanical damage and a delay in plant development. The vegetation reacts with changes in species composition and a decrease in biodiversity. Artificial snowing modifies some of these impacts: The soil frost is mitigated due to an increased insulation of the snowpack, whereas the formation of ice lay-ers is not considerably changed. The mechanical impacts of snow-grooming vehicles are mit-igated due to the deeper snow cover. The delay of the vegetation development is enhanced by a considerably postponed snowmelt. Furthermore, artificial snowing induces new impacts to the alpine environment. Snowing increases the input of water and ions to ski pistes, which can have a fertilising effect and hence change the plant species composition. Increasingly, snow additives, made of potentially phytopathogenic bacteria, are used for snow produc-tion. They enhance ice crystal formation due to their ice nucleation activity. Although ster-ilised, additives affected the growth of some alpine plant species in laboratory experiments. Salts are applied not only but preferably on snowed pistes to improve the snow quality for ski races. The environmental impacts of most salts have not yet been investigated, but a com-monly used nitrate salt has intense fertilising properties. Although snowing mitigates some of the negative impacts of ski piste preparation in general, new impacts induced by snowing could be non-beneficial to the vegetation, which, however, has yet to be clarified...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} type of air cooling coil used in the {{refrigeration}} industry is the finned tube heat exchanger. The performance of such coils can be greatly hindered by <b>frost</b> <b>formation,</b> which will occur when the coil surface temperature is both below the dewpoint of the air passing over it, and below 0 Â°C. Frost reduces performance, both through the increased thermal resistance of the frost layer, and by reduction of the air flow through the coil. Whilst frosting on coils is influential on performance, there is comparatively little information available on the performance of finned tube heat exchangers under frosting conditions. Smith (1989) has proposed an "unfavourable" <b>frost</b> <b>formation</b> theory. The theory states that unfavourable <b>frost</b> <b>formation</b> occurs when the line representing the temperature and humidity of the air passing through the coil, crosses the saturation line of the psychrometric chart. This criteria is more likely to occur under conditions of high relative humidity, low sensible heat ratio (SHR), and/or high refrigerant-to-air temperature difference (TD). Under unfavourable conditions it is suggested that the frost will be of particularly low density, which would cause coil performance to decline to a much greater extent for the same total frost accumulation, than under "favourable" frosting conditions. The objectives of this study were to measure the change in performance of a cooling coil under frosting conditions, and to assess the validity of the unfavourable <b>frost</b> <b>formation</b> theory. A calorimeter style coil test facility was used, that allowed coil performance to be measured as frost accumulated {{in a manner consistent with}} coil operation in industrial practice (i. e. declining air flowrate and a wide range of SHR's). The data collected supported the concept of unfavourable <b>frost</b> <b>formation</b> with a more rapid decline in performance for operation with low SHR, than that at high SHR, for the same total frost accumulation. Some recovery of coil performance was observed when operation at low SHR (with rapid performance deterioration) was followed by a period of high SHR operation. Equations were developed that allowed the theoretical conditions for the formation from favourable to unfavourable frosting to be quantified. The measured change in the rate of coil performance deterioration with frost buildup was dependent on air and coil conditions, in a manner consistent with these equations. The transition between favourable and unfavourable <b>frost</b> <b>formation</b> appeared to be related to the lowest temperature on the coil surface rather than the mean surface temperature. Satisfactory predictions of <b>frost</b> <b>formation</b> types were obtained by using the refrigerant evaporation temperature as an approximation to the lowest coil surface temperature...|$|E

Silicon wafers were coated with a self-assembled monolayer and patterned to create biphilic surfaces.

40|$|ABSTRACTUnderstanding an {{organization}} and its strategy formation processes implies {{to go beyond}} its tangible elements, eg, physical structure and product offerings. The organizational complexity demands a deeper understanding to explain some intangibles such as organizational culture. Organizational culture as a system of symbols and meanings (ALVESSONl, 2003), defines how strongly a company conducts its business. Moreover, according to Mintzberg, Ahlstrand and Lampel (2000), the formation of strategy {{can be seen as}} a process of social interaction based on common understandings to members of {{an organization}}, presenting cultural characteristics. Moreover, considering the studies of Martin and Frost (2001), organizational culture has three different perspectives: the perspectives of integration, differentiation and fragmentation.
