50|$|In June 2003, Media News Group, {{owner of}} the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, {{announced}} that it would <b>exercise</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> purchase KTVF. The seven-year option, pending removal of the FCC's restrictions on newspaper/broadcast ownership, was granted to Media News in 1999 when Northern Television sold the station to Ackerley.

50|$|The hire {{purchase}} agreement {{was developed in}} the United Kingdom in the 19th century to allow customers with a cash shortage to make an expensive purchase they otherwise would have to delay or forgo. For example, in cases where a buyer cannot afford to pay the asked price for an item of property as a lump sum but can afford to pay a percentage as a deposit, a hire-purchase contract allows the buyer to hire the goods for a monthly rent. When a sum equal to the original full price plus interest has been paid in equal installments, the buyer may then <b>exercise</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> buy the goods at a predetermined price (usually a nominal sum) or return the goods to the owner.|$|E

No Cavalier player made first team All-ACC team {{for the first time}} in 20 years. While Groh acknowledged that the year would be a rebuilding experience and a slow start upset some fans, Virginia athletic director Craig Littlepage stated that, [...] "Al will be our head coach" [...] through at least the 2007 season.Littlepage, however, later refused to <b>exercise</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> extend Groh's contract by one year stating that Virginia's expectations were higher than 5-7. Unlike past seasons, Groh only played one true freshman in 2006, which preserved the redshirt of true freshman.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of this complex, Falmouth residents took their water from either open water sources or hand-pumped wells. The town by 1896 provided seven hand-pumped wells for this purpose. Although the community at first resisted establishing a municipal water supply, growing demand from vacationers who owned property in the town, combined with increasing fire insurance rates for areas not covered by a municipal water system, prompted its construction. The Falmouth Water Supply Company, a private venture controlled by summer residents, was established in 1898. The complex was built on land owned by one of the proprietors, Joseph Story Fay, who had also given Good Will Park to the town. The town in 1900 voted to <b>exercise</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> purchase the company from its owners, a process completed two years later. The town eventually also purchased a number of other private water providers.|$|E
50|$|MPS Media {{announced}} in March 2012 {{that it would}} sell WPME to Triumph Broadcasting for $75,000. The deal was contingent on WPXT's concurrent sale from New Age Media to Tyche Broadcasting. On November 13, 2012, WPME filed a non-consummation notice to the FCC, meaning the transaction is nulled and void. On February 13, 2013, MPS Media filed to sell WPME to Cottonwood Communications; this deal is concurrent with a planned sale of WPXT to Ironwood Communications, which took over WPME's operations through a shared services agreement. The FCC granted its approval of the sale on April 2. The sale was consummated on May 20. On July 2, 2015, Ironwood chose to <b>exercise</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> acquire WPME outright for $65,000; the company is seeking a failed station waiver, as {{there are not enough}} stations in the Portland market to permit a duopoly without a waiver.|$|E

50|$|After relegation struggles {{during the}} two {{previous}} season, Mark Hughes marked his first full season in club management by taking Blackburn to sixth place - four points off Champions League qualification - and reaching his second successive cup semi-final, in the League Cup, only to be knocked out by the eventual cup winners again, Hughes' old club Manchester United. Blackburn had been in mid-table {{for much of the}} season before gathering momentum to put real pressure on Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur {{in the race for the}} crucial fourth place, eventually finishing in a UEFA Cup place. Rovers' good form was largely in part down to the good form of Welsh striker Craig Bellamy, a summer signing from Newcastle United, who scored 13 goals in the league. However, Bellamy would then <b>exercise</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> enable him to move for £6 million to a Champions League club, signing for FA Cup winners Liverpool. As his replacement Hughes signed South African striker Benni McCarthy, who had helped fire Porto to the Champions League title two years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Since 2007, the Tampa Bay {{event has}} been played in March, as the Players Championship moved six weeks later, to mid-May. For a time, the tournament was without a title sponsor, leading to {{speculation}} on its fate beyond 2007. Then, on January 24, 2007, tournament {{officials and the}} PGA Tour announced a six-year sponsorship agreement with PODS of Clearwater, Florida. However, the company chose to <b>exercise</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> withdraw as title sponsor after the 2008 event, and tournament officials searched to find a replacement. On June 4, 2008, Transitions Optical, Inc., the photochromic lens manufacturer headquartered locally in Largo, was announced as the new title sponsor. [...] Transitions left the event after the 2012 season. Just {{two weeks before the}} 2013 tournament, EverBank agreed to be presenting sponsor for the tournament. In September 2013, Valspar Corporation signed a four-year deal to become title sponsor of the event, now named the Valspar Championship. On March 9, 2016, the PGA Tour, Valspar Corporation, and Copperhead Charities - the Valspar Championship host organization - announced a three-year title sponsorship extension, thus carrying Valspar’s commitment to the tournament through 2020. This extension occurred {{in the midst of the}} original contract period, which was from 2013 to 2017.|$|E

40|$|The {{decision}} of Greppo v Jam-Cal Bundaberg Pty Ltd [2015] QCA 131 illustrates a defect in s 128 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) which gives {{a right to}} a lessee to apply for relief against forfeiture against loss of a right to <b>exercise</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> renew. The defect arises because the legislation does not adequately deal with breaches that occur after the exercise of the option but before the expiry of the lease. Most commercial leases of all kinds have a standard provisions, as the lease in this case, as a conditions of the exercise of the option to renew that the lessee will have given notice of exercise within the time specified to the lessor and will have up to the date of expiry of the lease paid all rent and observed all lessee’s covenants. The difficulties occur because invariably an option must be exercised before the expiry of the lease when a lessee may not be in breach of the lease but may later prior to the expiry of the lease fall into breach. As this decision indicates,at least in Queensland, that the lessee who desires to challenge the lessor’s right to enforce those conditions can neither seek relief under s 128 against forfeiture of the right to exercise the option,or indeed, under s 124 of the Property Law Act 1974 to preserve the agreement for lease brought about by the otherwise regular exercise of the option to renew. The decision cries out for legislative reform along the lines of s 133 E of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) which was amended in 2001 to meet this contingency...|$|E
