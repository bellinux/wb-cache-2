50|$|There is also {{a notable}} {{population}} of Yemenite Jews, especially Adeni Jews who originated in {{the port city of}} Aden in Yemen. They settled in Stamford Hill after fleeing the <b>inter-community</b> <b>violence</b> {{at the end of the}} Aden Protectorate. The Adeni Congregation synagogue, Nahalat Yosef, is named after the original Adeni synagogue in Yemen. A new synagogue has been built, modelled on the original one. Adeni Jews tend to consider themselves a different ethnicity to other Yemeni Jews, due to differences in traditions, prayers (pronunciation) and customs that have evolved under British rule. In recent years, many have moved to Southgate and Hendon.|$|E

A letter to Feiglin from the Home Office said that Smith based her decision on an assessment that his activities [...] "foment or justify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs; seek to provoke others to terrorist acts; foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to serious criminal acts and foster hatred which might lead to <b>inter-community</b> <b>violence</b> in the UK."

5000|$|In public {{speeches and}} {{policies}} that he formulated, Zia began expounding [...] "Bangladeshi nationalism," [...] as opposed to Mujib's assertion of a Bengal national identity. Zia emphasised the national role of Islam (as practised {{by the majority of}} Bangladeshis). Claiming to promote an inclusive national identity, Zia reached out to non-Bengali minorities such as the Santals, Garos, Manipuris and Chakmas, as well as the Urdu-speaking peoples of Bihari origin. However, many of these groups were predominantly Hindu and Buddhist and were alienated by Zia's promotion of political Islam. In an effort to promote cultural assimilation and economic development, Zia appointed a Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Commission in 1976, but resisted holding a political dialogue with the representatives of the hill tribes on the issue of autonomy and cultural self-preservation. On 2 July 1977 Ziaur Rahman organised a tribal convention to promote a dialogue between the government and tribal groups. However, most cultural and political issues would remain unresolved and intermittent incidents of <b>inter-community</b> <b>violence</b> and militancy occurred throughout Zia's rule.|$|E
5000|$|According to Enikő Vincze, [...] "the {{formation}} of the Cluj landfill as a space of precarious and stigmatized housing and labour, is a site of environmental racism." [...] Predominantly Romani neighbourhoods from throughout the city of Cluj have been evicted and relocated to the dump since 2002. Many different Romani subgroups, further divided by family lines, have been settled into an area near the dump on Cantonului Street, causing <b>inter-community</b> tensions and <b>violence.</b> In 2010, 300 residents of Coastei street were evicted and resettled at the dump near a chemical waste site. The newly vacated neighbourhood was subsequently transferred, for free, to the Archbishop of Feleac and Cluj {{for the purpose of}} constructing a campus for students of Orthodox Theology at the Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj.|$|R

During May 2011, 3, 000 refugees moved into the reserve, with their cattle, to escape post-election <b>inter-community</b> <b>violence.</b> The study is synchronic, with data being collected during three longitudinal visits to KGR between March and October 2011 during this period of political upheaval. Two main themes are explored: livestock management strategies (transhumance and herd splitting) and production parameters (herd size, composition, fertility, dynamics).|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} ritual forms of <b>inter-community</b> <b>violence</b> endemic in rural Galicia and their {{interaction}} with new varieties of societal and political {{activity in the}} late nineteenth century and first third of the twentieth century. We approach the subject using archival documents, press and literary sources and oral tradition. Seen in the past as a sign of the uncivilized character of the rural population, this variety of «horizontal violence» reveal however an inner logic related to the defense of the cohesion of the village community and the life-cycle of the males...|$|E
40|$|In Northern Ireland, {{in spite}} of a {{relatively}} efficient peace process implemented at the institutional and political levels, recurrent episodes of physical and symbolic violence still happen at urban interfaces between Protestant/Unionist and Catholic/nationalist neighbourhoods, which {{are one of the few}} places where the working-class members of the two communities can meet. After a brief history of interfaces in Northern Ireland, this chapter aims to identify the various modes of management of <b>inter-community</b> <b>violence</b> in Northern Ireland, by looking specifically at violence happening at interface areas and during parades, and by contrasting the cases of the two main cities of Northern Ireland: Belfast and (London) Derry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: is paper {{reports on}} the {{prevalence}} of traumatic bone lesions among Bronze and Iron Age populations in Armenia. A total of 51 traumatic injuries were observed {{in a sample of}} 147 individuals from 8 sites. Injuries were present in 37 males (46. 3 %, n= 80), 13 females (28. 9 %, n= 45), and 1 child (5 %, n= 20). In four sites (N. Getashen, Noraduz, Shirakavan and Lori Berd) the most affected age class was 20 – 29 years, in two other sites (Sarukhan and Arszvakar), the most affected age class was 40 – 65 years. Some kinds of trauma may be attributed to inter-personal violence, although it was not possi-ble to distinguish between intra-community (e. g. domestic) and <b>inter-community</b> <b>violence.</b> Key words: skeletal trauma; warfare; fracture...|$|E
40|$|Kachia Grazing Reserve (KGR) in {{northern}} Nigeria {{was home to}} some 10, 000 Fulani pastoralists and their 40, 000 cattle in June 2011. This study examines productivity and management of cattle belonging to livestock keepers within the reserve before and after a mass immigration event when 3, 000 refugees moved into the reserve with their cattle to escape <b>inter-community</b> <b>violence</b> during May 2011. Data, on livestock management strategies (transhumance) and production parameters (herd size, composition, fertility, dynamics), were collected in March, June and October 2011. Cattle productivity in KGR is geared to supporting Fulani households while maintaining herd wealth. High offtake of young animals, especially the selling of heifers, was an unusual finding and may indicate that KGR pastoralists have been restricting their herd size voluntarily as well as limiting milk production to household requirements. This is {{probably due to the}} absence of a commercial milk market and a higher reliance on the sale of young stock to meet cash needs. Despite the widespread perception that grazing reserves are promoting sedentarisation of Fulani pastoralists and curbing transhumance, the inhabitants of the KGR were observed to practise wide-ranging transhumance both during wet and dry seasons driven by the limited availability of grazing. Some households selected a sub-sample of animals for transhumance rather than sending their whole herd, and some maintained cattle on alternative land-holdings outside the reserve. KGR households described modifying their usual transhumance practices in response to the mass immigration event and insecurity. Nevertheless, the herd demography results from this study are broadly similar to data obtained from other studies over the past 40 years, indicating that productivity and management practices have remained relatively unchanged...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{the papers}} in this volume that precede it, our {{discussion}} brings all the chapters of the long story of Alsónyék into a single narrative, discussing in more interpretive terms notions of persistent place, community, aggregation and coalescence, {{with an eye on}} different scales of analysis and the broader tempo of change. We look especially at the remarkably long persistence of Alsónyék, the intensity of its occupation and the trajectory of population increase and decline at the site. We begin by comparing general conditions of early village emergence with the specific evidence for the development of settlement and population in Transdanubia and beyond in central Europe, before summarising date estimates for the successive periods of occupation at Alsónyék itself, from Starčevo through LBK and Sopot to the Lengyel. We emphasise the long continuity of occupation except for the gap between Starčevo and LBK, the probable overlap between LBK and Sopot, and the acceleration of growth in the Lengyel period. The exceptional persistence of place seen at Alsónyék is examined in further detail, with comparison to elsewhere leading on to discussion of the sense of place and community that may have been experienced through the Alsónyék sequence. Characterisation of the Lengyel occupation as not only a major aggregation but also a coalescent community is explored; the causes of such developments elsewhere, as seen in the historical and ethnographic record, are noted, including periods of social instability and <b>inter-community</b> <b>violence.</b> The extraordinary intensity of activity at Alsónyék is further modelled in various ways to provide estimates of population and numbers of buildings in use through the Lengyel sequence. The peak of intense activity was probably only maintained for a generation or two around 4700 cal BC, and the decline of the Lengyel site was perhaps only slightly slower than its rise (covering two or three generations {{in the latter part of}} the 47 th century cal BC). Activity did not reduce to its pre-Lengyel levels, however, but persisted for several more centuries at perhaps two or three times the intensity of any pre-Lengyel occupation. A search for the causes of the Alsónyék aggregation - and of its decline - remains challenging, though answers may eventually be found in the further study of the regional settlement complex or the detailed history of disease. No extensive signs of violence have so far been recorded. We further discuss possible constituents of the coalescence represented at Alsónyék, noting the frequent houses and possible households and neighbourhoods, and looking beyond these to the idea of wards, clans and moieties. Possible clues to internal differences within the site are noted for future research, and it is only with further work that the full Alsónyék story can be told...|$|E
