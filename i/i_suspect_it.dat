25|$|My {{favorite}} {{king was}} King Melchior, {{because he was}} the oldest and had a long white beard. My brother's favorite was King Kaspar. He insisted that this king was a little crazy and quite deaf. I don't know why he was so positive about his being deaf. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood what the word meant.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Hollis {{hoped that}} the {{difference}} between light and dark would be a significant feature of the gameplay, and the title was intended to reflect this focus. A flashlight was implemented by Steve Ellis, who had been responsible for much of the multiplayer mode of GoldenEye 007, but it {{was not included in the}} final game due to the limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. Hollis remarked that such aims were overambitious, commenting in 2006 that [...] "Even today, you can see game developers struggle to make light and dark foundational from a gameplay perspective. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> will take a few years before significant and pervasive gameplay innovation occurs here." [...] Although not all these intended features were realised, the game contains more advanced lighting than its predecessor. For example, lights can be shot out to create darkened areas, gunfire and explosions illuminate rooms dynamically, and the player can use infrared and night vision goggles.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} conducted by Contemporary Authors, Terpening said: “My desire to create imaginary worlds through fiction springs, as <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> does for most writers, from {{a love of}} reading. From early grade school years, when I was given my first books (most still in my library today) and when I lived one house away from the public library in Gresham, Oregon (where I {{spent most of my}} free time), to the present, when I teach Italian literature for a living, my addiction has been not to candy, rock 'n' roll, TV, drugs, sex, or gambling, but to the book—both as an artifact and as a source of delight, a distraction from the constraints of life. A good book carries you away and never lets you down.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That it was Mr. Clyffurde, our English friend," [...] {{broke in}} Madame tartly, [...] "who robbed {{us on the}} broad highway. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> all along." ...|$|R
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "Well, I won't, then. But do {{you know}} what <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> Lucy? <b>I</b> wouldn't mention it to everybody, but I will to you--in strict confidence: <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that you're rather ashamed of your grievance, if you have any. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it's</b> nothing at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{only too}} true, Ida. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> before, and he himself almost told {{me as much}} with his own lips to-night. I don't {{think that it is}} a {{laughing}} matter." ...|$|R
2500|$|Emmert himself told ESPN's Bob Ley {{that the}} death penalty was [...] "unequivocally on the table" [...] as one of the {{possible}} sanctions. [...] However, he said, Penn State's swift corrective measures after the scandal broke out in full—including forcing out Spanier and Paterno—were significant factors in ultimately taking the death penalty off the table. [...] "Had Penn State not been as decisive as they were," [...] Emmert said, [...] "I don't know what the outcome would have been, but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> would have been significantly worse." [...] Emmert also repeated Ray's denial that Penn State had been threatened with a multi-year suspension had it not agreed to the penalties, saying there had been [...] "some confusion" [...] about those circumstances. [...] He did say, however, that if Erickson and Penn State had not signed the consent decree, the NCAA would have launched a full-blown infractions investigation that would have had [...] "an unknown outcome." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987 Powell joined {{other music}} greats for a jazz festival on the cruise ship SS Norway, playing {{alongside}} Benny Carter, Howard Alden, Milt Hinton, and Louie Bellson and others. One performance {{has been documented}} on the CD The Return of Mel Powell (Chiaroscuro Records). The recording includes 20 minutes of Powell discussing {{his life and his}} reasons for leaving jazz. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine jazz critic Whitney Balliett, Powell said: [...] "I have decided that when I retire I will think through my decision to leave jazz – with the help of Freud and Jung. At the moment, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> was this: I had done what I felt I had to do in jazz. I had decided it did not hold the deepest interest for me musically. And I had decided that it was a young man's music, even a black music. Also, the endless repetition of material in the Goodman band – playing the same tunes day after day and night after night – got to me. That repetition tended to kill spontaneity, which is the heart of jazz and which can give a lifetime's nourishment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] said he, laughing, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> is a lost goose after all. It will be {{hard work}} to get either of these birds, uncle. However, I'll try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly," [...] Ward said; [...] "but I don't think, {{from the}} {{condition}} of this trail, that they come in {{on this side of}} the range. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it's</b> too lonely even for a cattle-thief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{hopefully}} in {{love with}} your father," [...] Lady Cynthia confessed. [...] "It has been coming {{on for a long}} time. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> the first time I ever met him. Now I am absolutely certain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Do I? O, I don’t think so. What is better, I don’t feel so. Tope {{has made}} {{too much of}} <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect.</b> <b>It’s</b> his trade {{to make the most}} of {{everything}} appertaining to the Cathedral, you know.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's good to feel {{alive on}} a day like this, but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> was {{doubtful}} for a time whether I'd have that satisfaction," [...] Walthew remarked languidly. [...] "Guess I owe you both a good deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If your {{trump card}} is what <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> to be," [...] Mr. Hennibul said, [...] "I don't {{think you need}} fear that. Rochester would be ready enough to try it, but some of his {{supporters}} wouldn't listen to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "D--n his wife!" [...] said Stacy almost savagely. [...] "Leave {{her out of}} this. It's Van Loo that <b>I</b> <b>suspect.</b> <b>It</b> was Van Loo who I {{knew was}} behind it, who {{expected}} to profit by it, {{and now we have}} lost him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That girl up at Conant's sent a telegram, in {{a desperate}} hurry. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> meant {{something}} important. Who is she, O'Gorman, and why did the Chief cut under us by planting Sarah Judd in the Conants' household?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [With a smile.] <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> confess. I shouldn't {{have come}} only I {{wanted to see}} Lucy. I've been in the country all day, and I knew nothing about Macinnery's letter till I saw the {{placards}} at the station.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{what are}} you and papa plotting?" [...] asked Hedwig. [...] "I know there is {{something}} going on. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> when papa brought Werner Stauffacher and the other man here, and you wouldn't let me listen. What is it? Some dangerous scheme, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't know--may be anything. But <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> is {{the sequel}} {{of the story}} of the statues. In that case our friend the image-breaker has begun {{operations}} in another quarter of London. There's coffee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These {{things should}} be a warning, Jack," [...] he said. [...] "Still, one has to make allowances; this hot weather's trying, and Ellice got a letter that {{disturbed}} her by the last mail. I didn't hear what was in it, but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> was a bill." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR FATHER,--I do {{not know}} which of us is to blame; <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> is you this time. The last {{accounts}} of you were pretty good, I was pleased to see; I am, on the whole, very well--suffering a little still from my fever and liver complications, but better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "I {{never knew}} before that virtue got its reward so darned quick in this world. I {{rejected}} that high-ball not because <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> {{but out of}} pure goodness, because I had {{made up my mind}} that I was through with all that sort of thing." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not like}} to speak out too flatly, so I said <b>I</b> had <b>suspected</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me for a moment, and then her eyes again fell. [...] "Do not speak in that way," [...] she said; [...] "it is not right. Of course I was not sure that you loved me, but <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it,</b> and this was the very reason why I took my vow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must get}} in {{as soon as}} we can," [...] said I, in a low voice, [...] "for this boat may be discovered, and then there will be a rush for it. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> may have been {{reserved}} for the captain and some of the officers, but we have as much right in it as they." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So am I," [...] {{answered}} Anscombe, [...] "to {{know the}} name of the Lydenburg district architect whom I should like to employ; though <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> is the surroundings that make the place look so beautiful. Hullo! here comes somebody, but he doesn't look like an architect; he looks like a wicked baronet disguised as a Boer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You can’t have it. It’s {{all in my}} head. No {{woman will}} read it. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> was {{something}} that could never have been written. But what a farewell! And now I suppose we shall say good-bye without even a handshake. But you are safe! Only I must ask you not {{to come out of}} this room till I tell you you may.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, a hotel. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> all along. <b>I</b> {{picked up}} a tennis racket on the beach the first day; and after that I walked over the ridge and through the jungle and I could see {{the roof of the}} hotel. Only," [...] he added rather shamefacedly, [...] "I didn't like to tell her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} allow your drum to drag you into bad company again," [...] said he, and resumed his conversation. As <b>I</b> <b>suspected,</b> <b>it</b> was a {{vigorous}} condemnation of General Clark {{and his new}} expedition. I expressed my belief that {{the government did not}} regard it seriously, and would forbid the enterprise at the proper time.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is--how he dares, Queen. Still, {{that is his}} plot {{which he}} will carry through if he is able. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> from the first, {{and that is why}} I always opposed this visit to Memphis, but you will remember that you bade me be silent, saying that you had determined to see the most ancient city in Egypt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess he}} must do some good," [...] {{admitted}} Jenny Wren rather grudgingly. [...] "I've seen him picking up worms and grubs, but he likes grain, and I have a suspicion that if his family becomes very numerous, and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> will, they will eat more of Farmer Brown's grain than they will pay for by the worms and bugs they destroy. Hello! There's Dandy the Waxwing and his friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And living close by, {{she will}} not come on a visit, all festal, to resume home habits. No, you must make up your mind, Ethel--if, as you say, if--he will be a man for monopolies, and he will resent {{anything}} that he thinks management from you. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> is a real sign of the love that you deny, that he has ventured on the sister of a clever woman, living close by, {{and a good deal}} looked up to.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} a Jacobite among them, {{he will have a}} warm time of it; with Sir Wycherly, his nephew, and the vicar--all three of whom are raging lions, in the way of loyalty. There does, indeed, seem {{something}} out of the way, for those sounds, I should think, are the feet of servants, running to and fro. If the servants'-hall is in the condition <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>it</b> will as much need the aid of the parlour, as the parlour can possibly--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Insult!" [...] reiterated Mr. Ablewhite. [...] "I {{know your}} motive, Miss Verinder, for {{breaking}} your promise to my son! I know it as certainly {{as if you}} had confessed it in so many words. Your cursed family pride is insulting Godfrey, as it insulted ME when I married your aunt. Her family--her beggarly family--turned their backs on her for marrying an honest man, who had made his own place and won his own fortune. I had no ancestors. I wasn't descended from a set of cut-throat scoundrels who lived by robbery and murder. I couldn't point to the time when the Ablewhites hadn't a shirt to their backs, and couldn't sign their own names. Ha! ha! I wasn't good enough for the Herncastles, when I married. And now, it comes to the pinch, my son isn't good enough for YOU. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it,</b> all along. You have got the Herncastle blood in you, my young lady! <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> all along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{they carried}} me in. She {{was bound to}} have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which <b>I</b> <b>suspected.</b> <b>It</b> lay between that and her bedroom, and I was {{determined}} to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} I laughed through my tears, and that {{cemented}} the friendship between us. It was a lifelong friendship, though <b>I</b> little <b>suspected</b> <b>it</b> then.|$|R
