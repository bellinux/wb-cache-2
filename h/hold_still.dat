On her homeward leg, she touched in at Saugor on 27 November and Madras on 27 December. From there she reached St Helena on 18 March 1790. On 14 May she ran aground near the Brisou (Grange Chine), at the Isle of Wight. She was gotten off, but had {{extensive}} damage and 10 feet of water in her <b>hold.</b> <b>Still</b> she arrived in the Downs on 13 June.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} is {{the patient}} has to <b>hold</b> <b>still</b> {{for long periods of}} time in a noisy, cramped space while the imaging is performed. Claustrophobia severe enough to terminate the MRI exam is reported in up to 5% of patients. Recent improvements in magnet design including stronger magnetic fields (3 teslas), shortening exam times, wider, shorter magnet bores and more open magnet designs, have brought some relief for claustrophobic patients. However, for magnets with equivalent field strengths, there is often a trade-off between image quality and open design. MRI has great benefit in imaging the brain, spine, and musculoskeletal system. The use of MRI is currently contraindicated for patients with pacemakers, cochlear implants, some indwelling medication pumps, certain types of cerebral aneurysm clips, metal fragments in the eyes and some metallic hardware due to the powerful magnetic fields and strong fluctuating radio signals to which the body is exposed. Areas of potential advancement include functional imaging, cardiovascular MRI, and MRI-guided therapy.|$|E

500|$|MacFarlane {{has also}} {{appeared}} on news shows and late night television {{shows such as}} Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Late Show with David Letterman. On January 19, 2007, MacFarlane appeared on Countdown with Keith Olbermann on MSNBC to discuss Stephen Colbert's appearance on The O'Reilly Factor and Bill O'Reilly's return appearance on The Colbert Report. MacFarlane introduced the segment by saying in Stewie's voice [...] "Oh, wait Bill. <b>Hold</b> <b>still,</b> allow me to soil myself on you. Victory is mine!" [...] Three months later on March 24, 2007, MacFarlane was interviewed on Fox's Talkshow with Spike Feresten, and closed the show by singing the Frank Sinatra song [...] "You Make Me Feel So Young". He also provided Stewie's voice when he appeared as a brain tumor-induced hallucination to Seeley Booth in an episode of Bones, writing his own dialogue for the episode. On May 8, 2009, MacFarlane was a guest on Real Time with Bill Maher.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to <b>hold</b> <b>still....</b> It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Children are genearally {{excluded}} from modeling nude for classes. [...] The minimum age can vary, but is often 15 to 18. Despite being nonsexual in nature, {{this may be}} influenced by the age of consent (i.e. at or slightly below). Children are not good candidates for art modeling since they lack the ability to <b>hold</b> <b>still.</b> A small number of photographers have done fine art works of nude children, under special circumstances, such as Sally Mann photographing her own children. Less well-known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children. Jock Sturges photographed entire families of naturists which lead to an FBI investigation. Some writers characterize many of these images as sexualizing children regardless of artistic merit.|$|E
2500|$|Mann's ninth book, Hold Still: A Memoir with Photographs, {{released}} May 12, 2015, is a {{melding of}} {{a memoir of}} her youth, an examination of some major influences of her life, and reflections on how photography shapes one's view of the world. It is augmented with photographs, letters, and other memorabilia. She singles out her [...] "near-feral" [...] childhood and her subsequent introduction to photography at Putney, her relationship to her husband of 40 years and his parent's mysterious death, and her maternal Welsh relative's nostalgia for land morphing into her love for her land in the Shenandoah Valley as some of her important influences. Gee-Gee, a black woman who was a surrogate parent, who opened Mann's eyes to race relations and exploitation, her relationship with Cy Twombly, and her father's genteel southern legacy and his eventual death are also examined. The New York Times describes it as [...] "an instant classic among Southern memoirs of the last 50 years." [...] An article by Mann adapted from this book appeared with photographs in The New York Times Magazine in April 2015. <b>Hold</b> <b>Still</b> was {{a finalist for the}} 2015 National Book Award.|$|E
