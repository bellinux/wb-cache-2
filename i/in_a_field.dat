40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to mark out and {{describe}} different types of combining university studies with work among 4 th year university students of Yaroslavl and Tatarstan and to analyze their influence on academic achievement. Seven ‘study-work’ types are defined on the basis of two variables: work schedule and work relatedness to specialty. 1) Full-time work from the 1 st- 2 nd university year not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specialty <b>field</b> (223 students), 2) Full-time work during senior university years not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specialty <b>field</b> (264 students); 3) Part-time work / working from time to time not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specialty <b>field</b> (1101 students); 4) Full-time work from the 1 st - 2 nd university year <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specialty <b>field</b> (114 students), 5) Full-time work during senior university years <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specialty <b>field</b> (127 students); 6) Part-time work / working from time to time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specialty <b>field</b> (491 students); 7) Only studying and not enrolled in working during university (1023 students). Every type is characterized from the point of view of academic achievement, motivation to study, future plans and some other important variables. One of the main results is that part-time work <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specialty <b>field</b> doesn’t have <b>a</b> negative influence on academic achievement and can even be beneficial to the learning process...|$|R

In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors.

5|$|Bird predators may seize {{anywhere}} from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony. The fish crow (Corvus ossifragus) is common raider of American white ibis nests, accounting {{for up to}} 44% of egg loss <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> study at Battery Island, North Carolina. Other predators of eggs and young include the boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), gulls, and possibly vultures, {{as well as the}} common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and rat snakes (Elaphe species). Egg predation rates of the American white ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness by the parents, especially during the last week of incubation. High nest densities and reduced synchrony increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer incubation times, as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation.|$|E
