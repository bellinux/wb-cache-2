50|$|<b>Endomyces</b> is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Dipodascaceae.|$|E
5000|$|Lymexylon, Elateroides, and Melittomma are pests {{to forest}} trees such as chestnut, poplar, and oak, {{and can be}} found worldwide. Some species are parasitic, causing decay in living trees and {{damaging}} timber structures such as houses and ships. Wood boring activities occur primarily in the larva stage, with the larvae damaging both sapwood and heartwood. Lymexylidae larvae bore into living and decaying wood (e.g. Chestnut, Populus, and Oak) where they consume the fungus <b>Endomyces</b> hylecoeti.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{inoculum}} in mycangia are fungi. The symbiotic inoculum of most {{bark and}} ambrosia beetles are fungi belonging to Ophiostomatales (Ascomycota: Sordariomycetidae) and Microascales (Ascomycota: Hypocreomycetidae). Symbiotic fungi in mycangia of woodwasps are Amylostereaceae (Basidiomycota: Russulales). Symbiotic fungi in mycangia of lizard beetles are yeast (Ascomycota: Saccharomycetales). Symbiotic fungi in mycangia of ship-timber beetles are <b>Endomyces</b> (Ascomycota: Dipodascaceae). Symbiotic fungi in mycangia of leaf-rolling weevils are Penicillium fungi (Ascomycota: Trichocomaceae). In {{addition to the}} above primary symbiotic fungi, secondary fungi and some bacteria have been isolated from mycangia.|$|E
50|$|Specifically, {{this species}} has evolved a {{relationship}} with the yeast-like fungus <b>Endomyces</b> hylecoeti. Every egg the female lays is coated with fungal spores from a pouch near her ovipositor. The larvae hatch and subsequently collect some of the spores by remaining close to the egg shells for a period of time, before tunneling further into the wood. The fungi grow on the tunnel walls created by the larvae. The larvae then consume the fungus, rather than the wood itself. As the fungi require air flow to grow, the larvae ensure the tunnels are free of any debris.|$|E
50|$|As Wilhelm Zopf {{obtained}} his degree, simultaneously, {{he backed}} to Berlin {{as an adjunct}} professor teaching at the Agricultural College for a few years. In 1883, {{he was invited to}} be a head of the cryptogamic laboratory at the University of Halle. In the period of 1883 to 1899, he made extensive studies on Chytridiales and other small aquatic fungi parasitic in algae and small animals. Likewise, he also published an authoritative fungal textbook in which he followed a classification similar in part to that of Julius Oscar Brefeld but placed Ascomycetes last in 1890. In this group, he made them went from the simple forms, like Saccharomyces, <b>Endomyces,</b> Gymnoascaceae, to Pezizales. In addition, he recognized the formation of ascogonia in many ascomycetes and even the union of these in Pyronema, with club-shaped “pollinodia”, but expressed doubt as to their real sexual function.|$|E
40|$|A new fungal {{species has}} been {{described}} {{and placed in the}} genus <b>Endomyces.</b> <b>Endomyces</b> tetrasperma forms a true septate, multinucleate mycelium which breaks up into arthrospores. Ascus formation occurs after isogamous copulation between sexual protuberances which develop at the ends of arthrospores or between two cells, adjacent mycelial cells, or arthrospores. The asci which dehisce at maturity release two to four smooth, ovoid, thick-walled spores, each containing two oil droplets. The proposed life cycle is based on morphological and cytological observations...|$|E
40|$|From the {{standpoint}} of botanical terminology the name Monilia should not {{be applied to the}} human pathogens since a group of sapro-phytic fungi are so called. However, usage has designated the term Monilia familiar to medical mycologists as a yeastlike organism devoid of ascospores, reproducing by budding, and under certain conditions developing mycelia (1, 2). The other organisms closely related to the Moniliae are <b>Endomyces,</b> Cryptococci and S&charomyces. The following chart illustrates the essential morphological points of difference between these organisms. Yeastlike fungi myceli...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{distribution}} of pH inside the yeast <b>Endomyces</b> magnusii was measured at 1 μm resolution using different external pH values. In a neutral buffer the pH of the cytoplasm was 6. 7 – 7. 2 in the center, decreasing to 6. 0 toward {{the periphery of}} the cell. A decrease of external pH was followed by a gradual uniform decrease of internal pH. Using a comparison of the ‘pH map’ with phase-contrast picture of the same cell, the pH of the vacuoles was estimated to be 5. 5 – 5. 6...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Ca 2 + uptake by {{mitochondria}} {{from the}} yeast <b>Endomyces</b> magnusii has earlier {{been found to}} be driven by the membrane potential and to be stimulated by spermine. It thus functions in a similar fashion as the animal mitochondrial calcium uniporter. Here, it is shown that the uptake is stimulated, i. e., Ca 2 + can be accumulated from lower [Ca 2 +], under hypotonic conditions. Ruthenium Red, an inhibitor of the animal uniporter, under certain conditions, stimulates the yeast uniporter. The mechanism of the stimulation by hypotonicity and Ruthenium Red is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{growth is}} the most {{frequent}} cause of spoilage in baked goods. During {{the last few years}} there has been a growing interest in biopreservation of foods by using lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Their preserving effect mainly relates to the formation of such metabolite products as acids and hydrogen peroxide, competition for nutrients, and production of bacteriocins. This paper describes the potential of LAB to inhibit the growth of Penicillium, Eurotium, <b>Endomyces</b> and Aspergillus (the Culture Collection of Biocentrum, DTU, Denmark) species isolated from bakery products by using an overlay assay method and a three point inoculation method.

40|$|During {{the course}} of an {{investigation}} of amylolytic enzyme production using <b>Endomyces</b> sp. it appeared desirable to use media containing rice-bran. In an effort to determine the effect of rice-bran, several components of rice-bran were added to the media. It might be concluded from the results of these investigations that rice oil was effective for the production of amylolytic enzyme. The other vegetable and animal oils were also effective for production of the enzyme. Moreover, it has been found that rice oil in the medium was assimilated. Lipase was produced a little in the medium by the microorganism. The addition of mixed fatty acids which were obtained from rice oil by saponification was effective for the amylolytic enzyme poroduction and additional fatty acids were utilized...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSpermine at {{concentrations}} of 12 – 100 μM considerably activates the Ca 2 + transport {{system of the}} <b>Endomyces</b> magnusii yeast mitochondria. As a result, {{in the presence of}} spermine the mitochondria are able to decrease extramitochondrial Ca 2 + to the physiological level. At Ca 2 + concentrations up to 200 μM, spermine enhances the initial rate of Ca 2 + uptake (a half-maximal effect at 12 μM spermine). The Ca 2 + concentrations required for half-maximal Ca 2 + uptake rate to be achieved were 160 and 60 μM Ca 2 + without and with spermine, respectively. Spermidine is shown to be less effective (a half-maximal effect at 50 – 100 μM spermidine). The polyamines do not change the parameters of energy coupling of mitochondria. The data obtained enabled the yeast mitochondria to be considered to take part in regulation of cytoplasmic and matrix Ca 2 +...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this report}} was to {{optimize}} the hydrolysis of the cell walls (CWs) from the yeast <b>Endomyces</b> fibuliger grown in mussel processing wastewaters (MPW) to establish a more accurate protocol for analyzing {{the composition of the}} monosaccharides in these CWs. Therefore, a kinetic study of CW hydrolysis and polysaccharide standards (mannan and curdlan) was performed to determine the effect of different temperatures and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) concentrations on this process. In all cases, the experimental data were fit satisfactorily to Saeman's equation with an Arrhenius relation between rate constants and the temperature effect. Optimal conditions for curdlan and mannan hydrolysis were achieved with 70 % TFA at 100 °C for 2. 3 h and 50 % TFA at 100 °C for 2. 6 h, respectively. The best operating options for CW hydrolysis were 100 °C/ 70 % TFA for 4. 58 h, 100 °C/ 50 % TFA for 4. 08 h and 100 °C/ 70 % TFA for 3. 27 h for the maximum production of glucose, mannose and reducing sugars, respectively.

40|$|In {{the case}} of the {{serological}} identification of yeasts, the direct application of the serum reaction, which can be used in bacteriological differentiation, seems to be unreliable. Hence the interrelationship between the several yeasts was examined by the writers by means of the reactions of agglutination, precipitin and complement fixation. The yeasts used were as follows: <b>Endomyces</b> fibuliger Lindner, Zygosaccharomyces Barkeri Saccardo-Sydow, Debaryomyces globosus Klecker, Saccharomyces sake Yabe (sake yeast), bottom beer yeast 2 ̆ 2 Asahi, 2 ̆ 2 Schizosaccharomyces octosporus Beijerinek and Torula C. Yeasts which are included in different genera according to the botanical classification, were clearly distinguished from each other by the agglutinin test. Especially, a high agglutination reaction was recognised in both Debaryomyces globosus and Torula C. In the cases of Saccharomyces species as sake yeast and beer yeast, however, their aggultinating powers were very closely related. Employing Fornet 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Ringprobe 2 ̆ 2 to carry on the precipitin test, the writers have used the maceration juices prepared from the yeasts modifying Lebedew 2 ̆ 7 s method. The maceration juice was prepared as follows: The yeast cells which had been grown in Koji extract were filtered, washed with water, and dehydrated by spreading them on clay plates. The dried yeast powders were mixed with water in the proportion of 0. 5 mg : 1 cc., then the mixture was incubated for 24 hours at a temperature of 30 ℃. The clear juice separated by centrifugation was diluted with equal volumes of 1. 7...|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} studies, the yeast <b>Endomyces</b> fibuliger LU 677 {{was found to}} degrade amygdalin in bitter apricot seeds. The present investigation shows that E. fibuliger LU 677 produces extracellular beta-glycosidase activity when grown in malt extract broth (MEB). Growth {{was very good at}} 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C and slightly less at 35 degrees C. When grown in MEB of pH 5 and pH 6 with addition of 0, 10 or 100 ppm amygdalin, E. fibuliger produced only slightly more biomass at pH 5, and was only slightly inhibited in the presence of amygdalin. Approximately, 60 % of the added amygdalin was degraded (fastest at 35 degrees C) during an incubation period of 5 days. Supernatants of cultures grown at 25 degrees C and pH 6 for 5 days were tested for the effects of pH and temperature on activity (using amygdalin, linamarin and prunasin as substrates). Prunase activity had two pH optima (pH 4 and pH 6), amygdalase and linamarase only one each at pH 6 and pH 4 - 5 respectively. The linamarase activity evolved earlier than amygdalase (2 days and 4 days respectively). The data thus indicate the presence of at least two different glycosidases having different pH optima and kinetics of excretion. In the presence of amygdalin, lower glycosidase activities were generally produced. However, the amygdalin was degraded {{from the start of the}} growth, strongly indicating an uptake of amygdalin by the cells. The temperature optimum for all activities was at 40 degrees C. Activities of amygdalase (assayed at pH 4) and linamarase (at pH 6) evolving during the growth of E. fibuliger were generally higher in cultures grown at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. TLC analysis of amygdalin degradation products show a two-stage sequential mechanism as follows: (1) amygdalin to prunasin and (2) prunasin to cyanohydrin...|$|E
40|$|Sourdough {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} were selected for antifungal activity by a conidial germination assay. The 10 -fold-concentrated culture filtrate of Lactobacillus plantarum 21 B grown in wheat flour hydrolysate almost completely inhibited Eurotium repens IBT 18000, Eurotium rubrum FTDC 3228, Penicillium corylophilum IBT 6978, Penicillium roqueforti IBT 18687, Penicillium expansum IDM/FS 2, <b>Endomyces</b> fibuliger IBT 605 and IDM 3812, Aspergillus niger FTDC 3227 and IDM 1, Aspergillus flavus FTDC 3226, Monilia sitophila IDM/FS 5, and Fusarium graminearum IDM 623. The nonconcentrated culture filtrate of L. plantarum 21 B grown in whole wheat flour hydrolysate had similar inhibitory activity. The activity was fungicidal. Calcium propionate at 3 mg ml− 1 was not effective under the same assay conditions, while sodium benzoate caused inhibition similar to L. plantarum 21 B. After extraction with ethyl acetate, preparative silica gel thin-layer chromatography, and chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses, novel antifungal compounds such as phenyllactic and 4 -hydroxy-phenyllactic acids were identified in the culture filtrate of L. plantarum 21 B. Phenyllactic acid was contained at the highest concentration in the bacterial culture filtrate and had the highest activity. It inhibited all the fungi tested at a concentration of 50 mg ml− 1 except for P. roqueforti IBT 18687 and P. corylophilum IBT 6978 (inhibitory concentration, 166 mg ml− 1). L. plantarum 20 B, which showed high antimold activity, was also selected. Preliminary studies showed that phenyllactic and 4 -hydroxy-phenyllactic acids were also contained in the bacterial culture filtrate of strain 20 B. Growth of A. niger FTDC 3227 occurred after 2 days in breads started with Saccharomyces cerevisiae 141 alone or with S. cerevisiae and Lactobacillus brevis 1 D, an unselected but acidifying lactic acid bacterium, while the onset of fungal growth was delayed for 7 days in bread started with S. cerevisiae and selected L. plantarum 21 B...|$|E
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{produces}} several β- 1, 3 -glucanases, but {{lacks the}} multicomponent cellulase complexes that hydrolyse the β- 1, 4 -linked glucose polymers present in cellulose-rich biomass {{as well as}} in haze-forming glucans in certain wines and beers. We have introduced into S. cerevisiae a functional cellulase complex for efficient cellulose degradation by cloning the <b>Endomyces</b> fibuliger cellobiase (BGL 1) gene and co-expressing it with the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanase (END 1), the Phanerochaete chrysosporium cellobiohydrolase (CBH 1) and the Ruminococcus flavefaciens cellodextrinase (CEL 1) gene constructs in this yeast. The END 1, CBH 1 and CEL 1 genes were inserted into yeast expression/secretion cassettes. Expression of END 1, CBH 1 and CEL 1 was directed by the promoter sequences derived from the alcohol dehydrogenase II (ADH 2), the phosphoglycerate kinase I (PKG 1) and the alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADH 1) genes, respectively. In contrast, BGL 1 was expressed under the control of its native promoter. Secretion of End 1 p and Cel 1 p was directed by the signal sequence of the yeast mating pheromone α-factor (MFα 1), whereas Cbh 1 p and Bgl 1 p were secreted using their authentic leader peptides. The construction of a fur 1 ura 3 S. cerevisiae strain allowed for the autoselection of this multicopy URA 3 -based plasmid in rich medium. S. cerevisiae transformants secreting biologically active endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanase, cellobiohydrolase, cellodextrinase and cellobiase were able to degrade various substrates including carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, laminarin, barley glucan, cellobiose, polypectate, birchwood xylan and methyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. This study could lead to the development of industrial strains of S. cerevisiae capable of converting cellulose in a one-step process into commercially important commodities. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Since it {{has been}} shown {{recently}} (1) that pyrithiamine, x the pyridine analog of thiamine, will produce symptoms of thiamine deficiency in mice, it was of interest to determine whether this substance would be effective as an inhibitor of the growth of other living things. Robbins (2) has shown that two fungi grew very poorly when this compound was added to the basal medium. In the present study, many species of bacteria, yeasts, and fungi have been tested quantitatively for ability to grow in the presence of pyrithiamine. It was found that without exception those organisms which needed thiamine in the medium for maximal growth were prevented from growing by small amounts of pyrithiamine, and that those which did not need thiamine were unaffected even by considerable concentrations of the pyrithiamine in the medium. Those organisms which were not affected by pyrithiamine did not synthesize large amounts of thiamine. Even when grown in a medium which contained considerable pyrithiamine, such organisms failed to produce increased amounts of thiamine. The failure of pyrithiamine to inhibit such organisms, therefore, could not be attributed to increased production of thiamine. And thus the explanation of sulfonamide fastness of certain bacteria by the increased production of the structurally-related p-amino benzoic acid (3) did not find analogy here. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that such insusceptible organisms grown either in {{the presence or absence of}} pyrithiamine did not produce detectable amounts of an antagonist other than thiamine which would be capable of reversing the inhibition of a susceptible organism.
