500|$|In the {{following}} duet the voices are homophonic {{for most of}} the time, but with little rhythmical differences, showing their different attitude to the darkness of the grave (...) : the alto expresses [...] "" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>truly</b> fear) on steady long notes, whereas the tenor tells in ornamented figuration [...] "" [...] (I do not fear). In the continuation they also deviate only on one word, [...] "" [...] (lamented) in the alto, [...] "" [...] (hoped) in the tenor. The flowing 12/8 time signature of the duet and a virtuoso solo violin are reminiscent of the original purpose of the music in the congratulatory cantata. It is most fitting for the middle section of the da capo form, when both voices agree: [...] "" [...] (Now my heart is full of comfort).|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} game, Chunsoft {{released}} an original video animation in December 2011. Created by the Japanese animation studio Gonzo, the animation {{serves as an}} introduction to the game, showcasing the characters and the basic Ambidex Game rules. As well as the video animation, a Flash game was produced and made available on the Japanese Virtue's Last Reward website. The gameplay of the Flash game has the player attempt to open a metal door by quickly clicking on it. As the door begins to open, Clover is revealed on the other side, and the player begins clicking on her breasts. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku was perplexed by the Flash game, stating that: [...] "as it is pretty much the antithesis of everything presented in Virtue's Last Reward, <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> wonder how this Flash game is supposed to convince anyone to play the full title. Perhaps it's just due to a [...] department following the old adage: 'sex sells'." ...|$|E

In 1963, a four-season {{starting}} quarterback battle began that continued until Lamonica {{left for the}} Raiders. Lamonica felt he [...] "...learned a lot from Jack about quarterbacking. [...] And <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> believe that we were a great one-two punch at the position for the Bills." [...] In 1963, Kemp led the Bills from a slow start to a tie for the AFL Eastern Division lead with a 7–6–1 record. Kemp again placed second in passing attempts, completions, and yards, and he also finished second to teammate Cookie Gilchrist in rushing touchdowns. The Bills played the Boston Patriots in an Eastern Division playoff game to determine the division title on December 28 at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, in [...] weather. [...] During the game, Buffalo replaced Kemp with Lamonica after falling behind 16–0, but still lost 26–8.|$|E
500|$|Gough and Millar {{always had}} {{intentions}} of bringing Christopher Reeve onto the show. When the pair learned Reeve enjoyed watching Smallville, Gough and Millar decided {{they were going}} to bring him on for season two. They had already crafted a character, Dr. Virgil Swann, they knew would reveal the truth about Krypton to Clark, and they decided Reeve would be perfect for the part. According to Gough and Millar, it was [...] "natural" [...] for Reeve {{to be the one to}} educate Clark about his past, and help him see his future. As Gough describes it, the scene between Clark and Dr. Swann is a [...] "passing of the torch" [...] moment for the series. Gough and Millar explain the importance of the character: [...] "Dr. Swann provided the first tantalizing answers to the quest plaguing Clark for all of his young life. 'Where am I from?' 'What happened to my parents?' 'Am <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> alone?" [...] The creative team flew to New York to film Reeve's scenes since he used a wheelchair and required additional assistance when travelling. Although James Marshall directed the episode, for Reeve's scenes in New York the Smallville crew sent Greg Beeman as a stand-in director. Gough, Welling and Mat Beck travelled alongside Beeman to New York, where John Wells, who had previously lent his White House office on The West Wing to the Smallville crew for season one's [...] "Hourglass", allowed the team to use the production offices from Third Watch for Reeve's scenes.|$|E

500|$|... "Dwight Christmas" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} story editor Robert Padnick, marking his fourth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the seventh season. It was directed by Charles McDougall, his first directing credit for the season. McDougal's first job for the series was directing its first Christmas episode during the show's second season. The basic plot of the episode, involving Belsnickel, had originally been conceived during the writing for fourth season {{and was going to}} air as that year's Christmas installment. However, the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike halted production, and the unfinished script was never used. According to executive producer and showrunner Greg Daniels, the writing staff wanted to use the premise for many years, but could never find a right time to implement it, until an opportunity during the show's last season presented itself. Before the episode aired, Kemper, in an interview with TV Guide said that [...] "I feel like I might be expected to say this because it is the last one, but <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> love this episode so much" [...] and that she [...] "specifically love Dwight's storyline" [...] because [...] "he brings in his family Christmas traditions. I've always held Dwight as one of my favorite characters and now 'Dwight Christmas' just takes it to a new level." [...] Fischer said that filming the last Christmas episode was [...] "emotional" [...] and regretted not being able to have Mindy Kaling, who portrayed Kelly Kapoor on the series, film a karaoke scene. This is the second episode of season nine to not feature Andy or Clark. Ed Helms, who portrayed Andy, left the show temporarily in the season's sixth episode [...] "The Boat" [...] in order to film The Hangover Part III, whereas Clark Duke, who portrayed Clark, left for a few episodes to film Kick-Ass 2.|$|E
500|$|A video {{confession}} {{which was}} released {{at the same}} time and broadcast on China Central Television confirmed his identity. In the 10-minute exclusive video, a tearful Gui expressed his remorse over a killing charge that he had absconded from a decade earlier. He said that his return to mainland China and his surrender were [...] "my personal choice and had nothing to do with anyone else. I should shoulder my responsibility and I don't want any individual or institutions to interfere, or viciously hype up my return". Gui also said, [...] "Although I have Swedish citizenship, <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> feel that I am still Chinese — my roots are in China. So I hope Sweden can respect my personal choice, respect my rights and privacy of my personal choice and allow me to resolve my own problems". Criminal investigations on other charges were said to be in progress. It was only on 19 January, when fellow Swedish citizen Peter Dahlin, cofounder of an NGO providing legal training for local lawyers in China, appeared on television, confessing to having violated Chinese law and [...] "caused harm to the Chinese government [...] hurt the feelings of the Chinese people", that it came to international attention that Gui had also confessed on television; Dahlin was subsequently deported. Reporters Without Borders condemned China's forced confessions, and urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for [...] "knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress". Lee Bo's letter to his wife on 17 January said that he had voluntarily gone to the mainland to assist Chinese law enforcement in an investigation that involved Gui. He denounced Gui as [...] "a morally unacceptable person" [...] who had got him into trouble with the authorities.|$|E
