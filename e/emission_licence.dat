40|$|Green {{taxes are}} used widely {{overseas}} and increasingly in Australia. There are four main categories. 1. Taxes, levies, fees and other charges, including development taxes, rezoning charges, emission charges, <b>emission</b> <b>licence</b> fees, environmental protection charges, input taxes, resource rents and royalties, sliding charges for utilities, and product levies. 2. Tradeable, bankable and marketable rights and credits, including tradeable emission rights, emission reduction credits, transferable development credits, tradeable resource quotas, and tradeable emission leases. 3. Other economic instruments such as refundable deposits, performance bonds and guarantess, and subsidies, 4. Income tax concessions and differential sales taxes and import duties. Recent High Court authority suggests that whilst {{some of these}} instrucments would be excises and hence could be imposed only by the Commonwealth, most could also be imposed by state government and some also by local government. Their economic and policy advantages and disadvantages are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} dynamic {{efficiency}} of an emission regulation regime where companies competitively pay for emission licences. We embed the <b>emission</b> <b>licence</b> market in a Cournot model where {{the price of}} emission licences is subject to strategic tradeoff between licences and abatement technologies. Unlike the standard Cournot model, agents have two action parameters, quantities bought on the licence market and investments into abatement technology. We want to investigate {{the implications of this}} market design on the strategic behavior regarding companies' incentives to invest in those technologies. Data from a series of laboratory experiments supports the theoretical predictions for subjects' investment into abatement technology. With respect to the adaptation process of individual quantities for licences we find that a majority of subjects adjusts on the market by imitation while a minority entertains a trial and error notion.

40|$|The Department of Environment and Conservation is a {{government}} department of Western Australia. It was established in 2006, and it combined the Department of Environment and the Department of Conservation and Land Management. The DEC is responsible for ensuring that the environment {{in the state of}} Western Australia is protected and conserved. There are many departments within the DEC. One of the major departments within the DEC is the Licensing and Regulation department. This department deals with the licensing and regulation of commercial premises and their operations on site. No emission can be discharged into the environment without an <b>emission</b> <b>licence</b> from the DEC. To acquire the appropriate licence, the proponent has to justify and prove to DEC that the emission to the environment will not {{have a significant impact on}} the surrounding environment and the welfare of the public. Currently the application process is slow and inconsistent. This has prompted a department wide reform project to look into the methodology of the application process to see whether it can be improved to make the application process more efficient and productive. This document is a result of the reform project and is the first stepping stone for a total reform of the applications for emissions to water, air and land...|$|E
25|$|In 2013, 61,7% of {{the energy}} {{produced}} was renewable, including 30.4% hydroelectric, 24.1% from wind, 5.2% from biomass, 0.9% solar energy and 1.1% from other renewable energy sources, particularly geothermical energy in the Azores. Thanks to this energetic strategy, during 2013 Portugal had reduced to only 5% the energy that it imports. Fossil fuels are still the source of 38.3% or the energy produced, but the trend is to diminish. In 2013, {{the increase in the}} production of clean energy helped to save 806 million Euros in the imports of fossil fuels and CO2 <b>emission</b> <b>licences.</b> From the beginning, Portugal has opted not to invest in Nuclear Power, so there are not any plants of that kind in the country.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the frame}} of the {{ecological}} policy, there exists a number of instruments for a protection of environment and to solve problems related to it. Single types of instruments are established on diferent principles which leads to long-lasting arguments of economists on fitness or unfitness for purpose. At the application of administrative instruments of regulation, as it is described by neoclassical economy theory, a question arises, if this strict solution is effective and practical in light of meeting targets of the environmental policy. Arguments which hold the view that the EU Directive on industrial emissions in the metallurgy sector implementation, as an above mentioned administrative instrument, is effective and practical can be displaced in case of comparison with well set alternative instrument - marketable <b>emission</b> <b>licences...</b>|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{opportunities}} for reduction of CO 2 emissions {{can be of}} strategic importance in the future due to such policy instruments as green certificates, trading in CO 2 <b>emissions</b> <b>licences</b> and long-term agreements between government and industry. The {{pulp and paper industry}} is an industry branch with large heat demands. The heat demands are covered by large amounts of bio fuel but also by fossil fuels. Process integration in the pulp and paper industry reduces the fuel demand {{but at the same time}} reduces the possibilities for backpressure production. Different measures will influence the fuel demand/electricity production ratio in different ways. Depending on the type of fuel reduced in the system, the CO 2 reduction opportunities also differ. The focus in this study is on a wider system aspect for some process integration measures. The measures in question are improved heat exchanging, heat pumping and process integrated evaporation, which all have proven to be economically favourable in previous studies. Evaluation and discussion on how the CO 2 reduction opportunities depend on different measures and conditions are performed within the study. The results are discussed from both societies and industry’s perspective and based on a case study...|$|R
40|$|International {{commitments}} {{constitute a}} considerable {{challenge for the}} climate policy pursued in Austria. In 1997, the first obligatory targets for greenhouse gas emission rates were defined by the Kyoto Protocol, and Austria, {{within the scope of}} an internal EU burden sharing agreement, agreed to cut its emissions by 13 percent against the 1990 level. The Kyoto Protocol raised great expectations with regard to reducing anthropogenic effects on the climate change. In November 2000, the Sixth Session of the UN FCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 6) will be held in The Hague. Its outcome is likely to affect the probability that the Kyoto Protocol will be ratified. Achieving the emission targets is to be facilitated by the introduction of so-called flexible mechanisms laid down in the Kyoto Protocol, which include emission trading. A key aspect of emission trading is its economic efficiency, i. e., it provides a market mechanism to ensure that necessary reductions will be made where their costs are lowest. Emission trading is also effective from an environmental policy point of view because it makes sure that the specified environmental goal will be attained. The trade in <b>emission</b> <b>licences</b> offers an incentive to exceed individual goals and thus be able to sell surplus licences. This provides an incentive to search for cost-effective ways to reduce emissions, which in turn promotes technical change and the development of environmentally friendly technologies. Key aspects of the framework for national CO 2 emission trading system are the sectoral emission structure and existing taxes on energy. From the sectoral emission structure in Austria {{it can be seen that}} CO 2 emissions in manufacturing are concentrated on a few sectors and a small number of companies. With regard to energy-related taxes, consideration should be given to how taxation can be used for companies and sectors which do not participate in the emission trading system.

40|$|In recent years, a {{new class}} of compact {{vehicles}} has been emerging and wide-spreading all around Europe: the quadricycle. These four-wheeled motor vehicles, originally derived from motorcycles, are a small and fuel-efficient mean of transportation used in rural or urban areas as an alternative to motorbikes or city cars. In some countries, they are also endorsed by local authorities and institutions which support small and environmentally-friendly vehicles. In this paper, several general considerations on quadricycles will be provided including the vehicle classification, evolution of regulations (as homologation, driver <b>licence,</b> <b>emissions,</b> etc), technical characteristics, safety requirements, most relevant investigations, and other additional useful information (e. g. references, links). It represents an important and actual topic of investigation for designers and manufacturers considering that the new EU regulation on the approval and market surveillance of quadricycles will soon enter in force providing conclusive requirements for functional safety environmental protection of these promising vehicles...|$|R
