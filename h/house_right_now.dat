5000|$|After their {{marriage}} takes place {{they return to}} Rameez's home and Rameez takes a few pictures of Haya and suddenly she faints. Rameez takes her to the hospital. He even informs Hadi. Hadi reaches the hospital immediately. Rameez asks him if he can stay with Haya for sometime in the hospital as {{he has to go}} back home. Hadi agrees. When Hadi and Haya are in the hospital's room, Rameez takes a few pictures of them through a small window of the room. Hadi tells Haya that now she is not alone,she has a husband, she should think about Rameez.When Haya and Rameez reach back home, Rameez tells her that how he had always wished for a house in which his beautiful wife and he would cook food for themselves together.It is then shown that Haya is leaving for her Taya (Hadi's father) and Tai (Hadi's mother) house for some days according to a rasam. Rameez asks her to stay but she says that she would be back in some days. Then she leaves.At her Tai's house Haya receives Rameez's call,who asks her to come back as he is feeling alone.when Haya refuses to do so, Rameez says that he is coming to her <b>house</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> because he is missing her a lot [...] She says that it's not possible as his house is far away from her house, it would take hours to reach there, and she is stunned when she turns around to see Rameez standing near the door.Haya comes to know that Hadi has started taking patients (which he had stopped before because of the death of his first wife Uroosa). Her Tai in shock talks to Haya and says that I wonder how he agreed on taking cases once again. Haya says it's because of me, I asked him to do so. She says {{that there should be a}} party because it's a big news. They should celebrate. Her Tai even tells Rameez about this, who also seems to be happy.On the other hand, Fareesa goes to meet Saim, who tells her that he would be leaving for America soon as he cannot stay longer. His company has asked him to come back. Fareesa gets angry. She says to him that she cannot live without him, to which he replies by saying that he cannot too.As Fareesa had gone to meet Saim and refused to prepare lunch for Hadi, which is to be sent to his hospital, Haya prepares his lunch. While Haya is preparing his lunch Rameez arrives there and asks her whether she would prepare the lunch for him in the same way, as she is preparing for Hadi. She replies [...] "Yes ! I would."When Hadi receives his lunch box at his hospital he sees that there is a note inside the lunch box as well. The not is from Haya and she has written on the note [...] "Just for HS." [...] Hadi smiles and begins eating his lunch.When he reaches back at his home he is ecstatic to see the house's dining room decorated and everyone standing there waiting for him to cut the cake. He cuts the cake and suddenly Fareesa appears. She asks what is going on. Hadi's mother tells her that it's a celebration and also tells her the reason behind it [...] She says that why doesn't she asks him (Hadi) what happened that made him take this decision.But Haya, interrupts her. Hadi's mom takes him to a side and tells him that Haya is not willing to go back with Rameez. She says that Hadi know better than her about Haya, and requests him to ask her to leave, it will be better for her and as well as you. Hadi leaves the party and goes to his room. Haya arrives there and asks him why he left the party and came here. He tells Haya that he is not interested in this party and she should leave him alone. He says that he is suffering from a headache and wants to rest. Haya asks him if her Tai said something regarding her to him. He says no he just wants her to leave and live with her husband. She asks him that he is asking her to live with her husband, but before saying that he should first think about him and Fareesa and why they don't even live the same room, even when they are husband and wife. He says that it's not about him and Fareesa it's about Haya and Rameez. She says that she wants to leave Hadi and start her life with Rameez. At last he says [...] "Yes !" [...] Haya leaves his room. Feeling dejected,Haya then tells Rameez to take her back to their home. Once they reach their home, Rameez gifts her a dress and asks her to wear it. After that, he asks her if she would do everything that she does for HS. He shows her pictures that he took of her and Hadi in hospital. Haya gets shocked.Rameez asks her that does she think that he is a fool. He had seen her love for Hadi way before.He grabs her hand and hurts her when she is sleeping for her to wake up get ready for his own entertainment.He asks her to make lunch and breakfast for him. And gets excited on seeing the lunchbox( [...] Apparently he had seen a dream about it). He tells haya that he has finished off her balance on her phone and would take it with him. He has also disconnected landline and internet connection and anyway by which she could communicate with anyone.Haya gets perplexed about the happenings with her.While Hadi is trying to get back to Fareesa, Fareesa avoids him. He sees her while she's talking to Saim. But Farèesa tells him that she was talking to her mother. Haadi still feels that she's lying because she kept changing the subject. Later Hadi tracks her and sees her with saim in a public park. Hadi furiously reaches home and when fareesa arrives he questions her but she simply refused to what Hadi saw. Later Rameez arranges a picnic, where they do ice skating and wall climbing and it is when Haya is uncomfortable doing all this but Rameez forces her to enjoy with him while Fareesa and Hadi notice Rameez's behaviour. Fareesa insists saim to let them fly to USA but he is a bit reluctant to do so.In a heated argument Fareesa says to hadi that even if he thinks of divorcing her she will destroy Haya's life. Hadi finds no other way to solve the problem so he finally divorces Fareesa. Fareesa leaves the house while shouting that everyone in this house is mental and that she will bring everyone on the footpath. When she reaches saim's house he tells her that he was taking revenge from her because she left him just to marry Hadi. Fareesa is shocked and is left devastated while Saim kicks her out of her house and life. On the other hand, Rameez and Haya get to know from Tayi that Hadi has divorced Fareesa. He starts shouting at Haya and calls it her plan. He chases Haya in the house when a sofa drops on his foot and he's hurt and when he catches Haya she accidentally hits him with a knife that injures his hand. Haya runs out of her apartment while Rameez is chasing her when Hadi clashes with Haya and takes her to his house. Haya is found to be pregnant but her Tayi, Taya and Hadi force her to live with them and leave Rameez.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{tradition}} in vocational education which emphasizes teaching technical knowledge and skills while neglecting the development of attitudes and social skills which {{have been shown to}} be important causes of problems for office workers. The terms in general use to identify these skills and attitudes are work adjustment and occupational adjustment. Borow calls them 2 ̆ 2 [...] . the work ethos, a set of attitudes, rules of etiquette, and interpersonal skills involving relations with fellow workers, supervisors, and clients. 2 ̆ 2 He goes on to say that: It is astonishing to what degree the school and the community assume that any student who is making the transition from school to employment has somehow mastered work protocol and the repertoire of unwritten and formal, yet highly critical, situational skills. It may be noted, parenthetically, that among culturally disadvantaged youth it is the utter lack of an acceptable work ethos quite as fully as inadequate training in the formal duties of the job that makes the work situation seem so bewildering and terrifying and which so frequently predisposes such novices to almost certain failure. (Borow, 1969, p. 1) The opinion stated above also appears in the writings of people who are responsible for Manpower Development and Training Programs. A study conducted by Pucel (1968) showed that MDTA trainees in Minnesota feel skill development to be very important. There was less agreement regarding the responsibility to build desirable work-related attitudes. The need for information about the personal qualities and characteristics of MOTA trainees is illustrated by the following excerpt from an article in Business Education World: This is the MDTA girl [...] the one we know. We know she has enrolled in the MDTA class, that she has some typing background, that she possesses the qualifications for success as a secretary and that she wants to be trained in this program. This is the MDTA girl I want to talk about [...] . the one we don 2 ̆ 7 t know. We don 2 ̆ 7 t know that she may be here because her husband passed away last year.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to outline and examine the growing corpus of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> and assess their {{relevance}} and applicability to complex contemporary housing systems across the world. Design/methodology/approach - The paper sets out the principal instruments and commentaries on <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> developed by the United Nations, regional and other bodies. It assesses their relevance in the context of contemporary analysis of housing systems, organized and directed by networks of legal and other professionals within particular domains. Findings - <b>Housing</b> <b>rights</b> instruments are accepted by all States across the world at the level of international law, national constitutions and laws. The findings suggest that there are significant gaps in the international law conception and framework of <b>housing</b> <b>rights,</b> and indeed, human rights generally, which create major obstacles for the effective implementation of these rights. There is a preoccupation with one element of housing systems, that of subsidized or social housing. However, effective <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> implementation requires application at meso-, micro- and macro-levels of modern, dynamic housing systems as a whole. Epistemic communities of professionals develop and shape housing law and policy within these domains. The <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> paradigm must be further fashioned for effective translation into contemporary housing systems. Research limitations/implications - The development of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> precedents, both within international and national law, is leading to a wide and diffuse corpus of legislation and case law. More research is needed on specific examples of effective coupling between <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> and elements of housing systems. Originality/value - This paper offers housing policy makers and lawyers an avenue into the extensive jurisprudence and writings on <b>housing</b> <b>rights,</b> which will inevitably become part of the lexicon of housing law across the world. It also highlights the limitations of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> implementation, but offers some new perspectives on more effective application of these rights...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> {{jurisprudence}} on Chinese legal and policy frameworks in the housing sector, examines the key related issues, and assesses whether current practices {{are in line with}} international best practice. The thesis considers three major questions, viz. 1 What are <b>housing</b> <b>rights?</b> 2 What is the significance of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> in the Chinese context? 3 Given the features and nature of <b>housing</b> <b>rights,</b> and China’s transitional societal background, how could <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> be implemented? By looking at the jurisprudence and jurisprudential development of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> in international law and related humanitarian jurisprudence, this thesis proposes a three-layer framework of <b>housing</b> <b>rights,</b> which encompasses property and resource dimensions. While the property dimension requires the state to refrain from interfering in property interest in housing, the resource dimension establishes a set of principles for directing governmental duties in utilizing and redistributing resources. The governments should enable equal and equitable access to housing and housing-related resources, and ensure housing development is a human-centered, sustainability-oriented process. China is a transitional society, where the Constitution shows a trend towards strengthening property rights protection, but institutional constraints on property rights remain. There are also transformative schemes in the housing sector that take the form of land reform and public housing programs. An overview of the housing regime in China identifies three primary limitations: an incoherent legal framework of Chinese takings law related to the property dimension of housing rights; problems with equal and equitable access to land resource as reflected by the urban-rural divide in the land tenure system; and the lack of a sustainability vision in public housing development. It is, therefore, argued that implementing <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> involves enshrining values and principles related to <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> in the domestic constitution. This can take the form of reinterpreting the Chinese constitutional property according to the three-layer framework of <b>housing</b> <b>rights.</b> Such a reinterpretation sheds further light on how to resolve the key issues in the current housing regime. This study concludes that <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> require Chinese constitutional property {{to strike a balance between}} protecting existing property-holdings and the transformative schemes in the housing sector. For the property dimension of Chinese constitutional property, <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> help to construct a coherent jurisprudence for Chinese takings law. The resource dimension of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> serves as an assessment tool for the policy framework to guide both the utilization and redistribution of land resources and the development of public housing programs. This facilitates the legal and policy framework in the housing sector to be informed by humanitarian jurisprudence and be in line with international best practice. The pioneering nature of this thesis lies in its exploration of humanitarian jurisprudence which is new to Chinese constitutional reasoning, and the extension of jurisprudential discussion of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> to public policy formulation. It is also innovative in proposing the three-layer framework of <b>housing</b> <b>rights.</b> Some of the findings from the discussion of international jurisprudence may be extended not only to the Chinese setting but also to other transitional economies which face similar housing issues and concerns in their policy-making. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
