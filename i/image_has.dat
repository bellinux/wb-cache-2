5|$|The exact {{appearance}} of the icon is unclear: although the early <b>image</b> <b>has</b> been interpreted as a bust of the Christ Pantocrator type, late Byzantine references, such as coins by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and the Deesis mosaic in the Chora Church, use the term for depictions of a standing Christ on a pedestal.|$|E

40|$|<b>Images</b> <b>have</b> {{become an}} {{important}} aspect of, and shaping force on, society. However, the evolving articulation taking place between images and sounds tends to be undertheorised. This article argues that, as <b>images</b> <b>have</b> become more ‘soundful’, that is, as <b>images</b> <b>have</b> become naturalised as a ‘source’ of sounds, and as sounds are increasingly seen to emanate directly from <b>images,</b> mediated sounds <b>have</b> come to reinforce images in hegemonic fashion. In this essay, a discussion of 9 / 11 as a televisual event {{will be used as}} a starting point to investigate implications of the interactions between images and sounds in increasingly audiovisual cultures...|$|R
5|$|Images {{from the}} series {{have long been}} {{licensed}} for use on merchandise, the success of Tintin magazine helping to create a market for such items. Tintin's <b>image</b> <b>has</b> been used to sell {{a wide variety of}} products, from alarm clocks to underpants. Countless separate items related to the character have been available, with some becoming collectors' items in their own right.|$|E
5|$|In popular memory, Tamar's <b>image</b> <b>has</b> {{acquired}} a legendary and romantic façade. A diverse set of folk songs, poems and tales illustrate {{her as an}} ideal ruler, a holy woman onto whom certain attributes of pagan deities and Christian saints were sometimes projected. For example, in an old Ossetian legend, Queen Tamar conceives her son of a sunbeam which shines through the window. Another myth, from the Georgian mountains, equates Tamar with the pagan deity of weather, Pirimze, who controls winter. Similarly, in the highland district of Pshavi, Tamar's image fused with a pagan goddess of healing and female fertility.|$|E
5|$|The 30-word {{design was}} the most popular {{recruitment}} poster at the time having been printed ten times the volume of Leete's image. Leete's <b>image</b> <b>has</b> been praised for being more arresting while his accompanying text is also far less verbose. The official wording, taken from a Kitchener speech, may seem more fitting for a character in a Henry James novel. The 30-word recruiting poster was developed as Britons' collective hopes of the war being over by Christmas were dashed in January 1915 and volunteer enlistments fell.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in Sec. 4, the resampling factors {{used in both}} left and right <b>images</b> <b>have</b> {{to be similar to}} guarantee the consistency of the forged images. Since almost the same resampling factors are used for both left and right images, the normalized positions of the interpolation peak from both <b>images</b> <b>have</b> to be sufficiently close. In experiments, the probability that peak of left and right <b>images</b> <b>have</b> same position was over 96.1 %. In the same way, the probability is low for the case that the normalized position is the same in spite of both images are not resampled. The probability that {{the left and the right}} <b>images</b> <b>have</b> peak that is same positions without resampling process was 3.2 %. The CSS process is conducted based on that fundamental. The entire CSS process is described in Algorithm 1 in detail.|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} {{was incorporated into}} the Star Wars merchandising campaign that corresponded with the theatrical release of Return of the Jedi. Besides the films, Jabba the Hutt is featured in Star Wars Legends literature. Jabba the Hutt's <b>image</b> <b>has</b> since played an influential role in popular culture, particularly in the United States. The name {{is used as a}} satirical literary device and a political caricature to underscore negative qualities such as morbid obesity and corruption.|$|E
5|$|A second woodcut was {{executed}} by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg {{around the same}} time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, {{but it is not clear}} whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros; however, Dürer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's <b>image</b> <b>has</b> survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.|$|E
5|$|Altair {{is one of}} the few {{stars for}} which a direct <b>image</b> <b>has</b> been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his {{coworkers}} produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the Sun, had been imaged. The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.|$|E

5|$|Anggun's <b>image</b> <b>has</b> been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and brown skin. For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
5|$|Development of Knuckles' Chaotix {{began in}} 1994 as an {{internal}} Sega engine test called Sonic Crackers for the Sega Genesis. Contrary to popular belief, this game (and ultimately Knuckles' Chaotix) were not developed by Sonic Team, but rather another internal development team at Sega. This team—which consisted of directors Masahide Kobayashi, Atsuhiko Nakamura, Naohisa Nakazawa, producers Hiroshi Aso, Makoto Oshitani, Mike Larsen, and artist Takumi Miyakewas—was assembled from young {{members of the}} staff who worked on Sonic CD (1993). Sonic Crackers featured Sonic and Tails joined together by a band of rings with an elastic nature. Although never released, the prototype's core tethering gameplay provided the foundation for Knuckles' Chaotix. The prototype ROM <b>image</b> <b>has</b> since leaked on the Internet and can be played {{with the use of}} emulators. Development was eventually transitioned to the 32X. Rather than featuring Sonic, the new game centered around a group of supporting characters led by Knuckles the Echidna, and the project was given the title Knuckles' Ringstar, later renamed Knuckles' Chaotix.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function within the poem. Part one contains a rose garden that allegorically represents potential within human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as an imagined reality. Also, the narrator's statement that words exist in the mind allows this imagined reality to be shared between the narrator and the reader. This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that such a place has no purpose. The garden <b>image</b> <b>has</b> other uses within the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories within the poem, and it functions {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E
