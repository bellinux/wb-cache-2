40|$|Abstract—With the {{development}} of steganalysis, the security of steganography is faced with tremendous challenge. <b>High</b> <b>order</b> statistical analysis is an effective and common detecting method that can defeat many hiding scheme. This paper proposes a secure steganography that can effectively resist image steganalysis based on <b>high</b> <b>order</b> statistical analysis. We have analyzed Haar wavelet decomposition characteristics and obtained a theorem about keeping <b>high</b> <b>order</b> statistics invariability. Based on the theorem, the hiding method that can preserve <b>high</b> <b>order</b> statistics of H, V, and D sub-bands of images decomposed by Haar wavelet is devised. In order to strengthen the security of our steganographic scheme, the approach to generate the set of random embedding location is presented. Finally, the capability of proposed algorithm is discussed in theory and proved by experiments. The results show our method possesses perfect imperceptibility and can effectively resist <b>high</b> <b>order</b> statistics analysis and RS analysis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose the {{accurate}} and simple reliability based design method adjusting the distribution shapes by means of <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moment. In this paper, we propose the <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moment standardizing method, and define a reliability index using the proposed method. Firstly, the <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moment standardizing method, which is able to treat random variables handly, is proposed by using the <b>high</b> <b>order</b> mement, and the proposed method is evolved into the third order moment standardizing mehtod concretely. The <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moment standardizing function is defined in the form of a series with undetermined coefficients. The coefficients are determined by using the information of the <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moments of random variables. Secondly, the reliability index based on the proposed method is defined. The reliability index is composed of the <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moments, which are offered by a finite number of data in the same manner as a mean or a standard deviation. The proposed method is very effective and useful method adjusting the asymmetry or skewness of the distribution shape, even if the statistical data are not given enough to determine the distribution functions of random variables exactly...|$|R
