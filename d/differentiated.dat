5|$|L. vellereus {{is larger}} {{with a thick}} stipe, woolly cap and less crowded gills, but is not as tall. Russula delica is similar in colour and shape, though has adnate blue-green tinged gills and no milk. L. deceptivus is also similar, but is <b>differentiated</b> by its less crowded gills, firmer cap margin and less acrid milk. Close to L. piperatus is L. glaucescens, which is <b>differentiated</b> by its milk that dries with a greenish colour.|$|E
5|$|L.lubrica fruit {{bodies are}} similar to those of Cudonia confusa, {{commonly}} known as the cinnamon jellybaby. The species can be <b>differentiated</b> by the fact that L.lubrica fruit bodies are more sturdy, and those of C.confusa are much paler in colour. Another Cudonia species, C. circinans (which is highly similar to C. lutea), is similar to L. lubrica, though it can be <b>differentiated</b> by its colour (which is more brown), spores (which are smaller and thinner) and texture (which is less slimy and gelatinous than L. lubrica). L. lubrica fruit bodies can also be mistaken for those of the much rarer L.atrovirens, which can be <b>differentiated</b> by its darker colouration. L.viscosa can again be <b>differentiated</b> by colouration; the species has a green head. However, as L. lubrica fruit bodies can sometimes have a greenish hue, differentiation between the two species is not always easy.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be <b>differentiated</b> based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily <b>differentiated</b> due to their pink spore print.|$|E

40|$|Dental pulp {{stem cells}} (DPSCs) are {{multipotent}} stem cells derived from neural crest and mesenchyme {{and have the}} capacity to <b>differentiate</b> into multiple cell lineages. It has already been demonstrated that DPSCs <b>differentiate</b> into melanocyte-like cells but only when cultivated in a specific melanocyte <b>differentiating</b> medium. In this study we have shown, for the first time, that DPSCs are capable of spontaneously <b>differentiating</b> into mature melanocytes, which display molecular and ultrastructural features of full development, including the expression of melanocyte specific markers and the presence of melanosomes up to the terminal stage of maturation. We have also compared the <b>differentiating</b> features of DPSCs grown in different culture conditions, following the timing of differentiation at molecular and cytochemical levels and found that in all culture conditions full development of these cells was obtained, although at different times. The spontaneous <b>differentiating</b> potential of these cells strongly suggests their possible applications in regenerative medicine...|$|R

Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the capacity of}} proliferating and <b>differentiating</b> keratinocytes to salvage and catabolize extracellular thymidine. Both populations of cells catabolized thymidine to thymine and possessed thymidine phosphorylase activity. As keratinocytes <b>differentiate,</b> thymidine phosphorylase activity ultimately increased twofold. In contrast, proliferating and <b>differentiating</b> keratinocytes differed markedly in their capacity to salvage extracellular thymidine. Proliferating keratinocytes readily salvage extracellular thymidine to form nucleotides, whereas <b>differentiating</b> cells rapidly lost this capacity. The inability of <b>differentiating</b> cells to form nucleotides from thymidine was not attributed to reduced availability of thymidine due to catabolism but rather {{was the result of}} the rapid loss of thymidine kinase activity. As keratinocytes <b>differentiate</b> in suspension culture, they lose 41 % of thymidine kinase activity in 8 h and over 90 % of activity i 12 h. Our data indicate that loss of capacity to salvage extracellular thymidine for synthesis of nucleotides closely parallels the onset of differentiation in keratinocytes...|$|R
40|$|Bone marrow–derived mesodermal {{stem cells}} may <b>differentiate</b> toward several lines and are easily cultured in vitro. Some {{putative}} progenitors of these cells {{have been described}} in both humans and mice. Here, we describe a new mesodermal progenitor population [mesodermal progenitors cells (MPCs) ] able to <b>differentiate</b> into mesenchymal cells upon appropriate culture conditions. When cultured in presence of autologous serum, these cells are strongly adherent to plastic, resistant to trypsin detachment, and resting. Mesodermal progenitor cells may be pulsed to proliferate and <b>differentiate</b> by substituting autologous serum for human cord blood serum or fetal calf serum. By these methods cells proliferate and <b>differentiate</b> toward mesenchymal cells and thus may further <b>differentiate</b> into osteoblats, chondrocytes, or adipocytes. Moreover MPCs are capable to <b>differentiate</b> in endothelial cells (ECs) showing characteristics similar to microvessel endothelium cells. Mesodermal progenitors cells have a defined phenotype and carry embryonic markers not present in mesenchymal cells. Moreover MPCs strongly express aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, usually present in hematopoietic precursors but absent in mesenchymal cells. When these progenitors are pulsed to <b>differentiate,</b> they lose these markers and acquire the mesenchymal ones. Interestingly, mesenchymal cells may not be induced to back <b>differentiate</b> into MPCs. Our results demonstrate the adult serum role in maintaining pluripotent mesodermal precursors and allow isolation of these cells. After purification, MPCs may be pulsed to proliferate in a very large scale and then induced to <b>differentiate,</b> thus possibly allowing their use in regenerative medicine...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is <b>differentiated.</b> Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a <b>differentiated</b> interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius subconiatus, {{known from}} Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is {{somewhat}} similar to M.sasicola. It can be <b>differentiated</b> as its stem does {{not enter the}} substrate, and the gills differ. In M.subconiatus, the gills are orange, and sport cheilocystidia which are pale yellow.|$|E

Reynolds {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Science predicting a volcanically modified surface and a <b>differentiated</b> interior, with distinct rock types rather than a homogeneous blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive amount of heat produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io caused by its slightly eccentric orbit. Their calculations suggested {{that the amount of}} heat generated for an Io with a homogeneous interior would be three times greater than the amount of heat generated by radioactive isotope decay alone. This effect would be even greater with a <b>differentiated</b> Io.|$|E

50|$|<b>Differentiating</b> is {{a process}} of {{disengaging}} or uncoupling. During this stage, differences between the relationship partners are emphasized and what was thought to be similarities begins to disintegrate. Instead of working together, partners quickly begin to become more individualistic in their attitudes. Conflict is a common form of communication during this stage; oftentimes, it acts as a way to test how much the other can tolerate something that may threaten the relationship. Knapp believes that <b>differentiating</b> can be the result of bonding too quickly; meaning, sufficient breadth and depth (see: Social penetration theory) was not established during the previous stages. However, <b>differentiating</b> is expected to happen in romantic relationships.
