25|$|The Battle of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cádiz</b> was a naval action which {{occurred}} on 7 August 1604, during {{the very last}} days of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604). The battle took place when a flotilla of two galleons commanded by Antonio de Oquendo engaged two English privateers who were plundering shipping lanes and villages around the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cádiz.</b> One of the English ships was captured and the other damaged. Later in his life, Antonio de Oquendo led the Spanish fleet that was utterly defeated by the Dutch at the Battle of the Downs in 1639. Oquendo's action off Cádiz is notable for having been fought just 21 days before the signing of the Treaty of London, which ended the protracted war between England and Spain.|$|E

2500|$|The Spanish {{flotilla}} {{search the}} waters around Cape St. Vincent, Cape Santa María and Cádiz {{for more than}} 20 days, without results. On 7 August at dawn, however, they found the two ships in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cadiz,</b> {{between them and the}} shore, identifying them as English. The larger privateer vessel suddenly approached and eventually grappled Oquendo’s flagship, and about 100 men boarded Delfín de Escocia. Oquendo, after two hours of fighting, managed to beat back the attackers, with many dead and wounded on both sides. [...] The clash was fought almost entirely with blade weapons. Spanish reports claim that Oquendo’s men threw some of the English intruders overboard. The privateer tried to disengage and flee, but Oquendo led his crew to the assault, boarding the enemy ship and forcing the English commander to surrender. The other vessel, which had been badly battered by Dobladilla’s guns, fled at full sail and could not been stopped. The Spanish flagship was heavily damaged in the action, arriving at Cascais along with Dobladilla and their prey for repairs.|$|E

(II) The type of relationship that took place between the Constitution <b>of</b> <b>Cadiz</b> and the constitutions of the independence's period, especially with the ones of the first republic (1811 - 1815). (III) The normative value that had the Constitution <b>of</b> <b>Cadiz</b> in different provinces of the New Granada, concluding that any answer to the above question may not fall on absolutes, black or white, but in a wide shade of gray. (IV) The different looks that received the Constitution <b>of</b> <b>Cádiz</b> during the war of independence in the New Granada. It will finally conclude that the Constitution <b>of</b> <b>Cadiz</b> cannot be considered as the first Colombian Constitution, although it has been for the Viceroyalty of the New Granada...|$|R
