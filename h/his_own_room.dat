5|$|The prisoners {{realised}} that if {{they managed}} to fully counterfeit the dollars, their lives {{would no longer be}} safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress as much as they could. The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the tacit approval of Krüger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended. In August 1944 Salomon Smolianoff, a convicted forger, was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes. The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to Krüger at having to work with a criminal, so he was given <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> to sleep in.|$|E
25|$|The {{dormitory}} {{is a big}} gothic {{room where}} the monks slept together: only the abbot was allowed to have <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b> In the 16th century the space was divided into individual cells. In the 1930s the cell walls were demolished.|$|E
25|$|Hitler later {{declared}} that Raubal {{was the only}} woman he had ever loved. Her room at the Berghof was kept as she had left it, and he hung portraits of her in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> there and at the Chancellery in Berlin.|$|E

25|$|His father {{remarried}} {{when he was}} nine, {{but neither}} Weston nor his sister got along with their new stepmother and stepbrother. After May was married and left their home in 1897, Weston's father devoted {{most of his time}} to his new wife and her son. Weston was left on his own much of the time; he stopped going to school and withdrew into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> in their large home.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Althusser {{was able}} to finally attend the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris. The school was {{sympathetic}} with his illness, allowing him to reside in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> in the school infirmary. Althusser would live at the ENS in the Rue d'Ulm for decades, except for periods of hospitalization. His professional role within the school structure was ill-defined, leading to his nickname amongst the students Althusserarien ("Althusser good for nothing").|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} season 3 in fall 1987 found Larry and Balki in a new, larger {{apartment}} where Balki had <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> instead of {{sleeping on a}} fold-out sofa. External shots clearly depict a new apartment building. According to season 6, episode 13, Larry and Balki's address is 711 Coldwell Street, Apt #209, Chicago, Illinois. The characters never made reference to the move, and Jennifer and Mary Anne were still co-tenants in the new surroundings.|$|E
60|$|His {{thoughts}} flashed back {{to those}} few moments of vivid life in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms.</b> He thought of Freudenberg's calm perseverance. An uncomfortable feeling seized him.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{finished}} it in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> at half-past seven," [...] Lady Mary answered. [...] "He discovered its loss at eleven o'clock--directly {{he had arrived}} at the ball." ...|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1873 {{he started}} the {{practice}} of Christianity, when his devotee Shambu Charan Mallik read the Bible to him. Ramakrishna said that for several days he was filled with Christian thoughts and no longer thought {{of going to the}} Kali temple. Ramakrishna described a vision in which a picture of the Madonna and Child became alive and he had a vision in which Jesus merged with his body. In <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> amongst other divine pictures was one of Christ, and he burnt incense before it morning and evening. There was also a picture showing Jesus Christ saving St Peter from drowning in the water.|$|E
25|$|Nyarlathotep sends Carter {{on a great}} Inganok shantak-bird {{through space}} to the sunset city. Unfortunately, Carter realizes too late that the mocking Nyarlathotep has tricked him, and that instead he is being taken {{to the court of}} Azathoth {{at the center of the}} universe. At first believing he is doomed, Carter {{suddenly}} remembers that he is in a dream and saves himself by leaping from the great bird. As he falls, his thoughts turn toward New England, and he wakes to find that he is at last in his marvelous sunset city; no longer in the Dreamlands but in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> in the waking world of Boston, looking out upon its architectural graces, suffused in a splendid sunrise.|$|E
25|$|Puyi's {{second choice}} {{for his wife}} was Wanrong, a Daur. She married Puyi in 1922 and became his Empress. Her father, Rong Yuan (榮源), was a Minister of Domestic Affairs. She was {{considered}} beautiful and came from a wealthy family. By Puyi's own account, he abandoned Wanrong in the bridal chamber {{and went back to}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b> He maintained that she was willing to be a wife in name only, in order to carry the title of Empress. The couple's relationship was good initially, and Puyi showed preference over Wenxiu for Wanrong and displayed trust in her. However, after Wenxiu left in 1931, Puyi blamed Wanrong and stopped speaking to her and ignored her presence. She became addicted to opium, and eventually died in a prison in Yanji, Jilin after being arrested by Chinese Communist soldiers.|$|E
60|$|In {{this state}} of affairs her father was brought home, {{suffering}} and disabled; and gloomily retired to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms,</b> where he was tended by servants, not approached by Edith, and had no friend or companion but Mr Carker, who withdrew near midnight.|$|R
60|$|Next day, as Ronald sat {{reading in}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms,</b> {{he was much}} {{surprised}} at hearing a well-known voice at the door, inquiring with some asperity whether Mr. Le Breton was at home. He listened to the voice in intense astonishment. It was his mother's.|$|R
6000|$|Strange {{it was for}} {{him then}} that she stood in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> doing it, while, with an {{intensity}} now beyond any that had ever made his breath come slow, he waited for her act. [...] "There's {{but one thing that}} can save you from my choice." ...|$|R
500|$|Although {{he later}} praised Jorden, Johnson came to odds with him {{over what he}} {{considered}} to be Jorden's [...] "meanness" [...] of abilities. He discouraged his friend Taylor, who came to Pembroke in March, from having Jorden as his tutor, and Taylor was soon encouraged to go to Christ Church to be taught by Edmund Bateman. Johnson appreciated Bateman's skill as a lecturer, and he would often travel to meet Taylor to discuss the lectures. However, Johnson lacked the funds to even replace his shoes, and so he started to make the journey barefoot. In response, those of Christ Church began to mock Johnson, and he soon kept to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> {{for the rest of}} his time at Pembroke, with Taylor visiting him instead.|$|E
500|$|Milo says {{goodbye and}} drives {{back through the}} tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room,</b> and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens {{the next day with}} plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, [...] "For Milo, who now knows the way." [...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for {{there is so much to}} do right where he is.|$|E

The woman, [...] Teresa [...] "Tracy" [...] di Vicenzo, invites Bond to her hotel room to thank him, but when Bond arrives he is attacked by an unidentified man. After subduing the man, Bond returns to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> and finds Tracy there, who claims she didn't know the attacker was there. The next morning, Bond is kidnapped by several men, including the one he fought with, who take him to meet Marc-Ange Draco, the head of the European crime syndicate Unione Corse. Draco reveals that Tracy is his only daughter and tells Bond of her troubled past, offering Bond one million pounds if he will marry her. Bond refuses, but agrees to continue romancing Tracy if Draco reveals the whereabouts of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE.|$|E
60|$|He looked round {{him as he}} spoke, and in {{particular}} looked above his head, as though he half expected to be standing under some object which had had existence in his dream. Then he rubbed his eyes and shook himself again, and followed his conductor into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
60|$|But {{the king}} would {{not listen to}} his son's voice, for {{he had always been}} {{accustomed}} to depend on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> judgment. He let the unhappy Omar be dragged from the hall, whilst he himself retired with Labakan to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms,</b> full of anger with the queen his wife, in spite of their many years of happy life together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{charitable}} Christian {{has sent}} those vagabonds away," [...] thought the sculptor, as he resumed his interrupted nap; [...] "who could it be? Donatello has <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> in the tower; Stella, Tomaso, and the cook are a world's width off; and I fancied myself the only inhabitant {{in this part}} of the house." ...|$|R
500|$|Soon afterward, Barton is {{visited by}} two police detectives, who inform him that Charlie's {{real name is}} Karl [...] "Madman" [...] Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer wanted for several murders; after {{shooting}} his victims, they explain, he decapitates them and keeps the heads. Stunned, Barton returns {{to his room and}} examines the box. Placing it on his desk without opening it, he begins writing and produces the entire script in one sitting. After a night of celebratory dancing, Barton returns to find the detectives in his room, who, after handcuffing Barton to the bed, reveal they've found evidence of Mundt's latest murders. Each of the men notes how hot it is, before Charlie as the hotel is engulfed in flames. Running through the hallway, screaming [...] "I'll show you the life of the mind!", Charlie shoots the policemen with a shotgun. As the hallway burns, Charlie speaks with Barton about their lives and the hotel, breaks the bed frame to which Barton is handcuffed (thus freeing him), then retires to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room,</b> saying as he goes that he paid a visit to Barton's parents and uncle in New York. Barton leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Voormann and Vollmer {{were friends}} who had all {{attended}} the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voormann became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where he had <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b> In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by {{a group called the}} Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she {{wanted to do was to}} be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard this new music called Rock n' Roll before, having previously listened to only Trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Weise became {{close to}} his {{paternal}} grandfather, Daryl [...] "Dash" [...] Lussier, Sr., and his younger companion, Michele Sigana, who had given him <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> with them. The family said Weise had {{a good relationship with}} both.|$|E

He has been killed in duel in London that very same afternoon of December 9th 1684." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1993 – In The Simpsons episode [...] "Last Exit to Springfield", Montgomery Burns has <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> with 1000 monkeys at typewriters, one {{of which}} he chastises for mistyping a word in the opening {{sentence}} of A Tale of Two Cities: [...] "'It {{was the best of}} times, it was the blurst of times?'

2500|$|Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who {{had written}} the first film, {{originally}} passed on the opportunity to write a sequel due to schedule conflicts. The studio began courting other writers in May2007, but were unimpressed with other pitches and eventually convinced Orci and Kurtzman to return. The studio also hired Ehren Kruger, who had impressed Bay and Hasbro president Brian Goldner with {{his knowledge of the}} Transformers mythology. The writing trio were paid $8million. Screenwriting was interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, but to avoid production delays, the writers spent two weeks writing a treatment, which they handed in the night before the strike began. Bay then expanded the outline into a 60-page scriptment, which included more action, humor, and characters. The three writers spent four months finishing the screenplay while [...] "locked" [...] in two hotel rooms by Bay; Kruger wrote in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> and the trio would check on each other's work twice a day.|$|E
60|$|From {{the studio}} Father Rocco went {{straight}} to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms,</b> hard by the church {{to which he was}} attached. Opening a cabinet in his study, he took from one of its drawers a handful of small silver money, consulted {{for a minute or so}} a slate on which several names and addresses were written, provided himself with a portable inkhorn and some strips of paper, and again went out.|$|R
