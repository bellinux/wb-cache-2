50|$|There are two {{subsections}} of the New <b>England</b> <b>Uplands</b> {{in addition}} to the Reading Prong. A prong of the same rock belt extends from the Hudson Highlands south to New York City along the Hudson River. This region {{is often referred to as}} the Manhattan Prong. The Staten Island Sepentinite is also a southward extension of the New <b>England</b> <b>Uplands.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Reading Prong is a physiographic sub{{province}} of the New <b>England</b> <b>Uplands</b> {{section of}} the New England province of the Appalachian Highlands. The prong consists of mountains made up of crystalline metamorphic rock.|$|R

25|$|Rhode Island has two {{distinct}} natural regions. Eastern Rhode Island contains the lowlands of the Narragansett Bay, while Western Rhode Island forms {{part of the}} New <b>England</b> <b>Upland.</b> Rhode Island's forests {{are part of the}} Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion.|$|R
5|$|The Saw Mill's basin {{is part of}} the Manhattan Hills in the New <b>England</b> <b>Uplands</b> physiographic region. It is {{primarily}} underlain by metamorphic rock such as gneiss, schist and marble. They can be seen in some bedrock outcrops in and around the river.|$|R
50|$|The Corridor {{consists}} {{mostly of}} the Eastern New <b>England</b> <b>Upland,</b> transitioning to the coastal forests {{to the south}} and east. The rolling hills {{in the southern part of}} the Corridor become more rugged in the northern part of the Corridor. The highest elevation is 1315 ft Burley Hill in Union, CT.|$|R
50|$|Heather moorland is rarer than {{tropical}} rainforest, and 75% of it {{is found}} in the UK as a result of grouse management, which provides an incentive to conserve heather moorland despite economic pressures of subsidies to intensify forestry and farming operations. 60% of all <b>England's</b> <b>upland</b> Sites of Special Scientific Interest are managed for grouse shooting.|$|R
50|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{the town}} has a total area of 24.7 sq mi, of which, 24.0 sq mi of it is land and 0.7 sq mi of it (2.83%) is water. North Smithfield is in a New <b>England</b> <b>upland</b> region. The Branch River and Blackstone Rivers {{provided}} much of the power for the early mills in the town.|$|R
50|$|The West Hill {{area was}} one of {{fourteen}} sites of Praying Indian Villages, established by the missionary, John Eliot around 1650. Early water powered mills, including some downsream on the West River, and Blackstone River, helped jumpstart America's industrial revolution in this river valley region. The Blackstone Valley is a New <b>England</b> <b>upland</b> region with elevations from approximately two hundred feet to over six hundred feet above sea level. West Hill Dam is located about thirty-four miles west-southwest of Boston, and about fifteen miles southeast of Worcester.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of the New England and Maritime Appalachian Highlands {{is similar}} throughout the Nova Scotia highlands including the Cobequid Hills and the Pictou-Antigonish Highlands {{on the mainland}} and the Cape Breton Highlands, the Chaleur Uplands of New Brunswick, the New <b>England</b> <b>Uplands,</b> the White Mountains and Mont MÃ©gantic on the New Hampshire/Quebec border, the Green Mountains of Vermont and their southern extension the Sutton Mountains, and the Taconic Mountains. Some of western Vermont is in the Adirondack province, but generally exhibits similar vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Pochuck Mountain {{is part of}} the Reading Prong of the New <b>England</b> <b>Uplands</b> sub{{province}} of the New England {{province of}} the Appalachian Highlands. In fact, it is the northernmost ridge of the Reading Prong in New Jersey. The rocks that form Pochuck Mountain are comprised from the same belt that make up nearby Wawayanda Mountain. This belt consists of ancient crystalline metamorphic rocks. As such, the New England province as a whole, along with the similarly composed Blue Ridge province further south, are often together referred to as the Crystalline Appalachians.|$|R
50|$|In the North Pennines are: 40% of the UK's upland hay meadows; 30% of <b>England's</b> <b>upland</b> {{heathland}} and 27% of its blanket bog; 80% of England's {{black grouse}} (and also breeding short-eared owl, ring ouzel, common snipe and common redshank); 36% of the AONB designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest; red squirrels, otters and rare arctic alpine plants; 22,000 pairs of breeding waders {{and one of}} England's biggest waterfalls - High Force. The area shares a boundary with the Yorkshire Dales National Park {{in the south and}} extends as far as the Tyne Valley, just south of Hadrian's Wall in the north.|$|R

50|$|The Hamburg Mountains {{are part}} of the Reading Prong of the New <b>England</b> <b>Upland</b> sub{{province}} of the New England province of the Appalachian Highlands. The rocks that form the Hamburg Mountains are comprised from the same belt that make up other mountains nearby. This belt, i.e. the Reading Prong, consists of ancient crystalline metamorphic rocks. The New England province as a whole, along with the Blue Ridge province further south, are often together referred to as the Crystalline Appalachians. The Crystalline Appalachians extend as far north as the Green Mountains of Vermont and as far south as the Blue Ridge Mountains, although a portion of the belt remains below the Earth's surface through part of Pennsylvania. The Crystalline Appalachians are distinct from the parallel Sedimentary Appalachians which run from Georgia to New York. The nearby Kittatinny Mountains are representative of these sedimentary formations.|$|R
5000|$|Coniferous {{forests are}} found in the White Mountain regions and the {{northern}} parts of New <b>England</b> <b>Uplands,</b> primarily the middle interior of Maine and northwards and especially in areas between 1300 metres (4,265 feet) and 900 metres (2,953) feet) elevation. It is also found on parts of the Fundy coast in Maine and the Maritimes, the northern parts of this ecoregion where the summers are cool. The coniferous forest goes by many names, including: Boreal forest, fir-spruce forest, the North Woods, and the taiga. It is noted in New England for its [...] "harsh" [...] conditions such as cold, subarctic temperatures, a short growing period, sandy-gravely acidic soil, and a high rate of leeching of nutrients out of the soil. It is also noted for a high rate of precipitation, year round, as rain and snow, which contributes to much of the leeching.|$|R
50|$|The Sparta Mountains {{are part}} of the Reading Prong of the New <b>England</b> <b>Upland</b> sub{{province}} of the New England province of the Appalachian Highlands. The rocks that form the Sparta Mountains are from the same belt as those that make up other mountains near-by. This belt, i.e. the Reading Prong, consists of ancient crystalline metamorphic rocks. The New England province as a whole, along with the Blue Ridge province further south, are often together referred to as the Crystalline Appalachians. The Crystalline Appalachians extend as far north as the Green Mountains of Vermont and as far south as the Blue Ridge Mountains, although a portion of the belt remains below the Earth's surface through part of Pennsylvania.

40|$|Aim Despite {{decades of}} study we have limited {{insights}} {{into the nature of}} the pre-European landscape of the north-eastern USA and the forces and changes that shaped modern forest patterns. Information on such long-term forest dynamics would provide critical {{insights into the}} relationships among environmental change, land-use history and biotic responses and is greatly needed for conservation planning. To address these issues we used modern, historical, and palaeoecological approaches to reconstruct the 3500 -year history of a New <b>England</b> <b>upland</b> region dominated by oak and (formerly) chestnut forests and to interpret the interactions among climate change, natural and human disturbance, and site factors in controlling vegetation patterns and dynamics at different spatial scales. Location The study focused on a broad upland ridge dominated by oak forests in the north-central Massachusetts town of New Salem. Detailed palaeoecological analyses were undertaken of wetland (Chamberlain Swamp) and lake (Lily Pond) basins in order to reconstruct local to regional scale vegetation dynamics, which were interpreted withi...|$|R

About them gather {{a host of}} associations, of living-over-agains, that have made it a delight to write them; associations of the winter woods, of apple blossoms and nest-building, of New <b>England</b> <b>uplands</b> and wilderness rivers, of camps and canoes, of snowshoes and trout rods, of sunrise on the hills, when one climbed for the eagle's nest, and twilight on the yellow wind-swept beaches, where the surf sobbed far away, and wings twanged like reeds in the wind swooping down to decoys,--all thronging about one, eager to be remembered if not recorded. Among them, most eager, most intense, most frequent of all associations, there is a boy with nerves all a-tingle at the vast sweet mystery that rustled in every wood, following {{the call of the}} winds and the birds, or wandering alone where the spirit moved him, who never studied nature consciously, but only loved it, and who found out many of these Ways long ago, guided solely by a boy's instinct.|$|R

Near the New York border, the Taconic and Hoosac Ranges cross into Massachusetts; however, in general, the area is known as The Berkshires. The region was populated by aborigines until the 18th century when Scotch-Irish settlers arrived, after having found the fertile lowlands along the Connecticut River settled. On reaching the Berkshires, settlers found poor soil for farming, but discovered numerous fast-moving rivers for industry. Pittsfield and North Adams grew into small, prosperous cities. A number of smaller mill towns exist along the Westfield and Housatonic Rivers, interspersed among wealthy vacation resort towns.The National Park Service administers a number of natural and historical sites in Massachusetts.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} has been to {{formulate}} a program {{which can be used}} as a guide to control or eliminate pollution in the Connecticut River Valley so that the river could be utilized to its fullest potential. However, after making a cursory examination, it has been discovered that pollution, though the most important, was not the only problem which prevented full utilization of the river. Pollution through- bacteria, synthetic organic and inorganic matter, sediment, and heat was found to do most in curtailing full utilization of the river. But a second problem caused by man's building dams across the river has also contributed to lessening the river's usefulness. These dams have prevented anadramous fish, such as Atlantic salmon and shad, from returning to their spawning grounds in the upper reaches of the Connecticut River. The valley has been deprived of much recreational fishing because of these dams. While pursuing this investigation, it was recognized that two cogent facts aggravated the problems of pollution and inadequate recreation: (1) a high rate of population increase in the river valley (a higher rate than that of Massachusetts) and more particularly the concentration ofthis population in the southern or Hampden County section of the valley and (2) inadequate amounts of recreational facilities which were needed by this increased population. Therefore, the study of these problems from which suggestions for their elimination could be derived seemed particularly worthwhile, especially, to the people of the valley and to a certain extent the nation as a whole. Finding it necessary to define the limits of this study while keeping in mind that the watershed of the valley provided the most logical boundaries for the study, the writer chose to recognize the natural boundaries of the area. The Berkshire Hills, an extension of Vermont's Green Mountains, established the western boundary of the valley. A southern segment of dew Hampshire's White Mountains, the Worcester County Plateau or Central New <b>England</b> <b>Upland,</b> defined the eastern limit of the study area. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{pattern and}} {{consequences}} of myxomatosis in wild rabbit populations were studied at three farmland sites in lowland southern <b>England</b> and <b>upland</b> central Wales between 1971 and 1978. When results from all years were combined, the disease showed a clear two-peaked annual cycle, with a main autumn peak between August and January, and a subsidiary spring peak during February to April. Rabbit fleas, the main vectors of myxomatosis in Britain, were present on full-grown rabbits in sufficient numbers for transmission to occur throughout the year, but the observed seasonal pattern of the disease appeared {{to be influenced by}} seasonal mass movements of these fleas. However other factors were also important including the timing and success of the main rabbit breeding season, the proportion of rabbits which had recovered from the disease and the timing and extent of autumn rabbit mortality from other causes. Significantly more males than females, and more adults and immatures than juveniles, were observed to be infected by myxomatosis. Only 25 - 27 % of the total populations were seen to be infected during outbreaks. Using two independent methods of calculation, it was estimated that between 47 and 69 % of infected rabbits died from the disease (much lower than the expected 90 - 95 % for fully susceptible rabbits with the partly attenuated virus strains that predominated). Thus it was estimated that 12 - 19 % of the total rabbit populations were known to have died directly or indirectly from myxomatosis. Although the effects of myxomatosis were much less than during the 1950 s and 1960 s, it continued to be an important mortality factor. It may still have a regulatory effect on rabbit numbers, with autumn/winter peaks of disease reducing the numbers of rabbits present {{at the start of the}} breeding season...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric N {{deposition}} {{can enhance}} biological P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems {{and increase the}} importance of organic P to plants and microorganisms. We used NaOHâEDTA extraction and solution 31 P NMR spectroscopy to determine the P composition of soils in the Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve, northern <b>England,</b> an <b>upland</b> region influenced by such deposition for at least 150 years. Three characteristic soil types were sampled on three occasions during an annual cycle: blanket peat (318 mg gâ 1 total C, 607 g gâ 1 total P, pH 3. 9); acid organic soil under grassland (354 mg gâ 1 total C, 1190 g gâ 1 total P, pH 3. 7); calcareous soil under grassland (140 mg gâ 1 total C, 649 g gâ 1 total P, pH 7. 3). Between 58 and 99 % of the total P in soil and litter layers was extracted by 0. 25 M NaOH + 0. 05 M EDTA. Extracts of all soils were dominated by organic P, mainly {{in the form of}} orthophosphate monoesters (43 â 69 % extracted P). The two acidic soils also contained large proportions of orthophosphate diesters (6 â 19 % extracted P) and phosphonates (7 â 16 % extracted P), suggesting that these compounds become stabilised at low pH. However, a seasonal trend of increasing orthophosphate monoester-to-diester ratios, most evident in the calcareous grassland soil, indicated the preferential degradation of orthophosphate diesters during the growing season. Orthophosphate was the major inorganic P compound (17 â 34 % extracted P), and all soils contained pyrophosphate (1 â 5 % extracted P). However, orthophosphate determined in the NaOHâEDTA extracts by solution 31 P NMR spectroscopy was substantially greater than that determined by molybdate colourimetry, suggesting that orthophosphate occurred in complexes with humic compounds that were not detected by conventional procedures. Our results suggest that organisms able to use recalcitrant soil organic P may have a competitive advantage in environments under enhanced atmospheric N deposition...|$|R

5000|$|Water dogs {{fall into}} two {{categories}} for hunting: the retrievers and multi-purpose. Retrievers are excellent swimmers with characteristic webbed feet, and many derive from either Canadian, American, or British stock. Retrievers typically have oily coats that help repel icy water, and are noted for having high intelligence and being very strongly bonded to their masters. The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is very unusual {{in the fact that}} it [...] "tolls"-plays around in the hopes of attracting the attention of waterfowl from above and then letting its master shoot the bird, whence it retrieves it and goes back in the blind. It's long silky double coat is ideal for brushy locations hunters hide in for waterfowl. Golden Retrievers are originally from Scotland: their long, flowing, blonde double coats make them ideally suited to Scotland's rainy wet climate and their patience on land and in water is the stuff of legend; they shall wait for a bird for hours and will obey their master so long as master rewards him with fond affection. Curly Coated Retrievers were bred in <b>England</b> for both <b>upland</b> bird hunting and for still water retrieval, and are noted for being very stubborn even if the weather is wet, windy, and cold: they simply will not leave the field until they have found the goose and brought it back to master.|$|R
30|$|Government {{policy goals}} for the uplands {{over the past three}} decades have shifted away from support for the use of the land {{primarily}} to generate agricultural output and support farming, towards a greater emphasis upon these areasâ high environmental and amenity value (Lowe and Ward 2007; Condliffe 2009; Dwyer 2010). This move towards a multi-objective and benefit approach is in line with a global shift towards a more holistic approach to policy that seems to be focusing around the ecosystem services approach developed as part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005) and the widely respected UK report, National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA 2011). Most upland areas within the UK also experience high levels of recreation and tourism activity. Various forms of exercise â walking, hiking, field and water sports and aerial recreation (gliding, etc.) - are common and some of these have had a major influence upon land use and management (shooting, in particular) and the rural economy. The uplands also play an essential role in providing much of the population with clean drinking water: of the total UK water supply, around 70 % is sourced from the <b>uplands</b> (Natural <b>England</b> 2011; Reed et al. 2009). Upland land management also has a strong influence on river flows and flood risk. The peat soils in the uplands represent a major carbon store and offer important potential for further carbon sequestration, the South West in particular (Natural <b>England</b> 2010). Many <b>uplands</b> also offer significant potential for renewable energy generation from wind and water, in particular.|$|R
40|$|The <b>uplands</b> of <b>England</b> and Wales are internationally {{important}} for nature conservation and are prized nationally for their landscape, recreational and cultural value. Reflecting this status, recent appeals, have prompted fundamental research into {{degradation of the}} upland habitat. This work was instigated {{as part of that}} research to determine the current extent, causes and rates of upland degraded soil. The research was based principally upon a statistically robust and objective selection of 399 field sites. Erosion extent and condition were recorded and related to morphology, environment and management conditions within both field sites and sub-catchments. The short-term rate of soil loss was determined through the completion of cross-sectional traverses on erosion gullies in 1997 and in 1999. Longer-term variations in the extent and causes of upland erosion were established through the interpretation of aerial photographs taken between 1946 and 1989. Erosion measured on field sites in 1999 was estimated to represent 24 566 ha and 0. 284 km 3 in <b>upland</b> <b>England</b> and Wales. Of this, 18 025 ha and 0. 242 km 3 was attributed to water erosion, which included large-scale blanket peat degradation. Biotic factors accounted for 6 541 ha and 0. 041 km 3 of erosion, evident on 68 % of eroded field sites. Wind was a negligible contributor to upland erosion. Upland eroded area in England and Wales increased by over 518 ha between 1997 and 1999 : humans and animals were responsible for 99. 9 % of this increase. Within the last half-century, the creation and perpetuation of erosion was also principally due to humans and animals. Water-eroded features on both peat and mineral soils showed stabilisation and revegetation throughout the same period. These results expose the highly degraded state of the upland environment and the alarming rate at which erosion is proceeding. The implications of this erosion and proposals for mitigation policies are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Since WWI, British Government {{policy has}} {{supported}} forestry {{in order to}} build up a strategic reserve of timber. The resultant afforestation has led to the largest land use change in Europe involving a shift from agriculture to forestry and by observation is mainly in the uplands. Until recently the expansion has largely ignored biodiversity and landscape ecological issues although some {{attention has been paid to}} landscapes. The paper first considers the history of afforestation in Britain before examining its impact at the landscape level. Forest cover in Britain increased by a quarter between 1870 and 1947, but almost doubled between 1948 and 1995. The distribution also changed from the lowlands of England and Scotland to the uplands, especially in SW Scotland. The balance also shifted from native broad leaves to exotic conifers as expressed by the present dominance of Sitka Spruce. Figures available from Forestry Commission Reports show that the overall increase in woodland area after 1948 is almost linear until c. 1994 when the rate of increase in conifer area slowed down whilst broad leaved planting increased in relative terms. Nevertheless, the conifer area still continued to increase even between 2008 and 2010. Conifer cover increased since 1948 by almost 400 % whereas broadleaves have increased by only 25 %. In 1948 there was more broadleaf than conifer but by 1973 the situation had reversed. Also conifers were mainly planted on open moorland whereas the core of broadleaves has remained much the same, although supplemented by recent planting in the lowlands. In the period after WW 2 there was much conversion of broad leaves to conifers, although this has recently been reversed. All the above changes were driven by government policy. An analysis of the patterns of forest cover shows that Lowland England is dominated by broadleaves but still has a significant area of conifers because of the plantations of pine in the south. In <b>Upland</b> <b>England</b> there is twice as much conifer but this is a small area in comparison with Scotland. There are almost no conifers in Lowland Wales but the upland figure is similar to England. Scotland is dominated by plantations of conifers. In Scotland, one third of a million hectares are in the marginal uplands with about half a million in the true uplands. Under 1 % of these are native pinewoods, the remainder are exotics. Conifer forest also occurs in relatively narrow altitudinal bands in different landscape types in Britain. Afforestation therefore mainly affects specific parts of the uplands and the national figure therefore underestimates its impact on local landscape ecology. Finally, conifer plantations cause almost complete loss of vegetation cover except for a few bryophytes. In conclusion, in the presented paper suggestions will be made as to how landscape ecology could ameliorate the situation...|$|R
