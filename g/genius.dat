50|$|Returning to Stanford University {{to pursue}} a Ph.D. in {{psychology}} {{under the supervision of}} Lewis Terman, Cox began her study of <b>geniuses.</b> For her dissertation project, she analyzed the works of 301 <b>geniuses.</b> Using biographical sources, Cox applied the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales to assign IQ scores to eminent people from when they were children. She concluded that higher IQ scores and eminence were related for those who worked in the fields of science, literature, and the arts. Military eminence was the only field where she did not find a relationship between childhood IQ and eminence. Cox earned her Ph.D. in 1925. Her dissertation, Early Mental Traits of 300 <b>Geniuses,</b> was published in 1926 as the second volume in the Genetic Studies of <b>Geniuses</b> series started by Lewis Terman.|$|R
