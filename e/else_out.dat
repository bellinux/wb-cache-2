5|$|The {{premise of}} Alien Soldier is {{provided}} with a long text scroll {{at the start of}} the game. After the game has begun, it is not referred to again. In the year 2015, the A-Humans of A-Earth have created genetically engineered A-Humans capable of super intelligence and strength, as well as parasitic co-existence with machinery and animals, particularly humans. A terrorist organization known as Scarlet rose up within this race and sought to dominate the rest of the A-Humans and A-Earth by locking the planet down and keeping anyone <b>else</b> <b>out.</b> During the height of Scarlet's power, an assassination attempt on the group's leader, Epsilon-Eagle, was carried out by a special forces group. Scarlet fought back with their powers, and the battle somehow breached the space-time continuum. Epsilon was gravely injured and cast somewhere into the continuum.|$|E

In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying {{about that kind of}} thing.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Spears revealed that her idea initially was to make an album that was [...] "fresh-sounding [...] for the clubs or something that you play in your car when you're going out at night that gets you excited, but I wanted it to sound different from everything <b>else</b> <b>out</b> right now." [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] is a party song with a heavy club beat. The elements used on the song's background were compared to similar used on songs by The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga, while its bass line {{was said to be}} [...] "a cousin of the ground" [...] for the Eurythmics' 1983 single [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)".|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Richard Cobbett {{summarized}} Maniac Mansion as [...] "one of {{the most}} intricate and important adventure games ever made". Retro Gamer ranked {{it as one of}} the ten best Commodore 64 games in 2006, and IGN later named it one of the ten best LucasArts adventure game. Seven years after the NES version's debut, Nintendo Power named it the 61st best game ever. The publication dubbed it the 16th best NES title in 2008. The game's uniqueness and clever writing were praised by Nintendo Power: in 2010, the magazine's Chris Hoffman stated that the game is [...] "unlike anything <b>else</b> <b>out</b> there — a point-and-click adventure with an awesome sense of humor and multiple solutions to almost every puzzle." [...] In its retrospective coverage, Nintendo Power several times noted the ability to microwave a hamster, which the staff considered to be an iconic scene. In March 2012, Retro Gamer listed the hamster incident as one of the [...] "100 Classic Gaming Moments".|$|E

500|$|On October 8, 2012, {{production}} {{returned to}} Sydney with filming on Erskine Street near Cockle Bay. The following week, the film shot in Parramatta, which doubled as a Japanese city. Also in October, Mangold {{revealed that the}} film follows the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, saying, [...] "Where this film sits in the universe of the films is after them all. Jean Grey is gone, most of the X-Men are disbanded or gone, so there’s {{a tremendous sense of}} isolation for [...]" [...] Mangold later stated that in the fight scenes, [...] "there's an urgency and a kind of intensity and hand to hand physicality that I hope is a little different than everything <b>else</b> <b>out</b> there." [...] On October 25, 2012 production relocated to Sydney Olympic Park in western Sydney. The set was made into a Japanese village draped in snow with filming beginning on November 1, 2012. [...] On November 10, 2012, filming took place on a back street in Surry Hills.

500|$|The first season, which premiered on September 24, 2013, aired episodes that {{directly}} relate to {{events in the}} films [...] and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The revelation in Captain America: The Winter Soldier that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated by Hydra had {{a huge impact on}} the series. Regarding the synergy the show had with addressing events from the film, Loeb said, [...] "It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere <b>else</b> <b>out</b> there in the entertainment business." [...] The second season, which premiered on September 23, 2014, introduces Inhumans to the MCU, ahead of their own television series. Additionally, a recurring plot point in the first two seasons involved the body of a member of the Kree race, who {{play a significant role in}} Guardians of the Galaxy. The third season, which premiered on September 29, 2015, introduces the concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, as well as Life Model Decoys. The fourth season, which premiered on September 20, 2016, sees Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider introduced to the MCU, and ties to the second season of Agent Carter and Doctor Strange. The fifth season is scheduled to premiere on December 1, 2017.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{released}} her eighth studio album, Music, in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired Ray of Light era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna commented: [...] "I love {{to work with}} the weirdos that no one knows about—the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone <b>else</b> <b>out</b> there. Music is the future of sound." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that [...] "Music blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color, technique, style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that it's easily as self-aware and earnest as Ray of Light." [...] The album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days. In the U.S., Music debuted at the top, and became her first number-one album in eleven years since Like a Prayer. It produced three singles: the Hot 100 number-one [...] "Music", [...] "Don't Tell Me", and [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl". The music video of [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] depicted Madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism, and was banned by MTV and VH1.|$|E

500|$|Ultimately, {{the season}} {{featured}} several tie-in episodes with Marvel Cinematic Universe films: the episode [...] "The Well" [...] takes place directly {{after the events}} of the episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] introduces the alien race the Kree to the MCU (confirmed as such in the second season), members of which {{play a significant role in}} Guardians of the Galaxy; and the episodes [...] "End of the Beginning" [...] and [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn" [...] revolve around the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Due to Captain America: The Winter Soldier revealing that Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. with sleeper agents, the season sees a retooling for the final six episodes. Regarding the synergy the show has with addressing events from the films, Loeb said [...] "It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere <b>else</b> <b>out</b> there in the entertainment business". The characters face the Hydra issue head on, while experiencing trust issues within themselves. Jed Whedon added that the Hydra element, which the show could not mention until after the release of The Winter Soldier in order to avoid spoiling the film, also attempts to address the lack of characters from the comics, a complaint fans had throughout the season, while also tying established threats such as the Clairvoyant, Project Centipede, and Deathlok, back into Hydra.|$|E
500|$|James Montogomery from MTV commented: [...] "With 'Telephone', Gaga {{has entered}} the rarest of pop stratospheres, {{up there with the}} Madonnas and the Michael Jacksons." [...] Matt Donnelly from Los Angeles Times wrote that the [...] "Telephone" [...] music video is a [...] "visual feast, packed with fantastic fashion, girl fights, {{poisoned}} diner food, an army of headpieces and lots of Gaga goodness." [...] Amy Odell from New York magazine felt that [...] "This is Gaga's video, but Beyoncé is the best part: she actually shows the angry, crazy side that we just knew lurked beneath her too-perfect facade." [...] Monica Herrera from Billboard wrote: [...] " [...] more than measures up to the hype.... 'Telephone' clip is chock full of intrigue, prison fights, makeout scenes, mass poisoning and plenty of skin-baring versions of what you might call 'outfits'." [...] Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "Is it as good as her epic 'Bad Romance' video? Sadly, I don't think so. But it's better than anything <b>else</b> <b>out</b> there." [...] Jennifer Cady of the website E! Online praised Beyoncé's [...] "always fierce" [...] look during the video. A writer of The Huffington Post wrote, [...] "As usual there is murder, masturbation, product placement, Tarantino referencing and lots of impractical headwear." [...] In January 2015, Billboard named the video as the best music video {{of the first half of}} the 2010s (decade).|$|E
500|$|Several reviews {{praised the}} game {{as one of the}} Wii's best. The Official Nintendo Magazine said that Wario should [...] "now take his place {{alongside}} Mario and Link as a true Nintendo great". Appreciating the game's [...] "terrific use of the Wii's unique control features", GameSpot remarked that the game also had [...] "amazing" [...] graphics, concluding that it belongs in the game libraries of Wii owners. This sentiment was shared by GameTrailers, which said that WarioWare: Smooth Moves was [...] "without a doubt" [...] the best collection of minigames for the Wii. GameSpy found that the game had [...] "a lot of value", especially for people who host parties or have groups of friends or family who already enjoy games such as Wii Sports or Rayman Raving Rabbids. Naming WarioWare: Smooth Moves the Game of the Week from January 28 – February 4, 2007, The Observer gave particular praise to the game's graphics, stating, [...] "There are nicely colourful cartoon intros to each level, and the microgames utilise a plethora of visual styles. You'll notice snippets of favourites from yesteryear, whether it be pulling the Master Sword out of the stone in the Nintendo 64's [...] or jumping to collect coins as NES-era Mario." [...] Australia's The Age found the game [...] "as entertaining to watch as it is to play", rating it four stars out of five. The Sunday Age newspaper predicted that WarioWare: Smooth Moves, which is [...] "totally unlike anything <b>else</b> <b>out</b> there", could convert non-gamers into fans of video games.|$|E

500|$|Several reviews {{praised the}} game's setting. GameSpy's David Chapman called it [...] "a truly {{remarkable}} experience.

[...] According to Game Informer, [...] "in terms of gameplay quality, this may be another middle-of-the-road shooter, but the unique premise sets it aside from everything <b>else</b> <b>out</b> there." [...] Greg Bemis of G4TV wrote that the biggest draw in Darkwatch is the [...] "different enough" [...] setting that [...] "does fall back on tired video game clichés {{from time to time}} like big-breasted, leather-clad babes who speak in aggressive sexually suggestive double entendres, but it’s nice to see something--anything--that’s a little off the beaten path." [...] GameShark's Will Jayson Hill wrote that [...] "about the sharpest criticism that can be leveled at Darkwatch is that it really adds nothing original in the gameplay department. Aside from its extremely well executed western/horror environment, Darkwatch is a pretty generic FPS game with a weaker multiplayer mode." [...] On the other hand, some reviews thought that the gameplay was actually the strongest part of the game. Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine stated Darkwatch [...] "has a few neat ideas but wins us over by doing solid shooting well. Fast-paced with cool guns, what's not to like?" [...] GameZone's Mike David wrote that only a [...] "weak plot pacing and that feeling that something is missing" [...] kept it from being given a score of 9/10.|$|E
