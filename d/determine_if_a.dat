5|$|DVT {{diagnosis}} {{requires the}} use of imaging devices such as ultrasound. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, can help <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> D-dimer test is useful. In those not highly likely to have DVT, a normal D-dimer result can rule out a diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} three related {{problems in}} graph theory: <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> directed graph has a directed even cycle, <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> two edged‐colored graph has an alternating colored even cycle, and <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> directed graph has an anti‐directed even cycle. We show {{that each of}} these, and two other variations, are special cases of a more general graph problem. We also show {{that one of these}} variations is NP‐complete. We present a general model to represent 5 different variations of the even cycle problem: 1. Even cycle problem (EC). Given a directed graph D, <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> D has <b>a</b> di rected cycle of even length...|$|R

5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While {{it is difficult to}} <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E
5|$|The third {{scenario}} {{involved an}} explosion at {{a nuclear reactor}} facility which shuts down two of three reactors. Everyone is killed in the disaster and scientists must send in an aerial robot to find the operating reactor building, enter the building (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the control panels to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> melt-down is imminent. The scientists are forced to maintain a 3 kilometer stand-off distance due to the extreme radiation hazard.|$|E
5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E

5|$|In {{answering}} {{both questions}} in the negative, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E
5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity {{to the point}} and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even if and only if the point is outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the point is outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E

5|$|The {{third phase}} of the project {{included}} several elements such as a powerful main engine whose propellant was pressure fed, a computer and a unit to measure inertia {{in order to control}} maneuvers. In addition, a long and close range radar system was required to guide the satellite (the system was taken from the Westinghouse radar used in Bomarc surface-to-air missiles), as were lights to illuminate the other satellite, and four cameras for observation. A radiation detector was to be installed to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> satellite was carrying either a nuclear weapon or something whose power source involved a radioactive substance. Other sensors included infrared and gravimetric sensors to ascertain the mass of the other satellite, while defensive counter measures would be installed to identify decoys, booby traps, anti-jamming devices, and enemy attack, along with nitrogen cold gas thrusters for orientation.|$|E
5|$|This act {{introduced}} the 11+ examination to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> {{child should be}} eligible for a grammar school, secondary modern or technical college, under the Tripartite System, but has since been phased out across {{the majority of the}} United Kingdom, with just several boroughs in England and Northern Ireland still using it. League tables published in March 2007 showed grammar schools throughout the country were outperforming comprehensive schools; data published ten years later in 2017 suggested a similar clear division between student attainment in grammar schools compared to comprehensive schools.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E
