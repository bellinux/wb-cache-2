[...] He says {{he referred to}} Jack Hamm's How to Draw Animals when drawing the horses that appear frequently throughout the book, which were rendered running with their legs splayed, as an artist may have depicted them {{in the days before}} the influence of Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of bodies in motion. [...] Brown drew each of the 1325 panels separately on watercolour paper on a block of wood he placed on his lap in lieu of a <b>drawing</b> <b>table,</b> which allowed him seamlessly to rearrange, insert, and delete panels as he saw fit. [...] The drawings were finished using both a thin ink brush (no larger than size 0) and dip pen with a Hunt 102 nib and black ink.|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} {{who teaches at the}} Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be a}} novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big <b>drawing</b> <b>table</b> covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E

(In the same vein, Wood also taped up another note to himself: [...] "Never draw anything you can copy, never copy anything you can trace, never trace anything you can cut out and paste up.") ...|$|E

2500|$|Several months later, {{after his}} split with DC, Kirby began freelancing {{regularly}} for Atlas {{in spite of}} his lingering resentment of Lee from the 1940s. Because of the poor page rates, Kirby would spend 12 to 14 hours daily at his <b>drawing</b> <b>table</b> at home, producing four to five pages of artwork a day. His first published work at Atlas was the cover of and the seven-page story [...] "I Discovered the Secret of the Flying Saucers" [...] in Strange Worlds #1 (Dec. 1958). Initially with Christopher Rule as his regular inker, and later Dick Ayers, Kirby drew across all genres, from romance comics to war comics to crime comics to Westerns, but made his mark primarily with a series of supernatural-fantasy and science fiction stories featuring giant, drive-in movie-style monsters with names like Groot, the Thing from Planet X; Grottu, King of the Insects; and Fin Fang Foom for the company's many anthology series, such as Amazing Adventures, Strange Tales, Tales to Astonish, Tales of Suspense, and World of Fantasy. His bizarre designs of powerful, unearthly creatures proved a hit with readers. Additionally, he [...] freelanced for Archie Comics' around this time, reuniting briefly with Joe Simon to help develop the series The Fly and The Double Life of Private Strong. Additionally, Kirby drew some issues of Classics Illustrated.|$|E

40|$|In 3 {{experiments}} {{the authors}} investigate how errors in perception produce errors in drawings. In Experiment 1, when Shepard stimuli were shown {{as a pair}} of tables, participants made severe errors in trying to adjust 1 part of the stimulus to match the other. When the table legs were removed, revealing a pair of parallelograms with minimal perspective cues, the illusion was weaker. The authors predicted that participants would err when <b>drawing</b> the <b>table</b> but not the parallelogram stimuli. The results of Experiment 2 support the prediction and establish a direct link between degree of perceptual distortion of the table stimuli and the severity of error in drawing. When drawing only the right-hand part of the figure, participants also erred to a greater degree in <b>drawing</b> the <b>table</b> than the parallelogram (Experiment 3). Collectively, the results suggest that perceptual distortion is linked with errors in <b>drawing</b> the <b>table</b> stimuli...|$|R
