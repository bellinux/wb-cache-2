A 1.5-inch slab of <b>gypsum</b> <b>concrete</b> weighs 13 {{pounds per square}} foot versus 18 pounds per square foot for regular concrete. Even though <b>gypsum</b> <b>concrete</b> weighs less, it still has the same compressive strength as regular concrete, based on its application as underlayment or top coat flooring. A 7-man work crew can lay 4-6 times as much <b>gypsum</b> <b>concrete</b> in a work day as regular poured Portland cement.

In addition, if the wooden subfloor is first coated in a film of latex, the adhesion between the subfloor and the concrete is much better than the adhesion obtained with “normal” concrete. A further benefit is that nails can be driven through the cement into the subfloor without it chipping.The cost of <b>gypsum</b> <b>concrete</b> is comparable to regular concrete, ranging from $1.75 per square foot to $6.00 per square foot.

Drilling sludge is a waste formed during drilling oil wells, and phosphogypsum is a waste of the chemical industry, formed as a result of the production of concentrational phosphoric acid.

In particular, the radon- 222 emanations from boards of calcium silicate, <b>gypsum</b> and lightweight <b>concrete</b> were measured experimentally in a small impervious radon chamber.

The rates found were 2. 43, 0. 22 and 0. 46 Bq m- 2 hr(1 respectively. Comparing with the emanation rate and the quantities of radon emitting construction materials in Hong Kong, these three partition materials have a low radon emitting level.

40|$|In {{this study}} both hemi-hydrate and {{anhydrite}} are tested as calcium sulphate binders for structural mortar and concrete. The advantage of using calcium sulphates instead of cement as a binder {{is the fact}} that the production of calcium sulphate is more environmental friendly than that of cement. For the calcinations of Portland cement, temperatures up to 1480 °C are needed, while the calcination of for instance hem-hydrate requires a temperature of 170 °C. The global cement industry produces around 1. 4 billion tons of C 02 per year. This is about 6 % ofthe total CO 2 production and thus it has a significant influence on the global warming of the earth / 1 /. Partially replacing cement by calcium sulphate binder could be one way to decrease the C 02 production. Applying new methods on gypsum based concrete could result in a type of concrete with a compressive strength up to 30 N/mm 2. With the right physical properties like flow ability and segregation resistance this could even be self compacting <b>gypsum</b> <b>concrete</b> (SCGC). Downside of the material is that, unprotected, it can only be used indoors, since it is non water-resistant. The calcium sulphate based concrete that has a compressive strength around 30 N/mm 2 can have different potentials of appliance. First of all it could replace cement based concretes where low to medium compressive strengths are required. Another application could be gypsum boards. These gypsum boards may be a good alternative for the use of drywall. The gypsum boards are stronger and can be self supporting, while dry wall has to be supported by a steel frame or wall. When the right aggregates and fillers are used these gypsum boards could even be produced at a lower cost than the dry wall, since the hemi-hydrate can be partially replaced by cheaper materials like sand and gravel. In this study first attempts to develop a competitive concrete based on gypsum are reported.

A hypothesis about an acoustic model built on acoustic theories combined with U-value theories is presented to answer the questions: •	Can U-value theory be combined with acoustic theories? •	Can the coefficient of heat be affirmed trough an acoustic measurement? The idea for this dissertation begun with a logical idea in mathematical similarity, between the coefficient of heat transmission units and sound intensity units. The U-value theory is based on assumptions such as initial resistance for inner walls and initial resistance for outer walls. The resistance in the material is interpreted through sound intensity theory. The argument is built upon mass law theory, which means if the frequency or thickness of the material layer doubles it implies an increase of sound reduction by 6 dB. Six different materials; foam, glas fiber insulation, MDF, <b>gypsum,</b> <b>concrete</b> and glass are being investigated through Insul 7 simulations. A practical lab assessment with two glass fiber insulation boards with different density is presented. These fiberboards were received from Saint-Gobain Isover, with alredy measured density and lambda value. The conclusions are drawn from simulations, practical lab testing and different theories. This dissertation confirms that it´s possible to use an acoustic model for U-value measurements, but the hypothesis need a further investigation. That means that the hypothesis is based on mass law theory only and the second degree effects are not calculated in this model. In other words, the model will most probably work better for materials with low density and will be less reliable on materials with high density...|$|E

40|$|Forestry {{harvesting}} on peats {{is known}} to result in significant losses of soil phosphorus (P) to adjacent waters, and the issue is becoming an increasingly serious concern as peatland forest stocks mature and reach harvestable age. One potential solution could be the use of low-cost P recovery techniques based on the chemical precipitation and/or adsorption of the dissolved fraction of soil P, which would otherwise be lost. Such recovery techniques have shown promise in similar applications on mineral soils. However, the interaction of peat with P adsorbing materials can significantly alter their adsorptive characteristics, and it is consequentially not known what materials might be suitable for this application. This study compared the performance of six potential soil amendments (aluminum water treatment residual (Al-WTR), crushed <b>concrete,</b> <b>gypsum,</b> magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, and steel wool) in removing P from aqueous solution {{in the presence of}} a typical forest peat soil. Comparison of adsorption isotherms plotted from these batch adsorption studies showed that the observed P adsorption maxima of Al-WTR and steel wool were increased by the presence of peat, from 10. 6 mg g- 1 and 20. 4 mg g- 1, to 11. 8 mg g- 1 and 52. 5 mg g- 1, respectively. In contrast, the observed P adsorption maxima of crushed <b>concrete,</b> <b>gypsum,</b> and magnesium oxide were reduced in the presence of peat, by 44 %, 87 %, and 37 %, respectively. The maximum P adsorption achieved by magnesium hydroxide was increased from 29. 8 mg g- 1 to 59 mg g- 1 at an amendment to peat-solid ratio of 1 : 4, but decreased from 73. 9 mg g- 1 to 23. 6 mg g- 1 at an amendment to peat-solid ratio of 1 : 10.

Construction {{of a large number}} of facilities based on standardized plans and architectural drawings, with the buildings designed to be the [...] "cheapest, temporary character with structural stability only sufficient to meet the needs of the service which the structure is intended to fulfill during the period of its contemplated war use" [...] was underway. To conserve critical materials, most facilities were constructed of wood, <b>concrete,</b> brick, <b>gypsum</b> board and <b>concrete</b> asbestos. Metal was sparsely used. The station was designed to be nearly self-sufficient, with not only hangars, but barracks, warehouses, hospitals, dental clinics, dining halls, and maintenance shops were needed. There were libraries, social clubs for officers, and enlisted men, and stores to buy living necessities. Finally, in December 1942, the first training unit, 80th Service Group arrived and the mission of the Service Group Training Center began.|$|R
