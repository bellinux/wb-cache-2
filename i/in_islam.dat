5|$|A major figure <b>in</b> <b>Islam,</b> Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to <b>in</b> <b>Islam</b> as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered}} to be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets <b>in</b> <b>Islam,</b> Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the Qedarites {{ceased to exist}} as a {{separately}} defined confederation or people. Allies with the Nabataeans, {{it is likely that}} they were absorbed into the Nabataean state around the 2nd century CE. <b>In</b> <b>Islam,</b> Isma'il is considered to be the ancestral forefather of the Arab people, and in traditional Islamic historiography, Muslim historians have assigned great importance in their accounts to his first two sons (Nebaioth and Qedar), with the genealogy of Muhammad, the Messenger of God <b>in</b> <b>Islam,</b> alternately assigned to one or the other son, depending on the scholar.|$|E

5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site <b>in</b> <b>Islam.</b> Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem <b>in</b> <b>Islam.</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{aimed to}} examine the Cupitt 2 ̆ 7 s {{conception}} {{in the light of}} Islamic paradigm. It is done by identifying negative impacts of postmodernism toward the existence of religion. Religion, in Don Cuppit view is alive in the term of “value”, “private realm”, “personal faith” and “counterculture”. Although Islam came from hundreds centuries ago, {{it does not mean that}} authentic <b>Islam</b> is <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> the past. <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> the past, <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> the present and <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> the future are different. Islam is not timeless doctrine, but changeable expression. Time is running; and Islam demanded to contextualize itself dynamically...|$|R
5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped <b>in</b> <b>Islam.</b> An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified <b>in</b> <b>Islam.</b>|$|E

5|$|The general {{principle}} behind {{the process of}} qiyas {{is based on the}} understanding that every legal injunction guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective. Thus, if the cause of an injunction can be deduced from the primary sources, then analogical deduction can be applied to cases with similar causes. For example, wine is prohibited <b>in</b> <b>Islam</b> because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads to the conclusion that all intoxicants are forbidden.|$|E

He married Gauri Chibber, a Punjabi Hindu, in a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony on 25 October 1991, after a six-year courtship. They have a son Aryan (born 1997) and a daughter Suhana (born 2000). In 2013, they became parents of a third child named AbRam, who was born through a surrogate mother. According to Khan, while he strongly believes <b>in</b> <b>Islam,</b> he also values his wife's religion. His children follow both religions; at home the Qur'an is situated next to the Hindu deities.|$|E
5|$|Darwaza was {{convinced}} that interpretations of the Quran were the only possible basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political and social thought, and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms <b>in</b> <b>Islam</b> and Islamic thinking. Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole tafsir—which Darwaza did—he had to justify his position by seeking a fatwa from the muftis of Aleppo and Damascus.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Islam,</b> doves and {{the pigeon}} family {{in general are}} {{respected}} and favoured because they {{are believed to have}} assisted the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in distracting his enemies outside the cave of Thaw'r, in the great Hijra.

5|$|Islamic feminists {{advocate}} women's rights, gender equality, {{and social}} justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, hadith (sayings of Muhammad), and sharia (law) towards {{the creation of a}} more equal and just society. Although rooted <b>in</b> <b>Islam,</b> the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's Muslim Consumers Association (PPIM) {{called for}} {{a ban on the}} film, {{claiming}} it is offensive to Islam. Secretary-General Maamor Osman claimed that the film was depicting the great flood as comedy and characterized God with the portrayal of a human, both of which are considered blasphemous <b>in</b> <b>Islam.</b> Similarly there was some public protest against Bruce Almighty being shown in theaters, but that movie was released on DVD and is now shown on television broadcasts. Evan Almighty was still released in Malaysia on August 23, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason <b>in</b> <b>Islam</b> is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E

5|$|Religions {{vary widely}} in {{their views of}} the ethics of birth control.

Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect to the more relaxed Reform sect. Hindus may use both natural and artificial contraceptives. A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not. <b>In</b> <b>Islam,</b> contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.|$|E

The campaign began on 20 March 1943, when von Krempler and Šuljak began an 18-day recruiting tour through 11 Bosnian districts.

5|$|Since Arafat {{was raised}} in Cairo, the {{tradition}} of dropping the Mohammed or Ahmad portion of one's first name was common; notable Egyptians such as Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak did so. However, Arafat dropped Abdel Rahman and Abdel Raouf from his name as well. During the early 1950s, Arafat adopted the name Yasser, {{and in the early}} years of Arafat's guerrilla career, he assumed the nom de guerre of Abu Ammar. Both names are related to Ammar ibn Yasir, one of Muhammad's early companions. Although he dropped most of his inherited names, he retained Arafat due to its significance <b>in</b> <b>Islam.</b>|$|E
