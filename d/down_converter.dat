5000|$|SPDC is {{stimulated by}} random vacuum fluctuations, {{and hence the}} photon pairs are created at random times. The {{conversion}} efficiency is very low, {{on the order of}} 1 pair per 1012 incoming photons. However, if one half of the pair (the [...] "signal") is detected at any time then its partner (the [...] "idler") is known to be present. The output of a Type I <b>down</b> <b>converter</b> is a squeezed vacuum that contains only even photon number terms. The output of the Type II <b>down</b> <b>converter</b> is a two-mode squeezed vacuum.|$|E

40|$|The {{technologies}} of direct digital <b>down</b> <b>converters,</b> digital frequency synthesis, and {{digital signal processing}} are being used in many commercial applications. Because of this commercialization, the component costs are being reduced {{to the point where}} they are economically viable for large scale accelerator applications. This paper will discuss two applications of these technologies to beam diagnostics. In the first application the combination of direct digital frequency synthesis and direct digital <b>down</b> <b>converters</b> are coupled with digital signal processor technology in order to maintain the stable gain environment required for a multi-electrode beam position monitoring system. This is done by injecting a CW reference signal into the electronics as part of the front-end circuitry. In the second application direct digital <b>down</b> <b>converters</b> are used to provide a novel approach to the measurement of beam intensity using cavity current monitors. In this system a pair of reference signals are injected into the cavity through an auxiliary port. The beam current is then calculated as the ratio of the beam signal divided by the average of the magnitude of the two reference signals...|$|R

50|$|Orthomode {{transducers}} {{are used}} in dual-polarized Very small aperture terminals (VSATs), in sparsely populated areas, radar antennas, radiometers, and communications links. They are usually connected to the antenna's <b>down</b> <b>converter</b> or LNB and to the High Power Amplifier (HPA) attached to a transmitting antenna.|$|E
50|$|RoF {{makes use}} {{of the concept of}} a remote station (RS). This station only {{consists}} of an optical-to-electrical (O/E) (and an optional frequency up or <b>down</b> <b>converter),</b> amplifiers, and the antenna. This means that the resource management and signal generation circuitry of the base station can be moved to a centralized location and shared between several remote stations, thus simplifying the architecture.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic {{calibration}} {{is needed}} {{when there are}} long waveguide runs between the antenna and first <b>down</b> <b>converter</b> (see Superheterodyne receiver). This compensates for temperature changes that alter the size and length of wave-guide, which will cause phase variations that produce incorrect angle error signals for long wave-guide runs. The Cal term is created by injecting a calibration signal into the receive waveguide while {{the system is not}} active (sum and delta). The angle error of the calibration signal is used to evaluate angle error during normal operation. Antenna tuning is used to make adjustments that create the desired error signal when the antenna is calibrated on an antenna range.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{satellite}} communications system, the ground station receiving antenna connect to an LNA because the received signal is weak. The received signal {{is usually a}} little above background noise since satellites have limited power and use low power transmitters. The satellites are also distant and suffer path loss: low earth orbit satellites might be 200 km (120 miles) away; a geosynchronous satellite is [...] away. A larger ground antenna would give a stronger signal, but a larger antenna can be more expensive than adding an LNA. The LNA boosts the antenna signal {{to compensate for the}} feed line losses between the (outdoor) antenna and the (indoor) receiver. In many satellite reception systems, the LNA includes a frequency block down-converter that shifts the satellite downlink frequency (e.g., 11 GHz) that would have large feed line losses to a lower frequency (e.g., 1 GHz) with lower losses. The LNA with <b>down</b> <b>converter</b> is called a low-noise block down-converter (LNB). Satellite communications are usually done in the frequency range of 100 MHz (e.g. TIROS weather satellites) to tens of GHz (e.g., satellite television).|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} logic gates for the {{implementation}} of a CORDIC is roughly comparable to the number required for a multiplier as both require combinations of shifts and additions. The choice for a multiplier-based or CORDIC-based implementation will depend on the context. The multiplication of two complex numbers represented by their real and imaginary components (rectangular coordinates), for example, requires 4 multiplications, but could be realized by a single CORDIC operating on complex numbers represented by their polar coordinates, especially if the magnitude of the numbers is not relevant (multiplying a complex vector with a vector on the unit circle actually amounts to a rotation).

40|$|The idea of {{software}} radio requires {{an expansion of}} digital signal processing towards the antenna. Hence, for converting the received signal to baseband, the need of efficient high speed digital <b>down</b> <b>converters</b> arises. In [1] digital down conversion was identified {{as one of the}} 'critical functionalities' because it has to run at a relative high sample rate, and has to provide high resolution. The common approach for digital down conversion (DDC) is the so called ROM table approach where the samples of the input signal are multiplied with amplitude values of the sine- and cosine-function stored in ROM. To achieve high resolution this technique requires a large look-up table which means large chip area, high power consumption, lower speed, and increased costs...|$|R
40|$|Due to pending line {{harmonic}} requirements {{at higher}} power levels, {{power factor correction}} (PFC) is required in some ac-to-dc off-line power converter applications. This type of power converter can be designed with two cascaded power stages similar to the configuration in Figure 1. The first stage is a boost converter that converts the ac voltage to dc voltage with PFC. The output voltage of the boost stage might {{be as high as}} 385 V to meet the universal line requirements of 85 VRMS to 265 VRMS. The second power stage is a forward <b>converter</b> that steps <b>down</b> the boost voltage. These designs often require two PWM controllers, one for each power stage. In some cases it is beneficial to synchronize the PFC controller with the step <b>down</b> <b>converter’s</b> controller, for example, when the UCC 3817 is properly synchronized with the <b>down</b> stream <b>converter,</b> it reduces the ripple current up to 40 % through the boost capacitor[1]. Some of these controllers do not provide the internal circuitry to synchronize the oscillator. Most of the controllers, however, do provide access to the oscillator ramp, which can be synchronized with external circuitry. The purpose of this application report is to describe how to synchronize a PFC controller’s oscillator in similar power systems to Figure...|$|R
