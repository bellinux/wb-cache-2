40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to devise a simple {{mechanical}} power formula for both peak and average power using a countermovement jump and reach test for both college male and female athletes. Forty-nine female and 69 male athletes were measured for height, weight, thigh circumference, thigh skinfold, upper leg length, and lower leg length. The athletes performed a countermovement jump and reach test off of a force platform. A Vertec jumping apparatus was used to measure vertical jump height and the force platform was used to acquire force/time data to determine actual peak and average power output. Eight anthropometric measurements, vertical jump height, and gender were the variables presented to develop the equations. A stepwise multiple regression statistical procedure was used to develop the prediction equations. Vertical jump height, mass, and body height were the significant (p. 05) and, therefore, not loaded into either equation. Predicted peak power and actual peak power values were 4, 707 t 1, 511 and 4, 687 ± 1, 612 watts, respectively. Predicted averagepower and actual average power values were 2, 547 ± 760 and 2, 463 ± 753 watts, respectively. The following best model regression-derived equations produced R 2 values of. 91 for peak power and. 82 for average power:Peak Power (W) = 78. 47 • VJ (cm) + 60. 57 • Mass (kg) - 15. 31 • <b>Ht</b> (<b>cm)</b> - 1, 308 Average Power (W) = 41. 41 • VJ (cm) + 31. 18 • Mass (kg) - 13. 86 • <b>Ht</b> (<b>cm)</b> + 431 Results of this study conclude that the two regression equations are good predictors of peak and average mechanical power output.

The data of 130 patients and 264 samples with an age range of 0. 1 - 15. 7 years old were collected during routine care. Blood samples were drawn at various times after administration. All patients received digoxin administration with a dose ranged of 1. 7 - 13. 6 μg/kg/day at Queen Sirikit Heart Center, Khon Kaen University, Thailand. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was developed from digoxin data by using NONMEM program (Version V) according to one-compartment of subroutine ADVAN 2 TRANS 2 model. Results: Weight, age, height {{and the presence of}} congestive heart failure (CHF) were significant covariates on CL. Weight and the presence of CHF were significant covariates on Vd. The final population model of CL and Vd in pediatric patients were as follows: CL/F (L/h) for infant (0 - 1 year) = 0. 322 * WT (kg); CL/F (L/h) for children (> 1 year) = (0. 138 * WT (kg) + 0. 0319 * <b>HT</b> (<b>cm)</b> * 0. 765 CHF; and Vd/F (L) for all ages = 9. 27 * WT (kg) * 1. 75 CHF.

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} is aimed to clarify the degree of {{leanness}} desired by contemporary young Japanese women using questionnaires and to use allometry to define the body weight boundary between the excessively lean and the others for a given height. Questionnaires on ideal body shape were distributed to female college students living in Akita and the suburbs of Tokyo. Data for 578 respondents, aged 18 to 21 years-old, were analyzed. The questionnaire asked the subjects to report their current and ideal body shape {{and to make a}} qualitative self-assessment of their weight. On average, the perceived ideal weight was 5. 2 kg lower than the current weight. The results also revealed that young women have a tendency to misunderstand their body shape and to regard themselves as heavier than they really were. Meanwhile, we defined leanness as a state of insufficient lean body mass (LBM, kg) in relation to height (<b>Ht,</b> <b>cm).</b> Allometric equation of LBM on Ht and the standard error of estimate (SEE) were calculated as LBM = 3. 87 X 10 - 3 XHt 1826 and 1. 09, respectively. The LBM boundary between the excessively lean and the others was determined using these values according to a statistical procedure comparing normal and abnormal values. The corresponding total body weight was estimated from the boundary LBM in the literature. Subsequently the body weight boundary for each height was tabulated in order to make young women reconsider weight control. The subjects were asked to assess the body weight boundary for their own height. The boundary values were found to be consistent with the sense o...|$|E
40|$|Thirty {{young male}} volunteers, 9 - 14. yrs, were studied to {{determine}} if a relationship existed between peak VO 2 and the 9 -min run distance. Physical characteristics for a 1 l Ss included ht, wt, and % fat. Ss were tested for volitional peak VO 2 on the treadmill using the Skinner et al. (1971) protocol. Variables measured were VE max, RER, HR max, and peak VO 2 (l-min - 1 ml/kg/min-l). A 9 -min run for distance was also performed by the Ss. A multiple regression technique was used to predict peak 90 from the 9 -min run distance. The resulting r value when predicting peak VO 2 in ml/kg/min from the 9 -min distance was 0. 693. The r value for prediction of peak VO 2 in l'min from the 9 -min run distance was 0. 583. Other variables measured were entered into the regression technique to improve the R such as age, ht, wt, HR, F 3 R, % fat, and body density. It was concluded that 2 equations which utilized. wt (kg) and ht (an) with the 9 -min run distance (yds) predicted peak V 02 values with the mst accuracy and practicality in ml/kg/min- (R=O. 7 89) and 1 'min- (R- 0. 966) : Peak k (ml/kg/min-l) = - 12. 13 t 0. 29608 (X 3) - 2 Peak yo 2 (1 -min-l) = - 3. 391 + 0. 017377 (X 3) + 0. 00072169 (XI) + 0. 033712 (X 2) Key: X 1 = 9 -min run distance (yds) X 2 = wt (kg) X 3 = <b>Ht</b> (<b>cm)</b> The multiple R value (0. 812) which combined % fat with the 9 -min was also concluded to be a goad predictor of peak V 02 (ml/kg/min- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{study of}} body {{composition}} in specific populations by {{techniques such as}} bio-impedance analysis (BIA) requires validation based on standard reference methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and cross-validate a predictive equation for bioelectrical impedance using air displacement plethysmography (ADP) as standard method to measure body composition in Mexican adult men and women. Methods This study included 155 male and female subjects from northern Mexico, 20 – 50 years of age, from low, middle, and upper income levels. Body composition was measured by ADP. Body weight (BW, kg) and height (<b>Ht,</b> <b>cm)</b> were obtained by standard anthropometric techniques. Resistance, R (ohms) and reactance, Xc (ohms) were also measured. A random-split method was used to obtain two samples: one was used to derive the equation by the "all possible regressions" procedure and was cross-validated in the other sample to test predicted versus measured values of fat-free mass (FFM). Results and Discussion The final model was: FFM (kg) = 0. 7374 * (Ht 2 /R) + 0. 1763 * (BW) - 0. 1773 * (Age) + 0. 1198 * (Xc) - 2. 4658. R 2 was 0. 97; the square root of the mean square error (SRMSE) was 1. 99 kg, and the pure error (PE) was 2. 96. There was no difference between FFM predicted by the new equation (48. 57 ± 10. 9 kg) and that measured by ADP (48. 43 ± 11. 3 kg). The new equation did not differ from the line of identity, had a high R 2 and a low SRMSE, and showed no significant bias (0. 87 ± 2. 84 kg). Conclusion The new bioelectrical impedance equation based on the two-compartment model (2 C) was accurate, precise, and free of bias. This equation can be used to assess body composition and nutritional status in populations similar in anthropometric and physical characteristics to this sample. </p...|$|E

This correlated to the turn-on voltage in I-V characterization, and the luminescence in the ambipolar TPD sample. In the unipolar sample, however, there is no such behaviour. This strongly suggests that the reduction of the hole mobility is due to site blocking/interacting caused by the excited triplet states. In further experiments in the presence of a magnetic field (500 mT), results an increase in the mobility (～ 5 %) and steady state current density in ambipolar samples only, this is consistent with magnetically mediated inter-conversion of 4 (blocking/interacting) triplet states to the singlet states. The correlation between the magnetic mobility increase and the steady state current increase offers direct evidence for a microscopic mechanism behind organic magneto resistance (OMR). Given the experimental evidence, we conclude that excitons (specifically triplet states play a critical role in charge transport in organic semiconductors.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{concern with}} environmental pollution significantly motivates {{the investigation and}} development of safe remediation technologies. The retention of contaminants by a biofilm supported on granular activated carbon {{is one of the}} promising technologies. This study aims the investigation and development of an innovative process for the removal of chromium (VI) from wastewater. The effect of the initial concentration of metal was tested, the polysaccharide and polymeric net of the E. Coli biofilm were quantified and the application of this system to a real effluent was made. The industrial effluent was provided by tannery factories. The support used for the biofilm formation was granular activated carbon (GAC) from MERCK with an average particle size of 2. 5 mm, characterised by N 2 adsorption (77 K) with an ASAP Micromeritics 2001 which indicated a Langmuir area of 1270 m 2 g- 1 and an average pore diameter of 2 nm. The use of activated carbon as a support is justified by the fact that this material is a versatile adsorbent due to its high surface area, porous structure, high adsorption capacity and surface chemical nature. The role of the biofilm was evaluated considering that microorganisms are quite adequate for heavy metals biosorption due to their ability to sorb metal ions, suitability for natural environments and low cost. Minicolumns (internal diameter = 2 <b>cm,</b> <b>ht</b> = 30 <b>cm)</b> were used for open systems studies, partially filled with GAC (15 g). The metal solutions were passed in upflow through the column with a flow rate of 5 ml/min (residence time of 19 min). Samples (5 ml) were taken, centrifuged and analyzed for metals using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, AAS. The results showed uptake values of 0. 19 mg/gbiosorbent, 3. 60 mg/gbiosorbent and 4. 61 mg/gbiosorbent, respectively for the initial concentration of 10, 50 and 100 mg/l. The quantification of polysaccharides and polymeric net reveled a value of 4. 77 mg/gbiosorbent for the polysaccharides and 142 mg/gbiosorbent, for the polymeric net. The polyssacharide and polymeric net give importante informations about the capacity of biofilm formation by the microrganism. The studies made with the industrial effluent showed values of Cr uptake of 0. 093 mg/gbiosorbent, for an initial concentration of 4. 2 mg/l. The value obtained for the removal percentage with the most diluted solution used (10 mg/l) was of 18 % (after 10 hours of experiment) and the value of removal percentage obtained with the industrial effluent was of 9 %, for the same period of time. This can be explainded by the fact that another compounds present in the industrial effluent than Cr(VI) can compete for the same active sites...|$|R

Between assessments, the experimental group performed exercises 2 x per week individually and 1 x per week supervised by co-researchers for 4 weeks. The control group was asked to continue pre-assessment physical activity. Results: Paired sample t-tests using SPSS software showed a significant increase in FMS scores for the experimental group (mean= 1. 06 ± 0. 789 SD, p= 0. 01). Significance was found between experimental FMS score mean increase and all wellness subcategory means (Psychological mean= 0. 058 ± 0. 289 SD, p= 0. 004; Emotional mean= 0. 073 ± 0. 265 SD, p= 0. 008; Social mean= 0. 018 ± 0. 796 SD, p= 0. 049; Physical mean= 0. 074 ± 0. 447 SD, p= 0. 008; Spiritual mean= 0. 00 ± 0. 513 SD, p= 0. 018; Intellectual mean= 0. 092 ± 0. 513 SD, p= 0. 003). Conclusion: Data indicated that an exercise therapy program significantly increased NB over a 4 -week period. An increase in NB also significantly affected all wellness subcategories. This may suggest therapeutic exercises used to improve NB increases all aspects of self-perceived wellness. As healthcare becomes increasingly integrated, therapeutic exercises may be considered to increase overall well-being. NACSM Professional Sponsor: Seth Paradi...|$|R
40|$|The setback {{in the use}} of Texas {{male sterile}} {{cytoplasm}} (Tms) by the corn blight disease (Helminthosporium maydis) encouraged the use of other and newer types of cytoplasmic male sterility (Cms and Sms) in hybrid seed corn production. Additional physiological information needed to be obtained concerning these new materials;Experiments were conducted near Ames in 1978 and 1979, to determine the yield performance of corn hybrids with Cms or Sms, and the relationships between ear development and growth of tassel and stem internodes in the male sterile and male fertile plants under varying plant densities;Wf 9 CmsHt x B 37 Ht, B 37 CmsHt x B 73 Htht, A 554 MysHtht x W 182 and Mo 17 WmsHtht x B 73 and their fertile counterparts were studied at 34, 594, 54, 362, and 74, 130 plants/ha densities in 1978. In 1979, Wf 9 CmsHt x B 37 Ht, B 37 CmsHt x B 73 Htht, B 73 CmsHt x N 28 Ht and Wf 9 Ht x C 103 <b>Ht</b> separately having <b>Cms</b> and Tms were studied at 39, 536, 59, 304, 79, 072, and 98, 840 plants/ha densities. Plant part measurements were taken at four sampling periods between 23 July and 17 August 1979 for the fertile and sterile counterparts of B 73 x N 28 and Wf 9 x C 103 (high density tolerant and intolerant hybrids, respectively) at the four plant densities used in 1979. The measurements were top ear, tassel and internode growths by weight and length. Sugar contents were also estimated by Brix values. Other measurements for all hybrids included date of 75 % silking, percent barrenness, stand count at harvest, and grain yields. Silage yield was determined in 1978;Results of the studies indicated that high plant densities reduced yields of hybrids but that the hybrids differed in the degree of response to the high density effect. Most of the hybrids with male sterile cytoplasm had significantly greater grain yields than the same hybrids with fertile cytoplasm at high densities. Days to silking and percent barrenness were reduced by the sterile cytoplasm, but it did not affect stand at harvest and silage yield in 1978. The Cms and Tms cytoplasms had similar grain yields in 1979. There were greater growths of tassel and internodes than of the ear during the two earliest sampling periods which corresponded with the time of late and final development of tassel and pollen. These results indicated potential competition against the ear. The sterile cytoplasm had a greater decrease in growth of tassels and stem internodes than did the fertile as density increased, which was interpreted as evidence of less competition with the ear. The stem sugar did not vary for cytoplasm but did for hybrid and density, being lower with increased density;The conclusions from the studies are that the Cms and Sms are similar in their responses at high plant densities and that the advantage of sterile plants over the fertile is the result of less competition of tassel and internodes with the ear in the sterile plants during pollen development with the result that the sterile plants are more tolerant to high plant density than are the fertile counterparts...|$|R
