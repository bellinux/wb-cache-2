This paper examines why quantitative easing has been necessary, and whether it is likely to result in higher demand or instead show up in higher inflation. Given the retrenchment in household spending, the risk is that quantitative easing has more impact on prices than output. And, with some first warning signs perhaps already evident in commodity markets, policymakers could face considerable difficulties unwinding the monetary stimulus. ...|$|R

2500|$|Hugh Laurie as Senator Tom James: {{a charming}} senator and Selina's new running mate after Doyle leaves the ticket. He is {{extremely}} popular with his colleagues and with voters. Selina {{was reluctant to}} pick him as a running mate {{out of fear that}} he would remember a time they nearly slept together. He frustrates Meyer at his desire to be involved with the <b>economy,</b> <b>going</b> so far as to request to serve simultaneously as Vice President and Secretary of the Treasury. In the general election, loophole rules in the Constitution dictate that in certain circumstances, James could become the Acting President (and subsequently President), further angering Selina. He offers that, should this occur, he would like her to be his Vice President. She later appoints him as her economy czar. Before the fourth season, Armando Iannucci met with Laurie in the UK after learning that he was a fan of Veep. The two began developing the character Tom James alongside the show's writers (also based in the UK). Iannucci describes Tom James as a [...] "normal, but ambitious operator ... this is someone who seems to outdo [...] in his ability." [...] (Seasons 4–6) ...|$|E
