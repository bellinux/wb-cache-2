Presented {{at the invitation of}} dental schools, this half-day interactive work-shop provides opportunities for a dental school’s administrators, staff, and <b>admissions</b> <b>committee</b> members to learn about the value of diversity in the educational environment and how to implement holistic admissions practices that take into consideration the experiences, attributes, and metrics of candidates for admission. This report explores the rationale {{for the development of the}} ADEA ACW, discusses lessons learned from presentation of the workshop at more than twenty-seven U.

40|$|College of {{pharmacy}} <b>admissions</b> <b>committees</b> face an im-portant and difficult task in selecting candidates for their professional degree programs. This task {{has become more}} difficult {{as the number of}} applicants has continued to increase. 1 Because the admissions process is highly competitive, with more applicants than space available, it is incumbent upon the <b>admissions</b> <b>committees</b> to select candidates who will not only excel academically, but also will have the necessary characteristics to advance the profession {{of pharmacy}}. 2 To achieve this goal, <b>admissions</b> <b>committees</b> need to apply and continually evaluate high-ly predictive and valid selection methods that increase the likelihood of selecting students who can withstand the rigors of the curriculum and become successful prac-titioners and scientists. 3 Numerous reports have been published that addressed which prepharmacy admission variables are the best pre-dictors of academic performance in the professional pro-gram.

50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, several Community {{settlement}} in the Negev and the Galilee were accused of barring Arab applicants from moving in.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this chapter}} we {{describe}} the institutional and policy-level strategies that dental schools in the Pipeline, Profession, and Practice: Community-Based Dental Education program used to modify their admissions practices to increase the diversity of their student bodies. Schools developed and used clear statements recognizing the value of diversity. They incorporated recent U. S. Supreme Court rulings regarding educational diversity into their revised admissions practices; these rulings cited diversity as both a “compelling interest ” and its use in only “narrowly tailored ” circumstances. We {{make a case for}} admissions decisions based on a comprehensive evaluation that balances the quantitative and qualitative qualities of a candidate. It refutes the practice of overreliance on standardized tests by detailing the whole-file review process to measure merit and professional promise. Also described is a range of noncognitive variables (e. g., leadership, ability to sustain academic achievement with competing priorities, volunteerism, communication, social background, and disadvantaged status) that schools can take into consideration in admis-sions decisions. <b>Admissions</b> <b>committees</b> can tie this comprehensive review of candidates into the case for promoting cross-cultur-al understanding and enhanced competence to provide care to patients from diverse backgrounds. In addition, the chapter reviews the challenges schools face in developing admissions policies and procedures that reflect the university’s mission for diversity. It addresses the importance of a diverse composition of the <b>admissions</b> <b>committee.</b> It also describes how tailored workshops and technical assistance for <b>admissions</b> <b>committees</b> can help schools improve their student diversity and how <b>admissions</b> <b>committee...</b>|$|R
