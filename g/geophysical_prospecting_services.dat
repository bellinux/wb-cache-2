40|$|Several {{zones of}} the {{northern}} part of Barcelona City have old water mining galleries located in {{the upper part of the}} granite formation. These galleries are now out of use and their localization are unkown. This fact involves some problemes when foundations are built near or over them. Usually geothecnical or <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> are only carried out to detect these underground galleries when foundation has been already built and, therefore, <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> is more difficult and hard to carry out. The presence of parts of the totally of the building foundation makes very difficult to apply some of the <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> techniques like some electromagnetic ones.

30|$|Considering that {{different}} <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> approaches {{have their own}} characteristics on detection accuracy and scope and integrating with the geological condition of research area, the time-lapse geophysical monitoring of this project has chosen three <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> methods, i.e. 3 D seismic prospecting, electrical prospecting and ground penetrating radar prospecting, among which 3 D seismic prospecting mainly aims at studying the structural changes of coal measure data (Peng et al. 2013), electrical prospecting aims at studying water bearing changes of strata (Han 2009) and ground penetrating radar aims at studying water bearing changes of shallow surface strata. It is helpful to improve the detection accuracy of geological results by organically integrating 3 D seismic prospecting, electrical prospecting and ground penetrating radar prospecting and fully taking advantage of strengths of each prospecting approach.|$|R

30|$|To {{study the}} impact of modern coal mining on {{overlying}} strata and its water bearing conditions, integrated time-lapse <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> integrating 3 D seismic, electrical and ground penetrating radar method were used. Through observing and analyzing the geophysical data variations of all stages of pre-mining, mining and post-mining as well as post-mining deposition stable period, impacts of coal mining on stratigraphic structure and its water bearing were studied and modern coal mining induced stratigraphic change pattern was summarized. The research result shows that the stratigraphic structure and the water bearing of surface layer during modern coal mining have self-healing pattern with mining time; the self-healing capability of near-surface strata is relatively strong while the roof weak; water bearing self-healing of near-surface strata is relatively high while the roof strata adjacent to mined coal beds low. Due to integrated time-lapse <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> technology has extra time dimension which makes up the deficiency of static analysis of conventional geophysical methods, it can better highlight the dynamic changes of modern coal mining induced overburden strata and its water bearing conditions.|$|R
40|$|Integrated <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> has {{produced}} remarkable {{results in the}} field of archaeology. In addition to the recognition of archaeological sites, the evolution of a site can be reconstructed. Therefore, the combination of more than one geophysical technique can aid in understanding the layout of a site and help to answer interpretative questions. In this paper, we illustrate the use of two <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> methods – ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) – to interpret the archaeological site of the so-called Domus septem Parthorum in the center of Rome (Italy). The ability to investigate the subsurface at different horizontal and vertical resolutions demonstrates the advantage of using these two methods. The GPR provides high-resolution data on the upper remains in the shallow part of the soil, and the ERT detects deeper targets for a complete and exhaustive reconstruction of the buried anomalies. The results of this paper confirm the archaeological hypothesis that this so-called domus was repurposed as a house of worship during the Late Antiquity. In particular, the integrated geophysical acquisition supports the possible existence of a buried Paleochristian basilica...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of natural or artificial lakes and reservoirs that can drain because of natural phenomena can generate catastrophic events affecting urban and agricultural areas {{next to the}} source area. Therefore, <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> techniques have been applied {{in the study of}} Sirino Lake, which, during the last century, was affected by the sudden opening of small sinkholes, resulting in the almost total draining of the lake and in the sudden increase of water flow rates of distal springs. Two electrical resistivity tomographies (ERTs) were carried out across the lake, using electrode arrays located on land and across the water body. Selfpotential (SP) data were acquired around the lake shore and the surrounding area. The <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> contributed significant data toward explaining the unique hydrogeological characteristics of the lake. Integration of geophysical, geological, hydrogeological, and geomorphological data allowed us to estimate the thickness of the lacustrine deposits beneath the lake, to describe the main patterns of the subsurface fluid flows in the area, and to identify possible water escape routes causing the piping phenomen...|$|R
