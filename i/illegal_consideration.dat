50|$|Total {{failure of}} {{consideration}} or <b>illegal</b> <b>consideration</b> by the party giving a guarantee will prevent its being enforced. Though in all countries the mutual assent {{of two or more}} parties is essential to the formation of any contract, a consideration is not everywhere regarded as a necessary element. Thus in Scotland a contract may be binding without a consideration to support it.|$|E
30|$|The {{average age}} of {{potential}} illegal migrants is slightly lower (24 years) than that of potential legal migrants (27 years). The proportion of married people among potential legal migrants is almost double (32 %) that among potential illegal migrants (17 %). The proportions of dependent people are higher for potential legal migrants than for potential illegal migrants. The average education level in the sample is secondary, with 27 % of people having reached this level. It {{is interesting to note}} that 55 % of potential illegal migrants have a low level of education, whereas they represent 33 % of potential legal migrants. Only 5 % of potential illegal migrants have a university level, which is five times less than in the population of potential legal migrants. People living in a house that they or their family own represent 56 % of the sample, which does not greatly vary according to the legal or <b>illegal</b> <b>consideration</b> of migration. Interestingly, a larger percentage among the potential illegal migrants belong to the Mouride brotherhood 9 (54 %) than among the potential legal migrants (39 %).|$|E
50|$|He is {{considered}} by many to be the greatest Maliki legal theoretician of the 13th century; his writings and influence on Islamic legal theory (uṣūl al-fiqh) spread throughout the Muslim world. His insistence on the limits of law underscores the importance of non-legal (not to be confused with <b>illegal)</b> <b>considerations</b> in determining the proper course of action, with significant implications for legal reform in the modern Islamic world. His views on the common good (maslahah) and custom provide means to accommodate the space-time differential between modern and premodern realities.|$|R
40|$|While the {{strength}} of the US-UK ‘special relationship’ has waxed and waned in recent years, many have viewed it as being generally beneficial. Peter Harris writes on one major casualty of the special relationship – the Chagos Islanders. Evicted from their home nearly 50 years ago, the Chagos Islands were converted into the US military base, Diego Garcia. Despite a 2000 High Court ruling that the islanders’ exile had been <b>illegal,</b> strategic <b>considerations</b> have since stood in the way of their return. Obama’s visit to the UK is an opportunity to reopen the issue...|$|R
50|$|Current lidar {{devices have}} a {{horizontal}} beam width of one metre at 300 metres, {{compared to the}} registration plate width of 30 cm, ensuring that little of the signal is scattered to following vehicles. Detecting the police signal in advance is difficult as the tight beam, short signal duration and expert targeting of individual vehicles ensures little scatter of the police signal from advance targeted vehicles. Modifying the vehicle to deflect, absorb or jumble the signal {{is likely to be}} ineffective as it is the registration plate that is targeted. Modifying the registration plate is easily detected and is illegal. Returning a false separate signal will be detected by current police lidar models and may be <b>illegal.</b> These <b>considerations</b> have not stopped a proliferation of evasion devices in the market.|$|R
40|$|The number if {{household}} employees {{has increased}} over a ten year time period, but the compliance rate for household employment tax filings has decreased. This study explores different explanations for non-compliance of household employment {{taxes in the}} United States. These explanations include detection risk, the employment of <b>illegal</b> immigrants, psychological <b>considerations,</b> the {{lack of knowledge about}} household employment taxes, the decrease in household employees affecting compliance rates, and compliance rates based on income and age. The results of a state-to-state comparison have a potential impact on overall compliance. Other explantions have no direct effect on compliance rates. B. A. (Bachelor of Arts...|$|R
50|$|It is not {{absolute}} in effect. For example, in Revill v Newbery {{an elderly}} allotment holder {{was sleeping in}} his shed with a shotgun, to deter burglars. On hearing the plaintiff trying to break in, he shot his gun {{through a hole in}} the shed, injuring the plaintiff. At first instance, the judge awarded damages on the basis that the defendant had used violence in excess of the reasonable limits allowed by lawful self-defence and was negligent to the standard of care expected of a reasonable man who found himself in such a situation. On appeal the defendant raised the defence of , but the Court of Appeal held that while public interest required that someone should not benefit from his <b>illegal</b> conduct, different <b>considerations</b> applied in cases arising in tort as opposed to those in a property or contract context. Old common law authorities and the Law Commission report (Liability for Damage or Injury to Trespassers) acknowledged the existence of some duty towards trespassers and the defendant could not rely on the doctrine to relieve himself of liability.|$|R
