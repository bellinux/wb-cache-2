5|$|The players union {{encouraged}} {{players to}} find work overseas, hoping owners would offer better deals <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> players having more options. Josh Childress, who played for Greek team Olympiacos {{before returning to the}} NBA in 2010, said he would not consider playing overseas during the lockout. He cited concerns with reliability of getting paid, differences in coaching styles, and lower standards of business travel compared to the NBA. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) announced on July 29 that it would allow players under NBA contracts to play overseas, provided that the contracts they signed had opt-out clauses that allowed players to return once the work stoppage ended. Stern said the league would allow players to play overseas, but he warned that it could divide the union and possibly jeopardize players' contracts if they were seriously injured. Most leagues permitted the signing of locked-out NBA players with the option of opting out; the Chinese Basketball Association, however, only allowed its clubs to sign foreign free agents who could play for at least the entire season. Chinese nationals were exempt from this rule; this allowed Yi Jianlian to return to the NBA upon the end of the lockout.|$|E

Rio collects real-time data both from drivers {{who use the}} Waze navigation app and pedestrians who use the public-transportation app Moovit. Rio was also talking to the owners of cycling app Strava to monitor movements of cyclists. It was noted that though initially the data the apps were sharing was all anonymous, more specific identifying details were possible, if people agreed to being monitored through their smartphones <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> benefits for them.|$|E
25|$|Punishments are {{reserved}} {{to the legal}} authorities and false accusations are to be punished severely. It {{has been said that}} these legal procedural requirements were instituted to protect women from slander and false accusations: i.e. four witnesses of good character are required for conviction, who were present at that time and saw the deed taking place; and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it they were not of good moral character, as they were looking at naked adults; thus no one can be convicted of adultery unless both of the accused also agree and give their confession under oath four times.|$|E

25|$|Ben-Gal {{described}} {{the battle to}} Eitan {{and told him he}} was not sure he could hold on. Eitan asked him to hold on for another half-hour. At this point, the remaining eleven tanks of the Barak Brigade arrived, and Eitan directed them to Ben-Gal. Eitan told Ben-Gal of Ben-Hanan's force. Kahalani called Captain Emi Palant, the senior officer behind the ramps, to use a signal flag to get the tank commanders' attention and direct them to the ramp, but waving the flag got no response. Palant fired his machine gun {{at the side of the}} nearest tank to get the commander to look out, and the message was passed. He ran from tank to tank and rapped on their turrets to get their attention before returning to his own tank and starting to move forward. No tank followed. Kahalani heard a sergeant from the 74th Battalion and ordered him to take his position and guard the wadi. The sergeant replied he did not have any shells left. Zamir, who was flanking his position to the south, reported a massive Syrian attack and asked for permission to move the remaining tanks to Zamir's company to a better position slightly to the south. Ben-Gal refused. Kahalani reported that he was unable to control the tanks, which kept drifting to the rear. Ben-Gal said he would try to get him more tanks. Kahalani ordered the sergeant to take his place, saying the Syrians would not try to attack <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> his tank.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dispersal}} {{of the family}} of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of Ibolo region of old Oyo kingdom, of Ooduan dynasty by Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently {{played a significant role in}} restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. She allowed herself to be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. He told her that the only thing they fear was FIRE, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and made the juice have a sleeping effect on the palace people. When they woke up after eating them, they found that she had gone to tell her people. They were soon prepared for the marauders.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} week of February, rumors began to {{circulate}} that D.C. United was in [...] "serious talks" [...] with FC Sochaux-Montbéliard to acquire U.S. national team forward Charlie Davies on loan from the French Ligue 1 side. Originally declining to comment about a possible loan Davies' agent, Lyle Yorks, told reporters that Davies was seeking a loan, in order to have more ample playing time while recovering from a serious of injuries he suffered in an automobile accident in October 2009. On 2 February, D.C. United posted a press release that stated Davies would be training with United during their Fort Lauderdale training camp, for a week starting on 3 February. Subsequently, club public relations released a press statement declaring that Davies would join United on loan <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him match fit.|$|E

The participant was instructed to select randomly (at their leisure) between either pressing the [...] "go" [...] button, or not pressing it, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a decide signal. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown after the initial go-signal ("decide trials"), for example, required that the participants prevent themselves from acting impulsively on the initial go-signal and then decide what to do. Due to the varying delays, this was sometimes impossible (e.g. some decide signals simply appeared {{too late in the}} process of them both intending to and pressing the go button for them to be obeyed).|$|E
2500|$|She {{also made}} some {{statements}} pointing to Westerfield's possible innocence. The strongest evidence against Westerfield {{was found in}} his RV, particularly a drop of van Dam's blood and her hand print. That evidence could be innocently explained if, at some previous time while it was parked unlocked in the streets outside her home, van Dam had entered that vehicle, perhaps to explore it out of curiosity. There was no testimony she had done so, but Grace said she [...] "can imagine a little girl wandering into a RV and playing in it, much as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a swimming pool, they might jump in, or a playground, they might play on it".|$|E
2500|$|Since {{leaving the}} White House, {{she and her}} husband reside in the River Oaks {{community}} in Houston, Texas and at the Bush compound in Kennebunkport, Maine. Bush described January 20, 1993, the day of Bill Clinton's inauguration, a [...] "tough day" [...] for her and George. After returning to Houston, the two were visited by their son George W. and at that point Barbara realized she had not cooked in twelve years, and had difficulty driving on her own to the point where she did not drive far from home {{for a long time and}} her husband warned people to get out of the way <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> her car. A month after they left office, in February 1993, Bush was surprised by her husband when he booked them on the [...] "Love Boat" [...] ship Regal Princess. On April 27, 1993, Bush and her husband had breakfast with Margaret Thatcher during her speaking tour. Thatcher mentioned the most recent celebration of former President Ronald Reagan's birthday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, where he orated the same card twice. Bush read about the incident after Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which she called a [...] "tragedy for both" [...] Mr. and Mrs. Reagan. On January 16, 1995, Bush flew to Austin, Texas with her husband to attend her son George W.'s inauguration as Governor of Texas. After attending a church service, the family went to the state capitol for the ceremony. While waiting, the Bushes had visits from former governors and their wives. After dining in the Governor's Mansion, the Bushes and their son Marvin flew back to Houston.|$|E
