2500|$|Roger Sargent (a {{close friend}} and {{photographer}} of the band) described their relationship as like [...] "first love, and all the jealousy and obsessiveness that comes with that" [...] - adding [...] "I think there's, y'know, obsession and jealousy on both of their sides. They bitch about each other to each other or to other people. They have a bond, intellectually and spiritually, like nothing I've ever seen ... but sometimes, you know, you just think, God, why don't you just get a room?!" [...] In the same interview, a Radio One documentary, upon being asked just how close their relationship was, Doherty responded [...] "I love him. Wouldn't go, um - certainly not on Radio 1 - go into too much detail, but... we had lots of wonderful times together, yeah." [...] Barât, when questioned similarly, steadfastly denied that the relationship had involved anything [...] "physical". Barât has insisted that [...] "people are really into conjecture" [...] and has frequently denied having {{a sexual relationship with}} Doherty. However, in a 2011 interview when asked if the two had ever had a physical relationship he replied [...] "There have been moments <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> where physicality has ensued." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April, {{the sisters}} decided to flat {{together}} but trouble arose with Brooke's flatmate's Bella Cooper (Amelia Reid) and Luke Durville (Gerald Urquhart) refusing to move out. Brooke ended up manipulating the two into relationship problems {{to get them}} out but ultimately helped the two and was at odds with Bree's antagonistic view of the couple. Brooke and Bree's mother Annette (Louise Wallace) returned in July 2012 and the cast enjoyed portraying the relationship between the mother and her illegitimate daughter, with Wallace stating: [...] "It's good looking at the back story and what happened <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> and where it all went wrong, why she hates me and why I don't give a rats arse about her. We are deeply flawed." [...] She went on to state that Annette would have never; [...] "anticipated having to deal with this part of her past, so it throws her a real curveball when she arrives and discovers Bree has firmly entrenched herself in Brooke's life" [...] and that; [...] "In some ways, Bree and Annette are more similar than Brooke and Annette, which really riles Annette." [...] Following her lack of respect from Annette, Bree held her captive and mentally tortured her. She decided that life would be easier as Brooke and started to adopt her personality, [...] "All she really wants is acceptance and love and, as we're seeing now, she's finding a way for that to happen by adopting Brooke's persona." [...] The storyline was compared to films: Fatal Attraction and Single White Female, though Blampied tried not to be influenced by them. The storyline climaxed in Bree, under the identity of Brooke, attempting to murder her sister and hiding her body in a storage container. Vinnie realised something was wrong and a search party soon found Brooke. Bree tried to escape but was mown down by a forklift. After finally accepting what she had done was wrong, Bree tried to make up with Brooke but ended up being sectioned to a psychiatric ward.|$|E
