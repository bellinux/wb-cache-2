5000|$|A <b>suicide</b> <b>gene,</b> in genetics, {{will cause}} a cell to kill itself through apoptosis. Activation of these genes can be due to many processes, but the main {{cellular}} [...] "switch" [...] to induce apoptosis is the p53 protein. Stimulation or introduction (through <b>gene</b> therapy) of <b>suicide</b> <b>genes</b> is a potential way of treating cancer or other proliferative diseases. <b>Suicide</b> <b>genes</b> {{form the basis of}} a strategy for making cancer cells more vulnerable, more sensitive to chemotherapy. The approach has been to attach parts of genes expressed in cancer cells to other genes for enzymes not found in mammals that can convert a harmless substance into one that is toxic to the tumor. Most <b>suicide</b> <b>genes</b> mediate this sensitivity by coding for viral or bacterial enzymes that convert an inactive drug into toxic antimetabolites that inhibit the synthesis of nucleic acid. <b>Suicide</b> <b>genes</b> must be introduced into the cells in ways that ensure their uptake and expression by as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting their expression by normal cells. <b>Suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy for cancer requires the vector to have the capacity to discriminate between target and non target cells, between the cancer cells and normal cells.|$|R

50|$|One of the {{challenges}} of cancer treatment is how to destroy malignant tumors without damaging healthy cells. A new method that shows great promise for accomplishing this employs {{the use of a}} <b>suicide</b> <b>gene.</b> A <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> is a gene which will cause a cell to kill itself through apoptosis. There are currently two methods of <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy being used. Gene-directed enzyme-producing therapy (GDEPT) uses a gene taken from the cancer cell and then modified with other genes to form enzymes that are harmless to healthy cells. This foreign enzyme is inserted into the tumor cells where it releases a prodrug, which is a small molecule harmless to healthy cells, but destructive to cancerous cells. The modified <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> converts the non-toxic prodrug into a cytotoxic substance. The second method of <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy is called virus-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy. This uses a virus, such as herpes simplex or cold virus, as the carrier, or vector, to deliver the modified genes to the cancer cells. <b>Suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy is not necessarily expected to completely eliminate the need for chemotherapy and radiation treatment for all cancerous tumors. The damage inflicted upon the tumor cells, however, makes them more susceptible to the chemo or radiation. This approach has already proven effective against prostate and bladder cancers. The application of <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> therapy is being expanded to several other forms of cancer as well. Cancer patients often experience depressed immune systems, so they can suffer some side effects of the use of a virus as a delivery agent.|$|R

Growth of primary tumors was suppressed when treated with Ad-tk plus Ad-MCP 1 (1 : 1 and 1 : 0. 1) as compared with Ad-tk alone. The antitumor effects against tumor rechallenge tended to be high in the Ad-tk plus Ad-MCP 1 group (1 : 0. 1). The effects were dependent on production of Th 1 type-cytokines.

We tested truncated Bid (tBid), a human pro-apoptotic protein that induces apoptosis very rapidly and efficiently, as <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> for gene therapy against HIV- 1 infection. Results When tBid was introduced into the HIV- 1 LTR-based, Tat- and Rev-dependent transgene expression vector pLRed(INS) 2 R, very efficient induction of apoptosis was observed within 24 hours, but only in the presence of both HIV- 1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev.

The most effective and consolidated cell therapy approach is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only cure for several patients with high-risk haematological malignancies. The potential of allogeneic HSCT is strictly dependent on the donor immune system, particularly on alloreactive T lymphocytes, that promote the beneficial graft-versus-tumour effect (GvT), but may also trigger the detrimental graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). Gene transfer technologies allow to manipulate donor T cells to enforce GvT and foster immune reconstitution, while avoiding or controlling GvHD. The <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> approach is based on the transfer of a <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> into donor lymphocytes, for a safe infusion of a wide T cell repertoire, that might be selectively controlled in vivo in case of GvHD.

Here, we propose a <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> approach, based on cell cycle-dependent promoter Ki 67 -driven expression of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK). We generated a PSC line expressing this construct and induced neural differentiation. In vitro, proliferating PSC and early neural precursor cells (NPC) were killed by exposure to ganciclovir. In vivo, transplantation of PSC led to tumor formation, which was prevented by early ganciclovir treatment. Transplanted NPC {{did not lead to}} tumor formation and their survival and neural maturation were not affected by ganciclovir. In conclusion, the cell cycle promoter-driven <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> approach described in this study allows killing of proliferating undifferentiated precursor cells without expression of the <b>suicide</b> <b>gene</b> in mature neurons. This approach could also be of use for other stem cell-based therapies where the final target consists of postmitotic cells...|$|R
50|$|Foreigners from Afghanistan and Iraq, {{as well as}} Afghan-trained Somalis, play an {{important}} role in the group's leadership ranks owing to their combat experience. Bringing with them specialized skills, these commanders often lead the indoctrination of new recruits, and provide training in remote-controlled roadside bombings, <b>suicide</b> attack <b>techniques,</b> and the assassination and kidnapping of government officials, journalists, humanitarian and civil society workers.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{viral vector}} system was {{established}} to efficiently transfer and express so-called <b>suicide</b> <b>genes</b> in human tumors. Following administration of a harmless proding the suicide protein transforms this into a highly toxic metabolite {{which leads to the}} destruction of the tumor cells. 3 different <b>suicide</b> <b>genes</b> were inserted into the foamy virus based vectors and evaluated in vitro. Of these one viral vector, which transduces the bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylase gene, was identified as a promissing candidate vector for further studies. (orig.)

40|$|With recent {{advances}} in genetic engineering, tumor biology, and immunology, gene therapy has been recognized as a promising new treatment option for various cancers, including prostate cancer. Several clinical trials of prostate cancer gene therapy, using therapeutic <b>genes</b> which include <b>suicide</b> <b>genes,</b> immunomodulatory genes, tumor suppressor genes, and anti-oncogenes, are under way and preliminary reports have emerged. Although gene therapy for prostate cancer is still {{at an early stage}} and requires additional technological breakthroughs, new insights obtained from recent clinical trials indicate a promising potential for prostate cancer gene therapy. In this report, general concepts, current progress, and future prospects in prostate cancer gene therapy are summarized...|$|R
