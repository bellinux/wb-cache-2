30|$|This {{simulation}} {{study of}} silver nanoparticle exposure when operating a printed electronics printer using nanosilver conductive ink is very useful for estimating silver nanoparticle exposure in the workplace.

30|$|To {{estimate}} {{particle number}} concentration and particle size distribution released during operation of printed electronics, several particle analyzers were used. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), combining a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, 4220, HCT Co., Ltd, Icheon, Korea) and condensation particle counter (CPC, 4312, HCT Co., Ltd), was used to monitor the particle size distribution with an electrical mobility diameter ranging from 7.37 to 289.03  nm. Another condensation particle counter (CPC 3775, TSI Co., Ltd, 1 – 107  particles/cm 3, detection range) was used to monitor the number concentration. Plus, a dust monitor (Model 1.109, Grimm) was used to observe the particle size distribution with a diameter ranging from 0.25 to 32  µm. After starting the printed electronics printer, measurements were taken outside the <b>exposure</b> simulation <b>chamber</b> for 2  h and inside the <b>exposure</b> simulation <b>chamber</b> for 1  h. In addition, to measure the background, further measurements were taken outside the <b>exposure</b> simulation <b>chamber</b> for 2  h after terminating the printing operation.|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{measures}} {{of air and}} vegetation concentrations in an <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber</b> and a two-box mass balance model are used to quantify factors that control the rate and extent of chemical partitioning between vegetation and the atmosphere. A continuous stirred flow-through <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber</b> was used to investigate the gas-phase transfer of pollutants between air and plants. A probabilistic two-compartment mass-balance model of plant/air exchange within the <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber</b> was developed and used with measured concentrations from the chamber to simultaneously evaluate partitioning (K{sub pa}), overall mass transfer across the plant/air interface (U{sub pa}) and loss rates in the atmosphere (R{sub a}) and aboveground vegetation (R{sub p}). The approach is demonstrated using mature Capsicum annuum (bell pepper) plants exposed to phenanthrene (PH), anthracene (AN), fluoranthene (FL) and pyrene (PY). Measured values of log K{sub pa} (V{sub [air]}/V{sub [fresh plant]}) were 5. 7, 5. 7, 6. 0 and 6. 2 for PH, AN, FL and PY, respectively.

When compared with personal exposure levels measured at a printed electronics workplace, the MOE was also greater than 1000, supporting the data from the <b>exposure</b> simulation <b>chamber.</b> The low concentration of silver nanoparticles released was likely due to the high viscosity of the conductive ink containing silver nanoparticles.|$|R

40|$|A simplifi ed {{approach}} is proposed {{and used to}} study the TiO 2 nanoparticle transport and diffusion in an <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber.</b> This <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber</b> is used to assess lung toxicity in rats resulting from the inhalation of airborne nanoparticles. The simplifi ed approach uses computational fl uid dynamics (CFD) commercial software. The mathematical model for airfl ow {{is based on the}} three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with turbulence modeling. The mathematical model for airborne nanoparticles transport is based on assumptions such that their motions {{are similar to those of}} a single-sized diameter distribution of a passive contaminant. This model is valid as long as the nanoparticle concentration is low and the particle diameter is small enough that settling is negligible, which is the case for the <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber</b> studied. With this model, the diffusion coeffi cient is a property that plays a signifi cant role in the transport of airborne nanoparticles. The particle diffusion coeffi cient can be expressed in terms of a friction coeffi cient, and three possible relationships to model particle diffusion are presented. Their infl uences on the friction and diffusion coeffi cients are considered for the particu-lar case of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Although all the models studied here predict a decrease in the value of the diffusion coeffi cient with increasing particle diameter, some signifi cant variations can be observe...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} achieving uniformly distributed electric field within a metal waveguide.

40|$|Four male {{volunteers were}} exposed at rest for two periods of two hours, {{separated}} by a one hour exposure free interval, to 50 ppm 2 -butoxyethanol (BE) vapour generated in an <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber.</b> During the first two hour period the men were exposed by mouth only via a respiratory valve connected by tubes to the <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber.</b> During the second exposure period the men were exposed by skin only while sitting inside the <b>exposure</b> <b>chamber,</b> naked except for shorts, and wearing a respiratory protection mask supplied with compressed air.

The average concentration in blood and the calculated rate of uptake of BE were about three to four times higher during dermal exposure than during inhalation exposure. These experiments suggest that dermal uptake of BE accounts for about 75 % (45 - 85 % in individual experiments) of the total uptake during whole body exposure to BE vapour. Thus it appears that the use of a respiratory protection mask will not protect efficiently against exposure to BE vapours.
