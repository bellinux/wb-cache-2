Neurite outgrowth from explants of 8 -d chick embryo dorsal root ganglia was achieved at very low NGF concentrations with heart conditioned medium during overnight culture. Quickly incrasing the NGF concentration in the growth medium dramatically affected GC and neurite morphology: the majority of GCs and neurites collapsed and retracted towards the cell body over a course of approximately 2 - 5 min. Retraction was elicited by increasing NGF levels from 0 to 0. 05 ng/ml to as little as 0. 5 ng/ml but did not occur if the NGF concentration during the initial overnight culture period exceeded 0. 8 ng/ml, regardless of how much the concentration was elevated.

Increased <b>NT</b> is <b>seen</b> in a diversity of fetal malformations. The mechanism explaining the abnormal fluid accumulation and the transient nature of NT remains unexplained. METHODS: The nuchal regions of normal and trisomy 16 mouse embryos were examined for (lympho) vascular abnormalities using immunohistochemical markers against lymphatic vessels (LYVE- 1) and smooth muscle (1 A 4) and endothelial (CD 34) cells. Additionally, an ultrasonographic study was carried out on 17 human fetuses with an increased NT. Two of these fetuses were examined morphologically. RESULTS: In both abnormal human and mouse specimens, we found a mesenchyme lined cavity within the posterior nuchal region as well as bilaterally enlarged jugular LYVE- 1 positive lymphatic sacs. The persistence of jugular lymphatic sacs was also confirmed by ultrasound in 14 human fetuses with increased NT. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify the cause of increased NT as mesenchymal oedema {{in the presence of}} distended jugular lymphatic sacs, detected by the hyaluronan receptor LYVE- 1. The delayed organization and connection of these lymphatic sacs to the venous circulation might explain the transient nature of NT. Disturbance in timing of endothelial differentiation might be a common denominator in the origin of NT, linking cardiovascular and haemodynamic abnormalities...|$|R
