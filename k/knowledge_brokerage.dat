40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the knowledge retrieval networks behind the adoption of farm biogas in an area of Mediterranean Europe featuring arable farming systems. The overarching objective of the analysis is to help and understand the interplay between biogas adopters and the stakeholders of the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovations System (AKIS). Specifically, the paper proposes an application of social network analysis that aims at bringing out the influence of knowledge exchanged within the system on adopters' business decisions, as well as adopters' contribution to knowledge upgrading. Social network analysis focuses on the estimation of three network attributes (cohesion, <b>knowledge</b> co-creation, and <b>brokerage)</b> using primary data, collected in 2015 via questionnaire to plant adopters. Self-education, upstream industry, agronomists, farmer/biogas unions, university, public-funded projects, and public research centers are AKIS’ stakeholders, which adopters turn to when seeking for information and/or know-how. Upstream industry is the most influential node and the one that can help knowledge diffusion across adopters, regardless of their background. Self-accessible resources are major providers of information at the adoption-decision stage. The networks are centralized on self-education tools, while upstream industry and the Research Center on Animal Productions are the brokers. Policy intervention aimed at improving AKIS in the biogas sector should involve the upstream industry in decision-making, while considering the duality of self-accessible information vs. physical advisors. This paper shows evidence from a region where public incentives have allowed biogas diffusion, despite the region not being intrinsically suitable for it. Study findings may be useful for policy-makers and researchers who deal with the prevention, or mitigation, of the negative externalities of land use change via the promotion of informed technology diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This collection consists of evaluations of research-training events, knowledge exchange activities {{and impact of}} the practitioner research programme. There are significant challenges around improving, or even maintaining, the quality of health and social care for older people both in the UK and across {{many parts of the}} world. This project starts from the premise that in order to improve the health and social care for older people {{there is a need for}} a stronger evidence base forthose designing or providing care, greater sharing of this evidence base and better use of this evidence to improve the lives of older people. One way of making a contribution across these dimensions is through moving towards the co-production of knowledge between academic researchers, those involved in designing and delivering care, and those receiving care. This is beneficial in terms of ensuring that the evidence produced around older people's care is directly relevant to the needs of those involved in providing or receiving care, and it ensures that those outside academia have better access, awareness and ownership of the research under production. This project therefore seeks to contribute to our understanding of effective research use in practice and to improving care for older people by strengthening the use and usefulness of research to inform the design and delivery of this care. In order to achieve this, the project aims to: 1. Extend theoretical and practical understandings of the <b>knowledge</b> translation, <b>brokerage</b> and exchange processes that are effective between academics, users, policymakers and practitioners when sharing good practice in the production and utilisation of findings relating to the health and social care of older people 2. Improve the volume and quality of research created between those involved in delivering care for older people, older people receiving care and academics 3. Increase awareness of, and improve access to, research created by those involved in providing care for older people 4. Support greater engagement and collaboration between researchers and practitioners involved in researching and delivering care for older people across health and social care contexts. The need which underpins this proposal is twofold: first, there is a need to link more strongly the use of research evidence with policy and practice improvements in the care of older people. Second, we need to know more about how knowledge sharing, collaboration and engagement between those involved in the creation of research and those who are involved in providing services can be more effective, potentially utlising the practitioner research programme model. In order to achieve these aims set out above the project will involve the following activities: 1) Synthesising the evidence about improving research use by and usefulness of research for those involved in receiving or delivering care, specifically examining the role of practitioner research and building on learning from recent projects 2) An exploration of the research priorities of the project partners in developing and sharing research evidence on the care of older people 3) The delivery of a Practitioner Research Programme (PRP) to support the development of small-scale research projects led by those delivering care for older people and involving older people receiving care, academic researchers and knowledge brokers in the co-production and translation of this research. Programme delivery will include supporting networking, knowledge exchange and sharing between those individuals and organisation undertaking the research projects, and the promotion and dissemination of this research across wider national and international networks. 4) Sharing existing and emerging evidence about how to support and embed practitioner research activities, and methods of improving engagement and collaboration between researchers and those involved in delivering services for those who require support Project partners will be NHS Lothian,Scottish Care, Alzheimer Scotland. Glasgow City Council, and West Lothian Local Authority This project brings together a team of academics, policy-makers, practitioners, older people accessing health and social care provision, and specialists in evidence-use in practice and knowledge media. Together we will draw together existing evidence and generate new knowledge and understanding about improving health and social care for older people, and embed the use of this evidence to then improve the lives of older people across Scotland. These benefits will be for academic, practitioner, policymaker and service user audiences...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{strategic}} management literature lacks {{a comprehensive}} {{explanation as to}} why seemingly similar business models in the same industry perform differently. This paper strives to explain this phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach – The model is conceptualized and accompanied by a case study on the airline industry to explain <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> that creates value from the effective utilization of knowledge resources acquired from intra- and inter-firm environments. Findings – The model explains a cyclical view of business model flexibility in which the knowledge-based resource accumulation of the business model is spread across the intra- and inter-firm environments. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> strategies from the inter- and intra-firm environments result in improved performance of the business model. The flexibility that the business model acquires is determined by how efficiently resource accumulation is aligned with its external environment. Originality/value – The paper effectively integrates the concepts of <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> and business models from a resource accumulation-based view and simultaneously arrives at the performance heterogeneity of seemingly similar business models within the same industry. It has performance implications for firms that start out without any distinct resources of their own, or that use an imitated business model, to attain better performance through business model evolution aligned with successful <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> strategies.

40|$|The {{provision}} {{of renewable energy}} by agriculture – so called agroenergy – {{is a key element}} of the Europe 2020 Strategy and has sparked the public and research debates on the bio-based economy. Hot topics involve direct and indirect land use change, as well as the ability of agroenergy to foster or hinder food and energy security. Worldwide research has dealt with those and other issues associated with the sustainability of the diffusion of agroenergy generation systems, but the subject is still open. The agricultural sectors’ contribution to the {{provision of}} energy is central issue in Horizon 2020 strategies and has shaped the public and research debates on the future of bio economy. The common agricultural policy (CAP) {{has been one of the}} main drivers of farmers’ behaviour changes and represents the main agricultural policy instrument to address viability of rural areas and maintaining the profitability of the agricultural sector. In addition, the European Commission backs the agricultural knowledge and innovation system (AKIS), being the key to successful implementation of a bioeconomy in the EU. AKIS-specific measures are also included in the rural development policy of the CAP 2014 - 2020. Then, studying the AKIS is important for policy planning in the EU. Chapter 2 analyses the AKIS behind the adoption of farm biogas in an area of central Italy, thereby describing adopters’ and business typologies. The methodology relies on social network analysis of primary data, collected via questionnaire to plant adopters, and focuses on the estimation of three network attributes: cohesion, <b>knowledge</b> co-creation, and <b>brokerage.</b> We highlight three business models: i. e. multifunctional farm, entrepreneurial farm, and Energy Service Company. The latter is the most widespread. Self-education, upstream industry, agronomists, farmer/biogas unions, university, public-funded projects, and public research centres are AKIS’ stakeholders, which provide information and know-how. Upstream industry is the most influential node, the one that can help knowledge diffusion across adopters, regardless of their background. Self-accessible resources are the main providers of information at the adoption-decision stage. The networks are centralized on self-education tools, while upstream industry and the Research Centre on Animal Productions is the broker. Policy intervention aimed at improving AKIS in the biogas sector should involve the upstream industry in decision making, while considering the duality self-accessible information vs. physical advisors. To contribute to the ongoing policy debate towards CAP reform, Chapter 3 provides an empirical model to simulate the impact of alternative CAP mechanism on the provision of renewable energy. By applying a dynamic mathematical programming model the paper tests the impact new policy measures design on provision of second-generation of bio fuel crops that represent a relevant option for the Tuscany farmers. Results show that CAP reform positive impacts on the supply of energy crops mainly due to the introduction of greening payments, which allows an enlarging of crops diversification. Model results stress also the income stabilisation effects of energy production introduction at farm level, due to reduction of farm exposure to the market prices fluctuations. Chapter 4 contributes to the ongoing debate on the sustainability of agroenergy. We propose an empirical model to simulate the diffusion of farm biogas installations and estimate a set of indicators covering the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability at the regional level. Model results show that agroenergy production can help farmers stabilise their income and keep viable rural areas, despite some trade-offs among socio-economic and environmental indicators. Major drawbacks are environmental risks associated with farming intensification...|$|R
40|$|There {{is concern}} that the present {{education}} designed for the 19 th century and an industrial machinery no longer suits the complex problems of the post-industrial 21 st century.   Complexity arises out of the fused multi-dimensional characteristics of social and development problems, yet universities continue to address these {{as if they were}} well configured to be addressed by existing academic disciplines.   Universities, expected to be champions of educational reforms to suit development needs are themselves challenged concerning their relevance.   The challenge is even more crucial for African universities especially those in the sub-Saharan region confronted with persistent and unbearable levels of poverty and food insecurity.   Can African universities contribute to the reversal of the situation?   Through innovations competence development for university staff, this thesis addresses the question of relevance of the African university in the sub-Saharan region to contemporary development challenges.   Farming being an important element in the livelihood of the majority of people in the region, the research focuses on agriculture using Makerere University in Uganda as a specific case. Experiences of the sub-Saharan Africa suggest that a narrow technological focus, as the driver of development is unlikely to eliminate the pervasive poverty and food insecurity.   The problem is more than technological, it is has social and political dimensions and therefore calls for innovative and integrated approaches.   In addition to providing education and training, the African university is also expected to influence development change in society through research and outreach.   To combine its traditional academic role with a developmental role, staff in the African university must be innovative and actively engage in problem solving in community.   This represents fundamental reforms in the university - dealing with the basic elements of changing mindsets, and building a new vision and new skills for training and research amongst the academic staff.   Without such radical moves, universities in Africa risk becoming - rightly - obsolete in the face of huge challenges posed by poverty and international commitments such as the Millennium Development Goals. This thesis describes and evaluates an experiment of innovation competence development for transforming learning, research and consultancy in Makerere University with the hope of making it more innovative and able to influence wider processes of change in society.   Transformation is examined specifically from the perspective of learning, innovation and change in agriculture.   Making change in society requires innovation competences over and above disciplinary expertise and these competences have to be learnt.   The learning starts with the university lecturers, hence the title of the thesis "Learning to make change".   Competence has been treated as the capability to learn and influence learning.   Innovation has been viewed as an adaptation and translation of learning into options for solving real-life problems in a complex and dynamic environment, while change has been seen as the desirable outcome of learning to improvement of life (or better development). Objectives and research design The overall objective {{of the study was to}} establish how the innovation competence development programme for university lecturers could be set-up and implemented to increase relevance of Makerere University to national development. Specifically the study aimed at: 1) identifying the main functions of agricultural professionals in enhancing farmer innovations, 2) identifying the key competence challenges for agricultural professionals to engage in an innovation system, 3) describe how an innovation competence development programme for university lecturers could be designed and implemented to respond to challenges of agricultural development, and 4) determine the contribution of the innovation competence development programme to making universities relevant to development.   These objectives were pursued with three case studies: The first case study explores farmer learning and innovation among smallholder vanilla farmers in Uganda.   From this, functions of university graduates (i. e. researchers and extensionists) in enhancing farmer learning and innovation are proposed. The second case study explores challenges faced by research and extension in demand-driven service delivery systems.   These are used to identify competences relevant to functions graduates are expected to perform in innovation systems.   These two case studies provide a context for the third case study on the innovation competence development at the university.   The third case study focuses on an experiment of how these required competences are first developed in the university staff so as to be passed on to the graduates.   The experiment based on personal mastery and systemic "soft skills" as foundation for building broader change skills comprising of six thematic areas namely: personal development, team development, facilitation methods and techniques, organisational development, communication and alternative ways of conducting training, research and consultancy.   It involved 26 lecturers from three faculties of Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine and Forestry and Nature Conservation over a period of 1 ½ years.   The research sought to understand phenomena underlying social structural mechanisms influencing action and practice among vanilla farmers, researchers and extensionists and university lecturers.   In this view, the research embraced a combination of constructivism and realism as methodology to take the stance that social reality does not exist independent of the social actors, but at the same time seek the possibility of casual explanations of how that reality is shaped by actors.   Data were generated for each case study by a triangulation of methods which included: interviewing, workshops, documentary reviews, participant observation and self-assessment.   Key findings of the research are highlighted below. Findings With market incentives, farmers learn and innovate through their social networks and interactions.   Interpersonal relationship is the mechanism that allows free exchange of knowledge and innovations in an informal way.   This learning can however be enhanced by research and extension if they engage to learn with farmers to integrate local and scientific knowledge.   To the contrary, researchers and extensionists 'shy' away from social learning processes in preference of linear top-down approaches.   By their training, researchers and extensionists are modelled to be 'experts' to provide solutions, while social learning takes place in non-hierarchical interaction with farmers.   To facilitate social learning as a way of enabling smallholder farmers gain adaptive capacity, agricultural professionals require new skills and attitudes.   They should have competences and mindsets to perform functions which include: <b>knowledge</b> and information <b>brokerage,</b> organisational development, facilitating joint learning and multi-stakeholder dialogues, and developing entrepreneurial skills and attitudes. In an agricultural innovation system context where services are directed by demand and necessity, both the supply (research and extension) and demand (farmers) sides need innovation competences to enable them function harmoniously.   The supply side requires competences to facilitate action learning and experimentation; broker information and knowledge between farmer and other stakeholders; develop and empower local organisations; think systemically, develop teams and work in teams; develop and manage partnerships; and facilitate enterprise development.   The demand side also should have capacity to self organise, lobby, advocate and negotiate for services, elect visionary and accountable leadership, act with entrepreneurial attitude, and learn by experimenting.   Competences of the demand and supply sides appear to be mutually dependent and this thesis recognises that the supply side has the responsibility to facilitate the emergence of requisite competences on the demand side, while the demand side provides all-important feedback.   The implication is that such skills have to be integrated in the professional training of all those likely to work with farmers. For the African university to integrate those competences in its educational system, the academic staff have to reorient their mindsets towards systemic thinking and integration of disciplines, and learn new skills for facilitating interactive learning processes and linking research and consultancy to development.   The innovation competence development experiment at Makerere University provides one possible way of doing that through an integrated learning programme for the academic staff.   The experiment presents evidence of enhanced staff capabilities in: self-awareness to fully utilise their potentials; influencing change in organisations through feedback; working in teams and promoting peer learning; facilitating interactive learning and collective action processes; overcoming fear to try out new things as reflective practitioners; communication in problem solving situations; and thinking 'out of the box' to influence development impact through action research and process consultancy. There is a relationship between innovation competences at the farmer, agricultural professionals and university levels, but those at the university have to be at a meta-level to ensure that agricultural professionals and farmers can be linked.   To bring the African university into the mainstream of development, it is argued in this thesis that the university focuses on a) building relationships across the different levels with regard to learning and change as individual and collective action processes, b) inducing and managing change in social systems, c) development of and access to tools for making change, d) achieving solution-oriented thinking and practice, and e) attaining to a culture of authenticity However, some of the challenges of developing innovation competences in the African university include ensuring: appropriate reward systems; feedback mechanism between students, lecturers, management and other stakeholders; dealing with student attitudes and stereotypes to support interactive learning and critical thinking; dealing with embedded institutional cultures and practices to promote innovation; and shifting towards integrated curriculum. Conclusions The three case studies allow the following conclusion to be drawn, in terms of possible lessons for the African university more generally: 1.       Social learning is inevitable in agriculture, but to support this phenomenon, agricultural professionals need new skills and re-orientation of mindsets.   It is therefore imperative that the African universities re-orient their programmes to produce graduates capable of enhancing innovation and social change in the community of smallholder farmers.   But university lecturers must acquire the necessary competences first. 2.       From a policy perspective, the participative and democratic paradigms of development have implicitly imposed new roles, responsibilities and forms of accountability for development professionals but in practice the professionals have not changed.   Deliberate efforts are needed to address the competence challenges of such a system, since the current training regimes are not in fact fit-for-purpose_ in a collaborative demand-led world. 3.       The competence deficiencies of agricultural professionals reflect the short-comings of their training.   Undoubtedly African universities need to redesign their curricula, but before that they have to re-examine their own capacity to provide the type of education that ensures the competences demanded by contemporary African society.   The effort requires not only a change in knowledge and skills; the larger task is to transform a 'technical' university into a 'developmental' university, and this demands a shift in attitudes, mindsets, values and responsibilities. 4.       African universities on their own are incapable of initiating fundamental reforms in their way of doing things - they need external help to stimulate systemic thinking that is not in the mainstream of conventional academic practice, and to build capabilities to manage change processes. 5.       The fundamental reforms needed in the African university are reorientation of mindsets and building capacities for reflective practice to foster personal and organisational development goals.   The starting point is to challenge some entrenched beliefs and values, in order to awaken consciousness and desire for personal change towards a preferred future.   The incentives for personal change in the African context are benefits that enhance social relations, potential to supplement meagre salaries through worthwhile research and/or consultancy activities and professional or career growth...|$|R

In this case study, we critically reflect on an annual KDI as part of <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> activities in the MRC/Wits-Agincourt Unit health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in rural South Africa from 2001 to 2015. The HDSS findings on births, deaths and migrations, as well as nested research project results, were shared with villagers, village leaders and service providers. The data used for this case study comprised secondary analysis of 13 reports and 762 evaluation forms of annual village-based meetings; records of requests for data from stakeholders; and qualitative analysis of 15 individual and five focus group interviews with local leaders and service providers involving 60 people. Over time, the KDI evolved from taking place over one week a year to being extended over six months, and to include briefings with service providers and local leaders. Attendance at village-level meetings remained low at an average of 3 per cent of the total adult population. Since 2011, the KDI village-based meetings have developed into an embedded community forum for discussion of topical village issues. There has been a decrease in requests for health-care and other services from the research unit, with a concurrent increase in research-related questions and requests for data from service providers, village leaders and political representatives. We conclude that, in this setting, the dissemination of research findings is not a linear exchange of information from the researchers to village residents and their leadership, but is increasingly multi-directional.

To address this question, we develop an argument that reconciles both specialization and brokerage into a dynamic explanation. Our contention is that specializing in an increasingly homogeneous set of input ideas is both more efficient and less risky than brokering knowledge. Nevertheless, specializing implies progressively exhausting available recombinant possibilities, while brokerage creates new ones. Hence, technology domains tend to grow faster when they specialize, but the more specialized they become, the more they need <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> to grow.

40|$|IDRC- Canada. CDBPH is a <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> unit {{designed}} to link health researchers with health decision-makers. This initiative serve researchers by collecting, synthesizing, re-packaging, and communicating the relevant evidence in user-friendly terms that stakeholders at many different levels can interact with and understand. CDBPH also intends to serve health decision-makers by providing capacity building opportunities, providing evidence summaries and identifying needs and gaps related to Evidence to Practice. This policy brief on reinforcing the health information system {{to step up}} viabilization of health district in Cameroon is the fourth prepared by CDBPH to synthesize and communicate research evidence backing particular policy options for the consideration of decision-makers. The policy options discussed in this document {{are not mutually exclusive}} interventions; that is {{some or all of the}} options could be adapted concurrently as they are complementary strategies to strengthen the health information to step up viabilization of health district in Cameroon.

40|$|This report elaborates an {{integrated}} vulnerability assessment concept, {{intended as a}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> tool for decision-makers in the Baltic Sea Region. By developing {{an integrated}} vulnerability concept, in line with advances in regional and local vulnerability and adaptation research {{and based on the}} project’s review of the scope and quality of current vulnerability assessments, the report supports discussions on what is needed for a systematic assessment of vulnerability in the region. The report rearticulates five critical challenges that potentially hamper realizing the full potential of vulnerability assessments to support and contribute to strategic decisions on climate adaptation: Adequate scope and goals; Ability to reflect the context; Inclusion of socio-economic stress; Clear connection between vulnerability assessment and decision-making on responses (and integrating knowledge and policies across sectors and levels); and Ability to merge top-down and bottom-up approaches. For each challenge, a principle has been formulated, which may serve as a guide {{in the development of the}} Baltic Sea Region Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. BaltAdap...|$|E
40|$|Various {{theoretical}} models {{of public policy}} analysis are used to treat situations of decision-making in which public deciders {{have to take into}} account the multifunctionality of agriculture. For some, science-society relations are not really problematical. Others acknowledge the current attempts of these policy-makers to find adequate scientific knowledge, and the difficulties they encounter. These difficulties stem partly from the very content of knowledge produced by research. Could other modes of production be more efficient? The status of the knowledge produced by these approaches is a subject of debate. Bridging the divide between science and policy more effectively is not only a question of <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage.</b> Accessibility and reliability of the existing evidences are also problems to be addressed. The debates around evidence-based practices may provide some landmarks in this new situation although they also emphasize the limits of the tools that can be built for this purpose.

40|$|This edited {{collection}} of peer-reviewed papers explores critical {{challenges faced by}} organisations and individuals involved in evidence-informed development through a diverse set of case studies and think-pieces. In this chapter we briefly set out {{the foundations of the}} trend in evidence-informed decision-making and reflect on a fast-changing development knowledge landscape. The dominant themes emerging from the contributions provide the structure for this chapter, including: building networks and partnerships; contextualisation of knowledge and power dynamics; and modes of <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage.</b> An analysis of these themes, and the respective roles of researchers, non-governmental organisations, large programmes and policy actors, suggests that a common thread running throughout is the importance of social relationships. We find that the social and interactive realities of mobilising knowledge comprise several layers: (i) individual and collective capacities, (ii) individual relationships, (iii) networks and group dynamics, and (iv) cultural norms and politics, which are all key to understanding how to make evidence really matter...|$|E
40|$|Agri-environment schemes (AES) are a {{major policy}} tool in Europe to {{increase}} the environmental performance of agriculture. However, {{there is evidence that}} AES's implementation is not achieving the intended objectives and that current monitoring and evaluation frameworks are not adequate to fully assess their environmental effects. We argue that systematic consideration of ecosystem services would greatly benefit the implementation and assessment of AES, and that SEA represents a suitable platform to do this. We illustrate a case study of an ecosystem service-inclusive SEA applied to a rural development program and related AES in Italy. Results indicated that provision and consumptions of a wide array of ecosystem service are affected by AES and that current data management systems would allow to appraise these effects with acceptable efforts. In some other cases however sample field surveys would be needed. The case also shows the importance of mutual learning and <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> between SEA practitioners and program officers. Overall, findings suggest that integrating ecosystem service in the design and assessment of AES would provide policy-makers and stakeholders with more focused information and ultimately improve their effectivenes...|$|E
40|$|Informed Cities {{looks at}} the <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> {{processes}} between cities and higher education institutions, and in particular evaluates governance mechanisms for monitoring local sustainability {{and the role of}} research within this. The first part of the book provides an analysis of tools for governing sustainable cities and develops a typology of existing tools. It then considers approaches to monitor local sustainability on a European level, focusing on a number of key tools such as the Covenant of Mayors, Reference Framework for Sustainable Cities, and Green Capital Award. The second part of the book introduces an explorative application of two tools that the author team have used in practice to monitor local sustainability, Urban Ecosystems Europe and Local Evaluation 21, presenting and evaluating European level data collected from local governments. The third part of the book looks deeper into a number of case studies discussing how a working and rewarding city-university connection can be created and nourished in an administrative and political setting. Finally, {{the last part of the}} book reflects on lessons learned from the application of the tools and accompanying research process and makes recommendations for further developing monitoring tools for urban sustainability on a European level...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, climate changes became {{increasingly}} noticed. As {{a result of}} these changes, many extreme events such as flooding and droughts occur. These have an expected increasing impact on society and the environment. Especially the Alps are affected with a stronger increasing temperature compared to the rest of Europe. As a societal reaction, adaptation strategies and tools have been launched. Among the adaptation tools are web-based adaptation platforms, which are assumed to be important governance tools. They support <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage,</b> awareness raising, capacity building, and crosslevel coordination. Within this manuscript we identify available platforms and previous Alpine Space Programme projects and their interdisciplinary and cross-subject climate change related information. We analyse available portals and elaborate design and user requirements for the Climate Change Knowledge Inventory Platform developed here. We found that many previously developed platforms integrate similar information, but automated information exchange between platforms is scarce due to interoperability limitations. To avoid these double works of entering the same findings again, our developed catalogue service for the web solution ensures standard compliant information provision to enable interoperability and thus the exchange of climate change information across platforms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} innovation {{within the}} Swedish construction industry {{with the purpose}} of identifying key factors for small and/or newly founded firms to increase their innovative capacity and long-term competitiveness. The paper presents a theoretical framework of driving and hindering factors raised by the literature along with an introduction to the Swedish market and important segments on the market. An analysis is performed through the lens of a case firm operating within this market, where their approach to construction innovation is compared and contrasted with the findings of the literature and complementary interviews, in order to find factors most critical to innovation, that are still within the impactable sphere of a small firm. Our paper holds that five factors are key for small firms ability to innovate: Network Development, Build Dynamic Organizational Capabilities, Scale Knowledge-flows, Procurement Partnering, Impact through <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Brokerage.</b> Findings are related to a small firm operating in the more innovative side of the construction industry with a high skill base and high level of education compared to other firms operating within the industry. Further investigations based on small firms with lower academic skill-base is needed to complement the findings and to create a more holistic view of small firm construction innovation within the Swedish market...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} AWARE {{project has}} been to {{demonstrate}} {{a new way of}} “connecting research, people and policy-makers in Europe to achieve sustainable water ecosystem management”. The project used a variety of methods and activities to achieve this aim – including workshops, interactive conferences, online surveys and personal interviews. This chapter review the ex-post evaluation of the AWARE potential impact, as ascertained in particular in a number of keynote interviews and in a final ex-post evaluation workshop with water managers held in Brussels, {{at the end of the}} project. Future prospects to achieve a snowball effect, deepening the AWARE method application to foster public participation to integrated coastal zone and river basin management in the water sector and to expand its application to other sustainability challenges in other sectors (e. g. energy and climate, transport, etc.) are discussed. Practical lessons drawn from the AWARE pilot experience are given as a guidance for future participatory processes. The lessons learned are presented as tips about how to better engage citizens, stakeholders and policy makers, scientists, and how to organise the <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> process and deliver the outcomes in order to get effective results from the whole participatory process.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{empirical}} investigation of public policy-making and government {{action in the}} UK. It presents the findings of an ethnographic study of the work practices {{of a team of}} middle-ranking civil servants in DEFRA, the UK government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Analysis relies on data generated over a period of one year of research placement in the Department's headquarters in London, during which the author witnessed, and to an extent participated to, the everyday activities of policy officers. The inquiry is framed around the problem of establishing empirical grounds for the study of public policy-making. The methodology the study uses combines elements of traditional ethnographic studies of work in organisations with the more recent theoretical background informing workplace studies. The interest is first and foremost micro-sociological, with a view of capturing language, discursive practices and practical reasoning and analyse them as local, ongoing accomplishment of office work. An objective of the inquiry is to detail the status of 'sustainable consumption' policies in the United Kingdom during the period of participant observation (2011 - 2012). The analysis clarifies upon which formal or informal sources of knowledge policymakers drew in designing policies and interventions, and it describes the tasks and the work associated with policy development. Through the analysis of this ‘policy work’, the thesis also provides a larger picture of the ways policies and policy options are progressed or dismissed by the government through the work of Departments. Practices of project management, risk management and <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> are considered and examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{realization}} of e-city {{is a necessary}} component for achieving the green city. This paper outlines a vision for an e-city platform {{that is based on}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokerage</b> in the green city. The proposed platform will be a venue for creating dynamic virtual organizations to harness collective intelligence of knowledge hubs to analyze and manage sustainability knowledge in urban areas. Knowledge assets of participating organizations will be presented in three dimensions: process structures, human profile and software systems. These three facets of knowledge will be accessible and viewable through a self-describing mechanism. Cities can post their geospatial and real-time data on the net. Relevant environmental and energy-use data will be extracted using topic maps and data extraction services. Local decision makers can synchronize work processes (from participating hubs) to create an integrated workflow for a new ad hoc virtual organization to collaboratively analyze the multifaceted nature of sustainable decision making. An e-city platform is envisioned in this paper that will be realized through intelligent, agent-like, domain-specific middleware (KnowWare). Through triangulation between people, software and processes, these KnowWare will discover, negotiate, integrate, reason and communicate knowledge (related to energy and environment) from across organizations to the right person at the right time. KnowWare is fundamentally, a portal of social semantic services that resides on a cloud computing infrastructure. Knowware exploits thee main tools: 1) existing ontologies to represent knowledge in a semantic manner, 2) topic maps to profile sources of knowledge and match these to the complex needs of sustainability analysis, 3) domain-specific middleware for knowledge integration and reasoning...|$|E
