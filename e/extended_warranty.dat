40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} {{contractual}} exclusion of third-party <b>extended</b> <b>warranties</b> should be legally permissible, using a model incorporating consumer heterogeneity.

In contrast to the approach typically adopted by the courts, the paper argues that manufacturers should not generally be permitted to practice requirements contracting in <b>extended</b> <b>warranties,</b> even when the product market is competitive. ...|$|R

50|$|An <b>extended</b> <b>warranty,</b> {{sometimes}} called a service agreement, a service contract, or a maintenance agreement, is a prolonged warranty offered to consumers {{in addition to}} the standard warranty on new items.

Occasionally, some extended warranties that are purchased for multiple years state in writing that during the first year, the consumer must still deal with the manufacturer in the occurrence of malfunction. Thus, what is often promoted as a five-year extended guarantee, for example, is actually only a four-year guarantee.|$|E
