5000|$|The Earth's {{atmosphere}} is opaque to {{primary cosmic rays}} with energies below about 1 <b>gigaelectron</b> <b>volt</b> (GeV), so only secondary radiation can reach the surface. The secondary radiation is also attenuated by absorption in the atmosphere, {{as well as by}} radioactive decay in flight of some particles, such as muons. Particles entering from a direction close to the horizon are especially attenuated. The world's population receives an average of 0.4 millisieverts (mSv) of cosmic radiation annually (separate from other sources of radiation exposure like inhaled radon) due to atmospheric shielding. At 12 km altitude, above most of the atmosphere's protection, radiation as an annual rate rises to 20 mSv at the equator to 50-120 mSv at the poles, varying between solar maximum and minimum conditions.|$|R
40|$|<b>Giga{{electron}}</b> <b>volt</b> (GeV) electron accelerators {{are essential}} to synchrotron radiation facilities and free-electron lasers, and as modules for high-energy particle physics. Radiofrequency-based accelerators are limited to relatively low accelerating fields (10 - 50 MV m- 1), requiring tens to hundreds of metres to reach the multi-GeV beam energies needed to drive radiation sources, and many kilometres to generate particle energies of interest to high-energy physics. Laser-wakefield accelerators produce electric fields of the order 10 - 100 GV m- 1 enabling compact devices. Previously, the required laser intensity was not maintained over the distance needed to reach GeV energies, and hence acceleration {{was limited to the}} 100 MeV scale. Contrary to predictions that petawatt-class lasers would be needed to reach GeV energies, here we demonstrate production of a high-quality electron beam with 1 GeV energy by channelling a 40 TW peak-power laser pulse in a 3. 3 -cm-long gas-filled capillary discharge waveguide. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group...|$|R

We report the detection of variable gamma-ray emission above 100 <b>gigaelectron</b> <b>volts</b> from the microquasar LS I + 61 303. Six orbital cycles were recorded. Several detections occur at a similar orbital phase, which suggests that the emission is periodic.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} Cherenkov gamma- ray telescope MAGIC, {{designed for}} a low- energy threshold, has detected very- high- energy gamma rays from a giant flare of the distant Quasi- Stellar Radio Source (in short: radio quasar) 3 C 279, {{at a distance of}} more than 5 billion light- years (a redshift of 0. 536). No quasar has been observed previously in very- high- energy gamma radiation, and this is also the most distant object detected emitting gamma rays above 50 <b>gigaelectron</b> <b>volts.</b> Because high- energy gamma rays may be stopped by interacting with the diffuse background light in the universe, the observations by MAGIC imply a low amount for such light, consistent with that known from galaxy counts...|$|E
40|$|International audienceX-ray {{binaries}} {{are composed}} of a normal star in orbit around a neutron star or stellar-mass black hole. Radio and x-ray observations {{have led to the}} presumption that some x-ray binaries called microquasars behave as scaled-down active galactic nuclei. Microquasars have resolved radio emission that is thought to arise from a relativistic outflow akin to active galactic nuclei jets, in which particles can be accelerated to large energies. Very high energy γ-rays produced by the interactions of these particles have been observed from several active galactic nuclei. Using the High Energy Stereoscopic System, we find evidence for gamma-ray emission of > 100 <b>gigaelectron</b> <b>volts</b> from a candidate microquasar, LS 5039, showing that particles are also accelerated to very high energies in these systems...|$|E

These are neutron stars or black holes orbiting around massive stars (1). On page 189 of this issue, the Fermi Large Area Telescope Collaboration (2) use the correlated orbital modulation at gamma-ray, x-ray, and radiowave wavelengths to show that the source 1 FGL J 1018. 6 - 5856 is a new gamma-ray binary, demonstrating the potential of searches for periodic modulation at gamma rays and other wavelengths to unveil new populations of gamma-ray binarie...|$|E
40|$|Because {{they are}} bright and distant, Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) {{have been used}} {{for more than a decade}} to test {{propagation}} of photons and to constrain relevant Quantum Gravity (QG) models in which the velocity of photons in vacuum can depend on their energy. With its unprecedented sensitivity and energy coverage, the Fermi satellite has provided the most constraining results on the QG energy scale so far. In this talk, the latest results obtained from the analysis of four bright GRBs observed by the Large Area Telescope will be reviewed. These robust results, cross-checked using three different analysis techniques set the limit on QG energy scale at E(sub QG, 1) greater than 7. 6 times the Planck energy for linear dispersion and E(sub QG, 2) greater than 1. 3 x 10 (exp 11) <b>gigaelectron</b> <b>volts</b> for quadratic dispersion (95 % CL). After describing the data and the analysis techniques in use, results will be discussed and confronted to latest constraints obtained with Active Galactic Nuclei...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Recent {{observations}} {{have shown}} that some compact stellar binaries radiate the highest energy light in the universe. The challenge has been to determine {{the nature of the}} compact object and whether the very high energy gamma-rays are ultimately powered by pulsar winds or relativistic jets. Multiwavelength observations {{have shown that}} one of the three gamma-ray binaries known so far, PSR B 1259 − 63, is a neutron star binary and that the very energetic gammarays from this source and from another gamma-ray binary, LS I + 61 303, may be produced by the interaction of pulsar winds with the wind from the companion star. At this time it is an open question whether the third gamma-ray binary, LS 5039, is also powered by a pulsar wind or a microquasar jet, where relativistic particles in collimated jets would boost the energy of the wind from the stellar companion to TeV energies. Keywords X-ray binaries · Microquasars · X-rays · Gamma-rays A new window on the universe is presently being opened by ground-based telescopes that survey the sky by detecting very high energy (VHE) photons, which have energies greater than 100 <b>gigaelectron</b> <b>volts</b> (GeV). Because of their high sensitivity, and high angular and energy resolution, these telescopes are revealing and identifying a plethora of new extragalactic and galactic sources of VHE radiation. The Galactic Center, supernovae remnants, pulsar-wind nebulae, and a new class of binary stars called gamma-ray binaries have all been identified as VHE sources in the Milky Way. LS 5039 [1] is a new gamma-ray binary detected at VHE [2] (see Fig. 1). Recently, Albert et al. [3] confirmed the identification [4] of LS I + 61 303 as the third gamma-ray stellar binary, reporting a time variability in the signal that points to the mechanism for the VHE emission (see Fig. 2) ...|$|E
