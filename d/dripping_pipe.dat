5000|$|Some time later, after Bratishka falls asleep, Poekhavshiy defecates {{on their}} shared plate for eating (calling it [...] "sweet bread"), smears feces over his belly and consumes {{a large portion}} of it. After doing so he offers a plate with the fecal matter to the other man right after he wakes up, and drives him mad again. Poekhavishiy tells him that he is just giving him some food to eat with {{together}} (as they will not be given anything to eat), but Bratishka angrily tells him to wash himself by the <b>dripping</b> <b>pipe</b> water, threatening Poekhavshiy that he will kill him. The guard arrives from the screaming in the cell, and drags the infuriated Bratishka out to clean the toilets again. The captain arrives to the cell and lectures Poekhavshiy on the theatre of operations of the Pacific Ocean, particularly on the names and numbers of the Japanese and American ships on Pearl Harbor. He scolds Poekhavshiy on his incorrect answers, and orders a guard to go to the canteen to prepare a glass of tea for him and the officer. The captain tastes it, and comments [...] "It tastes like urine", spilling its contents on the guard's head. He orders to guard to hold the glass with his teeth, instructing him to go and tell the kitchen staff that [...] "this kind of tea will not be tolerated, ever." [...] The guard then beats up Poekhavshiy.|$|E
5000|$|The Toronto Star further writes that, [...] "In his film, Nisker {{also looks}} at the less {{tangible}} garbage we create daily. He shows viewers the sludge {{at the bottom of}} the sewage treatment plant that is regularly trucked to a Michigan dump, the oily [...] "road runoff" [...] from our cars' <b>dripping</b> exhaust <b>pipes</b> that snakes into our rivers and streams, and the chemicals we dump into our dishwashers and washing machines that feminize male fish and make the air inside our homes more toxic than outside." ...|$|R
30|$|I {{visited the}} Walled City in 1989 and I {{remember}} {{the maze of}} dark corridors and laneways formed within the ‘superblock’; an extreme outcome of dramatically increasing population and a laissez-faire attitude {{by the government in}} the 1960 s and 70 s, leading to unhealthy conditions and intolerable sanitary conditions. Some residents never left the superblock as everything they needed was at hand, and inhabitants walked the narrow alleys with umbrellas to shield themselves from the constant <b>dripping</b> of water <b>pipes</b> above.|$|R
5000|$|Two men (both being junior {{officers}} in Soviet Army, in 1986), nicknamed [...] "Bratishka" [...] (Little Brother) and [...] "Poekhavshiy" [...] (The Mad), {{are being held}} in a penal military prison. The room which they share looks like a dark cellar with a <b>dripping</b> sewer <b>pipe</b> running through it. One of the prisoners, Poekhavshiy, seems to be delirious and never stops talking. He tells stories of his past, sings {{the song of the}} [...] "Green Elephant" [...] circus, does push-ups, comes up with crazy ideas and even mimics a heron in an attempt to cheer up his cellmate Bratishka, leading only to an increase in his anger. He receives a violent beating from the enraged Bratishka, before he is then taken from the cell by a guard to clean up a dirty toilet bowl with a fork.|$|R
5000|$|The lack of {{accessibility}} to reports from journalists and monitoring groups {{has made the}} prison a deep black hole which no outsider knows anything about. The only sources the world has on the incidents inside the Sednaya prison derive from the memories of detainees that have made it out from what {{has been referred to}} as hell on Earth. The memories they bear on are what we have in order to understand what is going on within Sednaya. In April 2016, Amnesty International and Forensic Architecture traveled to Turkey to meet five Sednaya survivors. The researchers used architectural and acoustic modeling to reconstruct the prison and the survivors’ experiences at detention. As there are no images of the prison and because the prisoners were held in darkness under brutally enforced silence, researchers had to depend entirely on their memories and acute experience of sound, footsteps, door opening and locking and water <b>dripping</b> in the <b>pipes</b> among other things. The fact that prisoners did barely see daylight, they were, consequently, forced to develop an acute relation to sound. Having to cover their eyes with their hands whenever a guard entered the room made them become attuned to the smallest sounds. In a video interview, a former Sednaya detainee says [...] "You try to build an image based on the sounds you hear. You know the person by the sound of his footsteps. You can tell the food times by the sound of the bowl. If you hear screaming, you know newcomers have arrived. When there is no screaming, we know they are accustomed to Sednaya." [...] Sound became the instrument by which inmates navigated and measured their environment. Therefore, sound also became one of the essential tools with which the prison could be digitally reconstructed. The sound artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan used a technique of “echo profiling” which made it possible for him to decide the size of cells, stairwells, and corridors. He played different sound reflections and asked former inmates to match these tones of different decibel levels to the levels of specific incidents inside the prison.|$|R
