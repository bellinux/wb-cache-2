50|$|British Army {{regional}} {{districts have}} evolved slowly {{over the previous}} 150 years or so. For many years there were regional commands in the UK, including Aldershot Command (from 1880), Eastern Command, Northern Command, Scottish Command, Southern Command and Western Command (from 1905). By 1985 these were superseded by districts, and until the spring of 1991 there were nine of them. Antony Beevor wrote in his revised <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inside</b> the British Army in 1991 that '..the first of the minor districts to be amalgamated were North West District, Western District, and Wales, {{to form a new}} Western District.' HQ Northern Ireland remained separate and reported to HQ UK Land Forces only on non-operational matters.From 1995, UK commands and later districts were replaced by regenerative divisions. 2nd Division, 4th Division, 5th Division and London District acted as regional commands within the UK reporting to Commander Regional Forces. Scotland District was absorbed by 2nd Division in 2000. The divisions were responsible for training subordinate formations and units under their command for operations in the UK, such as Military Aid to the Civil Community, as well as training units for overseas deployments. 2nd, 4th and 5th Divisions were replaced by Support Command on 1 November 2011.|$|R
