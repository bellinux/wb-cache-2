40|$|Passive fluid damper {{is one of}} {{most widely}} used control devices for <b>damping</b> <b>vibration</b> of stay cables in a {{cable-stayed}} bridge in practice. However, each stay cable features unique dynamic characteristics and requires a specific damper to achieve the best control performance, which engenders many troubles in manufacture, implementation and maintenance of dampers. This paper presents a new approach for <b>damping</b> <b>vibration</b> of stay cables in a cable-stayed bridge by using adjustable fluid dampers. The principle and main features of adjustable fluid dampers with shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are first introduced. The solution of a taut cable with the adjustable fluid damper described by the Maxwell model is provided. A most favorable design principle is then proposed for selecting the least types of adjustable fluid dampers for <b>damping</b> <b>vibration</b> of a few hundreds stay cables in a cable-stayed bridge. A case study of stay cables in a super long span cable-stayed bridge is finally performed, demonstrating that only two types of adjustable fluid dampers are required for <b>damping</b> <b>vibration</b> of all stay cables in the bridge.

40|$|AbstractFree <b>damped</b> <b>vibrations</b> of {{a linear}} {{viscoelastic}} oscillator {{based on the}} fractional derivative model involving more than one different fractional parameters and several relaxation (retardation) times are investigated. The analytical solution is obtained {{in the form of}} two terms, one of which governs the drift of the system’s equilibrium position and is defined by the dynamic relaxation–retardation processes occurring in the system, and the other term describes <b>damped</b> <b>vibrations</b> around the equilibrium position and is determined by the system’s inertia and energy dissipation. The drift is governed by an improper integral taken along two sides of the cut of the complex plane, while <b>damped</b> <b>vibrations</b> are determined according to the two complex conjugate roots of the characteristic equation, which are located on the left half of the complex plane. The behaviour of the characteristic equation roots as functions of the system’s rheological parameters, which enable the control of the dynamic response of the oscillator, is shown in the complex plane...|$|R
