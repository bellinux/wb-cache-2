25|$|Hulda Stumpf lay {{across the}} bed with a {{mattress}} doubled over her <b>face.</b> <b>I</b> was the second person to enter the room after the tragedy, and I made a careful examination of her poor body. She had been brutally treated but was not, as the story was circulated, {{the victim of a}} bungling attempt at circumcision. That finally she had been strangled was evident by the large black and blue patches on her throat and neck. She was safe on the other side, but had had a rough passage.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my <b>face</b> <b>I</b> did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

As the girls know what is really happening, they try to comfort her and make her leave the partner. A writer of The Times of India found a break-up theme in the song, further saying that [...] "In 'Girl', the relational mishaps play out as three-way girl talk, with two girlfriends trying to help their sister see the truth of a bad connection".

500|$|In December 1983, Jerôme Dahan and Laurent Boutonnat, two friends, {{composed}} {{a song called}} [...] "Maman a tort", about lesbian love between a girl committed to a mental hospital and her nurse. To find a performer, they held a casting. A girl aged 15–16 was initially chosen to perform the song, before being rejected because she {{was too young to}} sing its sexually ambiguous lyrics. Boutonnat then decided to ask one of his friends, Mylène Gautier, to sing the track. Both composers have said that they thought Gautier seemed psychotic and thus was the ideal person to record the track. Boutonnat said: [...] "As soon as I saw her, with her triangular <b>face,</b> <b>I</b> realized that this would be her and nobody else. She looked crazy, it was perfect." [...] After they decided to work with her, Gautier took the pseudonym of Farmer, as a tribute to actress Frances Farmer.|$|E

For [...] "The Human Abstract", he used ascending piano, bass, and percussion instruments to evoke the ghost described in Blake's poem. It is a bass-driven, funky song that juxtaposes augmented sevenths strummed on an electric guitar against an acoustic piano and muted horns. According to music critic Thom Jurek, [...] "The Divine Image" [...] and [...] "A Little Girl Lost" [...] elicit feelings of majesty and [...] "pastoral sadness", respectively. [...] "London" [...] was recorded by Axelrod as a tone poem to reflect Blake's opening stanza about the spiritual climate of London {{at the onset of the}} Industrial Revolution: [...] "I wander thro' each charted'd street / Near where the chart'd Thames does flow / And mark in every <b>face</b> <b>I</b> meet / Marks of weakness, marks of woe." ...|$|E

One of Pollard's attempts to advertise his stallion involved letting {{one of his}} ranch hands take the horse to a local jackpot roping. Pollard assumed that the hand would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off, but he later discovered that more was involved. Pollard said later that [...] "I should have been suspicious when he (the ranch hand) returned with Lightning Bar that afternoon, with a sheepish grin on his <b>face.</b> <b>I</b> asked him how the horse was received and he said 'The stud did good and I won the jackpot!'

He was not the first composer to combine themes in this way, but it became a characteristic feature of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] Sometimes the melodies were for solo voices, as in [...] "Once more the <b>face</b> <b>I</b> loved so well" [...] (The Zoo), and [...] "I am so proud" [...] (The Mikado), which combines three melodic lines; other examples are in choruses, where typically a graceful tune for the ladies is combined with a robust one for the men. Examples include [...] "When the Foeman bares his steel" [...] (The Pirates of Penzance), [...] "In a doleful train" [...] (Patience) and [...] "Welcome, gentry" [...] (Ruddigore). At other times, notably in [...] "How beautifully blue the sky" [...] (The Pirates of Penzance), one theme is given to the chorus and the other to solo voices.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her <b>face.</b> <b>I</b> threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that.
