50|$|Adhesive {{weight is}} the {{weight on the}} <b>driving</b> wheels <b>of</b> a <b>locomotive,</b> which determines the {{frictional}} grip between wheels and rail, and hence the drawbar pull which a locomotive can exert.|$|R
50|$|A {{coupling}} rod or side rod connects the <b>driving</b> wheels <b>of</b> a <b>locomotive.</b> Steam locomotives in particular usually have them, but some diesel and electric locomotives, especially older ones and shunters, also have them. The {{coupling rod}}s transfer {{the power to}} all driving wheels.|$|R
50|$|A side-effect of {{the cannon}} box {{is that the}} centre of the shaft is now {{enclosed}} and inaccessible. Previously Stephenson had coupled the <b>driving</b> axles <b>of</b> his <b>locomotives</b> with a central chain. The need for an alternate system spurred the development of the coupling rods, where the drive was connected on the outside face of the wheels.|$|R
50|$|The concept {{originated}} with the hauling of logs {{in the northeastern}} US, with the Lombard Steam Log Hauler built by Alvin Lombard of Waterville, Maine, from 1899 to 1917. The vehicle resembled a railway steam locomotive, with sled steering (or wheels) in front and at the rear, crawlers driven by chains instead <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> wheels <b>of</b> a <b>locomotive.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At the time, Campbell's 4-4-0 {{was a giant}} among locomotives. Its {{cylinders}} had a 14 in bore with a 16 in piston stroke, it boasted 54 {{in diameter}} driving wheels, could maintain [...] of steam pressure and weighed 12 ST. Campbell's locomotive {{was estimated to be}} able to pull a train of 450 ST at 15 mph on level track, outperforming the strongest of Baldwin's 4-2-0s in tractive effort by about 63%. However, the frame and <b>driving</b> gear <b>of</b> his <b>locomotive</b> proved to be too rigid for the railroads of the time, which caused Campbell's prototype to be derailment-prone. The most obvious cause was the lack of a weight equalizing system for the drivers.|$|R
40|$|This thesis applies genetic {{algorithms}} to computationally design control strategies for a simulated robot, a mobile vehicle {{operating in a}} two-dimensional environment. The simulated robot has five touch sensors, two hearing sensors, two motors <b>driving</b> a pair <b>of</b> <b>locomotive</b> tank tracks, and a control circuit connecting input sensors to the motors. To navigate in the environment, the robot should have some basic behaviors such as food approach, obstacle avoidance, and wall following. For designing the control strategies of the robot, we apply a classic genetic algorithm and a non-traditional genetic algorithm to train the robot for these behaviors in a complex environment. However, these results are not satisfactory. We propose a new method in which control strategies evolve for each behavior in a separate environment, and then some of these strategies are selected as seeds and injected into the initial population of another genetic algorithm running in the complex environment. Our method [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s North British {{signed a deal}} with the German company MAN to {{construct}} further diesel engines under licence. These power units appeared in the late 1950s' British Railways (BR) designs pre-TOPS British Rail Class D3/1 (later D3/4), and later designated Class 21, Class 22, Class 41, Class 43 (Warship) and Class 251 (Blue Pullman) None of these were particularly successful: constructional shortcomings with the MAN engines made them far less reliable than German-built examples. A typical example of this was the grade of steel used for exhaust manifolds in the Class 43s - frequent manifold failures led to loss of turbocharger drive gas pressure and hence loss of power. More importantly, the <b>driving</b> cabs <b>of</b> the <b>locomotives</b> would fill with poisonous exhaust fumes. BR returned many North British diesel locomotives to their builder for repair under warranty and they also insisted on a three-month guarantee on all repairs (a requirement not levied on its own workshops).|$|R
5000|$|Once steel became available, greater {{rotational}} speeds became {{possible with}} multiple smaller coupled wheels. Five years after new locomotive construction had begun at the West Point Foundry in the United States with the 0-4-0 Best Friend of Charleston in 1831, the first 4-4-0 locomotive {{was designed by}} Henry R. Campbell, {{at the time the}} chief engineer for the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railway. Campbell received a patent for the design in February 1836 and soon set to work building the first 4-4-0. For the time, Campbell's 4-4-0 was a giant among locomotives. Its cylinders had a 14 in bore with a 16 in piston stroke, it boasted 54 in diameter driving wheels, could maintain [...] of steam pressure and weighed 12 ST. Campbell's locomotive was estimated to be able to pull a train of 450 ST at 15 mph on level track, outperforming the strongest of Baldwin's 4-2-0s in tractive effort by about 63%.

5000|$|He {{returned}} to the LNWR at Crewe, and in 1920 became the [...] "bricks and mortar assistant" [...] with responsibility for the new erecting shop. When work on this was stopped, Riddles was placed {{in charge of a}} small production progress department and was sent to Horwich to study the methods used by the L&Y. From this Riddles gained some backing, and had significant influence in the re-organisation of Crewe which took place between 1925 and 1927.In 1923 the LNWR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway thus on completion of the work at Crewe, Riddles was sent to the ex-Midland Railway works at Derby, now part of the LMS, to initiate a similar arrangement. In this task he had the active support of the then Derby works manager, H. G. Ivatt. During the General Strike in 1926 Riddles volunteered as a driver, taking trains from Crewe to Manchester and Carlisle. The experience gained made him almost unique among CMEs; Riddles maintained that the practical knowledge <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> a <b>locomotive</b> that he gained was an invaluable aid to his design work.|$|R
