60|$|Then {{came the}} {{discovery}} that for consumptives dry cold is a medium superior to damp heat. Invalids {{were sent to the}} Tyrol, to the Engadine, to Canada, and even to Iceland, where phthisis is absolutely unknown, and where a diet of oleaginous fish is like feeding upon cod-liver or shark-liver oil. The air as well as the diet proved a tonic, and patients escaped the frequent cough, catarrh, influenza, and neuralgia which are so troublesome at Funchal. Here, too, the invalid must be accompanied by a 'prudent and watchful friend,' or friends, and the companions will surely suffer. I know few climates so bad and none worse for those fecund causes of suffering in Europe, liver-affections ('mucous fevers'), diarrhoeas, and dysenteries; for nervous complaints, tic <b>douloureux,</b> and neuralgia, or for rheumatism and lumbago. Asthma is one of the disorders which shows the most peculiar forms, and must be treated in the most various ways: here some sufferers are benefitted, others are not. Madeira is reputedly dangerous also for typhoid affections, for paralysis, and for apoplexy. There is still another change to come. The valley north of the beautiful and ever maligned 'Dead Sea' of Palestine, where the old Knights Templar had their sugar-mills and indigo-manufactories, has peculiar merits. Lying some 1,350 feet below the Mediterranean, it enables a man to live with a quarter of a lung: you may run till your legs fail with fatigue, but you can no more get out of breath than you can sink in the saline waters of Lake Asphaltites. When a railway from Jafa to Jerusalem shall civilise the 'Holy Land,' I expect great things from the sites about the Jordan embouchure.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{comprises}} {{a clinical}} and pathological {{report of a}} case of tic <b>douloureux,</b> in which death occurred {{three and a half}} months after a successful injection of the right trigeminal nerve. Though this form of injection has been practised for nearly 40 years, there is still dispute about the exact site of action of the alcohol, the changes which it produces in the trigeminal pathway, and their duration. Chance (1920) wrote [...] . it is not known for how long in a given case the influence of the alcohol can last, nor has it been settled by post-mortem studies, I believe, just how great is the destruction of the ganglia. " So far as we can discover, these words are still essentially true. Similarly, after the parallel procedure of sensory rhizotomy, only a few patho-logical studies have been made of the sensory root and central trigeminal pathway. Spiller and Frazier (1901) and others have made such studies in various experimental animals; but so far as we know, the only three human cases that have been reported are those of Sj 6 qvist (1938). Cavina (1932) made an ingenious investigation of the site ofaction ofalcohol. On numerous occasions he gave a trigeminal injection and immediately pro-ceeded to a posterior rhizotomy, having left the needle in place; on opening the cave of Meckel he noted the position of the needle point. He was able to infer that the alcohol had the greatest effect when injected among the fibres of the sensory root just anterior to the porus trigemini. We have discovered only two workers who describe the histology of the trigeminal ganglion and the adjacent trigeminal fibres after injection. Both found changes which might or might not have been due to the alcohol, but neither attempted to deter-mine the site of the injection from the histological picture.

40|$|SYNOPSIS Twenty-five {{patients}} {{affected by}} 30 episodes of tic <b>douloureux</b> {{were treated with}} a new anticonvulsant, clonazepam. In 400 % there was complete control of the neuralgia and an additional 23. 3 % were significantly helped by the drug. Sixteen patients had previously been resistant to carbamazepine, and eight of them were completely and one partially relieved by clonazepam. The side-effects, somnolence and unsteadiness of gait, were present to some extent in 80 and 88 % of the cases respectively, being severe in about half of them. It is concluded that clonazepam can be con-sidered as a second choice {{for the treatment of}} this condition, after proven failure with carbamaze-pine. Possible mechanisms of action are discussed. Tic <b>douloureux</b> is a condition characterized by brief paroxysms of extremely severe pain re-stricted to the distribution of one or more cutaneous branches of the trigeminal nerve. These often recur several times a day and are usually triggered by tactile or painful stimulation of the skin or mucosa innervated by branches of the trigeminal nerve. The episodes of neuralgia usually last for months or years, then subsiding for variable periods of time, to recur again with comparable severity. It is a disease of the adult, and its aetiology is unknown. The first successful drug for its treatment was diphenylhydantoin (phenytoin, Dilantin, Epanu-tin) introduced by Braham and Saiz in 1960. In different series, it was reported that from 540 to 700 of patients were improved completely or significantly by this drug (Braham and Saiz, 1960; Blom, 1962, 1963). Because of its common side-effects (ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus) and a significant incidence of recurrence of the neuralgia despite its continuous use, a new drug, carbamazepine (Tegretol), was introduced by Blom in 1962. Its reported effectiveness has been around 90 %o (Blom, 1962), with most patients responding after 24 hours of treatment. It has been suggested that its effect on trigemina...|$|E

40|$|Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} or tic <b>douloureux</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} disabling neurologic pains. This is characterized by sudden, severe, sharp electric shock like pain along the branches of trigeminal nerve. The incidence of trigeminal neuralgia is 4 in 1, 00, 000 population per year. Knowledge of anatomical course and distribution of trigeminal nerve is important in diagnose and treatment. Trigeminal nerve is the largest of all cranial nerves which is mixed type of nerve. Sensory root of trigeminal nerve is divided in to 3 divisions, ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular divisions. These three divisions carry pain, touch, temperature sensations from scalp, forehead, eye, lateral surface of nose, cheek, mandibular skin excepting angle of mandible and part of auricle. Commonest cause of trigeminal neuralgia is due to vascular compression by nearby artery of trigeminal nerve. Demyelination of trigeminal nerve is next cause. In this case report we discussed about 49 year old lady with intense, sudden electric shock like pain on her chin and cheek. The pain aggravated with trigger factors which is characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia. After physical and radiological examinations she had been diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} {{to determine whether the}} intraoperative monitoring of brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) during microvascular decompression operations is effective in preventing profound hearing loss or deafness in the ipsilateral ear. The authors retrospectively compared the auditory morbidity of posterior fossa microvascular decompression surgery for the treatment of tic <b>douloureux</b> and hemifacial spasm before and after the introduction of routine intraoperative BAEP monitoring in 1984. Each patient underwent a similar procedure performed by the same surgeon. The two patient groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, and indications for surgery, Auditory morbidity did not decline with the increasing experience of the surgeon prior to 1984; 10 (6. 6 %) of 152 primary operations (151 patients) in which monitoring was not performed were followed by a profound ipsilateral hearing loss or deafness. In the monitored group, none of 109 operations (104 patients) caused profound hearing loss or deafness. This significant decline in auditory morbidity is attributed by the authors to the use of intraoperative BAEP monitoring, which allows the surgeon to alter the operation in response to degradations in the wave patterns. Based on our experience and that of others, we believe that intraoperative BAEP monitoring is of value in reducing the auditory morbidity of posterior fossa microvascular decompression surgery...|$|E
40|$|Background: Multiple leiomyomas {{are rare}} benign {{tumors of the}} skin, {{originating}} from the arrector pili muscle, and usually appear as painful nodules. Several pharmacologic agents have been used with some success to reduce pain and discomfort since surgery may be an impractical approach owing {{to the extent of}} the disease. Objective: This article reports on a patient with multiple cutaneous leiomyomas of the upper limb who was managed by a method not previously reported for leiomyomas. Method: The management involved total surgical resection of the defect and immediate reconstruction with the Integra artificial dermal template (Integra LifeSciences Corp., Plainsboro, NJ). Results: With this treatment, the patient was totally relieved from the pain, and optimal functional and esthetic results were achieved. Conclusion: Complete surgical resection of multiple cutaneous leiomyomas prevented the disease’s recurrence. The immediate reconstruction of the resultant full-thickness defect with artificial dermis ensured uneventful wound healing, resulting in optimal functional and esthetic outcome and total relief from leiomyoma-associated discomfort.
