40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on study of {{antimutagenic}} properties in selected kinds of honey and propolis. In honey extracts compounds with antimutagenic and antioxidant effect were analysed by spectrophotometry, RP/HPLC/UV-VIS, HPLC/PDA and on-line LC/MS. Further, effect of long-term storage on active compound levels was studied. Antimutagenic activity was tested by simple eukaryotic system - yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae D 7. The highest antimutagenic effect and simultaneously the highest stability of antimutagenity values was found in several kinds of multi-floral honey, rape seed honey, honey from eucalypt and orange flowers and in honeydew honey. Samples obtained from trade network exhibited at general lower antimutagenity values when compared with samples from bee-keeper. The highest content of total phenolics was detected in honey with royal yelly, the lowest content was measured in acacia honey. The highest values of total flavonoids exhibited buckwheat and eucalypt <b>flower</b> <b>honey.</b> Total phenolic content was substantially changed during long-term storage (decrease about 50 - 70 %), while total flavonoid content was stable and no significant changes during storage were observed.

Because of relative stability and low changes in most of honey samples during storage {{it can be concluded}} that honey belong to foodstuffs which are able to conserve their positive nutritive properties for a long time...|$|E
40|$|Neonicotinoide gehören zu den wichtigsten Pestiziden, die zum Schutz von landwirtschaftlichen Kulturen eingesetzt werden. Aufgrund der weit verbreiteten Anwendung können Honigbienen mit diesen Substanzen in Berührung kommen. Ein möglicher Expositionsweg stellt das Guttationswasser von saatgutbehandelten Pflanzen dar, welches im ersten Teil der Untersuchungen dieser Diplomarbeit anhand von Proben neonicotinoid-gebeizter Maispflanzen mittels LC-MS/MS analysiert wurde. Die untersuchten Neonicotinoide Clothianidin, Imidacloprid und Thiamethoxam konnten im Guttationswasser in Konzentrationen im ppm-Bereich nachgewiesen werden. Als Folge einer möglichen Exposition von Honigbienen gegenüber Neonicotinoiden könnten diese Substanzen in den Honig gelangen, welcher vom Konsumenten als ein besonders reines Lebensmittel angesehen wird. In diesem Zusammenhang war das Hauptziel dieser Diplomarbeit die Entwicklung und Validierung einer analytischen Methode für die simultane Bestimmung von Neonicotinoiden in Honig sowie die anschließende Untersuchung von österreichischen Honig- und Nektarproben. Die Methode umfasste insgesamt acht Neonicotinoide (Acetamiprid, Clothianidin, Dinotefuran, Flonicamid, Imidacloprid, Nitenpyram, Thiacloprid und Thiamethoxam) und vier Metabolite (IM 2 - 1, TFNA-AM, TZMU und TZNG). Die Probenaufarbeitung basierte auf einer Extraktion mit Acetonitril und anschließender Aufreinigung mittels dispersiver Festphasenextraktion. Der Nachweis und die Quantifizierung der Analyte erfolgte mit LC-MS/MS. Drei Neonicotinoide konnten in den Honigproben nachgewiesen werden: 18 von 41 Proben enthielten Thiacloprid, zwei Proben Acetamiprid und eine Probe Spuren von Thiamethoxam. In Honigproben von Bienenvölkern, welche von Bienenverlusten betroffen waren, konnte Thiacloprid häufiger und in höheren Konzentrationen nachgewiesen werden als in normalen Monitoringproben. Weiters enthielten Blütenhonige durchschnittlich höhere Thiacloprid-Rückstände als Waldhonige. Neun von elf Nektarproben enthielten ebenfalls Thiacloprid. Eine Korrelation zwischen den positiven Proben und Gebieten mit hohem Anteil an Mais- und Rapsanbau konnte nicht festgestellt werden. Neonicotinoid {{insecticides}} {{belong to}} the most important pesticides in the protection of agricultural crops. Honeybees may {{come into contact with}} them as a consequence of their wide-spread application. The first matter of investigation of this thesis dealt with a possible exposure route of honeybees towards neonicotinoid insecticides, focusing on the detection and quantification of neonicotinoids in the guttation liquid of maize plants cultivated from neonicotinoid-treated seeds using LC-MS/MS. The investigated neonicotinoids clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were detectable in the guttation liquid in considerable quantities in the ppm range. In the context of the possible exposure of honeybees to neonicotinoid insecticides these pesticides might be transferred into honey which represents a food with very high purity demands by consumers. In this context the main objective of this thesis was the development and validation of an analytical method for the simultaneous determination of neonicotinoid insecticides in honey and the subsequent analysis of Austrian honey and nectar samples. A total of eight neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, flonicamid, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam) and four metabolites (IM 2 - 1, TFNA-AM, TZMU and TZNG) were included in the multi-residue method. The final method involved a sample preparation procedure based on acetonitrile extraction and subsequent clean-up by dispersive solid-phase extraction followed by detection and quantification using LC-MS/MS. Three neonicotinoid insecticides were detectable in the analysed honey samples: 18 out of 41 samples contained thiacloprid, two samples acetamiprid and one sample traces of thiamethoxam. Honey samples from beehives with reported losses of honeybees proved to be contaminated more often and with higher amounts of thiacloprid than standard monitoring samples. Further, <b>flower</b> <b>honey</b> samples contained on average higher thiacloprid residues than forest honey samples. Nine out of eleven nectar samples contained thiacloprid.
