Unique interior touches like the gear shifter that doubled as a shovel handle, removable <b>interior</b> <b>lights</b> which doubled as flashlights, and flat-folding front seats were removed, though several concept items remained as factory options.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{self-levelling}} rear {{air suspension}} available in Caprice brought advantages when hauling heavy loads and improved vehicle dynamics when towing. Safety in the WH model was also enhanced, {{with the addition}} of side impact head & torso airbags and pyrotechnic seat belt pretensioners along with drivers steering wheel and passenger dashboard airbags all as standard. If the seat belt pretensioners trigger, the doors automatically unlock, both engine and fuel pump shut down and all <b>interior</b> <b>lights</b> will switch on. Also new to the WH are the electric wing mirrors, which when reversing, the passenger mirror faces downwards to assist the driver when parking, thus preventing kerbside wheel damage.|$|E

Blue lights alone {{may be used to}} secure the site of an accident (or a standing emergency vehicle). Sometimes, columns of emergency or police vehicles use blue lights (without sirens) to make the column more visible to other vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Cars are {{typically}} fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, {{which are used}} to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. <b>Interior</b> <b>lights</b> on {{the ceiling of the}} car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.|$|E

The 86-inch model was a three-door, seven-seater. The new station wagons were very different from the previous Tickford model, being built with simple metal panels and bolt-together construction instead of the complex wooden structure of the older Station Wagon. They were intended to be used both as commercial vehicles as people-carriers for transporting workmen to remote locations, as well as by private users. Like the Tickford version, they came with basic interior trim and equipment such as roof vents and <b>interior</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E

Designed by Joseph Paxton, the Great Exhibition building was [...] long, with an interior height of [...] It was three times larger than the size of St Paul's Cathedral. The invention of the cast plate glass method in 1848 made possible the production of large sheets of cheap but strong glass, and its use in the Crystal Palace created a structure with the greatest area of glass ever seen in a building and astonished visitors with its clear walls and ceilings that did not require <b>interior</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The trains {{were run}} in five-car formations, Motor coach + trailer + trailer + trailer + motor coach, with spares for overhaul. They were {{constructed}} of welded steel, and were styled in an Art Deco appearance. The motor coaches had cabs at each end, enabling single-car operation by them; {{they had two}} axle-hung traction motors rated at [...] for one hour. The new trains had on-board compressors for the air brakes, and <b>interior</b> <b>lights</b> were in two circuits, one fed from the motor car {{at one end of}} the unit, and one from the other, avoiding total lighting loss in passing conductor rail gaps. The conductor rail was altered to the outside position normal for the third-rail system. There was no train power line, and each motor coach collected its own electric supply.

At 20:50 Townsend radioed Jackson, reporting that one of his platoons had been destroyed and that D Company was [...] "non-effective", with five dead, 16 wounded and 16 men still missing. Viet Cong losses were believed to have been heavy; however, with no confirmed casualty figures it was beginning to look to the Australians like they had suffered a major defeat. The two officers agreed {{it would be impossible to}} secure the battlefield or to attempt to locate the missing from 11 Platoon in the darkness, and after it became clear the Viet Cong were not going to counter-attack, Townsend ordered a withdrawal to a position [...] to the west from where their casualties could be evacuated. Handling the dead and wounded proved a slow process but with the casualties finally loaded onto the carriers D Company left at 22:45, while B and A Companies departed on foot 45 minutes later. Roberts established a landing zone by forming a square and illuminated it with the <b>interior</b> <b>lights</b> of the APCs by opening their top hatches. The artillery ceased as the evacuation commenced with the first casualties taken out by a US Army Dustoff helicopter, while the remainder were extracted by six UH-1B Iroquois from No. 9 Squadron RAAF. Despite being slowed by the requirement for the helicopters to land without lights, the operation went smoothly and was finally completed after midnight. The last of the casualties were taken out by 00:34, and were flown to the Australian hospital at Vung Tau.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> for both functional and esthetic purposes. Although {{a large body of}} research has developed over many years on nighttime driver vision and vehicle exterior lighting, there has traditionally been little research attention to <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> This report includes a brief review of some of the research that has been done, and presents the results of a nighttime field study that was performed to contribute to the understanding of how vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> affects some basic aspects of driver vision. Participants in the study were asked to perform two tasks while seated in a stationary experimental car on a closed test road at night: (1) detecting pedestrians on the road ahead, and (2) rating the subjective brightness of a reflected veiling light on the windshield. The veiling light was varied in both luminance and color. The results indicated that pedestrian detection was closely related to photopic photometric measures, suggesting the pedestrian task was influenced primarily by cone photoreceptors, while the rating of subjective brightness appeared to show an influence of rod photoreceptors. These results have implications for how the photometry of vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> should be performed in order to give the best correlation with driver visual performance. Future research should further quantify the effects observed here and investigate changes in retinal adaptation associated with automotive <b>interior</b> <b>lighting...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{perceived}} {{atmosphere in}} a space is {{to a large extent}} determined by the illumination of the space, which usually is a combination of artificial lighting and daylight naturally entering the room. In this study we investigated how the presence of daylight affects the perceived atmosphere of a light ambience both in a real illuminated space and in a visualization of the space. The perceptual accuracy of these visualizations has been demonstrated in previous studies for artificial <b>interior</b> <b>lighting,</b> but not yet for the contribution of daylight to the <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> Our results showed only a relatively small effect of the contribution of daylight both on the perception of light and the perception of the atmosphere of an <b>interior</b> <b>light</b> ambience. Possibly, adaptation {{plays an important role in}} this finding. Further, we demonstrated that the perceptual accuracy of visualizations containing daylight was for the majority of the light and atmosphere perception attributes similar to visualizations showing only artificial <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
