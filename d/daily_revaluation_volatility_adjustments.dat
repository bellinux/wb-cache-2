40|$|The {{problem of}} option hedging in the {{presence}} of proportional transaction costs can be formulated as a singular stochastic control problem. Hodges and Neuberger [1989. Optimal replication of contingent claims under transactions costs. Review of Futures Markets 8, 222 - 239] introduced an approach that is based on maximization of the expected utility of terminal wealth. We develop a new algorithm to solve the corresponding singular stochastic control problem and introduce a new approach to option hedging which is closer in spirit to the pathwise replication of Black and Scholes [1973. The pricing of options and corporate liabilities. Journal of Political Economy 81, 637 - 654]. This new approach is based on minimization of a Black-Scholes-type measure of pathwise risk, defined in terms of a market delta, subject to an upper bound on the hedging cost. We provide an efficient backward induction algorithm for the problem of cost-constrained risk minimization, whose associated singular stochastic control problem is shown to be equivalent to an optimal stopping problem. This algorithm is then modified to solve the singular stochastic control problem associated with utility maximization, which cannot be reduced to an optimal stopping problem. We propose to choose an optimal parameter (risk-aversion coefficient or Lagrange multiplier) in either approach by minimizing the mean squared hedging error and demonstrate that with this "best" choice of the parameter, both approaches have similar performance. We also discuss the different notions of risk in both approaches and propose a <b>volatility</b> <b>adjustment</b> for the risk-minimization approach, which is analogous to that introduced by Zakamouline [2006. European option pricing and hedging with both fixed and proportional transaction costs. Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 30, 1 - 25] for the utility maximization approach, thereby providing a unified treatment of both approaches.

40|$|Purchasing {{goods from}} distant {{locations}} introduces a significant lag between when {{a product is}} shipped and when it arrives. These transit lags are trade barriers for firms facing volatile demand, who must place orders before knowing the resolution of demand uncertainty. We provide a model in which airplanes bring producers and consumers together in time. Fast transport allows firms to respond quickly to favorable demand realizations and to limit the risk of unprofitably large quantities during low demand periods. The model predicts that the likelihood and extent to which firms employ air shipments is increasing in the volatility of demand they face, decreasing in the air premium they must pay, and increasing in the contemporaneous realization of demand. We confirm all three conjectures using detailed US import data. Fast transport thus provides firms with a real option to smooth demand volatility on international markets, and we provide simple calculations of that option value. This enables us to identify how the option value relates to goods characteristics, and to changes in air transport premia associated with technological and policy change including the introduction of jet engines, and liberalization of trade in air services.

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the dynamic effects of volatility spillovers and dominant role (the second-moment) of the US, Japan and Hong Kong in the East Asian equity markets. To evaluate the recent September 11 (911) impact, two sub periods – {{before and after}} the tragedy, are being considered based on daily market returns. The upshots of our findings are five-fold. First, for all markets the constant risk components, as well as the ARCH and GARCH effects are significantly detected, implying the persistency of volatility in East Asian equity markets. Nevertheless, not all indexes show asymmetrical news effects. Though all indexes show leverage effects, they are significant only for certain countries including the US and Japan, which is consistent with empirical literature. Second, the volatilities of these equity markets are bounded in common stochastic trends, at least in the long run. Third, the Hong Kong long run coefficients are more significant than that of US or Japan before the 911 calamity. Nonetheless, there is sufficient evidence showing that the US spillovers were transmitted via Hong Kong. After the 911, the Hong Kong’s spillovers trim down while Japanese influence enhance as in Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Singapore. Taken as a whole (1998 - 2002), Japanese spillovers are relatively small and nonsignificant in some East Asian equity markets. Fourth, the ECT coefficients are significant but small (except for Hong Kong). The East Asian equity markets are thereby endogenously determined and the <b>volatility</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the long run equilibrium are slow, once being shocked. The ECT coefficients slightly improved after 911. Fifth, volatilities in the East Asian equity markets are attributed mainly to the shocks of local and regional factors rather than the world factor. In a nutshell, the volatility spillovers and the Hong Kong- and US-dominant effects have been confirmed. Hitherto, the 911 impact is relatively small and somewhat inconclusive. ...|$|R

Therefore, focusing on the Hong Kong stock market allows the comparison on the disclosure quality between the three. While the banks usually do not provide the disclosed VaRs with details on their internal estimation model and the actual accuracy of the estimation; this paper aims to (1) replicate the banks’ Value-at-Risk and apply the backtesting on the estimated VaR; and (2) compare the estimated VaR under the selected model with the VaR disclosed in banks’ publicly disclosed information. In {{the first part of}} the research, twelve models are estimated with the variation of their <b>volatility</b> <b>adjustment</b> model, width of data rolling window, and simulation approaches. There are two ways of historical volatility forecast models applied, namely, the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (1, 1) (or GARCH(1, 1)); together with the case of no adjustment, they make up three different specification. 250 and 500 previous trading days are the two elected width of time window; and the Historical Simulation and Monte Carlo Simulation are the two simulation methods that are tested. These variations generate the twelve estimation approaches. These methods are then tested with the Christoffersen’s (1998) three tests of conditional coverage, independence and unconditional coverage. Furthermore, the GMM based duration test suggested by Candelon (2011) is also applied to the VaR data. The results concluded that the EWMA model with a 250 days of rolling window is the best perform model under the Christoffersen’s (1998) tests. In the second part of the research, the estimated VaR from the best perform model is compared with the disclosed values. Four types of disclosed VaR are included in the comparison, they are the trading book year-end and year average VaRs, and the trading and non-trading book year-end and year average VaRs. The results suggest that the year average forms of VaRs can better reflect the risk and the trading and non-trading book VaR is better than the trading book ones. In the cross country analysis, the group international banks (HSBC and SCB) outperform the two groups with Chinese and Hong Kong banks, which suggests that the international banks have their VaR disclosed with better quality...|$|R

Traditional solutions to congestion control are prone to delivery rate fluctuations and may respond only when packet loss has already occurred, while both fluctuations and packet loss seriously affect the end user?s appreciation of the delivered video. In this chapter, fuzzy logic control (FLC) is newly applied to control of video streaming in fixed and wireless networks. In a fixed network, by way of congestion control the encoded video bitstream?s rate is adjusted according to the available bandwidth. Compared to existing controllers, FLC?s sending rate is significantly smoother, allowing it to closely track available bandwidth at a bottleneck on the video stream?s path across a network. The chapter also shows that when multiple video streams are congestion controlled through FLC, the result is a fairer and more efficient sharing of the bandwidth capacity. Also considered is a pioneering application of FLC to wireless networks, where other resources, apart from available bandwidth, come into play. An FLC system has been designed that provides a modular solution to control of latency and energy consumption, which is important for battery-powered devices, but must be balanced against the quality of delivered video.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss and {{estimate}} the factors of growth and structural adjustment in small open economies in transition. Our theoretical considerations are empirically tested on Czech exports and imports in exchanges with two regions: the European Union {{and the rest of}} world. By using the export and import functions, we estimated the determining factors of trade intensities relative to the changes in aggregate demand, competitiveness, factor endowments and policy measures. It was of our special interest to analyze the outcome of the massive liberalization of trade with the EU during 1990 - 99. We worked with the commodity breakdown into 61 industries. The factors acting universally in all four of our tests were the aggregate demand of the destination countries and the structure of the foreign direct investment, representing the human capital. The competitiveness of Czech imports was based generally on quality, while Czech exports to the EU competed in prices. Factor endowments, tariffs and subsidies had also their specific role in shaping the Czech specialization pattern. The appreciation of real exchange rate had only a marginal net effect on the trade balance. Further structural adjustments can be expected not only in further deepening of the Czech export commodity specialization but, due to spillovers of both exports and imports, also in the domestic production for domestic market. The intensive structural and growth incentives associated with the EU accession will bring about pressures for a new wave of restructuring of enterprises, further reallocation of existing resources and a provision of production factors that become the constraints to growth. It is the nature of transition economies that their development, associated with fast growth and convergence to the EU GDP per capita average, will remain for a long time subjected to periodical (though attenuating) waves of <b>adjustments.</b> The economic <b>volatility</b> caused by <b>adjustments</b> to external shocks will be for long more intensive in transition economies than in stabilized economies. The core of fundamental adjustments rests in the changing conditions for the specialization in trade between accession and the EU incumbent countries. The degree of resistance of enterprises to pressures for restructuring coming from the trade potential is therefore reflected in the proneness of the economies in transition to macroeconomic instability (slow growth, budget deficit, structural unemployment and external imbalance). These politically sensitive developments are closely related to decision-making on a choice of macroeconomic and structural policies...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} contains three essays that {{explore the}} speed of <b>adjustment,</b> <b>volatility</b> and noise in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The first essay explores {{the speed of}} adjustment in the Indonesia Stock Exchange at daily interval from 2000 to 2004. The model employed is the speed of adjustment with noise. Firstly, I work on the estimation {{of the speed of}} adjustment. The estimated speed of adjustment coefficient concludes that the large size leads the smaller size group to adjust to new information. Secondly, I analyse the component in the noise that contributes significantly to the speed of adjustment level. It is confirmed that the factor determining the noise is bid-ask fluctuations. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer the component in the noise from bid-ask component. The decomposition of bid-ask spread into transaction cost and asymmetric information reveals that the latter is found to be a significant component determining the speed of adjustment level. The second essay analyses the fine grain dynamics of the speed of price adjustment to new information from 2000 to 2007. The exact time of adjustment is estimated at intraday frequency instead of at daily frequency. In this work, as an alternative of first moment estimation, second moment model-free estimation using volatility signature plot to estimate of the speed of adjustment is proposed. Both first and second moment estimation of the speed of adjustment provide consistent result of 30 minute adjustment period. Negative relation after 5 -minute return interval between speed of adjustment estimate and realized variance is found implying lower noise leads to smaller deviation between observed and equilibrium price. In the third essay, I concentrate the work on the second moment of continuously compounded returns from 2000 to 2007 in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The main purpose of the last essay is to estimate the noise and efficient variance in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The realized variance based estimator is employed in the third essay. During the period of the study, noise variance decreases indicating smaller deviation between the observed and equilibrium price, hence improving market quality in the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

The model predicts that expected returns increase with a firm's reliance on skilled labor, as well as compensation for fluctuations in aggregate uncertainty. Consequently, a rise in aggregate uncertainty predicts an increase in expected returns as well as in cautiousness in hiring and firing. This impact is larger for firms with a high share of skilled workers because their labor is more costly to adjust. I empirically test the implications of the model using occupational estimates to construct a measure of a firm's reliance on skilled labor, and find a positive and statistically significant cross-sectional relation between the reliance on skilled labor and expected returns. Empirical estimates also show that an increase in aggregate uncertainty leads to a rise in expected returns, and this impact is larger for firms which rely heavily on skilled labor; thereby, a firm's exposure to aggregate volatility is positively related to its reliance on skilled labor. In the second and third essay, co-authored with Ravi Bansal, we explore the impact of global temperature on financial markets and the macroeconomy. In tho second essay we explore if temperature is an aggregate risk factor that adversely affects economic growth. First, using data on global capital markets we find that the risk-exposure of these returns to temperature shocks, i. e., their temperature beta, is a highly significant variable in accounting for cross-sectional differences in expected returns. Second, using a panel of countries we show that GDP growth is negatively related to global temperature, suggesting that temperature can be a source of aggregate risk. To interpret the empirical evidence, we present a quantitative consumption-based long-run risks model that quantitatively accounts for the observed cross-sectional differences in temperature betas, the compensation for temperature risk, and the connection between aggregate growth and temperature risks. The last essay proposes a general equilibrium model that simultaneously models the world economy and global climate to understand the impact of climate change on the economy. We use this model to evaluate the role of temperature in determining asset prices, and to compute utility-based welfare costs as well as dollar costs of insuring against temperature fluctuations. We find that the temperature related utility-costs are about 0. 78 % of consumption, and the total dollar costs of completely insuring against temperature variation are 2. 46 % of world GDP. If we allow for temperature-triggered natural disasters to impact growth, insuring against temperature variation raise to 5. 47 % of world GDP. Dissertatio...|$|R
