40|$|Functionalisation of {{hydrocarbons}} is a {{field of}} continuing activity {{and a variety of}} approaches to this field, have been taken. This thesis is concerned with the functionalisation of the carbon-hydrogen bond, in hydrocarbons, using fluorinated alkenes via a free radical chain mechanism. Addition of the nucleophilic alkyl radical to the electrophilic <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkene,</b> specifically hexafluoropropene, occurs readily to give incorporation of the polyfluoroalkyl group into a number of hydrocarbons, including aliphatic, mono-, bi- and polycyclic systems. Further chemistry of these polyfluoroalkylated systems has been investigated, including dehydrofluorination of the polyfluoralkyl group to give a series of novel mono- di- and poly-enes with polyfluoroalkenyl groups. Perfluorination of the polyfluoroalkylated systems, using high valency metal fluorides, produced a range of new perfluorocarbons of interest and the monocyclic polyfluoroalkylated systems' were further functionalised, by radical chemistry, to give isomeric products...|$|E

That <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkene</b> (HPO) was synthesised in two steps {{starting from the}} thermal or redox telomerisation of VDF with C 6 F 13 I (after purification of the monoadduct compound by rectification) followed by a dehydroiodination {{in the presence of}} various alkalies. Their influences are discussed toward the yield of the reaction. The compositions of the resulting random-type copolymers were calculated by means of 19 F NMR spectroscopy and allowed one to quantify the respective amounts of each monomeric unit in the copolymer. From the Tidwell and Mortimer method, the reactivity ratios (ri) of both comonomers for this copolymerisation were determined showing a higher incorporation of VDF: rVDF = 12. 0 +- 3. 0 and rF 2 C-CHC 6 F 13 = 0 : 9 +- 0 : 4 at 74 °C...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: By {{contrast}} to typical high-temperature (100 − 250 °C) telo-/polymerizations of gaseous fluori-nated monomers, {{carried out in}} high-pressure metal reactors, the visible light, Mn 2 (CO) 10 -photomediated initiation of vinylidene fluoride (bp = − 83 °C) polymer-ization occurs readily {{from a variety of}} alkyl, semi-fluorinated, and perfluorinated halides at 40 °C, in low-pressure glass tubes and in a variety of solvents, including water and alkyl carbonates. Perfluorinated alkyl iodide initiators also induce a controlled radical polymerization via iodine degenerative transfer (IDT). While IDT proceeds with accumulation of the less reactive Pm-CF 2 -CH 2 -I vs the Pn-CH 2 -CF 2 -I chain ends, Mn 2 (CO) 10 enables their subsequent quantitative activation toward the synthesis of well-defined poly(vinylidene fluoride) block copolymers with a variety of other monomers. Fluorinated (co) polymers are fundamental specialty materi-als {{with a wide range of}} high-end applications 1 requiring their precise synthesis. However, while novel controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods 2 (atom transfer, nitroxide, or addition−fragmentation) have recently seen remarkable devel-opments 2, 3 and have proven very effective for (meth) acrylates or styrene, their applicability in the CRP of main-chain <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkene</b> monomers (FMs: vinylidene fluoride (VDF), hexafluoropropene (HFP), tetrafluoroethylene, etc.) still awaits demonstration.

The establishment of cyclobutane structure proved an example of waxing and waning in the interpretation of organic reactions. Many studies were done and they are discussed.

40|$|The Mizoroki-Heck {{reaction}} {{represents one}} of the most convenient methods for carbon-carbon double bond formation in the synthesis of small organic molecules, natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. Fluorine-containing organic compounds have found wide applications in the research areas of materials and life sciences over the past several decades. The incorporation of fluorine-containing segments into the target molecules by the Mizoroki-Heck reactions is highly attractive, as these reactions efficiently construct carbon-carbon double bonds bearing fluorinated functional groups by simple procedures. This review summarizes the palladium-catalyzed Mizoroki-Heck reactions using various fluorine-containing reagents as the cross-coupling partners.

40|$|Chiu, Pei C. Chang, Shu-ChiThe {{prevalence}} of legacy and emerging contaminants has increasingly stressed our limited water resources, and caused impaired water quality {{in many parts}} of the world. To meet our growing demand for clean water in this century, it is of the utmost importance to develop more effective means to remove/degrade pollutants in water. In this research, three novel materials/processes were investigated for the adsorption or degradation of three important contaminants: arsenic, <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkenes,</b> and nitrate. Arsenic is a common groundwater contaminant that poses a serious health threat to populations in the U. S. and other countries. Fluorinated organics are widespread in consumer and industrial products, and many of them are persistent due to the high stability of the carbon-fluorine bond. Nitrate is the most ubiquitous pollutant in U. S. groundwater. Nitrate is not only toxic at high concentrations, but is also a leading cause of water quality impairment. We have developed a new nano-magnetite-based sorbent to remove arsenic, investigated an effective catalyst for the reduction of <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkenes,</b> and determined the capacity of a biochar to promote microbial nitrate reduction. Magnetite nanoparticle composite (MNPC) was synthesized for the removal of arsenic from water. We have shown that magnetite nanoparticles (MNP) possess high capacities and superior kinetics for adsorption of arsenic. In addition, to enable treatment applications, a new method was developed to embed MNPs into a silica network (MNPC). MNPC exhibited high adsorption capacities for arsenite and arsenate, 159. 7 and 165. 1 mg g- 1, respectively, comparable to the adsorption capacity of MNPs under anaerobic conditions. MNPC could retain over 99. 99 % of the MNPs in its structure. Moreover, the embedment prevented exposure of MNPC to oxygen and thereby extended its service life. Our results suggest that MNPC may represent a viable technology for arsenic removal from groundwater and drinking water. Rhodium on alumina was used as a catalyst to activate hydrogen gas for the reduction of vinyl fluoride (VF) as a model compound for <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkenes.</b> VF is the monomer of fluoropolymer, a high production volume compound, and a probable (group 2 A) carcinogen. We studied the kinetics of VF reduction in the presence of water. The rate-limiting step for the reduction was determined to be the mass transfer of VF from bulk water to the catalyst surface. Based on the product distribution, the reaction paths were found to consist of reductive defluorination, followed by hydrogenation, and hydrogenation only, producing ethane and fluoroethane, respectively, as final product. When water was absent, the kinetics was too fast to be measured producing mainly fluoroethane as the final product. The experiment with humidified hydrogen gas showed that even layers of adsorbed water molecules on the surface of the catalyst would dramatically shift the reaction rate and product distribution. By revealing the crucial role of water in controlling both the reaction kinetics and pathway, this study could be an important step toward the development of effectively catalytic treatment for fluorocarbons. We demonstrated for the first time that biochar could serve as an electron donor to support microbial nitrate reduction. This new discovery could be a basis of novel engineered treatment/remediation systems to degrade nitrate, the most prevalent pollutant in the U. S. groundwater. Geobacter metallireducens (GS- 15) was used to investigate the role of redox active functional groups in biochar to nitrate reduction by exoelectrogenic bacteria. We showed that both biologically and chemically reduced biochar could support nitrate reduction. Results of this study suggest that biochar could be a bioaccessible electron storage medium in bioretention cells and other engineered systems, and this finding may also be applied to other black carbon. Each approach in this dissertation represents a breakthrough in contaminant treatment. Results of each investigation either form a basis for new and improved treatment methods or have implications, for the fate of contaminants in natural systems. Both are discussed in Chapter 5.

Very similar Rh-ethene coordination geometries {{are found in}} the solid state, i. e., 1, Rh-C = 2. 127 (5) Angstrom, and 2, Rh-C = 2. 121 (3) Angstrom, in good accord with DFT calculations, i. e., 1, RB-C = 2. 132 Angstrom and 2, Rh-C = 2. 136 Angstrom. The calculated Rh- 103 NMR chemical shifts (GIAO-B 3 LYP/II level) for a range of bis(eta (2) -alkene) (2, 4 -pentanedionato) rhodium(I) complexes also agree well with solution NMR data. The empirical correlation between transition-metal shifts and stability constants (Öhrström, L. Comm. Inorg. Chem. 1996, 18, 305) could be confirmed for simple alkenes, since the computed relative Rh-alkene binding energies were found to correlate with delta(Rh- 103). I, contrast, chelating or <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkenes</b> showed large deviations from this correlation. The steric and electronic effects on the Rh-alkene bond are discussed and analyzed in terms of Bader's atoms-in-molecules theory, which revealed qualitatively different binding modes of ethene and tetrafluoroethene to rhodium: ethene forms typical pi -complexes in the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model, whereas tetrafluoroethene complexes are on the borderline to metallacyclopropanes...|$|R
5000|$|Hydrodefluorination (HDF) {{is a type}} {{of organic}} {{reaction}} in which in a substrate a carbon-fluorine bond is replaced by a carbon-hydrogen bond. The topic is of some interest to scientific research. In one general strategy for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds with a specific substitution pattern, the substrate is a cheaply available perfluorinated hydrocarbon. An example is the conversion of hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) to pentafluorobenzene (C6F5H) by certain zirconocene hydrido complexes. In this type of reaction the thermodynamic driving force is the formation of a metal-fluorine bond that can offset the cleavage of the very stable C-F bond. Other substrates that have been investigated are <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkenes.</b> Another reaction type is oxidative addition of a metal into a C-F bond [...] followed by a reductive elimination step in presence of a hydrogen source. For example, perfluoronated pyridine reacts with bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) and triethylphosphine to the oxidative addition product and then with HCl to the ortho-hydrodefluorinated product. In reductive hydrodefluorination the fluorocarbon is reduced in a series of single electron transfer steps through the radical anion, the radical and the anion with ultimate loss of a fluorine anion. An example is the conversion of pentafluorobenzoic acid to 3,4,5-tetrafluorobenzoic acid in a reaction of zinc dust in aqueous ammonia.|$|R

One of our research effort demonstrates the development and application of novel Multiple Internal Reflection Infrared Spectroscopy (MIR-IR) as a sensitive (sub- 5 nm) metrology tool to provide precise chemical bonding information that can effectively guide {{through the development of}} more efficient process control. In this work, we investigated the chemical bonding structure of thin fluorocarbon polymer films deposited on low-k dielectric nanostructures, using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

For the purpose of synthesising the 1 : 1 adducts, γ-ray initiation was shown to provide a superior method to ultra violet radiation or peroxides. Competition reactions were carried out between homologous alcohols and between different species, viz alcohol, aldehyde, amine, ether. These reactions enabled reactivity series to be established. Chemistry of the derived polyfluorinated alcohols was investigated, and {{it has been shown that}} these compounds may be reacted with a broad spectrum of electrophiles to give new esters, carbonates, sulphonates and ethers, including the first reported such reactions with perfluorinated aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds as electrophiles.

40|$|Hydrofluorocarbons {{have been}} {{proposed}} as CFC and HCFC substitutes since 1987, after the Montreal Protocol, {{with the aim of}} decreasing the ozone depletion. At present, these compounds are industrially produced by reaction of chlorinated hydrocarbons with HF. Environmental concerns have been raised regarding such processes, due to the co-production of huge amounts of HCl and the possible generation of dioxins and chlorinated compounds [1]. Due to their contribution to the greenhouse effect, fluorinated alkanes have often been replaced by other materials (e. g., natural refrigerants) in several UE countries [1, 2]. On the other hand, fluorinated olefins are used as intermediates for fluorinated polymers. A growing effort is currently being performed to set out cleaner processes for these latter compounds. To achieve an environmentally sustainable process, a possible alternative for <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkenes</b> synthesis is the reaction of olefins with fluorinated solids. In particular, perovskites-type materials with composition (AgF) (MF_y) _x, were reported to be active catalysts in ethylene and propylene oxyfluorination [3]. However, the synthesis of the perovskite-type mixed fluoride [4, 5] leads to the formation of other compounds, such as metal oxides or reduced metals (i. e., Ag^ 0). For this reason, we tried to improve previous results with the aim of optimizing the catalyst synthesis. This work deals with the synthesis of AgCuF_ 3 by i) solid state reaction between commercial fluorides, in a HF flow, and ii) fluorination with HF of an oxohydrate obtained by metal nitrates co-precipitation. These compounds were also characterized by catalytic reactivity tests.
