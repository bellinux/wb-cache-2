40|$|This study {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} behavioural responses to climate change induced extreme weather events. It suggest a microeconometric method for measuring <b>flooding</b> related <b>risk</b> preferences of affected individuals. The method is outlined using the empirical case of agricultural production in floodplains of the UK over 28 years. A quasi-experimental approach to measure differences in the risk attitudes of farmers located in high <b>flooding</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> versus farmers located in low <b>flooding</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> is followed. Changes in <b>flooding</b> <b>risk</b> related behaviour over time is analysed and marginal effects of different individual and disaster related characteristics for this behaviour are investigated. Beside a moments based risk estimation approach the study also applies a dynamic panel estimator. The estimates suggest that the average farmer located in a high <b>flooding</b> <b>risk</b> <b>area</b> is prepared to pay about 6 % more of his profit for insuring against the higher <b>risk</b> of <b>flooding</b> compared to farmers in low <b>flooding</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas.</b> The significance of considering individual risk preferences for an efficient flood policy design is discussed using the example of voluntary agreements for the maintainance of flood defences.

40|$|This paper quantitatively explores farmers' {{vulnerability}} to flood in the Poyang Lake Region (PLR) with the supports of GIS spatial functions. The analysis {{consists of three}} major steps, {{which is based on}} the spatial unit of township. Firstly, the spatial extent and characteristics of <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> were determined using a digital elevation model (DEM) derived from the 1 : 50, 000 topographic map. Secondly, for each of the township, six indices indicating the economic activities of local farmers were calculated. These indices are: rural population proportion, cultivated land proportion, GDP per unit area, employment proportion of primary industry, net rural income per capita and agricultural income proportion. These six indices were then normalized and used for later vulnerability assessment. Thirdly, the normalized indices (as GIS data layers) were overlaid with the <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> to produce the risk coefficient for each township and to calculate the overall vulnerability for each township. The analysis results show that in the PLR there are high <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> where the farmers' livings are seriously influenced or threatened. About 55. 56 % of the total 180 townships in the <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> have a high degree of flood vulnerability.

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{urbanization}} rate and extreme rainfall {{as a form of}} the abnormal climate, the urban flood frequency has been increased. Therefore, it is very important for the policy makers to evaluate the urban flood vulnerability and propose the corresponding flood mit-igation policies. Since the interests on the urban flood mitigation is increased, many structural flood measures has been constructed. If a city has many structural flood measures, the city is considered as the flood safe city. In this study, inherent flood vulnerability is pro-posed using Flood Protection Capacity and Damage(PCD) matrix with the flood damage cost and constructed structural flood mit-igation measures. The proposed inherent flood vulnerability method was applied in Seoul. The results are categorized by four areas such as relatively flood safe area, <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>area,</b> inherent flood vulnerable area, and the area where more structural flood measures are needed. Calculated inherent flood vulnerabilities were compared to the conventional flood vulnerability-resilience indices. The proposed inherent flood vulnerability showed more reasonable results.

From a rainfall event, the hydrologic model parameters are calibrated in order to predict the flood from surface runoff over time.

40|$|Flood {{damage is}} on the {{increase}} due {{to a combination of}} growing vulnerability and a changing climate. This trend can be mitigated only through significantly improved flood risk management which, alongside the efforts of public authorities, will include improvements in the mitigation measures adopted by private households. Economically "reasonable" efforts to self-insure and self-protect should be expected from households before the government steps in with publicly-funded relief programmes. To gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} benefits of households' precautionary measures, telephone interviews with private home owners were conducted in the Elbe and Danube catchments in Germany after the floods of 2002 and again after the floods in 2005 and 2006. Only detached, solid single-family houses were included in this study, which is based on 759 interviews. In addition, market-based cost assessments were solicited based on a "model building". Expert interviews and a literature review – including catalogues and price lists for building materials and household appliances – were used as back-up information for the cost assessments. The comparison of costs and benefits shows that large investments, such as building a sealed cellar, are only economically efficient if the building is flooded very frequently, that is, if it is located in a high <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>area.</b> In such areas it would be preferable in economic terms not to build a new house at all – or else to build a house without a cellar. Small investments, however, such as oil tank protection, can prevent serious damage at low cost. Such investments are still profitable even if the building is flooded every 50 years or less on average. It could be argued that these low-cost measures should be made mandatory through the enforcement of building codes. Financial incentives built into insurance contracts coupled with limits set on governmental relief programmes would provide an economic motivation for people to invest in precautionary measures...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} dynamic links between natural disasters, human decision making, and risk perceptions {{as well as}} the public health implications of wildfire. In Chapter 1, we develop a model that links underlying changes in location-specific risk perceptions to housing market dynamics. We apply the model's predictions to an empirical analysis of the influence of severe wildfires on housing markets. Interpreted {{in the context of the}} model, our empirical results suggest that the evolution of risk perceptions following a natural disaster depend both on the characteristics of the property (relationship to the disaster and latent risk) and the location of the individual whose risk perceptions we are considering (potential seller vs. potential buyer). In Chapter 2, we examine the relationship between hurricanes, the salience of flood risk, and residential property investment. Utilizing a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find a significant increase in the probability a homeowner invests in a damaged building located in a statutorily designated <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>area.</b> However, we find no change in the rate of property investment in damaged homes located outside of these areas. We estimate changes in households’ perceptions of risk by modeling relative changes in investment between properties in designated risk areas and properties directly outside of these zones restricting attention to the set of structures that failed to experience any damage by the storm. Model results suggest that a recent storm may elevate households' perceptions of flood risk; however, we show that the primary mechanism driving these changes is a household's exposure to storm damage. Finally, in Chapter 3 we estimate the effects of wildfire on infant health. Model results show that wildfires lead to a statistically significant 4 % to 6 % reduction in birthweight conditional on the mother being exposed in her second or third trimester and located inside a wildfire smoke plume or downwind of a wildfire burn area. We find no statistically significant effects of wildfire on the health of infants located more than 3 miles away from a burn scar, living outside of smoky areas, or upwind of a wildfire...|$|E
40|$|The hydrodynamics {{of coastal}} river reaches is complex {{due to the}} {{interaction}} of several sources of flooding as the astronomical tide, surge, wave set-up and river discharge. The tidal level might affect several km of river reach. In those reaches, the same inundation water level can result from different combinations of the sea level ad river discharge. At the present time, most flood inundation studies in tidal river reaches are based {{in the application of}} an arbitrary sea level at the downstream river boundary, without considering the interaction and possible correlations between sea level and river discharge. In Spain, the Guía Metodológica para el Desarrollo del Sistema Nacional de Cartografía de Zonas Inundables (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino, 2011), recommends to consider the simultaneous occurrence of a sea level and river discharge associated to the same return period. This approach does not consider the probability of simultaneous occurrence of extreme sea level and river discharge. In order to improve this excessively simple and conservative approach, in this paper we propose a continuous simulation methodology that combines the generation of synthetic long-term time series of river discharge and sea level, 2 D inundation modelling at a high spatial resolution and statistical sampling and interpolation techniques. The proposed methodology is applied to the coastal town of Betanzos (NW of Spain), which is classified as a high potential <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> <b>area</b> by the regional authorities.
