40|$|The {{diffusion}} equation for nonequilibrium interstitial impurity atoms {{taking into}} account their charge states and drift of all mobile interstitial species in the built-in electric field and {{in the field of}} elastic stress was obtained. The obtained generalized equation is equivalent to the set of diffusion equations written for the interstitial impurity atoms in each individual charge state. Due to a number of the characteristic features the generalized equation is more convenient for numerical solution than the original system of separate diffusion equations. On this basis, the macroscopic description of stress-mediated impurity diffusion due to a kick-out mechanism was obtained. It is supposed that the <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurity</b> <b>atom</b> makes a number of jumps before conversion to the substitutional position. At the same time, a local equilibrium prevails between substitutionally dissolved impurity atoms, nonequilibrium self-interstitials, and interstitial impurity atoms. Also, the derived equation for impurity diffusion due to the kick-out mechanism takes into account all charge states of interstitial impurity atoms as well as drift of interstitial species in the electric field and in the field of elastic stress. Moreover, this equation exactly matches the equation of stress-mediated impurity diffusion due to generation, migration, and dissociation of the equilibrium pairs "impurity atom - self-interstitial".

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the Green {{function}} method, analytical solutions of the diffusion equation which describes nonstationary migration of nonequilibrium <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> have been derived. It is supposed that the initial distribution of nonequilibrium <b>impurity</b> <b>interstitials</b> is formed due to ion implantation and, therefore, is described by the Gaussian function. The condition of the constant concentration of <b>impurity</b> <b>interstitials</b> (the Dirichlet boundary condition) or reflecting boundary condition was imposed on the surface of a semiconductor. The Dirichlet boundary condition was also enforced for the concentration of <b>impurity</b> <b>interstitials</b> in the infinity, i. e., in the bulk of a semiconductor. On {{the basis of}} the solutions derived the redistribution of ion-implanted boron in silicon substrate during low-temperature thermal treatment has been simulated. The calculated profile of boron atoms after annealing agrees well with experimental data.

40|$|Radiation-induced {{precipitates}} on dislocation loops in low {{and high}} purity Fe- 9, - 18 and - 50 % Cr alloys were examined under electron irradiation in a high voltage electron microscope operated at 1 MV. Two types of dislocation loops on { 100 } planes with a Burgers vectors and on { 111 } planes with a / 2 are formed in high purity Fe-Cr alloys. However, only a type loops are formed in low purity alloys, i. e. where carbon concentration is greater than about 60 wt. ppm. The growth rate of the loops formed in Fe- 9 and - 18 Cr alloys is faster than that of Fe- 50 Cr alloy. All of the loops formed at temperatures ranging from 573 K to 973 K, even in the (σ+α+α') phase regions in thermal equilibrium, have moiré fringe contrast due to precipitates identified as α' phase. The contrast is very weak in the Fe- 50 Cr alloy because of coarse distribution of precipitates, while the α' phase formed in low purity alloys has somewhat larger interplanar spacings that are modified by <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurities.</b> The α' phase formation on the loops can be understood by radiation-induced segregation of chromium and <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{behavior of}} polycrystalline materials {{is influenced by}} the local variation of properties caused by the presence of impurities and defects. The effect of these impurities at the atomic scale can either embrittle or strengthen grain boundaries within. Thus, it is imperative to understand the energetics associated with segregation to design materials with desirable properties. Here, molecular statics simulations were employed to analyze the energetics associated with the segregation of various elements (He, H, C, P, and V) to four (Sigma 5 and 13 GBs) and six (Sigma 3, 9,and 11 GBs) symmetric tilt grain boundaries in alpha-Fe. This knowledge is important for designing stable interfaces in harsh environments. Simulation results show that the local atomic arrangements within the GB region and the resulting structural units have a significant influence on the magnitude of binding energies of the <b>impurity</b> (<b>interstitial</b> and substitutional) <b>atoms.</b> This data also suggests that the site-to-site variation of energies within a boundary is substantial. Comparing the binding energies of all ten boundaries shows that the Sigma 3 (112) boundary possesses a much smaller binding energy for all <b>interstitial</b> and substitutional <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> among the boundaries examined here. Additionally, based on the Rice-Wang model, our total energy calculations show that V has a significant beneficial effect on the Fe grain boundary cohesion, while P has a detrimental effect on grain boundary cohesion, much weaker than H and He. This is significant for applications where extreme environmental damage generates lattice defects and grain boundaries act as sinks for both <b>interstitial</b> and substitutional <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms.</b> This methodology provides us with a tool to effectively identify the local as well as the global segregation behavior which can influence the GB cohesion.

The {{mechanisms}} of formation of activated states upon diffusion of <b>impurity</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> in metals have been identified, which allows {{formulation of the}} theoretical criterion for reliability of corresponding experimental data. This criterion is valid for almost all experimental results gained using precise techniques for bcc, fcc, and hcp metals. In case of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, most adequate are the models of potential diffusion barrier {{that are based on}} the elasticity theory. For carbon and boron, a less energy-taking mechanism is realized which involves the electron system rearrangement in a crystal during the diffusion jump. The accuracy of the theoretical criterion is in line with the capacities of modern precision techniques...|$|R

40|$|<b>Impurity</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> {{present in}} metals with BCC {{structure}} can diffuse in the metallic matrix by jumps to energetically equivalent crystallographic sites. Anelastic spectroscopy (internal friction) {{is based on}} the measurement of mechanical loss or internal friction as a function of temperature. Due to its selective and nondestructive nature, anelastic spectroscopy is well suited for the study of diffusion of interstitial elements in metals. Internal friction measurements were made using the torsion pendulum technique with oscillation frequency of a few Hz, temperature interval from 300 to 700 K, heating rate of about 1 K/min, and vacuum better than 10 - 5 mbar. The polycrystalline Nb and Ta samples used were supplied by Aldrich Inc. The results obtained showed thermally activated relaxation structures due to stress-induced ordering of oxygen atoms around the Nb (or Ta) atoms of the metallic matrix. The results were interpreted by three methods and led to activation enthalpy values for the diffusion of oxygen in Nb and Ta of 1. 15 eV and 1. 10 eV, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The first-order monoclinic-to-orthorhombic (β→γ) phase {{transition}} {{of the giant}} magnetocaloric material Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2 was studied using in situ high-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction. A special crystal mounting procedure was developed to avoid crystal contamination by oxygen or nitrogen at high temperatures. The elastic β→γ transformation occurs at 300 − 320 °C during heating, and it is reversible during fast and slow heating and slow cooling but irreversible during rapid cooling. Contrary to theoretical predictions, the macroscopic distribution of the Si and Ge atoms remains the same in both the orthorhombic γ-polymorph and the monoclinic β-phase. It appears that <b>interstitial</b> <b>impurities</b> may affect stability of both the monoclinic and orthorhombic phases. In the presence of small amounts of air, the β→γ transformation is complete only at 600 °C.

40|$|Unalloyed {{metallic}} uranium used in {{some work}} done at Y- 12 contains small quantities of impurities, the three most significant of which are carbon, iron, and silicon. During metallurgical processing, as the metal cools from a molten condition towards room temperature, the metallic matrix solution becomes supersaturated {{in each of the}} impurities whose concentration exceeds the solubility limit. Many <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> form compounds with uranium that precipitate out of the solution, thus creating and growing inclusions. The objective of the present work is to study the distribution of <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> about some of the inclusions, with a view toward examining the effect of the interaction between inclusions on the <b>impurity</b> <b>atom</b> distribution. The method used is time-dependent mass diffusion from the supersaturated solution to the surfaces of the inclusions. Micrographs of metal samples suggest that the inclusions form in successive stages. After each inclusion forms, it begins to draw <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> from its immediate vicinity, thus altering the amounts and distributions of <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> available for formation and growth of later inclusions. In the present work, a one-dimensional spherical approximation was used to simulate inclusions and their regions of influence. A first set of calculations was run to simulate the distribution of <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> about the largest inclusions. Then, a second set of calculations was run to see how the loss of <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> to the largest inclusions might affect the distribution of <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> around the next stage of inclusions. Plots are shown for the estimated distributions of <b>impurity</b> <b>atoms</b> in the region of influence about the inclusions for the three impurities studied. The authors believe that these distributions are qualitatively correct. However, there is enough uncertainty about precisely when inclusions nucleate and begin to grow that one should not put too much reliance on the quantitative results.
