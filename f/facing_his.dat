5|$|The {{battle is}} {{highlighted}} by many historians specifically because Lucullus overcame the numerical odds <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> army.

In November 1969, he tried a different tack, contacting the Pathet Lao and attempted to negotiate a quid pro quo: the Hmong would cease fighting if the communists {{would allow them to}} establish a semiautonomous state in Xieng Khouang Province.|$|E
5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can be done in this zone.|$|E

5|$|Continuing to emphasise good {{relations}} with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. However, throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals would remain unemployed, with unemployment being one of the most persistent problems <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> government.|$|E
5|$|Convinced by Scar {{that he is}} {{responsible}} for his father's death, Simba runs away to a distant jungle where he is befriended by Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him to ignore his past and avoid his responsibilities. There, he grows into a handsome young lion, while Scar wreaks havoc on the Pride Lands. When Simba is discovered by his childhood friend named Nala, she confronts him, warning him of Scar's tyranny and begging him to return home. Afraid of <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> past, Simba refuses until a wise mandrill named Rafiki leads him to Mufasa's ghost, who convinces him to return home and reclaim his kingdom from Scar.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{understood}} the problems <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> multi-ethnic patrimony and the ambivalent position the Austrians {{held in the}} Holy Roman Empire. Although the Habsburgs and their successor house of Habsburg-Lorraine had, with two exceptions, held the position of Emperor since the early 15th century, the basis of 18th-century Habsburg power lay not in the Holy Roman Empire itself, but in Habsburg territories in Eastern Europe (where the family had vast domains), the Italian peninsula, and the Lowlands. For Joseph or his successors to wield influence in the German-speaking states, they needed to acquire additional German-speaking territories. Acquisition of Central European territories with German-speaking subjects would strengthen the Austrian position in the Holy Roman Empire. As far as Joseph was concerned, only this could shift {{the center of the}} Habsburg empire into German-speaking Central Europe. This agenda made dispensable both the Austrian Netherlands—Habsburg territories which lay furthest west—and Galicia, furthest east. It also made the recovery of German-speaking Silesia and acquisition of new territories in Bavaria essential.|$|E

5|$|Mid-way in the march, Frederick finally {{realized}} that he would end up <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> enemy, instead of approaching from behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make {{an assault on the}} Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that he could turn the Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he moved more troops around so that the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} contest pitted Chris Sabin against Petey Williams, lasting 12 {{minutes and}} 34 seconds. The bout was originally scheduled as Sabin <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> tag team {{partner in the}} Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament, Shocker. However, Shocker was unable to attend the show {{and was replaced by}} Williams. Williams held Sabin by Sabin's legs in a Sharpshooter submission hold twice during the match, with Sabin forcing Williams to release the hold both times. Near the end, Williams went to perform his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver on Sabin, before Sabin countered the move into his signature Cradle Shock maneuver. After lifting up and slamming Williams back and neck-first into the mat, Sabin followed with the pinfall to win the encounter. Matt Bentleyformally known as Michael Shanereturned to TNA by attacking Sabin and Williams after the bout. Bentley then announced an Ultimate X open challenge to take place at Bound for Glory.|$|E
5|$|The {{men in the}} Castle Inn {{retreated to}} Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial {{reinforcements}} from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, {{not all of them}} were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned {{about the quality of the}} opposition <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell into the hands of the insurgency. Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.|$|E

25|$|His country scenes at Yerres {{focus on}} {{pleasure}} boating on the leisurely stream {{as well as}} fishing and swimming, and domestic scenes around his country home. He often used a soft impressionistic technique reminiscent of Renoir to convey the tranquil nature of the countryside, {{in sharp contrast to}} the flatter, smoother strokes of his urban paintings. In Oarsman in a Top Hat (1877), he effectively manages the perspective of a passenger in the back of a row boat <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> rowing companion and the stream ahead, in a manner much more realistic and involving than Manet's Boating (1874).|$|E
25|$|Following the {{dismissal}} of Martyn, Vaughan brought back Jones – realising that Australia were reluctant to hit runs and thus allowing Jones to get through his overs without causing as much damage as he did early on. In fact, he and Harmison {{were part of a}} remarkable streak – they served up 28 successive dot-balls to Symonds and Michael Clarke (who bowed under to the pressure and was hit on the pad, out lbw for a 19-ball two). However, Michael Hussey – <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> first ball at 93 for 5 after 25 overs – took control of Jones, and when Harmison was taken off, Australia were let off the hook.|$|E
25|$|Czartoryski was {{disappointed}} when his hopes held {{as late as}} the Congress of Vienna, that Alexander's might undertake reforms, failed to materialize. His subsequent thoughts were distilled in a book, completed in 1827 but published only in 1830, Essai sur la diplomatie (Essay on Diplomacy). This book, according to the historian Marian Kamil Dziewanowski, is indispensable {{to an understanding of the}} Prince's many activities conducted in Paris following the ill-fated Polish November 1830 Uprising. Czartoryski wanted to find a place for Poland in the Europe of the time. He sought to interest western Europeans in the adversities <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> stateless nation which he still considered to be an indispensable part of the European political structure.|$|E

25|$|During 1966 and 1967 {{it became}} obvious to MACV that the North Vietnamese were using neutral Cambodia {{as a part of}} their {{logistical}} system, funneling men and supplies to the southernmost seat of battle. The unknown factor was the how much use the enemy was making of Cambodia. The answer shocked even the most hardened intelligence analysts. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, desperately trying to balance the threats <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> nation, had allowed Hanoi to set up a presence in Cambodia. Although the extension of Laotian Highway 110 into Cambodia in the tri-border region was an improvement to its logistical system, North Vietnam was now unloading communist-flagged transports in the port of Sihanoukville and simply trucking its supplies to its Base Areas on the eastern border.|$|E
25|$|Eliade {{provided}} {{two distinct}} explanations {{for not having}} met with Sebastian: one was related to his claim of being followed around by the Gestapo, and the other, expressed in his diaries, was that the shame of representing a regime that humiliated Jews had made him avoid <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> former friend. Another take on the matter was advanced in 1972 by the Israeli magazine Toladot, who claimed that, as an official representative, Eliade was aware of Antonescu's agreement to implement the Final Solution in Romania and of how this could affect Sebastian (see Holocaust in Romania). In addition, rumors were sparked that Sebastian and Nina Mareş had a physical relationship, one which could {{have contributed to the}} clash between the two literary figures.|$|E
25|$|Gheorghe Asachi's own works, many {{of which}} {{date back to the}} time he spent in Rome, show the {{influence}} of Classicism. Noted for their rigorous use of artistic conventions and nature study, they are nonetheless considered inferior to both their creator's contributions to other cultural fields and the works of other many painters active in Moldavia at the time. Asachi himself is known to have sketched out works which were completed by his foreign collaborators or students (among these is a since-lost painting of Stephen the Great <b>facing</b> <b>his</b> mother, signed by the Italian artist Giani, and an 1845 painting of Moldavians in the battle of Malbork Castle). A series of Classicist drawings from {{the early decades of the}} 19th century have only tentatively been attributed to Asachi.|$|E
