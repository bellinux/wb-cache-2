40|$|Background: Traumatic {{brain injury}} {{is a common}} {{condition}} that affects millions of people every year. Many of them have balance impairments that affect them functionally, physically, and socially. The purpose of this case study was to document outcomes after strengthening and balancing interventions in a child after traumatic brain injury. Two years after sustaining an injury post a fall, a 10 year-old boy participated in a rehabilitation program {{with the goal of}} acquiring the ability to walk properly. On initial evaluation, the individual had significant weakness, impaired standing balance and gait abnormalities. Content: The boy was treated thrice a week for 6 weeks with strengthening and balancing interventions. The outcome measures were functional independence measure (FIM), berg balance scale (BBS), computer <b>dynamography</b> (CDG) for gait parameters. Conclusion: By using above mentioned protocols, we got satisfactory results which are indicated through the improved scores in following outcome measures & this proves that exercise regime which we have used in this case may be effective in improving balance, muscle strength, gait pattern & functional independence & thereby {{the quality of life of}} TBI survivors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the influence of different methods on the identification of the onset of EMG and force. Using the example of electromechanical delay (EMD), results show a rather distinct dependence of onset times of both EMG and force on the applied method and within the threshold values. However, no automatic method has been found for providing reliable and comparable results. For determination of time sensitive values such as EMD, the visual method seems to be the only advisable method regarding accuracy and reliability. This method provides the earliest onset times, lowest threshold levels and a muscle independent course of EMD related to initial muscle length. For other cases of motion analysis or motor research, with some provision for acceptable inaccuracies of about ± 20 - 30 ms, this study illustrates why the preferable method should use a moderate low-pass filter and low percentage thresholds. KEY WORDS: methods, electromechanical delay, EMG-onset, force-onset INTRODUCTION: Electromyography and <b>dynamography</b> are the only basic methods used in biomechanical motion analysis, providing information about non-visible activities and forces. E. g. lifting a leg from a horizontal position requires a force generation greater than th...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we attempt}} to answer the {{following}} question: To what degree the higher muscular activity determined by increased load in the extension phase (eccentric muscle action) of vertical jump affects its efficiency? Ten high performance acrobats participated in this investigation. The acrobats performed tests that consisted of five single “maximal ” standing vertical jumps (counter movement jump – CMJ) and five single vertical jumps, in which the task was to touch a bar placed over the jumping acrobats (special counter movement jump – SCMJ). Subsequently, they performed five single drop jumps from an elevation of 0. 40 m (DJ). Ground reaction forces were registered using the KISTLER 9182 C force platform. MVJ software was used for signal processing [1] and enabling calcula-tions of kinematic and kinetic parameters of the subject’s jumping movements (on-line system). The results obtained show that the height of jump (h), the mean power (Pmean) and the maximum power (Pmax) are statistically significant, and higher in DJ. The results prove fine adaptation of the nervous system in acrobats to muscle extension and workload, due to the 40 cm high drop jump. Presumably, this height is closest to that which acrobats experience during landing, after performing flic-flacs or round-off.
