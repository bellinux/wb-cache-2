5|$|The new {{structure}} {{is administered by}} a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment. The {{first president of the}} metropolitan council, Patrick Ollier, a Republican and the mayor of the town of Rueil-Malmaison, was elected on 22 January 2016. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million persons and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small budget; just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E
5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

5|$|The great {{rarity of}} the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce is {{explained}} by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration. 140Ce is the most common isotope of cerium, as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce is that it is a magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low cross-section towards further neutron capture. Although its proton number of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past the magic number 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long-lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.|$|E
