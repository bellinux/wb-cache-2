This {{provides a means}} of interrogating assumptions of independent yet homogeneous actions and pay-offs in <b>economic</b> <b>processes,</b> <b>a</b> particular interest of heterodox approaches to economics. Contemporary applications include modelling opinion leadership among consumers, search and matching in labour markets, collaboration in research and development, patterns of innovation diffusion among firms, and global commodity chains. This chapter introduces the central concepts and methods of social {{network analysis}}, including data collection and interpretation considerations and a brief discussion of specialized software in the field.

Bringing together a range of international contributors, the book proposes that both analyzing justice {{through the lens of}} desire, and considering desire through the lens of justice, are vital for exploring <b>economic</b> <b>processes.</b> <b>A</b> variety of approaches for capturing the complex and dynamic interplay of justice and desire in socioeconomic processes are taken up. But, acknowledging a complexity of forces and relations of power, domination, and violence – sometimes cohering and sometimes contradictory – it is the relationship between hierarchical gender arrangements, relations of exploitation, and their colonial histories that is stressed. Therefore, queer, feminist, and postcolonial perspectives intersect as Global Justice and Desire explores their capacity to contribute to more just, and more desirable, economies...|$|E

In the Lake Constance area and the Rhineland, this point is first reached in the Bronze Age, when there is no primordial forest left.

40|$|Economic theory {{deals with}} a complex reality, which may be seen through various perspectives, using {{different}} methods. Economics' three major branches [...] development economics, macroeconomics, and microeconomics [...] cannot be unified because the former two use preferentially a historical-deductive, while the later, an essentially hypothetical-deductive or aprioristic method. While Smith, Marx and Keynes used the new historical facts method to develop their major theories, Walras adopted an aprioristic one to devise the neoclassical general equilibrium model. The historical-deductive method looks for the new historical facts that condition the new economic reality, and only then develop the stylized facts or economic model that generalizes the problem. Thus, economic theory remains central, {{but it is more}} modest, or less general, as the economist is content to develop short term macroeconomic models and long term growth models in the framework of a given historical phase or moment of the <b>economic</b> <b>process.</b> <b>As</b> a trade off, his models are more realistic and conducive to more effective economic policies, as long as he is not required to previously abandon, one by one, the unrealistic assumptions required by a excessively general theory, but already starts from more realistic ones.
