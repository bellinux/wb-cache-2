40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the training effectiveness of two different flight simulators, when student pilots enrolled in a university aviation degree course were trained to fly an instrument <b>holding</b> <b>procedure.</b> A PC-based simulator and an approved instrument simulator were used to teach two experimental groups to fly a Non-directional Beacon (NDB) holding instrument procedure. Their time to reach proficiency and their flight performance in a Cessna 172 SP aircraft was compared to a control group that was trained solely in the aircraft. A Pre-flight Questionnaire was used to establish the participants' previous PC-based simulator experience and their current attitudes towards their use. Flight data was recorded to determine the participants' performance when flying the NDB holding pattern in the aircraft and the resulting flight times were used to determine the Percent Transfer and Transfer Effectiveness Ratio (TER) of the approved instrument simulator and the PC-based simulator. The Cost Benefit equation was used to determine the financial savings resulting from the use of these simulators. A Post-flight Questionnaire was used to determine the flight instructor's opinion of the participants' flight performance when flying the NDB holding pattern. The results of this study were unable to confirm {{significant differences between the two}} experimental simulator groups and the aircraft control group, however there were indications that prior training in a simulator reduced flight time to criterion and there was a small but positive Percent Transfer and TER. The Cost Benefit analysis revealed that there was generally a negative cost benefit as a result of the small TERs and the relatively close operational cost of the aircraft and simulators. The study concluded that although the transfer of training effects of the simulators were small, they were still a positive indication of what PC-based simulators and approved instrument simulators are capable of as computer technology continues to improve. The study recommended that further research using PC-based simulators to train complicated instrument procedures is required with a larger sample size...|$|E

40|$|The {{mortality}} rate from exchange transfusions even in healthy babies is real, and probably stands around 1 % in most centres (Jablonski, 1962; Kitchen, 1970). As rhesus incompatibility becomes a preventable disease, {{it seems likely}} that most other causes of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia could be managed on a multifaceted conservative approach, i. e. using phenobarbitone, phototherapy, early feeding regimens, and perhaps oral agar to interrupt the neonatal enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin (Lucey, 1971). It has recently been shown that early clamping of the cord can signifi-cantly decrease the need for exchange transfusion in the premature infant by reducing placental transfusion and consequent hyperbilirubinaemia (Saigal et al., 1972). Together these factors could make a significant reduction in the need for exchange transfusion. The category of babies in which these advances are likely to make the least impression would have findings similar to this case report. This is the fairly unusual group of babies who develop severe neonatal jaundice without it being anticipated in the antenatal period. They may thus have the added disadvantage of being born at home, or in a small hospital, where the necessary paediatric care is some distance away. It is suggested that where there is delay in obtaining compatible blood, a 'mini plasma exchange ' is a satisfactory <b>holding</b> <b>procedure.</b> Previous workers have been concerned largely with albumin priming in an effort to increase the efficiency of an exchange blood transfusion. It has recently been pointed out that albumin priming can also be useful in severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia when blood is not immediately available for an exchange transfusion (Tsao and Yu, 1972). The decision to proceed to a 'mini exchange ' rather than albumin priming depends on the Hb level. Summary A small exchange plasma transfusion of 12 ml/kg is a feasible and instantly available alternative to an exchange blood transfusion in the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia when there is delay in obtaining compatible blood. The infant must have an adequate Hb for the procedure, and a minimum level of 14 g/ 100 ml is suggested. In the case described there was no significant rebound in the serum bilirubin after the plasma exchange, unlike that commonly observed after an exchange blood transfusion...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{aircraft}} {{is the most}} used transport to travel between two very distanced places {{since it is the}} fastest way. For these last years, the demand of flights has been increasing immensely, so the airports have been also suffering the same increase in workload. Congestion is the word for the imbalance between demand and capacity. After applying a Ground Holding Program (GHP) optimization process before departure to solve this problem in a previous work [1], in this project the Air Holding Program (AHP) is presented in order to minimize the economic costs once in the landing phase. The main goal of this final degree project is to implement a basic model of AHP to minimize the delay costs near the single destination airport, Barcelona-El Prat in this case. The model of AHP is based on a dynamic stochastic GHP. The problem is solved using Gurobi libraries. Firstly, a pre-tactical phase in [1] of GHP is applied to make flights wait on ground according to capacity constraints in the Barcelona Airport. Then, once the flights are already flying towards the destination and entering the analysed area (500 km from destination airport), these flights will perform a Free Route Airspace (FRA) route in order to make them fly a straight route trajectory to possibly shorten the flight duration, which will cause that the arrival queue be again disordered making the capacity constraint again violated. In order to minimize the air delay costs, a second optimization to assign air delay is applied called AHP. Once the flights are leaving this airspace, they will be communicated their final assigned holding. Finally when they are entering the landing phase, they should first pass through the <b>holding</b> <b>procedure</b> to hold the time needed according to the delay assigned. Some of the conclusions after this research is that if capacity is reduced in destination airport, firstly a GHP can be applied before departure [1]. Then, an AHP can be applied for a second optimization purpose. If traffic is directly taken to be applied an AHP, the capacity flexibility is very reduced, while using pre-tactical regulation the capacity could be as small as desired. This outlines the advantage of using GHP and AHP together. Furthermore, although the main objective is to minimize the delay costs, if the flights are arriving earlier than scheduled in the most optimal case, the delays could be negative values, which means that costs are saved...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the gap metric approach to controller discretisation problems for continuous-time nonlinear systems with disturbances in both input and output channels.

This is shown for the case of memoryless controllers and for a more general class of controllers specified by stable, causal operators. In both cases, both regional and global results are obtained under respective local and global incremental stability assumptions on the controllers. Key words.
