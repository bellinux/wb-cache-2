5|$|As {{proposed}} in their election manifesto, in February 2003 Livingstone's administration introduced a congestion charge covering 8 square miles in central London, charging motorists £5 {{a day for}} driving through the area. It was introduced {{in an attempt to}} deter traffic and reduce congestion; Livingstone himself took the London Underground to work, and tried to inspire more Londoners to use public transport rather than cars. The policy was highly controversial, and strongly opposed by businesses, resident groups, the roads lobby, and the Labour government; many commentators recognised that if opposition resulted in the policy being abandoned then <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the end of Livingstone's political career. That year, the Political Studies Association named Livingstone 'Politician of the Year' due to his implementation of the 'bold and imaginative' scheme. The scheme resulted in a marked reduction on traffic in central London, resulting in improved bus services, and by 2007, TfL could claim that the charge had reduced congestion by 20%. To further encourage the use of public transport, in June 2003, the Oyster card system was introduced, while bus and Underground journeys were made free for people aged 11 to 18.|$|E
5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E
5|$|The power {{contest between}} the allied Military Committee and the Regionalists against the National Command was fought out {{within the party}} {{structure}}. However, the Military Committee and the Regionalists managed to turn the party structure on its head. At the 2nd Regional Congress (held in March 1965), {{it was decided to}} endorse the principle that the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command would be the ex officio head of state, and the Regional Command acquired the power to appoint the prime minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff, and the top military commanders. This change curtailed the powers of the National Command, who thenceforth had very little say in Syrian internal affairs. In response, at the 8th National Congress (April 1965) Aflaq had originally planned to launch an attack on the Military Committee and the Regionalists, but was persuaded not to by fellow National Command members – most notably by a Lebanese member, Jibran Majdalani, and a Saudi member, Ali Ghannam – because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the removal of the party's civilian leadership, as had occurred in the Iraqi Regional Branch. Because of this decision, Aflaq was voted from office as Secretary General, to be succeeded by fellow National Command member Munif al-Razzaz. Razzaz was a Syrian-born Jordanian who was not rooted enough in party politics to solve the crisis, even if under his command several joint meetings of the National and Regional Commands took place. Not longer after Aflaq's loss of office, Hafiz, the Secretary of the Regional Command, changed his allegiance to support the National Command. While Hafiz was the de jure leader of Syria (he held the offices of Regional Command secretary, Chairman of the Presidential Council, prime minister and commander-in-chief), it was Jadid, the Assistant Secretary General of the Regional Command, who was the de facto leader of Syria.|$|E

40|$|The {{problematic}} of performativity {{has recently}} produced several criticisms and {{debates about the}} status of the economic discourse. Indeed the affirmation that economist shapes the world by describing <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the subjectivist idea that each theory can in fine be 'true' and each theory can perform the social world in his specific way. This work clarifies this problematic in connecting it with the institutional theory of John Searle. We define performativity as a particular type of assignment of function. Finally, this enables us to show that performativity is limited by two kinds of factors : brut facts and social facts...|$|R

25|$|The {{constraints}} {{in their}} primitive form are rather singular, {{this was the}} reason for integrating them over test functions to obtain smeared constraints.

When the Kargil conflict started just a year after the nuclear tests, many nations desired to end it before it intensified.|$|E
25|$|Fearing that juries {{would find}} it {{impossible}} to discount an implicating confession against a codefendant who stood alongside the confessor, the Court discounted such instructions. In a subsequent case, Parker, the Court was split on the same issue where each defendant had made his own confession.

25|$|After {{the turmoil}} in 473 BC, which {{was caused by the}} {{blockage}} of an agrarian law three years before and the death of a tribune who attempted to bring to justice former consuls, there was more unrest among the Roman people. The consul Titus Quinctius became a peacemaker, unlike Appius who strongly opposed the tribunes. Titus Quinctius barely managed to calm the crowd by adopting a more conciliatory approach. He forced Appius to retreat into the Curia Hostilia. There the senators urged Appius to abandon his intransigent attitude because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> serious civil unrest. Isolated and deprived of political support, Appius was unable to do anything but permit the vote. The law, Lex Publilia Voleronis, was finally proclaimed.|$|E
