2500|$|In the 18th century, fox hunting became {{increasingly}} popular in England. The high-cantle, high-pommel design of earlier saddles became a hindrance, unsafe and uncomfortable for riders as they jumped. Due to this fact, Guérinière's saddle design {{which included a}} low pommel and cantle and allowed for more freedom of movement for both horse and rider, {{became increasingly}} popular throughout northern Europe. [...] In the early 20th century, Captain Frederico Caprilli revolutionized the <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle</b> by placing the flap at an angle that allowed a rider to achieve the forward seat necessary for jumping high fences and traveling rapidly across rugged terrain.|$|E

5000|$|The seat {{is usually}} much deeper in a {{dressage}} saddle than a <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle,</b> {{and allows the}} rider to sit comfortably and relax to best influence the horse. The stuffing of the panels is often {{kept to a minimum}} in a dressage saddle, to allow a closer feel with the horse. It often has a wider bearing surface than a <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E

50|$|Most event riders have a <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle</b> {{as well as}} a {{dressage}} saddle, {{since each}} places them in a position better-suited for its purpose. At the lower levels, however, a rider can ride all three phases without difficulty in a well-fitted <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle.</b> At the upper levels, riders usually have a saddle specifically designed for cross-country, giving them more freedom for such fences as banks and drops.|$|E
50|$|Like the All-Purpose saddle, the <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle</b> {{usually has}} three short billets. However, other styles (such as monoflap jumping saddles) have longer billets that mirror the {{dressage}} saddle, {{so that the}} rider no longer has to ride with extra bulk under the leg.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} that the rider's leg fit appropriately into the flap of the <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle</b> when the stirrups are shortened. If the knee is too far forward or back, the rider's balance will be incorrect and the saddle becomes a hindrance rather than an advantage while jumping obstacles.|$|E
50|$|Thigh roll: {{the padded}} part {{at the rear}} of the panel's sweat flap, which lies behind the rider's thigh and can give extra {{stability}} in the saddle. Very common in dressage saddles but much less so in <b>jumping</b> <b>saddles</b> as it may interfere with freedom of movement of the rider's leg.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>jumping</b> <b>saddles</b> {{have three}} billets. This not only allows the rider a spare should one break, {{but can also}} provide an {{adjustment}} option. For horses on which the saddle sits nicely, neither slipping forward or back, {{the first and third}} billets should be used. On horses where the saddle slips back, the first and second billets should be used.|$|R
5000|$|Many riders {{put their}} saddles too far forward, {{especially}} those that use <b>jumping</b> <b>saddles.</b> A properly fitting saddle will [...] "find its own place" [...] when put on over the withers, and then slid back until it will not easily slide further. Even a well-fitting saddle will cause discomfort to the horse and position problems for the rider if it is placed too far forward, creating problems that include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Dressage saddles {{have a very}} straight-cut flap, {{much longer}} than a <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle,</b> which {{accommodates}} the longer leg position of a dressage rider, who works only on the flat and {{does not need to}} jump fences. The pommel is a bit higher and the deepest point of the saddle's seat more forward, all to allow for this longer leg position.|$|E
50|$|Some designs feature {{an exaggerated}} amount of padding {{in front of}} the knee, much more than in a <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle,</b> said to assist the rider in keeping the knee down and thigh back. However, there is usually little padding behind the calf, as the rider {{needs to be able to}} freely move the lower leg to give aids to the horse.|$|E
50|$|In show jumping, {{the rider}} uses a <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle,</b> usually with a square or fitted white pad. Rules on tack are less-stringent, and most forms of {{bridling}} and bitting are allowed, {{including the use}} of gag bits, hackamores, and any type of noseband. Breastplates and open front boots are usually worn. Running martingales are also allowed, but must be used with rein stops. Standing and Irish martingales are not allowed.|$|E

5000|$|The saddle {{is usually}} a type of forward seat (<b>jumping</b> <b>saddle),</b> {{generally}} the style called [...] "close contact," [...] though [...] "eventing" [...] and [...] "all-purpose" [...] designs are seen in some areas, particularly at lower levels. Saddles are usually of brown leather, with a plain girth, usually of leather. The saddle pad should be white, and shaped to fit the saddle. Ideally, {{no more than one}} inch of pad should appear under the saddle.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "all-purpose" [...] or [...] "eventing" [...] saddle (also {{sometimes}} called a [...] "general purpose" [...] saddle) {{was developed to}} allow riders to use one saddle both over fences and on the flat. This type of saddle has a deep seat with a long, but somewhat forward flap. The flaps usually have padding under the leg, for support while jumping. The design {{is intended to be}} a compromise between the flatter [...] "close contact" [...] <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle</b> with a forward flap, and deep-seated dressage saddle with a long, straight flap.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle,</b> {{sometimes}} called a [...] "forward seat" [...] or [...] "close contact" [...] saddle, {{is designed for}} show jumping, hunt seat equitation, foxhunting, and the show jumping and cross-country phases of eventing. Its most distinctive feature is a forward-cut flap that allows for a shorter stirrup length (although not as short as racing stirrups). The flap often has supportive padded knee rolls, especially for show jumping and cross-country, less so for equitation. The balance of the seat is further back and comparatively flat, with the cantle and pommel low {{so that they do}} not interfere with the rider's jumping position (and variations known as [...] "two-point position" [...] or [...] "half-seat").|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} between the styles of English saddle are small but significant. The most important distinctions are the location and therefore {{the balance of the}} seat, and the flap length and shape. A saddle used for a discipline where the rider sits more upright with a longer leg, such as in dressage, has a flap that is longer to accommodate the leg, and less inclined forward (as the knee does not need to go forward). The seat will also be closer to the withers, to keep the rider's center of gravity in the correct spot. However, in disciplines where the rider needs shorter stirrups for better balance and security, such as in the jumping disciplines, the saddle flap is moved proportionately forward and shortened, and the seat is moved further back. A <b>jumping</b> <b>saddle</b> will have a shorter and more forward flap than a dressage saddle, with the seat slightly more towards the cantle. If the flap was not inclined forward, the rider’s knee would hang over the flap, and the flap would constantly push the leg out of position (usually backward), so that the rider would become unstable and interfere with his horse. If the seat was not moved rearward, the rider would be forced ahead of the saddle over a fence. A racing saddle, where jockeys ride with incredibly short stirrups, will have an extremely forward and short saddle flap (almost more horizontal than vertical), and the seat will be extended well back from the pommel to keep the rider’s center of gravity correctly situated.|$|E

50|$|Free jumping or loose jumping is the {{practice}} of jumping a horse without a rider. It is often conducted in a chute and is used most often to evaluate the jumping ability of horses too young to <b>jump</b> under <b>saddle.</b> The correlations between free jumping and eventual success in show jumping competition {{have been the subject}} of several studies. Free jumping is used as a diagnostic tool by most warmblood breeding societies to evaluate jumping prowess in breeding stock. This practice is used to build a horse's confidence over jumps without a rider's interference, to evaluate a horses jumping ability, or to showcase a horse that is for sale. This training method is used in a variety of ways, both professionally and recreationally. Free jumping is also done competitively, primarily with younger horses that are not old enough for a rider or just beginning their jumping career.|$|R
50|$|While free jumping {{has many}} {{benefits}} {{it can also}} cause many problems if not done properly. A horse can learn to refuse if not kept in the chute, may compensate incorrectly for bad distances, and a bad experience overall will make a horse nervous or ill-tempered to <b>jump</b> once under <b>saddle.</b> A horse can also be harmed if it is pushed too hard when it is too young or not mentally or physically ready. Free jumping {{is a form of}} training that requires an experienced rider or trainer present.|$|R
