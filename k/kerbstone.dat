25|$|Just above Coopers Bridge, the Calder and Hebble {{enters a}} lock cut through a floodgate. The route to Ramsden's Canal follows {{the main course}} of the river, passing under the bridge which carries the A62 road over the river. A large weir is {{directly}} ahead, protected by a boom, and the first lock is on the right, just above it. The lock is a grade II listed structure, dating from {{the building of the}} canal, although a dated <b>kerbstone</b> indicates that it was modified in 1899. The adjacent lock keepers cottage, which is built of hammer-dressed stone, with two storeys and a stone slate roof, dates from the early or mid 19th century, and is also a listed structure. The canal turns to the south west to run parallel to the River Colne, and passes under a railway bridge to reach the Clone Bridge Lock. Just above it is a hammer-dressed stone warehouse, dating from the 18th century, followed by an arched bridge which carries Colne Bridge Road over the canal. A datestone indicates that it was built in 1775.|$|E
500|$|In Ireland {{she is also}} {{associated}} with craggy, prominent mountains and outcroppings, such as Hag's Head (...) the southernmost tip of the Cliffs of Moher in County Clare. The megalithic tombs at Loughcrew in County Meath are situated atop Slieve na Calliagh (...) and include a <b>kerbstone</b> known as [...] "the hag's chair". Cairn T on Slieve na Calliagh is a classic passage tomb, in which the rays of the equinox sunrise shine down the passageway and illuminate an inner chamber filled with megalithic stonecarvings. Aillenacally (Aill na Caillí, [...] "Hag Cliff") is a cliff in County Galway. The passage tombs on the Cúil Iorra peninsula in County Sligo, {{are associated with the}} Cailleach (one is called the Cailleach a Bhérra's House [...] ). William Butler Yeats refers to the Sligo Cailleach as the 'Clooth na Bare'.|$|E
500|$|As the Lotus 72 {{was not as}} {{effective}} as the team hoped, it was returned to the factory to be re-built and Rindt used the old Lotus 49 for the next race in Monaco. The necessity of using tyres intended for the new design made the older car unstable. Seemingly unaffected by this, Rindt produced what his race engineer Herbie Blash called [...] "the race of his life". From eighth on the grid, he worked his way through the field on a track notorious for presenting few overtaking opportunities. In the closing stages, he was second, steadily closing the gap on leader Jack Brabham. On the final lap, on the final corner, Brabham braked too late, touched the <b>kerbstone</b> and went straight ahead into the straw bales, allowing Rindt through to take his first victory of the season. Rindt used the Lotus 49 one last time at the Belgian Grand Prix, a race at which he heavily criticised the organisers for installing guardrails that had gaps of several metres between them. He had originally started practice in the remodelled 72, but the car came to a halt early in the session with a broken lower wishbone, forcing Rindt to switch cars once more. Despite engine troubles during the rest of practice, he managed to qualify on the front row, but later retired with another engine failure.|$|E

2500|$|The sudden rise to fame {{took its}} toll on Gagarin. While acquaintances say Gagarin had been a [...] "sensible drinker", his touring {{schedule}} placed him in social situations where he was always expected to drink. Gagarin was also reportedly caught by his wife {{in a room with}} another woman, a nurse named Anna who had aided him after a boating incident earlier in the day, at a Black Sea resort in September 1961. He attempted to escape by leaving through a window and jumping off her second floor balcony, hitting his face on a <b>kerbstone</b> and leaving a permanent scar above his left eyebrow.|$|E

60|$|Her host, Lord of the Manor, Lord Lieutenant of the County, and tenth Earl of Cumberland, paused readily {{enough and}} leaned his machine against a <b>kerbstone.</b> Bicycling {{was by no}} means a {{favourite}} pursuit of his, and the morning for the time of year was warm.|$|E
50|$|Outside the tomb, {{a ring of}} <b>kerbstones</b> {{shows the}} {{original}} extent of the mound, and they also follow {{the line of the}} ditch of the earlier henge monument. Three of the stones, visible within the cairn mound, are thought to be from the stone circle of that time.|$|R
50|$|The cairn {{is a large}} {{limestone}} cairn 30 m across. It {{is surrounded}} by a low mound, and <b>kerbstones</b> are visible in several places, one of which has some interesting lines or scratches. The sides are very steep and the top is flat, indicating that it almost certainly contains a passage grave.|$|R
50|$|The area retains many {{original}} boundary walls, often in brick and flint or cast iron. Some pavements were laid with blue-brick paving slabs, {{and a few}} survive.

6000|$|But Mrs Stocks {{was of a}} more {{practical}} turn. After surveying my enemies from an upper window she had sent a neighbour's little girl for a cab. By the time this vehicle arrived, with a half-hearted [...] "Boo!" [...] of disappointment, the concourse in the street had all but melted away, and Mrs Stocks's check duster scattered the rest. The cab-door slammed, the wheels ground on the <b>kerbstone,</b> my début was over. I had been but a nine minutes' wonder.|$|E
60|$|THE NOTE TAKER. You {{see this}} {{creature}} with her <b>kerbstone</b> English: the English {{that will keep}} her in the gutter {{to the end of}} her days. Well, sir, in three months I could pass that girl off as a duchess at an ambassador's garden party. I could even get her a place as lady's maid or shop assistant, which requires better English. That's the sort of thing I do for commercial millionaires. And on the profits of it I do genuine scientific work in phonetics, and a little as a poet on Miltonic lines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chambers}} usually {{lie in a}} round cairn made {{of broken}} rocks, which either contemporaneously or later were surrounded by the eponymous platform, up to 20 metres wide at the front and from 1.0 to 1.5 metres high, and were partly enclosed by large <b>kerbstones.</b> A gentle [...] exedra is characteristic of the front face.|$|R

50|$|The cairn or tumulus {{is about}} 85 m in {{diameter}} and 15 m high, and surrounded by large <b>kerbstones,</b> {{some of which are}} decorated.

Three stone-lined passages lead into the mound from the west.|$|R
6000|$|... 'For {{some months}} after I had done crying for the flaxen-haired edition of her, my Love did not reappear. Then she came suddenly, unexpectedly, in a {{situation}} I should never have predicted. I {{was standing on the}} <b>kerbstone</b> of the pavement in Budmouth-Regis, outside the Preparatory School, looking across towards the sea, when a middle-aged gentleman on horseback, and beside him a young lady, also mounted, passed down the street. The girl turned her head, and--possibly because I was gaping at her in awkward admiration, or smiling myself--smiled at me. Having ridden a few paces, she looked round again and smiled.|$|E
60|$|He {{crossed the}} road compassionately with the tottering old grandmother, giving her his helping {{hand over the}} <b>kerbstone,</b> and {{following}} her with bated breath into the close little sick-room. Then he flung open the tiny casement with its diamond-leaded panes, so as to let in the fresh summer air, and picked a few sprigs of sweet-briar from the porch, which he joined with the geranium from his own button-hole to make a tiny nosegay for the bare bedside. After that, he sat and talked awhile gently in an undertone to pale, pretty little Nellie herself, and went away at last promising to send her some jelly and some soup immediately from the vicarage kitchen.|$|E
60|$|He {{descended into}} the street but {{for a few moments}} he found himself hopelessly lost at sea. So far as he could see there was no light nor any glimmer of one. He reached the corner of the street like a blind man, by tapping the <b>kerbstone</b> with his cane. Arrived here, he stood for a moment {{in the middle of the}} road, bareheaded. There was not a breath of wind anywhere. He made his way {{carefully}} down towards Downing Street, meeting few people, and still obliged to grope rather than walk. Along Downing Street he made his way by the railings and rang the bell at last at the Premier's house. He was shown at once into the council room. The four or five men who were seated around a table, and who looked up at his entrance, bore every one of them, household names. The Premier held out his hand.|$|E
5000|$|Kong Svends Høj {{consists}} of a large, rectangular mound covering a chamber 12.5 m in length. The mound is surrounded by <b>kerbstones,</b> which, with a height of around 1.5 m, are among the tallest recorded in a Neolithic tomb. The gable stones are almost 4 m high. The north-western façade originally had two outliers, known as [...] "horns" [...] or guard stones.|$|R
5|$|Also {{visible from}} the circle is a scatter of over thirty stones on the Westwater Allotment; these are up to 0.5m (1.6 feet) long, with two {{reported}} as being standing in 1988. Elsewhere on Withypool Common {{is a collection of}} six stones arranged in a roughly circular fashion, which may have represented another stone circle or perhaps the <b>kerbstones</b> from a since-destroyed round cairn.|$|R
50|$|Granite {{is one of}} {{the hardest}} stones, and {{requires}} such different techniques to sedimentary stones that it is virtually a separate trade. With great persistence, simple mouldings can and have been carved from granite, for example in many Cornish churches and in the city of Aberdeen. Generally, however, it is used for purposes that require its strength and durability, such as <b>kerbstones,</b> countertops, flooring, and breakwaters.|$|R
