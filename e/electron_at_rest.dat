If a body is on the Earth’s surface, however, its worldline is no longer geodesic and it is subjected to a force. The nature of that force {{is an open question}} in general relativity. This paper pursues two aims- to bring forward that question and to develop an approach toward resolving it which was initiated by Fermi in 1921. General relativity provides a consistent no-force explanation of gravitational interaction of bodies following geodesic paths.

If the entire mass of an elementary charged particle is regarded as electromagnetic in origin, a hypothesis providing a consistent explanation of inertial and gravitational phenomena emerges. Due to the anisotropy in the propagation of electromagnetic interaction in the vicinity of all (massive) objects the electric field of an <b>electron</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> on the Earth's surface is distorted which gives rise to an electric self-force trying to force the electron to move downwards (hence the passive gravitational mass turns out to be electromagnetic); the anisotropy is compensated if the electron is falling with an acceleration g [...] in this case its electric field is the Coulomb field and the electron's motion is geodesic (non-resistant) in accordance with general relativity. The behaviour of an electron in an accelerated reference frame is identical (the anisotropy in the speed of light in this case is caused by the frame's accelerated motion). This hypothesis can be experimentally tested and opens up the possibility of (at least partly) controlling inertia and gravitation. Even if one insists on the present understanding that only part of the electron mass is electromagnetic it still follows that the possibility for (partly) controlling inertia and gravitation and for an experimental test has been present since the beginning of this century when the electromagnetic mass theory was proposed. It has not been realized up to now that it immediately follows from this theory that part of the electron's active gravitational mass is electromagnetic in origin too which means that part of its gravity being caused by its charge (since part of its active gravitational mass itself is electromagnetic) is also electromagnetic in nature.
