Spring rates could now be softer at both ends of the car compared to previous models. The heavy duty suspension was no longer optional, although all models now had a front anti-roll bar as standard. Brakes were improved with finned rear drums. The remaining pickup, the Rampside, was discontinued at the end of the model year.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s ChessGenius was [...] "one {{of the first}} master-strength programs". In an article {{comparing}} ChessGenius with Fritz in February 1994 Grandmaster and computer chess expert John Nunn wrote, [...] "y own opinion is that if raw playing strength is your dominant criterion, then go for Genius". Its playing style {{has been compared to}} that of a [...] "micro-Karpov". ChessGenius, like many of Lang's programs, was famous for having an 'asymmetric evaluation function' which means that moves and sequences of moves might be scored differently depending on whether they are to be made by the program or by the opponent (which has implications for which lines are 'forward pruned' in its calculations). For example, ChessGenius might give a low score to a wild attack of its own and so not calculate it and so not initiate it, but a high score to a wild attack by the opponent and so spend time calculating the implications of such an attack by the opponent, thus making its style of play very 'safe'. At the Intel World Chess Grand Prix in London in 1994 ChessGenius achieved a rating performance for the tournament of 2795 Elo rating. From 1994 until 1998 ChessGenius remained one of the top chess programs available. In 1999 ChessGenius dropped out of the top ten on the SSDF (Swedish Chess Computer Association) rating list and it continued to slip down the list over the following decade. The programmer Richard Lang has suggested that this was because the program does not scale well to faster hardware. Portable versions (for example for Palm and the original iPhone) perform exceptionally well because ChessGenius is particularly strong in weak hardware environments. Unlike most other commercial vendors, Richard Lang explicitly forbids including the PC version of ChessGenius in chess <b>engine</b> <b>rating</b> lists, so it is difficult to gauge its strength compared to other modern programs. It has been suggested that the reason the current PC version of ChessGenius (7.2) is marketed as [...] "Classic" [...] is {{because it was the first}} ever platform for Genius engine to appear for, to distinguish it from the other versions primarily for handheld devices and not because apart from speed and efficiency enhancements, and updates to its openings book, the program has not changed dramatically since 1995.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{locomotive}} was {{powered by}} two Maybach 1035hp (D800–802) or 1135hp (D803–829, D831–832 and D866–870) MD650 engines coupled to Mekydro hydraulic transmissions. Although these diesel engines were of German Maybach design, they were physically manufactured by Bristol Siddeley at their factory at Ansty, near Coventry, under licence. The lower <b>engine</b> <b>rating</b> {{in the first}} three was because the first batch of transmissions could not accept more than this; a shortcoming swiftly rectified, although the technology of the time limited hydraulic transmissions to below [...] input, hence the need for two engines. D830 Majestic was equipped with two Paxman YJXL Ventura engines rated at [...] each as a potential showcase of an alternative British-designed engine which might prove superior to the German Maybach. The new locomotives were substantially lighter than previous diesel-electric designs: a Class 44 Peak locomotive weighed [...] and required 8 axles to carry it; the D800s weighed less than 80 tons and only needed 4 axles. D800–802 were produced as a pilot order and differed slightly both mechanically and cosmetically from the others. Aside from the obvious differences of disc versus rollerblind headcodes and the slightly less powerful engines, D800–802 were only equipped with six power controller notches, which was found to be unsatisfactory for smooth acceleration and economical running in operational use. These differences meant D800–802 were effectively a separate sub-class and could not work in multiple with the others (although the [...] "white diamond" [...] code multiple working capability of the Warships was rarely used until the late 1960s, and was removed from many locomotives as a constant source of electrical problems). In 1960 British Rail introduced the Class 43 diesel hydraulic locomotives, with a maximum tractive effort of [...] These were constructed by North British Locomotives, numbered in the range D833 to D865 and also bore names. Although of a very similar design to the Swindon-built examples, the 43s were equipped with MAN engines and Voith hydraulic transmissions at a similar power rating as the Swindon locomotives. The Maybach engines were a more sophisticated design, with advanced features such as oil-cooled pistons that the MAN design lacked. The German V200 class, upon which the D800 design was based, used Mercedes and Maybach engines – the MAN engines were not fitted in significant numbers to V200 locomotives – coupled to Mekydro and Voith transmissions in roughly equal proportions, with engines and transmissions being completely interchangeable. Thus one locomotive might have one Mercedes engine coupled to a Mekydro transmission and a Maybach coupled to a Voith. This interchangeability of engines and transmissions was theoretically a feature of the BR design as well, but was never exploited. Detail differences in the floor construction after the first few Swindon production locomotives removed the ability to exchange transmissions.|$|E
