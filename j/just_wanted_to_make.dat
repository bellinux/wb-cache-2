500|$|When asked {{during a}} press tour for 1994's Divine Intervention about the {{pressure}} of having {{to live up to}} Reign in Blood, King replied that the band did not try to better it, but rather <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> music. In 2006, Blabbermouths Don Kaye drew a comparison to the band's 2006 album Christ Illusion, and concluded that [...] "Slayer may never make an album as incendiary as Reign in Blood again." ...|$|E
500|$|Endino billed {{the band}} thirty hours of {{recording}} at $606.17. Jason Everman, a guitarist who {{was impressed by}} Nirvana's demo with Dale Crover, supplied the money. He briefly joined the group as second guitarist. Everman was credited as a guitarist on the album sleeve, and is the other guitarist {{on the cover of}} the album, even though he did not perform on the album. Bassist Krist Novoselic explained, [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him feel at home in the band." ...|$|E
500|$|Robey {{was asked}} to help organise a charity {{football}} match in 1907 by friends of the Scottish football trainer James Miller, who had died the previous year. [...] Robey compiled a team of amateur footballers from the theatrical profession and met Miller's former team Chelsea Football Club at their home ground. The match raised considerable proceeds for Miller's widow. Robey was proud of the match and joked: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that Chelsea stay in the first division." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{portion of}} Beghe's {{criticism}} of Scientology originally uploaded to YouTube by Mark Bunker was shown on Nightline {{in a piece}} about David Miscavige's niece, Jenna Miscavige Hill, and her criticism of Scientology. Beghe has turned down television appearances to speak about his experiences, stating: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the story isn’t about me. It’s not about me. It’s about helping others who are still lost in the cult, or toying {{with the idea of}} getting involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in his YouTube career, PewDiePie used rape jokes in his videos.

500|$|During {{his first}} game for the Cubs, Banks {{received}} a visit from Jackie Robinson that influenced his quiet presence in baseball. Robinson told Banks, [...] "Ernie, I'm glad to see you're up here so now just listen and learn...For years, I didn't talk and {{learned a lot about}} people". Later, when Banks felt like becoming more vocal, he discussed the issue with teammate Billy Williams, who advised him to remain quiet. Williams drew the analogy of fish that are caught once they open their mouths. Banks said, [...] "I kept my mouth shut but tried to make a difference. My whole life, I've <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> people better".|$|E

Although Chamberlin {{predicted}} that [...] "the band's going to be huge," [...] Zwan produced only one album, Mary Star of the Sea, before disbanding in 2003. Chamberlin formed his next project, Jimmy Chamberlin Complex, in 2004, and released its first studio album, Life Begins Again, in 2005. Chamberlin stated that, with the Jimmy Chamberlin Complex, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> music and not really be constrained to making a Zwan or a Pumpkins record.".

As a father myself, I'd want to be accessible to my children's problems." [...] Madonna avoided the controversy, and did {{not comment on the}} song's use as a pro-life statement. Her publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said that [...] "she [...] is singing a song, not taking a stand", adding that [...] "her philosophy is people can think what they want to think." [...] Danny Aiello, having appeared in the video as the titular [...] "Papa", recorded [...] "Papa Wants the Best for You" [...] later that year, an answer song written by Artie Schroeck from the father's point of view.|$|E
500|$|The ROM {{image of}} {{the first version of}} Shadowrun {{contains}} a much more crude script, with more sexual suggestive and violent phrases. For example, one line is changed from [...] "morgue guys" [...] to [...] "chop shop guys". The game's distributor favored the less serious version for retail release, sparking indignation and conflict among Kidd and other members of Beam's staff. Kidd recalled: [...] "Beam Software was a madhouse, a cesspit of bad karma and evil vibes. The war was reaching shooting level; old school creators who <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> good games were being crushed down by a wave of managerial bull. It was no longer a 'creative partnership' in any way; it was 'us' and 'them'. People were feeling creatively and emotionally divorced from their projects." [...] Shadowrun was ultimately completed by its deadline. Kidd credits this to the staffers abstaining from company meetings and workshops, and continually keeping management away from the designers.|$|E

500|$|Stefani {{initially}} did {{not intend}} to tour to support the album, responding [...] "What tour?" [...] to a question from MTV News in December 2004 regarding a possible tour. She later mentioned several times that she had not originally intended to tour in support of the album, referring to her [...] "illegal tour" [...] and apologizing for her breaking her promise not to tour on stage at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota on November 14 and admitting [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a record.

500|$|Before filming began, {{several of}} the main cast members were sent to a boot camp in South Africa and went through {{intensive}} and rigorous military training by former SAS and SBS soldiers. Stapleton and Winchester had more training than Birthistle, who <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure she could at least be a believable soldier. The actors were trained in several aspects including running, teamwork, and weapons. Mealing meanwhile, did not go through as much training as the other actors, but did spend mornings training with a commander for the SBS {{who is also a}} military adviser on the show. Winchester recalled, [...] "Sully and I would meet every morning at 6am. We would run to a chosen location and on the way we had to memorise street names and directions and then our trainers would say 'that car that you just passed what was the licence plate number?' Our trainers were ex-SAS guys who made us study everything in detail, for example, we learnt step by step how to enter a room in twos, then alone. At the same time, we had to be constantly aware of where our weapon was trained." ...|$|E
500|$|Critic {{and writer}} Kim Newman {{described}} Vampyrs style as {{closer to the}} experimental features such as Un chien andalou than a [...] "quickie horror film" [...] made {{after the release of}} Dracula (1931). Dreyer originally was going to film Vampyr in what he described as a [...] "heavy style" [...] but changed direction after cinematographer Maté showed him one shot that came out fuzzy and blurred. This washed out look was an effect Dreyer desired, and he had Maté shoot the film through a piece of gauze held threefeet (.9m) away from the camera to re-create this look. For other visuals in the film, Dreyer found inspiration from the fine arts. Actress Rena Mandel, who plays Gisèle, said that Dreyer showed her reproductions of paintings of Francisco Goya during filming. In Denmark, a journalist and friend of Dreyer, Henry Hellsen wrote in detail about the film and the artworks it appeared to draw on. When being asked about the intention of the film at the Berlin premiere, Dreyer replied that he [...] "had not any particular intention. I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a film different from all other films. I wanted, if you will, to break new ground for the cinema. That is all. And do you think this intention has succeeded? Yes, I have broken new ground". The filming of Vampyr was completed the middle of 1931.|$|E

500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that into your head and have that muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the day we were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E

Dev described the song as [...] "very flavorful" [...] and [...] "hot". In an interview with music blog Idolator, she talked in-depth about the conception of the song, stating, [...] "The idea behind 'In The Dark' was {{for me to make}} a sexy song. I'm a grown woman now. I've been working with The Cataracs {{for the past three years}} and I met them when I was kind of young and from a small town. I was like, dammit, I'm gonna make a sexy song! So that's what I did." [...] She explained that she wanted the song to be [...] "tasteful, yet sexual" [...] and described it as [...] "very sexy, but very musical at the same time". She said, [...] "The songs I had before, even though they were explicit to an extent, they were just fun. It was time when we <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> that sort of record, and we did. It's probably one of the sexier songs on the record, but I think it needed that!" [...] "In the Dark" [...] was recorded during a session in January 2011; it was one of the first songs to be recorded for Dev's debut album and it was eventually also recorded by Demi Lovato. It was later mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{aimed to}} {{demonstrate}} variety in the lyrics on their self-titled debut album, a fact expanded upon by James: [...] "Some songs {{are inspired by}} dreams, fantasizing, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.

[...] In regards to their second album, the band aimed for an increased sense of maturity and self-awareness, and wanted to focus less on [...] "break-ups and such things" [...] and more on [...] "longing, searching, loving, life, death, magic, lust and forgiveness," [...] according to James. [...] "We've also developed our relationships off the stage as well. This album {{was so much fun}} because it was like five best mates playing around in a studio." ...|$|E
