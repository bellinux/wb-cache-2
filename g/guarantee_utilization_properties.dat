30|$|Currently, {{however, the}} {{relationships}} between lignin chemical structures and various lignocellulose <b>utilization</b> <b>properties</b> are not fully understood, mainly due to the intricate lignin structures that show great variability among different biomass sources. In this respect, transgenic plants containing engineered lignins represent a powerful model system to investigate the effects of altered lignin structures on various lignocellulose properties.

However, few efforts have been made to systematically investigate the effects of lignin structures on lignocellulose <b>utilization</b> <b>properties</b> in grasses despite their importance as biomass feedstocks, possibly due to the limited transgenic materials with altered lignin structures available in grasses. In fact, as aforementioned, the structural organization of lignins in grasses substantially differs from those in eudicots and gymnosperm species, and therefore studies using appropriate grass model plants, such as rice, maize and Brachypodium, are essential to characterize the unique biosynthesis, structures and properties of grass lignins [3, 4, 24 – 26].|$|R

Still, obesity continues to escalate as a major health concern, and so the impact of weight-related guidelines on behaviour is unclear. The aim of this review was to examine consumer response to weight-related guidelines. A systematic literature search was performed using Medline, PsycInfo, ProQuest Central and additional searches using Google and reference lists. Of the 1, 765 articles identified, 46 relevant titles were included. Most studies examined attitudes towards content, source, tailoring and comprehension of dietary guidelines. Many respondents reported that guidelines were confusing, and that simple, clear, specific, realistic, and in some cases, tailored guidelines are required. Recognition of guidelines did not signify understanding nor did perceived credibility of a source <b>guarantee</b> <b>utilization</b> of guidelines.

However, {{our knowledge of the}} relationship between lignin structure and biomass <b>utilization</b> <b>properties</b> remains limited, especially in monocotyledonous grass species, despite their potential as biomass feedstocks.

The H-lignin-enriched rice transgenic line showed significantly enhanced biomass saccharification efficiency after alkali and acid pretreatments and even without any pretreatment, whereas the S-lignin-enriched rice transgenic line displayed enhanced saccharification efficiency after liquid hot water pretreatment. While we detected no significant differences in biomass heating values between the transgenic rice materials tested, analysis of synthetic lignins comprising only G, S or H units suggested that increased ratios of G or H units could increase the heating value of lignin-based solid biofuels.|$|R

40|$|Work {{efficiency}} cannot <b>guarantee</b> <b>utilization</b> maximization {{due to its}} {{susceptibility to}} biases toward either deployed processors P or execution time T, resulting in an imbalanced work distribution. To enhance the overall parallelization effectiveness, balancing work consisting of both computation and communication is critical to equitably optimize both P and T and therefore satisfy the needs of both the user and the resource manager. A "BUCH" measure is introduced to include P-T balancing, maximizing utilization of computations, and communication hiding as important components of truly effective parallelization. PRAM reduction, flawed by the imbalance of O(lg n) for T and O(n/(lg n)) for P, is clearly biased towards minimizing T {{at the expense of}} P and it also completely ignores communication. A new reduction technique called "BUCH-R" conforming to BUCH measure requirements is developed to produce effective schedules, assuming communication costs are bounded by the uniform computation cost. BUCH-R balances work distribution to achieve O(√n) for both P and T. By minimizing communications and overlapping them with computations, BUCH-R completely hides communication to eliminate all delays. Comparative analyses show and experimental data further buttress that PRAM utilization asymptotically decreases to 1 / 2 as n increases, while BUCH-R utilization asymptotically increases to approach the optimal theoretical bound of 1. Consequently, the validation of truly effective balanced parallel reduction achieving an appropriate compromise between user and resource manager needs via BUCH-R is complete. This makes a case for the recognition of BUCH-R as a new theoretical benchmark for effective parallel reduction...|$|R

Unfortunately, {{because of the nature of}} the algorithms employed within this compression standard and due to the inherent limitations of the radio environment, H. 263 coded video performs poorly when employed over bandwidth-limited, error-prone wireless channels. In this paper we propose an intuitive, low-complexity, pre-compression scheme that improves the performance of H. 263 coded video over radio channels. In our scheme video frames are spatially segmented into regions of different perceptual importance before being compressed independently with the H. 263 encoder. This allows us to apply unequal error protection and prioritized transmission to achieve at least a minimum temporal resolution at the receiver. Additionally, with this technique, both spatial and temporal error propagation is limited and through intra-frame statistical multiplexing the reserved transmission bandwidth is utilized optimally.

This work improves the bandwidth utilization of Bluetooth scatternets by providing a new interpiconet scheduling scheme. This paper mainly proposes a centralized algorithm to improve the bandwidth utilization for the on-demand QoS routing protocol. The centralized algorithm incurs the scalability problem.
