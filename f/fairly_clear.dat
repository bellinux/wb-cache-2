5|$|Although the {{relevant}} words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems <b>fairly</b> <b>clear</b> that Völundr {{is described as}} one of the elves in Völundarkviða. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.|$|E

25|$|Active S cyclin-CDK {{complexes}} phosphorylate {{proteins that}} make up the pre-replication complexes assembled during G1 phase on DNA replication origins. The phosphorylation serves two purposes: to activate each already-assembled pre-replication complex, and to prevent new complexes from forming. This ensures that every portion of the cell's genome will be replicated once and only once. The reason for prevention of gaps in replication is <b>fairly</b> <b>clear,</b> because daughter cells that are missing all or part of crucial genes will die. However, for reasons related to gene copy number effects, possession of extra copies of certain genes is also deleterious to the daughter cells.|$|E

For some years, the Taipings {{gradually}} advanced eastwards, but eventually they came close enough to Shanghai to alarm the European inhabitants. A militia of Europeans and Asians was raised for the defence {{of the city and}} placed under the command of an American, Frederick Townsend Ward, and occupied the country to the west of Shanghai. The British arrived at a crucial time. Staveley decided to clear the rebels within [...] of Shanghai in cooperation with Ward and a small French force.

Despite its shared characteristics with the Ms. M.383, there are important differences, {{not the least of which}} is the vastly different order of the information. This is the longest and most comprehensive of the four manuscripts of Fior di Battaglia. This manuscript is typically referred to as the 'Getty version'.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{location}} of the Chera capital has been subject to some speculation. The Chera capital has been called, 'Vanchi' and 'Karur' in several works. This has led to several theories identifying the Chera capital in places named Karur in both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. However, it is <b>fairly</b> <b>clear</b> that the capital was near the famous port known as Muziris, now identified to be near modern-day Kodungallur. Pliny refers to Muziris as the Chera capital, while {{the author of the}} Periplus identifies the capital to be a couple of miles away {{from the mouth of the}} river at Muziris. Ptolemy who identifies the capital as 'Karoura' gives a geographical location that is very close to Muziris as well. The capital of the Cheras and the port of Muziris were very close and almost indistinguishable.|$|E
25|$|Many {{attempts}} were made to find a salt water exit west from Hudson Bay, but the Fury and Hecla Strait in the far north is blocked by ice. The eastern entrance and main axis of the northwest passage, the Parry Channel, was found in 1819. The approach from the west through Bering Strait is impractical because of the need to sail around ice near Point Barrow. East of Point Barrow the coast is <b>fairly</b> <b>clear</b> in summer. This area was mapped in pieces from overland in 1821–1839. This leaves the large rectangle north of the coast, south of Parry Channel and east of Baffin Island. This area was mostly mapped in 1848–1854 by ships looking for Franklin's lost expedition. The first crossing was made by Amundsen in 1903–1905. He used a small ship and hugged the coast.|$|E

There was his ship, too, well freighted {{with a hundred}} things, all of which would {{contribute}} to the comfort and well-being of the colonists! It was {{a moment when the}} governor's heart was overflowing with gratitude, and could he then have taken Bridget and his children in his arms, the cup of happiness would have been full. Bridget was not forgotten, however, for in less than half an hour after the ship was secured Betts sailed in the Neshamony, for the Peak; he was to carry over the joyful tidings, and to bring the 'governor's lady' to the Reef. Ere the sun set, or about that time, his return might be expected, the Neshamony making the trip in much less time than one of the smaller boats. It was not necessary, however, for Betts to go so far, for when he had <b>fairly</b> <b>cleared</b> Cape South, and was in the strait, he fell in with the Abraham, bound over to the Reef. It appeared that some signs of the hostile canoes had been seen from the Peak, as Waally was crossing from Rancocus Island, and, after a council, it had been decided to send the Abraham across, to notify the people on the Reef of the impending danger, and to aid in repelling the enemy. Bridget and Martha had both come in the schooner; the first, to look after the many valuables he had left at the 'governor's house,' on the Summit, and the last, as her companion.|$|R
25|$|Through the {{intelligence}} interception service, Rommel had a <b>fairly</b> <b>clear</b> {{picture of the}} British situation, including their losses, problems and the new orders issued by Beresford-Peirse. Rommel was concerned for the forces at Halfaya Pass, which were trapped by the 22nd Guards Brigade {{on one side and}} the 11th Infantry Brigade on the other and running low on supplies. His plan was to have the 5th Light Division, which by midnight had almost fully reached Sidi Azeiz, drive south towards Sidi Omar and then east towards Sidi Suleiman and then north-east to Halfaya Pass, approaching the 11th Infantry Brigade from the rear. To prevent the re-deployment of Matildas, either to reinforce the 7th Armoured Brigade as Beresford-Peirse planned or to assist the British forces at Halfaya, Neumann-Silkow was ordered to attack Capuzzo. He ordered the attacks to begin while still dark, as the British intended to start their operations shortly after dawn.|$|E
25|$|The king, Shalmaneser III, {{stands before}} four divine emblems: (1) the winged disk, {{the symbol of}} the god Ashur, or, as some hold, of Shamash; (2) the six-pointed star of Ishtar, goddess of the morning and evening star; (3) the crown of the sky-god Anu, in this {{instance}} with three horns, in profile; (4) the disk and crescent of the god Sin as the new and the full moon. On his collar the king wears as amulets (1) the fork, {{the symbol of the}} weather-god, Adad; (2) a segment of a circle, of uncertain meaning; (3) an eight-pointed star in a disk, here probably the symbol of Shamash, the sun-god; (4) a winged disk, again of the god Ashur. The gesture of the right hand has been much discussed and variously interpreted, either {{as the end of the}} action of throwing a kiss as an act of worship, or as resulting from cracking the fingers with the thumb, as a ritual act which is attributed to the Assyrians by later Greek writers, or as being simply a gesture of authority suitable to the king, with no reference to a particular religious significance. It seems <b>fairly</b> <b>clear</b> that the gesture is described in the phrase 'uban damiqti taraṣu', 'to stretch out a favourable finger', a blessing which corresponds to the reverse action, in which the index finger is not stretched out.

5000|$|As other countries, {{especially}} Mexico and Cuba, {{developed their}} own radio broadcasting services, the need arose to standardize engineering practices, reduce interference, and more <b>fairly</b> distribute <b>clear</b> channel assignments.

A key objective for the United States was that, in exchange for receiving clear channel assignments, Mexico would eliminate the high-powered English-language [...] "border blaster" [...] stations that had been directing their programming toward the U.S. and causing significant interference to U.S. and Canadian stations. However, an initial international meeting held in Mexico City in the summer of 1933 failed, primarily {{due to a lack of}} agreement over how many clear channel frequencies would be assigned to Mexico.|$|R

500|$|In {{negotiations}} with the Iroquois, Bellomont overlooked some of the social elements that Iroquois customs demanded, {{with the result that}} the parties ended with differing views of how successful their councils were.

He promised them the construction of a fort at Onondaga, and even convinced the legislature to appropriate £1,000 for its construction, but the Iroquois were evasive on accepting this [...] "gift", and never showed English engineers suitable locations for a fort. Bellomont's attempts to prevent the Iroquois from dealing with the French were negated by the French military successes of 1700, which brought the Iroquois to a peace council that resulted in the 1701 Great Peace of Montreal.|$|E

Some noted that every Southern AP voter had voted for Notre Dame, which had yet to integrate, whereas three of Michigan's star players (Bob Mann, Gene Derricotte, and Len Ford) were African-American. The Southern schools refused even to schedule games against schools that played African-American players.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{concept of}} wetted cross-section, wetted perimeter and hydraulic radius seems <b>fairly</b> simple and <b>clear,</b> {{especially in the}} case of smooth boundaries of the flow. However, for the rough boundary surface covered with randomly arranged roughness the definition of the wetted cross-section as a normal to all elementary streams becomes notably problematic. More controversial seems the concept of wetted perimeter. This issue is of particular importance for the beds with high-dimensional roughness for which the geometric dimensions of the flow and the roughness elements are of the same order. The article shows that topological features of the boundary surfaces for the natural channels allow definitely refer them to fractals. Further study of the bed roughness based on its fractal nature can form a new approach to methodological soundness of main hydraulic parameters and open up new opportunities for their description...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Information {{extraction}} from unstructured text {{data has}} been used es-sentially to provide new insights by collecting, storing, and analyzing text data in textual analysis. The research on event extraction has been recently getting more attention in information extraction area since lots of events happens and significantly affect our societies and countries. Related studies on event extrac-tion use rules for identifying and extracting events from texts so far. However, rule based approaches have a limitation in terms of accuracy and rule construc-tion. In this paper, we present an event extraction system which {{takes advantage of the}} machine learning method, especially SSVM. The system extracts event triggers and predefined event arguments, while existing rule based systems ex-tract unknown event arguments. Ours provides 60. 23 F 1 score, which is higher than that of previous researches, in which rule based event extractions were per-formed. Even though rule-based and machine learning-based approaches cannot be compared against each other completely <b>fairly,</b> what is <b>clear</b> is that for the task in which event arguments are defined in advance, applying machine learn-ing method can make better results...|$|R
