25|$|The People's State Bank {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1926 {{when the two of}} the three state banks in Orangeville merged. The area had enjoyed success as a commercial hub in the years preceding the bank's construction. In 1928, just before the onset of the Great Depression, Illinois State Highway 74 (later Illinois Route 26) was rerouted through the eastern part of Orangeville, bypassing the downtown business district. Though the district no longer had a major thoroughfare passing through it many of the business were able to survive, at least initially. By 1928 the decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>community</b> of Orangeville was evident; the bypass, coupled with the depression continued to negatively affect the village. In 1932 the People's State Bank, the last open bank in Orangeville, closed its doors.|$|E

Visiting Charles Davenport's laboratory, he became convinced that American liberal eugenicism was a viable model for Romania. Also a Rockefeller scholar, Veturia followed her husband to America. She became an enthusiast of social work and interventionism, and later an outspoken conservative feminist.
