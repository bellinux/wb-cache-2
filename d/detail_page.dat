40|$|Abstract. A novel {{approach}} is proposed to automatically extract data records from <b>detail</b> <b>pages</b> using hierarchical clustering techniques. The approach uses the information of the listing pages {{to identify the}} content blocks in <b>detail</b> <b>pages,</b> which narrows the scopes of Web data extraction. Meanwhile, it also makes full use of the structure and content features to cluster content feature vectors. Finally, it aligns data elements of multiple <b>details</b> <b>pages</b> to extract the data records. Experiment results on test beds of real web pages show that the approach can achieve high extraction accuracy and outperforms the existing techniques substantially...|$|R

When a buyer views an item <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> and clicks “buy”, the buyer is automatically redirected to the sellerʼs PayPal and is then able to submit payment. Buyers can submit payment using their own PayPal account or via credit card. The buyer receives a receipt generated from PayPal and also a confirmation from Pricefalls that the item has been successfully purchased.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} link buyers {{directly}} to a sellerʼs payment gateway, the PayPal Id (email associated with the sellerʼs PayPal account) is imputed into the payment method field upon listing. This is done in both individual listings and bulk listings. In a bulk listing, all items are placed under one payment gateway, whereas in individual listings, payment options are done on a per item basis. Stores select their “Viable payment options” upon setup. The form of payment that a store accepts is displayed on the store page under the “Policies” tab {{as well as in}} every item <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> under the “Payment Methods” tab.|$|E
30|$|A <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> is a {{page with}} only one major image/video {{and a list of}} {{detailed}} description text such as title, uploader, and tags around it. A <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> can be considered as a crawling target page, which is our final crawling destination. An example <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> is shown in Figure 2.|$|E
3000|$|Our {{motivation}} while crawling {{is to be}} able {{to assess}} the importance of each outlink or <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> link before we actually retrieve that <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> given a list page and a crawling topic. For the case of Figure 3, suppose that we are going to crawl for the topic flowers, then we would intuitively rank the first <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> link, which links to a real flower, higher than the second <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> link, which links to a walking girl and happened to be also tagged as [...] "flower." [...] The only information available for us to use is the photo thumbnails and the photo uploaders such as [...] "U-EET" [...] and [...] "haggard 37." [...] Processing the content photo thumbnails to recognize which one is more conceptually related to the concept of real flowers poses a challenging task. Hence, we will explore the photo uploader information to differentiate between different concepts. Luckily, most social media-sharing websites keep track of each member's profile. As shown in Figure 3, a member's profile contains the member's collections, sets, tags, archives, and so forth. If we process all this information first, we can have a preliminary estimate of which type of photos the member would mainly upload and maintain. We can then selectively follow the <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> links based on the corresponding uploader profiles extracted.|$|E

30|$|The GeoNetwork portal website is a Spring MVC application. The {{changes for}} {{accommodating}} the COBWEB portal included a complete re-design, template changes, adding of new templates, controller changes, {{and the introduction}} of an AngularJS and Bootstrap modules. As at the time, GeoNetwork did not have a metadata <b>detail</b> <b>page,</b> and as {{this was one of the}} requirements for presenting the surveys, this functionality was implemented. An interesting feature is that the <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> was implemented to use the fields available through the “q” service, the Lucene-based search engine. As a consequence no additional request have to be made in order to get the metadata details, and the q-schema is always similar for each type of metadata. The <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> also provides some additional information, such as the relation to other metadata, and a link is provided to request the full metadata.|$|E
30|$|We can {{see that}} in both cases, the <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> capture ratio is higher for the profile-based focused crawler than for the purely OPIC-based crawler.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{potential}} impact of e-commerce soft-ware packages on the diffusion of markup for structured data on the Web. We argue that such an analysis must focus on the product <b>detail</b> <b>pages,</b> i. e. the “deep links ” to individual items, rather than the pure number of shop sites, for assessing the potential. Based on (1) a systematic analysis of the popularity of 56 software packages for e-commerce sites among the Alexa list of the one mil-lion most popular Web sites, we (2) estimate the number of product <b>detail</b> <b>pages</b> for the respective shops and then (3) project the potential lever of each e-commerce package for the adoption of structured markup, assumed that adding support for structured data can be made a readily available feature of a respec-tive software. Our results indicate that by adding a structured markup compo-nent to as little as seven popular e-commerce systems, we could instantly de-ploy structured data markup on nearly 90 % of the product <b>detail</b> <b>pages</b> among the one million most popular Web sites...|$|R
3000|$|In Algorithm 3, lines (4)–(14) do {{the actual}} {{crawling}} work. The page classifier described in Section 4 {{is used in}} line (6) to decide whether a page is a list page or a <b>detail</b> <b>page.</b> We already know that in social media-sharing websites, list pages have outlinks to detail pages and profile pages, and we name such links <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> links and profile page links, respectively. It is usually easy to differentiate them because in the DOM tree structure, <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> links generally have image thumbnails as their children, while profile page links have text nodes, which are usually the uploader names, as their children. Combined with our path string method, we can efficiently identify such outlinks. In lines (11)-(12), by not following profile page links, we save {{a significant amount of}} effort and storage space. Since we are not following profile page links, the classification result for page [...]...|$|E

The {{difference}} is that, {{since we are}} not pruning profile page links in lines (13)-(14) and we follow them to get the user profile information, we will encounter the profile page branch in the classification result for line (6), as shown in lines (17)-(18). Another {{difference is}} how we handle <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> links, as shown in lines (10)–(12). In this stage, we check whether a <b>detail</b> <b>page</b> link's user profile rank according to the crawling topic. If the rank is higher than a preset threshold, [...]...|$|E

30|$|Noting {{that the}} same types of pages have the same perceptual groups and further the same path strings, we can use whether a page {{contains}} a certain set of path strings to decide whether this page belongs to a certain type of pages. For example, as we already know that all list pages contain the path string that corresponds to uploader names, and almost all <b>detail</b> <b>pages</b> contain the path string that corresponds to tags, we can then use these two different types of path strings to identify list <b>pages</b> and <b>detail</b> <b>pages.</b> Algorithm 2 gives the procedure of extracting characteristic path strings for pages of a given type.|$|R
