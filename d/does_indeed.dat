5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E
5|$|While {{the stars}} are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies {{throughout}} the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices {{a bit like a}} pendulum, slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> face the summer solstice. For more information see History of solar observation.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Madlax and Margaret {{meet and}} {{embark on a}} search for Quanzitta Marison, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who {{supposedly}} knows about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant's leader Friday Monday possesses supernatural powers connected to the three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.|$|E

5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{evidence}} that the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley traded with the region. This is demonstrated by clay seals found at Ur III and in the Persian Gulf. In addition, if the land of Meluhha <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> refer to the Indus Valley, then there are extensive trade records ranging from the Akkadian Empire until the Babylonian Dynasty I.|$|E
25|$|Although power-law {{relations}} are attractive for many theoretical reasons, demonstrating that data <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> follow a power-law relation {{requires more than}} simply fitting a particular model to the data. This is important for understanding the mechanism that {{gives rise to the}} distribution: superficially similar distributions may arise for significantly different reasons, and different models yield different predictions, such as extrapolation.|$|E

25|$|If Risky Corp <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> default after, say, one year, {{then the}} hedge fund will have paid $500,000 to AAA-Bank, but then {{receives}} $10million (assuming zero recovery rate, and that AAA-Bank has the liquidity {{to cover the}} loss), thereby making a profit. AAA-Bank, and its investors, will incur a $9.5million loss minus recovery unless the bank has somehow offset the position before the default.|$|E
25|$|The writer (or writers) is {{possibly}} Greek. He <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> use the Hebrew words Naas and Caulacau, but these words had already {{passed into the}} common Gnostic vocabulary so as to become known to many unacquainted with Hebrew. He shows a great knowledge of the religious mysteries of various nations. For instance, he dilates much on the Phrygian rites, and the whole section {{seems to be a}} commentary on a hymn to the Phrygian Attis.|$|E
25|$|On July 6, 1895, Le Siècle rival, La France, refined {{the puzzle}} {{so that it}} was almost a modern Sudoku. It {{simplified}} the 9×9 magic square puzzle so that each row, column, and broken diagonals contained only the numbers 1–9, but did not mark the subsquares. Although they are unmarked, each 3×3 subsquare <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> comprise the numbers 1–9 and the additional constraint on the broken diagonals leads to only one solution.|$|E

25|$|When Tankado <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> die in Seville, of {{what appears}} to be a heart attack, Strathmore asks David Becker (Susan's fiancé) to travel to Seville and recover a ring that Tankado was wearing when he died. The ring is {{suspected}} to have the code that unlocks Digital Fortress. However, Becker soon discovers that Tankado gave the ring away just before his death. Each person he questions in the search for the ring is murdered by Hulohot, a mysterious deaf assassin.|$|E
25|$|Koester adds insight when he {{concluded}} that Thomas did not evolve from the editing of Synoptic parables but from an independent oral source. From “careful analysis of {{the parable of the}} Sower in the Synoptics and Thomas, John Homan concludes not only that the version in Thomas is independent, but that it <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> permit us to recover {{an earlier version of this}} parable.” These examples provide evidence that Crossan’s theory may be accurate when he discusses an early dating of Thomas and the independent oral source.|$|E
25|$|Rüstow and Köchly, {{writing in}} the 19th century, {{believed}} that Pelopidas led the Sacred Band out from the column to attack the Spartans in the flank. Hans Delbrück considered {{this to be a}} mere misreading of Plutarch. Plutarch <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> describe Pelopidas leading the Band and catching the Spartans in disorder, but there is nothing in his account that conveys anything other than the Sacred Band being the head of the column, and the Spartans were disordered not because they were taken in the flank but because they were caught in mid-maneuver, extending their line.|$|E

25|$|Williams's {{objection}} {{has turned}} out to be valid: Modern studies of demography in natural environments demonstrate that senescence <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> make a substantial contribution to the death rate in nature. These observations cast doubt on Medawar's theory. Another problem with Medawar's theory became apparent in the late 1990s, when genomic analysis became widely available. It turns out that the genes that cause ageing are not random mutations; rather, these genes form tight-knit families that have been around as long as eukaryotic life. Baker's yeast, worms, fruit flies, and mice all share some of the same ageing genes.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, Al-Khalili {{presented}} a Horizon special on BBC 2, which examined the latest scientific {{developments in the}} quest to discover the Higgs Boson, with preliminary results from the Large Hadron Collider experiment at CERN suggesting that the elusive particle <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> exist. In October that same year, he started presenting The Life Scientific on BBC Radio Four, a programme in which celebrated living scientists are interviewed; the first was Sir Paul Nurse. He has since interviewed a series of notable scientists, including Richard Dawkins, James Lovelock, Steven Pinker, Martin Rees, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, Mark Walport and Tim Hunt.|$|E
25|$|Within the Operations Department of Directorate S, {{there is}} the elite Special Operations Group called Zaslon. Formerly in PGU KGB SSSR called Vympel (e.g. French counterpart; Division Action). However, mere {{existence}} of such group within SVR is denied by Russian authorities. Nevertheless, there were some rumors that such group <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> exist and is assigned to execute very special operations abroad primarily for protection of Russian embassy personnel and internal investigations. It is believed that the group is deep undercover and consists of approximately 300-500 highly experienced operatives speaking several languages and having extensive record of operations while serving in other secret units of the Russian military.|$|E

25|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Keller group in Switzerland that {{particle}} tunneling <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> occur in zero real time. Their tests involved tunneling electrons, where the group argued a relativistic prediction for tunneling time should be 500-600 attoseconds (an attosecond is one quintillionth (1018) of a second). All that could be measured was 24 attoseconds, which is the limit of the test accuracy. Again, though, other physicists believe that tunneling experiments in which particles appear to spend anomalously short times inside the barrier are in fact fully compatible with relativity, although there is disagreement about whether the explanation involves reshaping of the wave packet or other effects.|$|E
25|$|Medawar's {{theory was}} further {{developed}} by George C. Williams in 1957, who noted that senescence may be causing many deaths, even if animals are not 'dying of old age.' In the earliest stages of senescence, an animal may lose {{a bit of}} its speed, and then predators will seize it first, while younger animals flee successfully. Or its immune system may decline, and it becomes the first to die of a new infection. Nature is such a competitive place, said Williams, (turning Medawar's argument back at him), that {{even a little bit}} of senescence can be fatal; hence natural selection <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> care; ageing isn't cost-free.|$|E
25|$|States have a {{right to}} say no to retail FDI within their jurisdiction. States have the right to add {{restrictions}} to the retail policy announced before they implement them. Thus, they can place limits on number, market share, style, diversity, homogeneity and other factors to suit their cultural preferences. Finally, in future, states can always introduce regulations and India can change the law to ensure the benefits of retail reforms reach the poorest and weakest segments of Indian society, free and fair retail competition <b>does</b> <b>indeed</b> lead to sharply lower inflation than current levels, small farmers get better prices, jobs created by organised retail pay well, and healthier food becomes available to more households.|$|E
