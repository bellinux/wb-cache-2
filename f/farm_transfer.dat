40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the issue of intergenerational <b>farm</b> <b>transfer.</b> The <b>farm</b> <b>transfer</b> process is {{influenced}} by many factors. The type of farming or farm size is important, but perhaps more so is the type of ownership; business type or family system; family farm or corporate farm, conjugal or stem family system. Such institutional factors including the taxation system, inheritance customs, and the pension system form the <b>farm</b> <b>transfer</b> system. The current <b>farm</b> <b>transfer</b> system in Japan is a stem family system. Japanese agriculture has been struggling to reform such traditional systems. The basic idea should not be the change from the stem family but to expand the range of <b>farm</b> <b>transfer</b> systems to include both the stem family system and new types. One new <b>farm</b> <b>transfer</b> system is farm succession by an unrelated party of the farm family. There are two ways to do this. One is the foundation of a new farm and another is to use the corporate farm system. In general, corporate farms can accept beginning farmers as employees or regular members (shareholders). But most of corporate farms are organized as farmers' groups on the principle of equality. New farmers are required to invest equal amounts of capital and hold farmland to obtain regular membership. In order to overcome these obstacles, a corporate farm has to change from a farmers' group to a company with greater entrepreneurial skills. Policies should encourage corporate farms to change their business plans and organization. On the other hand, policies should try to establish modern corporate farms that can co-exist with traditional ones because creating new systems is easier that transforming old ones...|$|E

Data from the Survey of U. S. Farm Women conducted in 2001 by Penn State in collaboration with researchers at the Economic Research Service and in collaboration with NASS are used to examine the multiple work roles of farm women off the farm and in farming. Descriptive statistics for the results of the 2001 survey are compared to those from the last major survey of U. S. farm women conducted by Rosenfeld in 1980. Then, using data limited to farm couples, models of job choice considering jointness in participation are estimated and tested under conditions of presence or absence of children, followed by estimation of models of on-farm decision-making using a household bargaining approach. Of particular interest is the effect of the >path= of intergenerational <b>farm</b> <b>transfer</b> (i. e., if inherited or purchased through her family or through her spouse=s/partner=s family) on job choice and farm decision-making. Results show that the work decisions of farm couples are correlated, both when children are present and when they are not.

In the European Union (EU), farm retirement is encouraged by early retirement provisions for farmers.

This paper analyses the timing of early retirement decisions of farming couples using duration analysis and different exit channels. The empirical analysis is based on Finnish farm-level panel data for the period 1993 - 1998.

40|$|Farm {{succession}} and inheritance {{is increasingly}} considered a complex phenomenon {{which not only}} affects core dimensions of farm family life but also the agricultural sector more widely. Intergenerational <b>farm</b> <b>transfer</b> in particular is increasingly viewed as fundamental to the sustainability and development of global agriculture. In the majority of EU countries, {{the average age of}} farmers is increasing, while the number of farmers under 40 years of age is decreasing. There is growing concern that this demographic trend may have negative impacts on the agricultural industry because it is younger and not older farmers who are associated with more efficient and effective production practices. The question of what motivates decisions to transfer farms is a complex one, and research to date has not apparently enlightened agricultural policy to the extent that current trends towards an ageing farm population are being managed. This research aims to investigate economic and financial aspects of the policy drivers of farm succession and inheritance in Ireland to understand what it is about the policy environment that is failing to stimulate higher levels of <b>farm</b> <b>transfer.</b> It draws on the Teagasc National Farm Survey data which provides Irish data to the Farm Accountancy Data Network in the European Commission. A hypothetical microsimulation model is used to investigate economic factors of farm transfers, with scenarios created to test these factors and their impacts on the transfer process. The Net Present Value (NPV) of income streams for farmers and their successors are calculated to assess which scenarios have the highest/lowest financial effects.
