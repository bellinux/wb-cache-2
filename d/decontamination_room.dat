40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the capability of}} accident and emergency (AandE) departments in six health regions of England to safely decontaminate casualties exposed to hazardous chemicals. METHODS: In January 1999 a postal questionnaire {{was sent to the}} clinical director of all AandE departments in Trent, North and South Thames, South and West, North West and, Anglia and Oxford Health Regions. The questionnaire inquired about characteristics of the department, decontamination facilities and equipment, and staff training. Nonresponders were sent a second questionnaire and contacted by telephone if they failed to respond to the second mailing. RESULTS: 308 of 326 departments identified (94 %) returned a questionnaire. There {{was no significant difference in}} response rate by region (p = 0. 99). Analysis was restricted to 154 major departments seeing more than 20000 new attendances per year. Of these 154 departments, 109 (71 %) had a written chemical incident plan but only 55 (36 %) maintained a list of nearby industrial chemical sites. Fifty nine departments (38 %) stated that members of staff had received training in the management of chemically contaminated casualties in the preceding year. Eighteen departments (12 %) possessed the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for decontamination by the Ambulance Services Association. Ninety six departments (62 %) had a designated <b>decontamination</b> <b>room</b> but only seven (7 %) of them incorporated all the features generally considered necessary for safe decontamination. Forty one units (27 %) had the capability to decontaminate casualties outside of the department either with warm water from a shower attachment or with a mobile decontamination unit. Thirty six departments (23 %) had neither a <b>decontamination</b> <b>room</b> nor the ability to decontaminate casualties outside the department. Only 16 units (10 %) had both adequate PPE and either a <b>decontamination</b> <b>room</b> or the capability to decontaminate outside the department. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified deficiencies in the current NHS capability to respond to chemical incidents. To resolve this, nationally recognised standards for decontamination facilities, equipment and training should be formulated, agreed and implemented...|$|E
40|$|A {{cyclotron}} {{facility has}} been recently {{installed at the}} Laboratory of Applied Nuclear Energy (L. E. N. A.) [1] of the University of Pavia {{for the production of}} radioisotopes for medical use. L. E. N. A. is a laboratory where a TRIGA MARK II research nuclear reactor [2] is used for several scientific applications since 1965. The accelerator is an IBA CYCLONE 18 / 9 [3] with fixed energy of 18 MeV for protons and 9 MeV for deuterons equipped with three targets (two of which for 18 F production and one for 13 N-Ammonia) with the possibility of extension to eight targets. The site also includes a radiochemical laboratory for radioisotope packaging and delivery in shielded cases. The cyclotron building is separated from the reactor one with a stand-alone system for area radiation monitoring and other safety systems. Present applications are dedicated to radioisotopes production for PET medical centres. In the future this facility will offer the opportunity of the installation of an external beam line {{for a wide range of}} applications (e. g., radiobiological research). Since the cyclotron is installed in a university laboratory this can also be used as a training facility for particle accelerator courses.

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the physical area of rooms in dental surgeries that decontaminate instruments within and outwith the treatment area respectively, and other factors relating to practice layout and ventilation. Data were collected by interview and observation of dental healthcare workers in dental practice in Scotland, UK. Room layouts were recorded and measured at floor, benchtop and above benchtop heights. Thirteen surgeries with instrument decontamination processes occurring in the treatment area and seven surgeries with instrument decontamination outwith the treatment area were selected at random for detailed analysis of room dimensions. Of the 179 dental surgeries surveyed, 55 % were located in converted residential premises and most practitioners (91 %) did not share premises with other healthcare providers. The median number of rooms in the practices was 8 (range: 2 – 21) and the median number of surgeries present was 3 (range: 1 – 6). Regardless of whether instrument decontamination facilities were housed within the treatment area or not, the average treatment area room size for both was 15. 8 m 2 (range: 7. 3 – 23. 9) (P = 0. 862), with 20 % of the room area available as work surfaces. The median size of the seven instrument <b>decontamination</b> <b>rooms</b> (local <b>decontamination</b> units) was 7. 6 m 2 (range: 2. 9 – 16. 0), with, on average, 63 % of the room used for work surfaces.

40|$|In recent years, {{the world}} has been rocked {{repeatedly}} by terrorist attacks. Arguably, the most remarkable were: the series of four coordinated suicide plane attacks on September 11, 2001 on buildings in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, USA; and the recent series of two coordinated attacks in Brussels (Belgium), on March 22, 2016, involving two bombings at the departure hall of Brussels International Airport and a bombing at Maalbeek Metro Station located near the European Commission headquarters in the center of Brussels. This statement paper deals with different aspects of hospital policy and disaster response planning that interface with terrorism. Research shows that the availability of necessary equipment and facilities (eg, personal protective clothing, <b>decontamination</b> <b>rooms,</b> antidotes, and anti-viral drugs) in hospitals clearly is insufficient. Emergency teams are insufficiently prepared: adequate and repetitive training remain necessary. Unfortunately, there are many examples of health care workers and physicians or hospitals being targeted in both political or religious conflicts and wars. Many health workers were kidnapped and/or killed by insurgents of various ideology. Attacks on hospitals also could cause long-term effects: hospital units could be unavailable {{for a long time and}} replacing staff could take several months, further compounding hospital operations. Both physical and psychological (eg, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) after-effects of a terrorist attack can be detrimental to health care services. On the other hand, physicians and other hospital employees have shown to be involved in terrorism. As data show that some offenders had a previous history with the location of the terror incident, the possibility of hospitals or other health care services being targeted by insiders is discussed.

Similar results were obtained upon feeding [14 C]formaldehyde from aqueous solution to aseptic soybean cell-suspension cultures. Serine and phosphatidylcholine were identified as major metabolic products. Spider plant enzyme extracts contained two NAS+-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase activities with molecular mass values of about 129 and 79 kD. Only the latter enzyme activity required glutathione as an obligatory second cofactor. It had an apparent Km value of 30 [mu]M for formaldehyde and an isoelectric point at pH 5. 4.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming {{bacterium}} that is {{the most}} common cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea in developed countries. Control of C. difficile is challenging because the spores are resistant to killing by alcohol-based hand hygiene products, antimicrobial soaps, and most disinfectants. Although initiation of germination has been shown to increase susceptibility of spores of other bacterial species to radiation and heat, it was not known if triggering of germination could be a useful strategy to increase susceptibility of C. difficile spores to radiation or other stressors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrated that exposure of dormant C. difficile spores to a germination solution containing amino acids, minerals, and taurocholic acid resulted in initiation of germination in room air. Germination of spores in room air resulted in significantly enhanced killing by ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation and heat. On surfaces in hospital rooms, application of germination solution resulted in enhanced eradication of spores by UV-C administered by an automated <b>room</b> <b>decontamination</b> device. Initiation of germination under anaerobic, but not aerobic, conditions resulted in increased susceptibility to killing by ethanol, suggesting that exposure to oxygen might prevent spores from progressing fully to outgrowth. Stimulation of germination also resulted in reduced survival of spores on surfaces in room air, possibly due to increased susceptibility to stressors such as oxygen and desiccation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that stimulation of germination could represent a novel method to enhance killing of spores by UV-C, and suggest the possible application of this strategy as a means to enhance killing by other agents...|$|R

We examined the efficacy of environmental disinfection using the Tru-D device in the laboratory and in rooms of hospitalized patients. Cultures for C. difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) were collected from commonly touched surfaces before and after use of Tru-D. Results On inoculated surfaces, application of Tru-D at a reflected dose of 22, 000 μWs/cm 2 for ~ 45 minutes consistently reduced recovery of C. difficile spores and MRSA by > 2 - 3 log 10 colony forming units (CFU) /cm 2 and of VRE by > 3 - 4 log 10 CFU/cm 2. Similar killing of MRSA and VRE was achieved in ~ 20 minutes at a reflected dose of 12, 000 μWs/cm 2, but killing of C. difficile spores was reduced. Disinfection of hospital rooms with Tru-D reduced the frequency of positive MRSA and VRE cultures by 93 % and of C. difficile cultures by 80 %.

40|$|Abstract Background Environmental {{surfaces}} play {{an important}} role in transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens. There is a need for new disinfection methods that are effective against Clostridium difficile spores, but also safe and rapid. The Sterilray™ Disinfection Wand device is a hand-held <b>room</b> <b>decontamination</b> technology that utilizes far-ultraviolet radiation (185 - 230 [*]nm) to kill pathogens. Methods We examined the efficacy of disinfection using the Sterilray device in the laboratory, in rooms of hospitalized patients, and on surfaces outside of patient rooms (i. e. keyboards and portable medical equipment). Cultures for C. difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) were collected from commonly-touched surfaces before and after use of the Sterilray device. Results On inoculated surfaces in the laboratory, application of the Sterilray device at a radiant dose of 100 [*]mJ/cm 2 for[*]~[*] 5 seconds consistently reduced recovery of C. difficile spores by 4. 4 [*]CFU log 10, MRSA by 5. 4 log 10 CFU and of VRE by 6. 9 log 10 CFU. A > 3 log 10 reduction of MRSA and VRE was achieved in ~ 2 seconds at a lower radiant dose, but killing of C. difficile spores was significantly reduced. On keyboards and portable medical equipment that were inoculated with C. difficile spores, application of the Sterilray device at a radiant dose of 100 [*]mJ/cm 2 for[*]~[*] 5 seconds reduced contamination by 3. 2 log 10 CFU. However, the presence of organic material reduced the lethal effect of the far-UV radiation. In hospital rooms that were not pre-cleaned, disinfection with the Sterilray device significantly reduced the frequency of positive C. difficile and MRSA cultures (P = 0. 007). Conclusions The Sterilray™ Disinfection Wand is a novel environmental disinfection technology that rapidly kills C. difficile spores and other healthcare-associated pathogens on surfaces. However, the presence of organic matter reduces the efficacy of far-UV radiation, possibly explaining the more modest results observed on surfaces in hospital rooms that were not pre-cleaned. </p...|$|R
