Each of these angels carries a rod, with a fleur-de-lys termination; their wings decorate the intermediate ridges (formed, in a pure Greek moulding, by the arrows); and, behind the heads of all the figures, there is now a circular recess; once filled, I doubt not, by a plate of gold. The Christ, and the Evangelists, all carry books, of which each has a mosaic, or intaglio ornament, {{in the shape of a}} cross.

One of these gives a side view of the skull, and from it Fig. 25, A. has been shaded. The second (Fig. 26, A.) exhibits the wide openings of the frontal sinuses upon the inferior surface of the frontal part of the skull, into which, Dr. Fuhlrott writes, [...] "a probe may be introduced to the depth of an inch," [...] and demonstrates the great extension of the thickened supraciliary ridges beyond the cerebral cavity. The third, lastly (Fig. 26, B.) exhibits the edge and {{the interior of the}} posterior, or occipital, part of the skull, and shows very clearly the two depressions for the lateral sinuses, sweeping inwards towards the middle line of the roof of the skull, to form the longitudinal sinus. It was clear, therefore, that I had not erred <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and that the posterior lobe of the brain of the Neanderthal man must have been as much flattened as I suspected it to be.|$|E
60|$|XVIII. I imagine I {{have given}} {{instances}} enough, though I could multiply them indefinitely, {{to prove that}} these variations are not mere blunders, nor carelessnesses, but {{the result of a}} fixed scorn, if not dislike, of accuracy in measurements; and, in most cases, I believe, of a determined resolution to work out an effective symmetry by variations as subtle as those of Nature. To what lengths this principle was sometimes carried, we shall see by the very singular management of the towers of Abbeville. I do not say it is right, still less that it is wrong, but it is a wonderful proof of the fearlessness of a living architecture; for, say what we will of it, that Flamboyant of France, however morbid, was as vivid and intense in its animation as ever any phase of mortal mind; and it would have lived till now, if it had not taken to telling lies. I have before noticed the general difficulty of managing even lateral division, when it is into two equal parts, unless there be some third reconciling member. I shall give, hereafter, more examples of the modes in which this reconciliation is effected in towers with double lights: the Abbeville architect put his sword to the knot perhaps rather too sharply. Vexed by the want of unity between his two windows he literally laid their heads together, and so distorted their ogee curves, as to leave only one of the trefoiled panels above, on the inner side, and three on the outer side of each arch. The arrangement is given in Plate XII. fig. 3. Associated with the various undulation of flamboyant curves below, it is in the real tower hardly observed, while it binds it into one mass in general effect. Granting it, however, to be ugly and wrong, I like sins of the kind, {{for the sake of the}} courage it requires to commit them. In plate II. (part of a small chapel attached to the West front of the Cathedral of St. Lo), the reader will see an instance, from the same architecture, of a violation of its own principles, for the sake of a peculiar meaning. If there be any one feature which the flamboyant architect loved to decorate richly, it was the niche--it was what the capital is to the Corinthian order; yet in the case before us there is an ugly beehive put in the place of the principal niche of the arch. I am not sure if I am right <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>interpretation</b> of its meaning, but I have little doubt that two figures below, now broken away, once represented an Annunciation; and on another part of the same cathedral, I find the descent of the Spirit, encompassed by rays of light, represented very nearly in the form of the niche in question; which appears, therefore, to be intended for a representation of this effulgence, while at the same time it was made a canopy for the delicate figures below. Whether this was its meaning or not, it is remarkable as a daring departure from the common habits of the time.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the last}} decade of his life, Talcott Parsons devoted a large part of his {{scholarly}} attention to the sociology of religion and to the history and symbolism of Christianity.

The core of these myths is, according to Parsons, the idea of life as a gift. The article analyses the importance of this idea for (1) a sociological understanding of Christianity, (2) some aspects of contemporary moral theorizing, particularly the question how the Judeo-Christian tradition can be appropriated under the condition of highly developed autonomous individuality, and (3) the question of a latent Protestant bias in Parsons ’ theory of social change...|$|E

I have played a transcription of Bach's Cello Suite No. 1, made by Ulysse Delecluse, professor of clarinet at the Conservatory of Paris during the mid- 1900 s. A recording {{was made of the}} piece, which I used <b>in</b> <b>my</b> analysis and <b>interpretation</b> work. During this process, I also explored three different effects pedals, usually used for electric guitar, and then I, based on <b>my</b> analysis and <b>interpretation</b> of <b>my</b> first recording, used electronic effects to create a new interpretation of the piece.

Arshad’s self-aggrandising stories were necessary for coping with and detaching from an increasingly fragmenting reality—until his fantasy became a punishing, perpetual present. Researching his story propelled me over time towards a radical pacifism and a growing discomfort at his belief in his actions as wholly justified. For Arshad, this means I have betrayed him.

40|$|In this study, {{the focus}} is on the {{development}} of word borrowing patterns in the sociocultural climate of Putin’s Russia.

40|$|Focusing on Purple Hibiscus (2003) by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Housekeeping (1980) by Marilynne Robinson, The Secret Life of Bees (2002) by Sue Monk Kidd and Cat’s Eye (1988) by Margaret Atwood, {{my thesis}} {{considers}} {{a range of}} contemporary portrayals of trauma within novels featuring girls or women as autodiegetic narrators. These texts are examined in dialogue with theories of representations of trauma in literature from contemporary trauma critics Roger Luckhurst and Michelle Balaev, theories of memory taken from Paul Antze and Michael Lambek, and readings of clinical psychiatrists Judith Herman Lewis and Lenore Terr. The 1972 work Survival by Margaret Atwood is critical <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the protagonists {{as they attempt to}} heal from their trauma and become accommodated into society. I commence the thesis with an overview {{of the history of the}} medical study of trauma and the complementary study of representations of trauma in literature. Through a study of prominent critic Cathy Caruth’s investigations into Freud, I establish the signs of symptoms of trauma, and their typical presentation in a novel. In the work of contemporary theorists I establish the typical features of a trauma novel; however, I aim to establish that a wider range of techniques is utilized, examining the concepts of narrative closure, psychic integration, temporal disruption, and the reconciliation with flawed maternal and paternal figures. The thesis is structured in four chapters, each examining within a novel the relationship between the types of trauma suffered, the presentation of the traumatic symptoms, and the healing process of the protagonists. Each chapter is structured around a significant relationship, their titles reflective of the faults of the perpetrator of the trauma, for example The Sins of the Father, where analysis of the effects of these flawed relationships takes place. Kambili’s narration in Purple Hibiscus shows the effects of colonisation on the formation of identify; Housekeeping demonstrates the continuing effects of abandonment; The Secret Life of Bees demonstrates the necessity of truth to overcome repressed traumatic memories; and Cat’s Eye demonstrates the ongoing effects of repressed memory on the formation of character. Together these novels form a coherent argument that representations of trauma have become an organising concept for female identity in the late twentieth century...|$|R
