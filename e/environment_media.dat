Included in this discussion are Mead’s concepts of self, symbolic interactionism, {{and the relationship between}} symbolic interactionism and media ecology. Examples from Internet research are used to illustrate how media ecology can be applied to interpersonal mediated communication analysis. Media Ecology, a term introduced by Neil Postman (1970), is defined as the study of <b>media</b> <b>environments.</b> Many <b>media</b> ecologists have examined <b>media</b> <b>environments</b> and their impact on culture, social institutions, and social settings. For instance, Postman’s (1985) classic book Amusing Ourselves to Death argues that American television is a <b>media</b> <b>environment</b> that transforms information into entertainment.

Media {{literacy is}} increasingly recognised by governments and international organisations such as the European Union and the World Health Organisation as a key tool to help children understand and deal with today’s complex media <b>environment.</b> <b>Media</b> literacy programs are based around the need to “make children engage in media rather than solely consume it”.|$|E

Partially distributed teams function and operate in two different <b>media</b> <b>environments,</b> varying in availability of communication channels. These <b>media</b> <b>environments</b> may encourage different communication patterns, widening a gap produced by distance. In two laboratory studies we demonstrate that different electronic communication norms (ECNs) emerge among members of the same team based on their <b>media</b> <b>environments.</b> Most of the norms regarding use of electronic communication persisted even when <b>media</b> <b>environment</b> was changed. This difference in ECNs might serve as an additional faultline, causing an additional rift within distributed teams...|$|R
