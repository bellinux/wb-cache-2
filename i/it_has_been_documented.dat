5|$|Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} that affect a dog's eyesight and can lead to blindness. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in a large number of different dog breeds including both the American and English Cocker Spaniels. The two types of Cockers are susceptible to a specific type of PRA called Progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), symptoms include night blindness leading to total blindness between the ages of three and five. PRCD is the most widespread hereditary retinal disease which may lead to blindness in dogs.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> that red ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E

5|$|Blacknose sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and in turn}} fall prey to larger sharks. Like other members of their family, they exhibit a viviparous mode of reproduction in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection. The females give birth to three to six young in late spring or early summer, either annually or biennually, after a gestation period of eight to 11 months. This species is not known to attack humans, though <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> performing a threat display towards divers. It is of moderate commercial and recreational importance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened. In 2009, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the populations of the blacknose shark off the United States are being overfished, and proposed new conservation measures.|$|E
5|$|The {{ferocity of}} the fight {{convinced}} Black Hawk that Apple River Fort was impossible to defeat. He considered burning the fort, but feared the rising smoke would alert other militia in the area. His war-party slackened their fire as their fellow braves raided cabins near the fort. Taken were meat, flour, clothing, cooking utensils. Left behind was a paucity of real vandalism. Braves then raided the livestock: horses were run off and pigs and cattle were shot down and the choicest cut of meat taken. In the gathering darkness, Black Hawk quietly withdrew his war party and retreated back to the gap in Terrapin Ridge and gained the Galena Road. Casualties were few, given {{the intensity of the}} battle. Courier George Harkleroad was shot in the neck early in the battle and died; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall's pickets. Besides Welch, the only other garrison casualty was Josiah Nutting, who suffered a non-lethal wound to the side of his head. The number of Sauk casualties is unknown.|$|E

25|$|The ancient {{method of}} {{performing}} metzitzah—metzitzah b'peh, or oral suction—has become controversial. The process has the mohel place his mouth {{directly on the}} circumcision wound to draw blood away from the cut. The majority of Jewish circumcision ceremonies do not use metzitzah b'peh, but some Haredi Jews use it. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> that the practice poses a serious risk of spreading herpes to the infant.

25|$|Agelaia pallipes will {{normally}} feed {{on other}} insects (flies, moths, butterflies), however, {{it has been}} recently discovered that A. pallipes will also feed on carrion. Though the collection of bodily fluids is preferred, the wasp will also settle to take carrion morsels to their larvae; furthermore, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in recent studies that they will chew tissues of cavities {{in order to find}} liquids. Interestingly, A. pallipes was observed to feed on carrion primarily during the fresh stage (98% of occurrences) which can lead to significant forensic importance when determining the post-mortem interval.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, Evans became {{addicted}} to cocaine. He started with one gram per weekend, but later started taking several grams daily. His friends, Chicago pianists Sam Distefano and Larry Novak, repeatedly tried lecturing {{him in an}} effort to get him to quit, fearing for Bill's health. His brother Harry's suicide may have also influenced his emotional state after 1979. His sister-in-law Pat Evans has stated that she knew Bill wouldn't last long after Harry's death and she wondered if that's what prompted her to buy three plots in a Baton Rouge Cemetery, where Harry was interred. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> that he voluntarily quit his treatment for chronic hepatitis. Laurie Verchomin has claimed that Evans was clear in mind that he would die in a short time.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities in the {{maternal}} {{immune system and}} insufficiency of gestational immune tolerance seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward Th1 responses {{and the production of}} IFN-γ. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the natural killer cells of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of T helper cells, alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of regulatory T cells in pregnancy. Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> that fetal cells such as fetal erythroblasts as well as cell-free fetal DNA are increased in {{the maternal}} circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia. These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into the maternal circulation, that in turn leads to an immune response and endothelial damage, and that ultimately results in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|Various {{sources and}} {{publications}} {{have suggested that}} some springtails may parasitize humans, but this is entirely inconsistent with their biology, and no such phenomenon has ever been scientifically confirmed, though <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> that the scales or hairs from collembolans can cause irritation when rubbed onto the skin. They may sometimes be abundant indoors in damp places such as bathrooms and basements, and incidentally found on one's person. More often, claims of persistent human skin infection by springtails may indicate a neurological problem, such as delusory parasitosis, a psychological rather than entomological problem. Researchers themselves {{may be subject to}} psychological phenomena. For example, a publication in 2004 claiming that springtails had been found in skin samples was later determined to be a case of pareidolia; that is, no springtail specimens were actually recovered, but the researchers had digitally enhanced photos of sample debris to create images resembling small arthropod heads, which then were claimed to be springtail remnants. However, Steve Hopkin reports one instance of an entomologist aspirating an Isotoma species and in the process accidentally inhaling some of their eggs, which hatched in his nasal cavity and made him quite ill until they were flushed out.|$|E
2500|$|The rape of men {{by other}} men is also common in war. A 2009 study by Lara Stemple found that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> in {{conflicts}} worldwide; for example, 76% of male political prisoners in 1980s El Salvador and 80% of concentration camp inmates in Sarajevo reported being raped or sexually tortured.

25|$|Stone was {{in command}} at the fort during two war-related incidents. In the days {{immediately}} preceding June 18, 1832, Apple River Fort's stables were broken into and horses were stolen during the night. This incident {{was one of}} several around that time which led Illinois militia officer James W. Stephenson to clash with British Band warriors at Waddams Grove on June 18. On June 24, the Battle of Apple River Fort commenced at the fort. Approximately 150200 Sauk and Fox warriors under the command of Black Hawk attacked the fort, which was defended by about 25 militia. The militia was shorthanded during the battle, as most of the fort's detachment were not present. Inside the fort, the people of the nearby settlement had taken refuge. One woman, Elizabeth Armstrong, was singled out for her bravery after the battle. She rallied the fort's women to assist during the battle by making musketballs and reloading weapons. Fierce fighting ensued for at least 45 minutes with both sides exchanging heavy gunfire. Believing the fort to be more heavily defended than it was, Black Hawk and his band eventually retreated. Casualties were few, given the intensity of the battle. Militia member George Herclerode was shot in the neck or head early in the battle and died; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall's pickets.
