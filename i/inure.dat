500|$|Locke advises {{parents to}} {{carefully}} nurture their children's physical [...] "habits" [...] before pursuing their academic education. As many scholars have remarked, it is unsurprising that a trained physician, as Locke was, would begin Some Thoughts {{with a discussion}} of children's physical needs, yet this seemingly simple generic innovation has proven to be one of Locke's most enduring legacies—Western child-rearing manuals are still dominated by the topics of food and sleep. To convince parents that they must attend to the health of their children above all, Locke quotes from Juvenal's Satires—"a sound mind in a sound body." [...] Locke firmly believed that children should be exposed to harsh conditions while young to <b>inure</b> them to, for example, cold temperatures when they were older: [...] "Children [...] be not too warmly clad or covered, winter or summer" [...] (Locke's emphasis), he argues, because [...] "bodies will endure anything that from the beginning they are accustomed to." [...] Furthermore, to prevent a child from catching chills and colds, Locke suggests that [...] "his feet to be washed every day in cold water, and to have his shoes so thin that they might leak and let in water whenever he comes near it" [...] (Locke's emphasis). Locke posited that if children were accustomed to having sodden feet, a sudden shower that wet their feet would not cause them to catch a cold. Such advice (whether followed or not) was quite popular; it appears throughout John Newbery's children's books {{in the middle of the}} eighteenth century, for example, the first best-selling children's books in England. Locke also offers specific advice on topics ranging from bed linens to diet to sleeping regimens.|$|E
