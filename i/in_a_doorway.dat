5|$|On 21 April that year, Rejtan, in a {{dramatic}} gesture at the Sejm, {{is said to have}} bared his chest and laid himself down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway,</b> blocking the way with his own body in {{a dramatic}} attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held. Leaving of the chamber would have signified an end to the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion, meaning the acceptance of foreign territorial demands.|$|E
5|$|After the 1976 tour, Townshend took {{most of the}} {{following}} year off {{to spend time with}} his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, he passed out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway,</b> where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, Who Are You.|$|E
5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway</b> to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E

5|$|The next day, {{the court}} {{sentenced him to}} {{imprisonment}} and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops {{made it difficult for}} the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, still were present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway,</b> blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies just stepped over Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, hoping to be removed by foreign troops, which would be a symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having little sleep and food (Rejtan is said to have refused to eat in the Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out.|$|E

The sisters are noble in comportment and remote in expression. The unusual positioning of their figures implies a complex and intimate relationship.|$|E

25|$|Unlike at the North Tower, initially, one of {{the three}} {{stairwells}} was still intact after Flight175 crashed into the South Tower. This was because the plane struck the tower offset from the center and not centrally as Flight 11 in the North Tower had done. Only 18 people passed the impact zone through the available stairway and left the South Tower safely before it collapsed. One of them, Stanley Praimnath, was on the 81st floor, and his office suffered a direct hit. He witnessed Flight 175 coming toward him. One of the wings sliced through his office and wound up wedged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway</b> approximately 20 feet away from him.|$|E

Spade returns home and finds O'Shaughnessy hiding <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway.</b> He takes her inside and finds Gutman, Cairo, and Wilmer waiting for him, guns drawn. Gutman gives Spade $10,000 for the Falcon, but Spade tells them that part of his price is someone he can turn over to the police for the murders of Thursby and Captain Jacobi. Spade {{suggests}} Wilmer, since he certainly killed Thursby and Jacobi. After some intense negotiation, Gutman and Cairo agree; Wilmer is knocked out in a scuffle.|$|E

This struck Lennon in a positive way, and it became the album title.|$|E

500|$|The {{interior}} is sumptuously decorated with wood panelling and tiles of Delftware. The collection of artworks and artifacts includes furniture, china and pictures {{with a strong}} Dutch influence. The china includes a pair of tulip vases made in the 1680s. The state bed, with crimson and yellow velvet hangings, was made in Anglo-Dutch style around 1704. The entrance hall is hung with bird paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter and throughout the house are landscape and still lifes by Abraham Storck, Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten, David Teniers the Younger, Melchior d'Hondecoeter, and other Dutch Masters. Hoogstratens [...] "View of a Corridor" [...] has been hung <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway</b> as the artist originally intended. Blathwayt's travels are also represented by paintings by Spanish artists such as Bartolomé Esteban Murillo and a staircase made of walnut from his estates as auditor general of the Colony of Virginia. Many of these were brought to Dyrham by George William Blathwayt after he inherited the house in 1844. There are also artifacts from Blathwayt's journeys {{to other parts of}} the world, particularly Jamaica.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{described}} the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He {{said that on}} 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan {{that he had seen}} people [...] "as if they were on television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway</b> and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E

2500|$|Apaches was a {{term that}} was {{introduced}} by Paris newspapers in 1902 for young Parisians who engaged in petty crime and sometimes fought each other or the police. They usually lived in Belleville and Charonne. Their activities were described in lurid terms by the popular press, and they were blamed for all varieties of crime in the city. In September 1907, the newspaper Le Gaulois described an Apache as [...] "the man who lives on the margin of society, ready to do anything, except to take a regular job, the miserable who breaks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway,</b> or stabs a passer-by for nothing, just for pleasure." ...|$|E

He was emaciated, with a pale complexion and had several missing teeth. Nilsen and the youth took a taxi to Melrose Avenue; that evening, the victim was strangled to death as he slept, with his legs moving in a cycling motion as he was strangled. Nilsen later stated he believed this victim's life had been [...] "one of long suffering", and that the act of killing this victim had been [...] "as easy as taking candy from a baby".|$|E
2500|$|Arbuckle {{began his}} film {{career with the}} Selig Polyscope Company in July 1909 when he {{appeared}} in Ben's Kid. Arbuckle appeared sporadically in Selig one-reelers until 1913, moved briefly to Universal Pictures and became a star in producer-director Mack Sennett's Keystone Cops comedies. (However, according to the Motion Picture Studio Directory for 1919 and 1921, Arbuckle began his screen career with Keystone in 1913 as an extra for $3 a day (equivalent to approximately $ in [...] dollars), working his way up through the acting ranks to become a lead player and director. Although his large size was undoubtedly part of his comedic appeal Arbuckle was self-conscious about his weight and refused {{to use it to}} get [...] "cheap" [...] laughs. For example, he would not allow himself to be stuck <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway</b> or chair.|$|E

50|$|When {{adding a}} new room, the player {{randomly}} picks one from the pile of unused ones. One restriction is that <b>a</b> door <b>in</b> the new room must line up with <b>a</b> door <b>in</b> the room that the player is <b>in</b> so <b>a</b> <b>doorway</b> is formed between the two. A second restriction is that a room needs to be either on the same level, or one level above or below the level the player is on (i.e. <b>a</b> <b>doorway</b> cannot directly connect the cellar with the second floor). The plastic staircases are used to basically indicate doorways connecting one level to another.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} {{episode was}} not broadcast until 26 August 1991, when the BBC aired a version that edited together {{the first half}} of the taping with one of the two completed second halves. As it happened, the version chosen was the one in which the TARDIS doors would not close; other errors included actress Carole Ann Ford fluffing a line of dialogue, Jacqueline Hill getting caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway,</b> a camera banging into a piece of scenery during one of the scrapyard sequences, and William Russell accidentally knocking over a mannequin in the scrapyard. Earlier, in June 1991, a version with the first half edited together with the other take of the second half of the pilot was released on the VHS compilation The Hartnell Years; later, in 2000, the complete version (including both takes) was released in a remastered form on VHS, along with The Edge of Destruction. In 2006, the Doctor Who: The Beginning DVD set contained two versions of the episode: an unedited studio recording including all takes of the second part of the show, and a newly created version of the pilot that uses the best footage from the original recording, with additional editing and digital adjustments to remove blown lines, technical problems, and reduce studio noise. Like the other episodes from this serial, both versions of the [...] "pilot" [...] were remastered for DVD release, using VidFIRE technology that simulated the original video look of the 1963 production.|$|E
2500|$|The cloister, to {{the south}} of the nave of the priory church, is now part of the Priory Farm garden. To the east of the cloister, still standing, are part of the walls of the chapter house, and also some traces of the dormitory. The {{refectory}} and other domestic buildings probably are beneath or have been incorporated into the 18th century Priory Farmhouse, which was probably built from materials from the demolition of the early buildings. Much remains of the main priory church. The nave, from the west wall to the transept, is [...] long and [...] wide. The north wall still stands practically to the roof level, although the divisions between the windows have long gone. The belfry tower has gone, although the first steps can be seen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>doorway</b> in the south wall. The south wall is only as high as the window-sill level. The west wall is standing almost intact to gable height, although the lining of the original door has been replaced by modern brickwork. The north transept is [...] long and [...] wide. The east wall of the transept is entirely gone, except for traces of its junction with the north wall. At the south end of this wall once stood a pillar; the opposite pillar, west of the south door, is almost complete and in a good state of preservation. Also in the transept there is a doorway which leads to what is thought to be a sacristy, and is the only doorway remaining in its original form. The architrave is almost complete. West of the transept there is a small chapel [...] long and [...] wide. Most of the chapel's window mouldings survive. The chancel at the eastern end of the ruin remains to roof height on the north and south side. The original eastern wall has been demolished, but a flint wall has been built up to window-sill level. The north-east corner still has most of its window mouldings.|$|E
