25|$|In 2008 art by Hirst sold at his auction, Beautiful <b>Inside</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> Forever, raised $198 million (US). It {{is said to}} be {{the largest}} amount raised by any living artist to date.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, {{he took an}} {{unprecedented}} move for a living artist by selling a complete show, Beautiful <b>Inside</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> Forever, at Sotheby's by auction and bypassing his long-standing galleries. The auction exceeded all predictions, raising £111million ($198million), breaking the record for a one-artist auction as well as Hirst's own record with £10.3million for The Golden Calf, an animal with 18-carat gold horns and hooves, preserved in formaldehyde.|$|E

25|$|Hirst is a {{supporter}} of the indigenous rights organisation, Survival International. In September 2008, Hirst donated the work, Beautiful Love Survival, at the Sotheby’s London sale, Beautiful <b>Inside</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> Forever, to raise money for this organisation. Later, he also contributed his writing to the book, We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples, released in October 2009, in support of Survival. The book explores the existence of, and threats to, indigenous cultures around the world.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as he puts it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... and the thing is, I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E
500|$|On {{its release}} most critics {{agreed that the}} book was both scandalous and career-ending. [...] (Even with {{a quarter of the}} 1,000-page {{original}} manuscript excised, it took lawyers at Random House fourteen months to approve it for publication.) Lewis Cole, in The Nation, described it as being [...] " [...] written but spat out, a breakneck, formless performance piece...propelled by spite and vanity". Newsweek's review called it a [...] "573-page primal scream", while one Hollywood producer said it was [...] "the longest suicide note in history". In the 2003 documentary version of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, based on Peter Biskind's 1998 anecdotal history of New Hollywood, Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial fury at Phillips' revelations, before more circumspectly listening to [...] "a little voice <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> [...] 'Richard, Richard, the truth was so much worse'." [...] Despite Phillips' criticisms of Steven Spielberg in the book, Spielberg nevertheless invited her to a 1997 screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a way of [...] "keeping his friends close and his enemies closer." [...] Rapper Tupac Shakur mispronounces {{the title of the book}} in a Vibe Interview in 1996, stating briefly that it was one of the books he read recently. [...] "You’ll Never Work Again in Hollywood, whatever that is that they’re talking about, all the people that slept together." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said aloud, at last, [...] "it {{is to be}} {{hoped that}} I shall {{be able to do}} {{something}} with the <b>inside</b> of <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> for I shall certainly never do anything by the help of the outside." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{spending}} some {{months in the}} United States, Stan began working on the track in October 2013 at the two-weeks inaugural international songwriting FonoCamp in 2013, held in Azuga, Romania, where she met various Romanian and international artists. [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] was written by Lee Anna James, Naz Tokio, Sebastian Jacome and Alexandru Cotoi, while being solely produced by Jacome and Cotoi. When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This might sound like a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes to just let go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, so I do hope it has helped them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan. Florin Grozea of newspaper Adevărul felt the line [...] "I won't spend another day with you <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head...</b> How could you be so cruel? Turned me into a liar." [...] was directly addressed to Prodan.|$|E
6000|$|... “Never {{mind the}} many notes!” Klakee-Nah cried out impatiently. “They make my head {{go around and}} all the things <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> The whole! The round whole! How much is it?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{know what}} that means, of course, but I do. It means betwixt and between, {{and that is just}} where I am. I can see <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> what will happen when a shell bursts, and you {{bullocks}} can't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} the <b>inside</b> of <b>my</b> <b>head</b> you can have it," [...] said Brown rather wearily. [...] "What it's worth you can say afterwards. But the first thing I find in that disused pocket is this: that men who mean to steal {{diamonds}} don't talk Socialism. They are more likely," [...] he added demurely, [...] "to denounce it." ...|$|R
5000|$|After a year-and-a-half, Simon left {{in order}} to freelance, recalling in 1975 that, [...] "I was turning out so much work, they had to promote me, because I was earning more money {{than some of the}} {{full-fledged}} animators. But {{it got to the point}} that I was just too excited about the things going on <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head,</b> which I could not release while working for someone else." ...|$|R
2500|$|Carey {{was born}} in Liverpool, England, in 1959 – {{describing}} his young self as [...] "one of those ominously quiet kids... lived so much <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head</b> I only had vestigial limbs". As a child, he maintained an interest in comics, writing and drawing primitive stories to entertain his younger brother. He studied English at St Peter's College, Oxford, before becoming a teacher. He continued to teach for 15 years {{before moving on to}} writing comics.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even as {{the point}} of the spear sprang out beyond his back, he smote me upon the head. There was a flash, as of bright light, and <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> I felt {{something}} give, with a snap--just like that, with a snap. And the weight that pressed above my eyes so long was lifted, and the band that bound my brows so tight was broken. And a great gladness came upon me, and my heart sang with joy.|$|E
6000|$|I implored the Power {{above me}} to give me {{strength}} and wisdom; not to let me fail in this hour of trouble, and thereby bring these poor people to a bloody death. I prayed till the perspiration streamed down my face; then suddenly I fell into sleep or swoon. I don't know how long I lay thus, but I think {{it must have been}} the best part of an hour. At last I woke up all in an instant, and as I woke I distinctly heard a tiny voice, unlike any other voice in the whole world, speak <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> or so it seemed to me, saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I? I sat on, {{ashamed of}} my desire of woman {{that had not}} been so strong as my slave-obedience to a chief. And I drowned my shame in large drinks of rum and whisky, till the world went round and round, <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and out, and the Southern Cross danced a hula in the sky, and the Koolau Mountains bowed their lofty summits to Waikiki and the surf of Waikiki kissed them on their brows. And the giant harpooner was still roaring, his the last sounds in my ear, as I fell back on the lauhala mat, and was to all things for the time as one dead.|$|E

6000|$|... "Young master, {{you seem}} to have a good heart," [...] he returned, shaking his head at the proffered cigar, [...] "do, for God's sake, get me a little rum.

6000|$|... "My fren'," [...] said Etienne, exhaling a large cloud {{from his}} {{cigarette}} and patting Ross lightly on the shoulder with a bediamonded hand which, hung limp from a yard or more of bony arm, [...] "I see I mus' be frank with you. Firs', because we are rivals; second, because you take these matters so serious. I--I am Frenchman. I love the women"--he threw back his curls, bared his yellow teeth, and blew an unsavory kiss toward the kitchen. [...] "It is, I suppose, a trait of my nation. All Frenchmen love the women--pretty women. Now, look: Here I am!" [...] He spread out his arms. [...] "Cold outside! I detes' the col-l-l! Snow! I abominate the mees-ser-rhable snow! Two men! This--" [...] pointing to me--"an' this!" [...] Pointing to' Ross. [...] "I am distracted! For two whole days I stan' at the window an' tear my 'air! I am nervous, upset, pr-r-ro-foun'ly distress <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>'ead!</b> An' suddenly--be'old! A woman, a nice, pretty, charming, innocen' young woman! I, naturally, rejoice. I become myself again--gay, light-'earted, 'appy. I address myself to mademoiselle; it passes the time. That, m'sieu', is wot the women are for--pass the time! Entertainment--like the music, like the wine! ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{first thing}} I did on {{getting to the}} dining-room was to open the window. I had half a mind to smash it, so as to give an extra bit of local colour to the affair, but decided not to {{on account of the}} noise. I had put my lantern on the table, and was just {{reaching}} out for it, when something happened. What it was for the moment I couldn't have said. It might have been an explosion of some sort or an earthquake. Some solid object caught me a frightful whack on the chin. Sparks and things occurred <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and the next thing I remember is feeling something wet and cold splash into my face, and hearing a voice that sounded like old Bill's say, [...] "Feeling better now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Luck be blowed!" [...] {{broke out}} the long mate, Sparrowhawk, his face shining with admiration. [...] "It was hard work, that's what it was. We earned our pay. She worked us till we dropped. And {{we were down}} with fever half the time. So was she, for that matter, only she wouldn't stay down, and she wouldn't let us stay down. My word, she's a slave-driver--'Just one more heave, Mr. Sparrowhawk, {{and then you can}} go to bed for a week',--she to me, and me staggerin' 'round like a dead man, with bilious-green lights {{flashing}} <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> an' my head just bustin'. I was all in, but I gave that heave right O--and then it was, 'Another heave now, Mr. Sparrowhawk, just another heave.' An' the Lord lumme, the way she made love to old Kina-Kina!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lone Chief nodded vigorously. [...] "Mutsak speaks true. In {{the time}} that followed, my head was well, {{and it was not}} well. For though the flesh healed and the sore went away, yet was I sick inside. When I walked, my legs shook under me, and when I looked at the light, my eyes became filled with tears. And when I opened my eyes, the world outside went around and around, and when I closed my eyes, my head inside went around and around, and all the things I had ever seen went around and around <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> And above my eyes there was a great pain, as though {{something}} heavy rested always upon me, or like a band that is drawn tight and gives much hurt. And speech was slow to me, and I waited long for each right word to come to my tongue. And when I waited not long, all manner of words crowded in, and my tongue spoke foolishness. I was very sick, and when my father, the Otter, brought the girl Kasaan before me--" ...|$|E
5000|$|Frontman Pat DiNizio {{explained}} {{the darkness of}} the album saying: [...] "So why's it so dark? Well, I'm not a particularly happy person these days, and I do feel that society's going to hell in a handbag. You can hear that in the first song: 'Guess what, there's a black cloud <b>inside</b> of <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> don't mess around with me or you'll find yourself dead.' If you live in New York City, you can feel that way, like everyone around you is a walking time bomb." [...] Also, producer Butch Vig left the project prior to the recording of the album, which is said to have inspired some of the hatred expressed in this album.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{as we went}} on, I {{began to}} know that some alii was dead. No kanakas lay asleep in the sand, nor stole home from their love- making; and no canoes were abroad after the early fish most catchable then inside the reef at the change of the tide. When we came, past the hoiau" [...] (temple), [...] "to where the Great Kamehameha used to haul out his brigs and schooners, I saw, under the canoe-sheds, that the mat-thatches of Kahekili's great double canoe had been taken off, and that even then, at low tide, many men were {{launching}} it down across the sand into the water. But all these men were chiefs. And, though my eyes swam, and the <b>inside</b> of <b>my</b> <b>head</b> went around and around, and the <b>inside</b> of <b>my</b> body was a cinder athirst, I guessed that the alii who was dead was Kahekili. For he was old, and most likely of the aliis to be dead." ...|$|R
5000|$|La Commedia del Sangue means [...] "the {{comedy of}} blood" [...] {{and in spite}} of the blood and the special effects the shows were {{apparently}} more comedic than horrific. Rikki L. Grimes wrote in The Independent in November 1995 [...] "I expected a Gothic horror play reminiscent of Theatre des Vampires from Anne Rice's vampire chronicles. What I did not expect was a horror comedy. The play is sprinkled with not only one-liners, but jokes that just lingered <b>inside</b> of <b>my</b> <b>head</b> even hours after the play had ended." [...] Although this sometimes worked against it, John Chatterton wrote in his review of Just Us Served in the OOBR that [...] "All the one-liners in the world need a story to hang from or they just lie down and play dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And at the last," [...] Kumuhana resumed, [...] "I was not slain. Eoppo, {{the killing}} knife {{in hand and}} ready to lift for the blow, did not lift. And I? How did I feel and think? Often, Kanaka Oolea, have I since laughed {{at the memory of}} it. I felt very thirsty. I did not want to die. I wanted a drink of water. I knew I was going to die, and I kept remembering the {{thousand}} waterfalls falling to waste down the pans" [...] (precipices) [...] "of the windward Koolau Mountains. I did not think of Anapuni. I was too thirsty. I did not think of Malia. I was too thirsty. But continually, <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> I saw the tongue of the harpooner, covered dry with sand, as I had last seen it, lying in the sand. My tongue was like that, too. And {{in the bottom of the}} canoe rolled about many drinking nuts. Yet I did not attempt to drink, for these were chiefs and I was a common man.|$|E
6000|$|... "And then, {{sitting on}} the porch of her father's {{farmhouse}} back in Nebraska one moonlight evening, Sarah came out and put that gold chip into my hand. Seems she'd just found it in the torn lining of the trunk I'd brought back from Ecuador--I who for two years didn't even know I'd been to Ecuador, or Australia, or anything! Well, I just sat there looking at the chip in the moonlight, and turning it over and over and figuring what it was and where it'd come from, {{when all of a sudden}} there was a snap <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> as if something had broken, and then I could see Vahna spread-eagled on that big nugget and the old fellow with the beak waving the stone knife, and [...] . and everything. That is, everything that had happened from the time I first left Nebraska to when I crawled to the daylight out of the snow after they had chucked me off the mountain-top. But everything that'd happened after that I'd clean forgotten. When Sarah said I was her husband, I wouldn't listen to her. Took all her family and the preacher that'd married us to convince me.|$|E
6000|$|... "First, I wish {{it clearly}} {{understood}} that I believe in nothing. I {{do not even}} give the nothing I believe a name; or I should be an atheist. I have never had <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{so much as a}} hint of heaven and hell. I think it most likely we are worms in the mud; but I happen to be sorry for the other worms under the wheel. And I happen myself to be a sort of worm that turns when he can. If I care nothing for piety, I care less for poetry. I'm not like Ashe here, who is crammed with criminology, but has all sorts of other culture as well. I know nothing about culture, except bacteria culture. I sometimes fancy Mr. Ashe is as much an art critic as Mr. Paynter; only he looks for his heroes, or villains, in real life. But I am a very practical man; and my stepping stones have been simply scientific facts. In this village I found a fact--a fever. I could not classify it; it seemed peculiar to this corner of the coast; it had singular reactions of delirium and mental breakdown. I studied it exactly as I should a queer case in the hospital, and corresponded and compared notes with other men of science. But nobody had even a working hypothesis about it, except of course the ignorant peasantry, who said the peacock trees were in some wild way poisonous.|$|E
5000|$|Yusef Abdullahi {{was treated}} for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after his release from prison and campaigned on behalf of other victims of miscarriages of justice and for the reopening of the {{investigation}} into White's murder. In 1996 he said: [...] "Until it happens to you, no-one can {{have any idea what}} it's like to be convicted for a murder you didn't commit. We've been really messed up by what we've been through. We needed counselling, but no-one offered us any help. Being <b>inside</b> really did <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in." [...] He died of a perforated ulcer in January 2011, aged 49.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{permanently}} {{restricted to}} the OSU CommunityTwenty Questions, a Screenplay: Writing in Pictures is a film adaptation of my published novel, Twenty Questions. This {{is a story about}} a woman whose proximity to a murder leads to terrible truths about her own life. Set during the invasion of Iraq, the story is a comment on violence while, at the same time, exploring class, identity and the meaning of fidelity. Because I adapted a novel, I was able to concentrate on the screenplay form, rather than content. At the same time, it heightened the contrast between writing prose and writing a screenplay. Because this was an adaptation of my own work, it challenged my allegiance, forcing me {{to figure out how to}} be true to the story yet leave the book behind. I am an interior writer. I write impressions, feelings, thoughts. Much of the novel, Twenty Questions, takes place <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> character's <b>head.</b> The screenplay forced me to turn the story inside out, to make the invisible visible, to show the physical and imply the unseen.

40|$|A good {{proportion}} of migraine art seems {{to resemble a}} modernist tendency towards the fragmentation of vision and distortion of its subject, as one sees in Cubist portraiture, for example. The representation of the head in migraine art may at first glance seem a little clichéd and obvious. However, {{this is not a}} literal self-portrait but an attempt to describe the <b>inside</b> of <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> As such, <b>my</b> migraine art has more in common with expressionism and surrealism. My work usually explores the nature of the visual distortions and the shifting of the migraine experience from wakefulness to sleep. As such, my work generally tends to be more abstract. I prefer to use photography and digital media, and not paint—the idea of pinpricks of light in a lightproof box, or of images that do not really exist seem apposite—though, here, I use paint on canvas. In this piece the migraine experience is explained in the language of expressionism: it is both anti-naturalistic and, to an extent, representational. It has a lot in common with neo-expressionism, in that it is evocative, rather than descriptive. It is an awkward piece that seems on the on the verge of dissolving. www. digitalimagingandphotography. blogspot. co...|$|R
