50|$|<b>Grey-headed</b> <b>bulbuls</b> breed from January to June with a peak in April. The nest is {{a typical}} {{platform}} placed inside a low bush. They build their nest {{over a period of}} a week using vines, grasses or leaves. Many nests in a study in the Silent Valley National park were found to be made on saplings of Syzygium species or in reeds of Ochlandra travancorica. The typical clutch is one egg or sometimes two eggs that are incubated for 12 to 14 days. Eggs are sometimes destroyed and eaten by palm squirrels (Funambulus tristriatus). The eggs are pale pink to lavender and flecked in red, more densely on the broad end. Both parents take part in incubation and feeding. The nestlings leave the nest after 11 to 13 days.|$|R

50|$|The {{sanctuary}} is {{an important}} bird area with 192 recorded avian species. Five Western Ghats endemic bird species occur here, including the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus priocephalus), Indian rufous babbler (Turdoides subrufus) and white-bellied blue-flycatcher (Cyornis pallipes). Other interesting species found here include-Ceylon frogmouth (Batrachostomus moniliger), Indian edible-nest swiftlet (Collocalia unicolor), Malabar trogon (Harpactes fasciatus), Malabar whistling-thrush (Myiophonus horsfieldii) and Loten's sunbird (Nectarinia lotenia) (Islam and Rahmani 2004).

50|$|The yellow-bellied bulbul was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Ixos and alternatively classified in the now defunct genus Trichixos. It was later placed in the genus Criniger until moved to the genus Alophoixus in 2009. Alternate names for the yellow-bellied bulbul include the crestless white-throated bulbul, grey-capped bulbul, grey-headed bearded bulbul, <b>grey-headed</b> <b>bulbul,</b> white-throated bulbul and yellow-bellied bearded-bulbul. The common name 'yellow-bellied bulbul' is also used as an alternate name for the yellow-bellied greenbul. The alternate name 'grey-headed bulbul' {{should not be confused}} with the species of the same name, Pycnonotus priocephalus. The common name 'yellow-bellied bulbul' is also used as an alternate name for the white-throated bulbul.

50|$|The {{sanctuary}} sustains a good mammal population due to {{its rich}} habitat and plenty of perennial streams. Gaur (Bos gaurus), Malabar giant squirrel (Ratufa indica), four-horned antelope or chousingha (Tetracerus quadricornis), leopard (Panthera pardus), black sloth bear along {{with a host of}} other predators and herbivores find home in the sanctuary.

50|$|The Indian Bird Conservation Network (IBCN) has {{identified}} 212 {{species of birds}} from the Nilambur and Amarambalam forests. Amarambalam is classified as an Important Bird Area (IBS) of the Western Ghats Endemic Bird Area where 16 restricted range species (RRS) have been identified; eight species have been sighted in Amarambalam. Beside the RRS's, there are one critically endangered and two vulnerable species. In 2001 BirdLife International has also identified 52 near threatened species (NTS) of India. Three of the NTS bird species {{are found in the}} IBA, but more are likely to be found once detailed studies are conducted. Classified by BirdLife International, Amarambalam Reserve Forest lies in the Indian Peninsula Tropical Moist Forest (Biome-10): 15 bird species have been identified as typical biome assemblage, 12 species are found in this IBA. In 2003, Professor PO Nameer, Kerala Agricultural University, reported to have seen 11 species of woodpeckers, 11 species of flycatchers, nine species of babblers, seven species of bulbuls, and three species of barbets. As of 2004, there were populations of 10 IBA trigger species ranging from critically endangered/vulnerable to least concern according to IUCN categorisation and A1 to A3 according to IBA, namely Lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), White-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis), Nilgiri wood-pigeon (Columba elphinstonii), Malabar parakeet (Psittacula columboides), Malabar grey-hornbill (Ocyceros griseus), White-bellied treepie (Dendrocitta leucogastra), <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus priocephalus), Rufous babbler (Turdoides subrufus), White-bellied blue-flycatcher (Cyornis pallipes) and Crimson-backed sunbird (Nectarinia minima). The bird community showed high evenness. Maximum species richness was obtained during November and highest diversity index was recorded during April.|$|E
40|$|The {{breeding}} {{biology of}} the endemic <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Bulbul</b> Pycnonotus priocephalus was studied from 2003 to 2005 in Silent Valley National Park, Western Ghats, India. Nests were located during three field seasons from the arrival (December) to the dispersal {{of the birds}} (June) and collected data on various breeding parameters, availability of fruits and weather conditions. All nests were found in mid-elevation evergreen forests ranging from 900 to 1, 400 m elevation. Breeding occurred in the drier months (January-May), which coincides with high fruit availability. Nest building lasted 3 - 8 days. Majority of the nests (72 %; n = 39) were built on two plant species (Ochlandra travancorica and saplings of Syzygium sp.) and the mean nest height was 1. 52 plus or minus 0. 80 m (n = 52). Nests were randomly oriented around the nesting plants with a mean vector of orientation equaling 160. 450. The clutch size averaged 1. 53 plus or minus 0. 50 eggs (range = 1 - 2; n = 47). Incubation and nestling periods were 13 plus or minus 0. 87 (n = 9) and 12 plus or minus 0. 50 (n = 9) days, respectively. Overall nest success was 10. 79 %. Nest success rates varied among incubation and nestling periods. <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Bulbul</b> exhibit life-history traits associated with low productivity such as short breeding season, low clutch size, fewer broods per year and high predation rates indicating that deterioration of breeding habitats might seriously hamper the long-term survival of the species...|$|E
