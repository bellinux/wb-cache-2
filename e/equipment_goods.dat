40|$|The {{resulting}} {{economic integration}} of industrial processes and manufacturing internationalisation lead several authors {{to argue that}} world economy is globalised. In this context, the approach to the divestment concept without an social and económical context, does not show a group of associated practices and representations.

This type of strategy is designated by "divestment". The social level of consequencies are not due to the closing down or de-localization of production units that are divesting, but can be materialised of efects that are irreversible. This means unemployment, de-skilling, labour precarization and even emergence of new forms of social exclusion in former industrialised regions. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} work, Karl Whelan [2003] {{argues that the}} {{hypothesis}} of balanced growth is firmly rejected by postwar u. s. data. There is some clear evidence that the ratio of real investment to real consumption has exhibited an upward trend since the late 1950 s. In this case, the traditional one-sector model of economic growth provides a poor description of the long-run behavior of the u. s. economy. In this paper, I develop a simple two-sector model of economic growth in which the obsolescence of capital goods is endogenous. Numerical simulations of unbalanced growth paths suggest that the rapid decline in the relative price of <b>equipment</b> <b>goods</b> observed since the mid- 1960 s in the u. s. has shortened the average service-life of equipment, which, in turn, induced a long-lasting underestimation of {{the growth rate of}} Total Factor Productivity. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{contribution}} of incremental and radical innovations to total factor productivity (TFP) growth at the firm level. The first part of our analysis {{is dedicated to the}} determinants of innovation and reveals two different innovation regimes. On the one hand, radical innovations rely strongly on firm-level spillovers, including property rights, and formal internal research while, on the other hand, incremental innovations rely mostly on the adoption of <b>equipment</b> <b>goods</b> accompanied by informal research. We find that radical innovations are the only significant contributors to TFP growth so that innovation height matters. We also find evidence that TFP growth is better represented by an upward shift of the production function than by a continuous innovation measure. Overall, the growth gains that we find are comparable to the ones of the previous studies. growth, innovation, total factor productivity, Solow residual, spillovers...|$|E

This paper, using data on French firms, shows {{that most of}} the trade collapse is accounted by the intensive margin of large exporters but that many small exporters were forced to reduce both the number of products exported and destinations served or to stop exporting altogether. Small and large exporters su ered quantitatively proportional trade losses. Nonetheless, large fi rms absorbed the shock mostly by downsizing the value of exports and smaller rms by ceasing trade relationships. The di erential impact of the trade collapse on rms also had a distinct sectoral dimension, with firms exporting intermediate and <b>equipment</b> <b>goods</b> su ffering the worst losses. Finally, we find clear econometric evidence that the impact was greatest for nancially constrained firms, in particular if they were active in the sectors of high financial dependence.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} intra-Asia exchange rate volatility on intra-Asia trade in primary goods, intermediate goods, <b>equipment</b> <b>goods,</b> and consumption goods from 1980 to 2009. For Asia, the evidence shows that as intraregional exchange rate volatility increases, intraregional exports in these goods fall. This adverse impact is even more pronounced in the sub-region of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) + 5 comprising ASEAN member countries plus the People's Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Japan; the Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China; and especially among intermediate and equipment exports. Again, the impact magnifies in an even smaller sub-group excluding the smaller ASEAN economies. These results underline the significant impact of exchange rate volatility on the region's production networks. For South Asia, however, exchange rate volatility {{appears to have a}} positive impact on exports. Still, caution is warranted given that South Asian economies trade relatively little with each other. exchange rate volatility; trade; ASEAN; East Asia...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a comparative statics {{analysis of the}} potential impact of oil price rises on the EU economy. The macroeconomic and sectoral effects of such oil shocks are quantitatively assessed for two basic scenarios with the GEM-E 3 world model. The first scenario assumes a crisis leading to an increase of 10 $ per barrel of oil. The second one consists of a much deeper energy crisis, and translates into a rise of 30 $ per barrel of oil. The crude petroleum, petroleum refineries and energy-intensive sectors undergo a significant fall in their value-added. Almost 40 % of the overall GDP fall comes from the Other market service sector, while the Trade and Transport sector and the Other <b>equipment</b> <b>goods</b> sector represent each approximately 10 % of the overall GDP fall. The GDP losses for the EU as a whole are 0. 94 % in the first scenario and 2. 56 % in the second. The macroeconomic impact is slightly lower in the USA (0. 81 % an...|$|E
40|$|The {{capital-output ratio}} {{is more than}} 40 % lower in the poor {{countries}} than in the richest ones. Comparing TFP in manufacturing and in the economy at large, we show that the Balassa-Samuelson effect explains the bulk of this scarcity: TFP in manufacturing is indeed about 40 % lower than TFP in the aggregate economy. This discrepancy is one for one translated into higher prices of <b>equipment</b> <b>goods,</b> which explains that capital is scarce in volume, but not in value terms. This quantifies our interpretation of the Lucas paradox. When focusing on manufacturing, a tradable sector for which relative prices differences should not be essential, the initial paradox is actually turned into an anti-Lucas paradox: {{it is in the}} poorest countries that the capital output ratio is higher. We argue that lack of productive infrastructure is essential in explaining this anti-paradox. We finally examine the role of institutional quality. We show that public capital under provision, as reflected in low levels of infrastructure stock, is the key channel through which poor institutions hamper capital accumulationLucas paradox; Total factor productivity...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} new econometric {{evidence on}} the relationship between total factor productivity growth and the R&D expenditures of Canadian manufacturing industries in the presence of interindustry and international spillovers of technology. In contrast to studies that presume that international spillovers are incorporated in imports of intermediate and/or capital <b>equipment</b> <b>goods,</b> the present paper assumes that the principal channel of transmission of new technology is foreign direct investment. Three original proxies for international spillovers use information on patenting, the size and the origin of foreign ownership in the host country and the R&D expenditures in the country of origin. The results suggest that the nexus between industry's own R&D expenditures and the TFP growth is significant and positive, especially for the process-related R&D. Domestic interindustry spillovers of new technology have a larger effect on TFP than industry's own R&D expenditures. All three proxies for international technology spillovers are associated positively and significantly with TFP growth. However, international spillovers contribute to TFP growth less than domestic interindustry spillovers and less than own process-related R&D.

40|$|The {{relative}} price of capital (or <b>equipment)</b> <b>goods</b> {{with respect to}} consumption goods is strongly, negatively correlated with income per capita in cross-sections of countries. This stylized fact suggests that economic growth takeoffs are associated with changes {{in the direction of}} technical change. It also suggests that increases in productivity that are embodied in capital goods lead to relatively quicker growth. The goal {{of this paper is to}} explore the message of the discrete-time Ramsey model with logarithmic utility, augmented with endogenous direction of technical change. We suppose that the representative agent, while initially at steady state, is offered the possibility to increase either labor-augmenting productivity or investment-specific productivity. We derive the marginal increase in utility from each option. We find that when the elasticity of substitution, the capital share and the rate of impatience lie within the usual ranges, investment-specific technological change is relatively undervalued, because its fruits take relatively more time to materialize. This approach reflects some interesting ideas on the macroeconomics of structural change. However, its predictions stand at odds with cross-country evidence as well as with the early British growth experience (~ 1770 – 1913). We argue that the fixity of the production function constitutes a major obstacle for a consistent theory of the direction of technological changes on neoclassical bases...|$|E
