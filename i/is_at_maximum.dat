25|$|Jet {{engines are}} {{referred}} to as operating wet when afterburning is being used and dry when the engine is used without afterburning. An engine producing maximum thrust wet <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> power or max reheat (this is the maximum power the engine can produce); an engine producing maximum thrust dry is at military power or max dry.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} figure, the two {{orthogonal}} components {{have the same}} amplitudes and are 90° out of phase. In this case, one component is zero when the other component <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> or minimum amplitude. There are two possible phase relationships that satisfy this requirement: the x component can be 90° ahead of the y component {{or it can be}} 90° behind the y component. In this special case, the electric vector traces out a circle in the plane, so this polarization is called circular polarization. The rotation direction in the circle depends on which of the two phase relationships exists and corresponds to right-hand circular polarization and left-hand circular polarization.|$|E

40|$|Estimates from sonic data of removed {{overburden}} burial anomalies rely on {{identification of}} normal velocity–depth trends for relatively homogenous lithological units. In the North Sea, such trends {{are difficult to}} establish for Mesozoic formations that rarely <b>are</b> found <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> burial and hydrostatic pressure. The analysis of erosional history based on sonic data can, however, be developed further where two homogeneous units are encountered in the same wells, because the two units {{may or may not}} have <b>been</b> simultaneously <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> burial <b>at</b> a given location. If the two units <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> burial depth simultaneously prior to the most recent erosional event, the burial anomalies for the two units should be identical. If, however, the lower unit <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> burial before the upper unit, due to an intervening erosional event, the burial anomaly for the lower unit should exceed that of the upper unit. In the North Sea, Neogene erosion can be estimated from burial anomalies for the Upper Cretaceous–Danian Chalk Group. This allows corrections to be made of the depths of pre-Chalk formations to the situation prior to the onset of Neogene erosion. The normal trend for the pre-Chalk formation can now be traced more easily in a plot of velocity versus corrected depth, because the pre-Chalk formation <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> burial <b>at</b> more locations prior to Neogene erosion. This procedure is used to derive baselines for a Lower Jurassic shale unit, and for the Lower Triassic Bunter Shale and Bunter Sandstone using data from 123 British and Danish wells.

25|$|The Sun's major {{component}} of magnetic field reverses direction every 11 years (so the period is about 22 years), resulting in a diminished magnitude of magnetic field near reversal time. During this dormancy, the sunspots activity <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> (because {{of the lack of}} magnetic braking on plasma) and, as a result, massive ejection of high energy plasma into the solar corona and interplanetary space takes place. Collisions of neighboring sunspots with oppositely directed magnetic fields result in the generation of strong electric fields near rapidly disappearing magnetic field regions. This electric field accelerates electrons and protons to high energies (kiloelectronvolts) which results in jets of extremely hot plasma leaving the Sun's surface and heating coronal plasma to high temperatures (millions of kelvin).|$|E

[...] A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.|$|E
