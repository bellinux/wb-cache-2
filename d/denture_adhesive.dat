Later, in 1937 he fabricated acrylic veneers to be retained by <b>denture</b> <b>adhesive,</b> which were only cemented temporarily because there was very little adhesion.The introduction of etching in 1959 by Dr. Michael Buonocore aimed to follow a line of investigation of bonding porcelain veneers to etched enamel.Research in 1982 by Simonsen and Calamia revealed that porcelain could be etched with hydrofluoric acid, and bond strengths could be achieved between composite resins and porcelain that were predicted to be able to hold porcelain veneers on to the surface of a tooth permanently. This was confirmed by Calamia in an article describing a technique for fabrication, and placement of Etched Bonded Porcelain Veneers using a refractory model technique and Horn describing a platinum foil technique for veneer fabrication. Additional articles have proven the long-term reliability of this technique.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: There {{have been}} few reports in the dental {{literature}} {{on the number of}} denture wearers who regularly use <b>denture</b> <b>adhesive.</b> The objectives of this study were to see what the incidence of usage of <b>denture</b> <b>adhesive</b> was by a surveyed edentulous population, to determine the degree of success of its usage and the reasons for its current use or nonuse. METHODS: In this study, 146 patients attending the Adelaide Dental Hospital for denture treatment were surveyed regarding their usage of <b>denture</b> <b>adhesive,</b> using a prepared questionnaire. The surveyed group was divided into three categories [...] those who had never tried <b>denture</b> <b>adhesive,</b> those who had tried <b>denture</b> <b>adhesive</b> but no longer used it, and those who currently used <b>denture</b> <b>adhesive.</b> RESULTS: In the survey, there were 52 males (35. 6 %) and 94 females (64. 4 %) and 96 (65. 7 %) were over 60 years of age.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{generate}} discussion and communication among a group of general dentists in Tehran on their viewpoints regarding denture adhesives. Have they accepted <b>denture</b> <b>adhesive</b> as a material to enhance denture retention, stability and function? Materials and Methods: In the summer of 2007, a questionnaire was mailed to 300 general dentists who were assigned with a random systematic sampling method from general dentists in Tehran. The questions were arranged in two parts of evaluating knowledge and attitude. In evaluation of knowledge, dentists were classified into groups of good, moderate, weak and lack of knowledge. In evaluation of attitude, dentists were classified into positive, moderate and negative groups. (Evaluating attitude was carried out in good and moderate groups of knowledge.) Results: The study showed that 14 &#x 0025;, 32 &#x 0025; and 37 &#x 0025; of the general dentists had respectively good, moderate and weak knowledge toward <b>denture</b> <b>adhesive</b> while 16. 3 &#x 0025; had no knowledge about this material.

The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to establish the effect of a new <b>denture</b> <b>adhesive</b> on maximum bite force until denture dislodgement (BFDD) after adhesive application. Materials and Methods: Fifteen denture-wearing patients (7 female, 8 male, mean age: 64 years) were involved in the study.
