Lett. 104, 076101 (2010) ]. Our model assumes an intermode coupling between the CO frustrated translation (FT) and frustrated rotation (FR) modes with a weak and strong <b>electronic</b> friction <b>coupling</b> to hot electrons, respectively, and heat transfer between the FT mode and the substrate phonons. In this model the effective <b>electronic</b> friction <b>coupling</b> of the FT mode depends on the absorbed laser fluence F through {{the temperature of the}} FR mode. The calculated hopping yield as a function of F nicely reproduces the nonlinear increase observed above F= 4. 0 J/m(2). It is found that the electronic heating via friction coupling nor the phonon coupling alone cannot explain the experimental result. Both heatings are cooperatively responsible for CO hopping on Cu (111). The electronic heat transfer dominates over the phononic one at high F, where the effective <b>electronic</b> friction <b>coupling</b> becomes larger than the phononic coupling...|$|R

This paper reports the first experimental confirmation of synchronization of hyperchaos in time-delayed <b>electronic</b> oscillators <b>coupled</b> indirectly through a common environment. We confirm the occurrence of in-phase and inverse-phase synchronization phenomena in the coupled system through the dynamical measures like generalized autocorrelation function, correlation of probability of recurrence, {{and the concept of}} localized sets computed directly from the experimental time-series data. We also present a linear stability analysis of the coupled system. The experimental and analytical results are further supported by the detailed numerical analysis of the coupled system. Apart from the above mentioned measures, we numerically compute another quantitative measure, namely, Lyapunov exponent spectrum of the coupled system that confirms the transition from the in-phase (inverse-phase) synchronized state to the complete (anti-) synchronized state with the increasing coupling strength.

50|$|Supramolecular {{chemistry}} is {{the domain of}} chemistry beyond that of molecules and focuses on the chemical systems {{made up of a}} discrete number of assembled molecular subunits or components. The forces responsible for the spatial organization may vary from weak (intermolecular forces, electrostatic or hydrogen bonding) to strong (covalent bonding), provided that the degree of <b>electronic</b> <b>coupling</b> between the molecular component remains small with respect to relevant energy parameters of the component. While traditional chemistry focuses on the covalent bond, supramolecular chemistry examines the weaker and reversible noncovalent interactions between molecules. These forces include hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, van der Waals forces, pi-pi interactions and electrostatic effects. Important concepts that have been demonstrated by supramolecular chemistry include molecular self-assembly, folding, molecular recognition, host-guest chemistry, mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures, and dynamic covalent chemistry. The study of non-covalent interactions is crucial to understanding many biological processes from cell structure to vision that rely on these forces for structure and function.

50|$|Using {{the same}} {{principles}} pioneered by 2D-NMR experiments, multidimensional optical spectroscopy is possible using ultrafast pulses. Different frequencies can probe various dynamic molecular processes to differentiate between inhomogeneous and homogeneous line broadening as well as identify coupling between the measured spectroscopic transitions. If two oscillators are coupled together, be it intramolecular vibrations or intermolecular <b>electronic</b> <b>coupling,</b> the added dimensionality will resolve anharmonic responses not identifiable in linear spectra. A typical 2D pulse sequence consists of an initial pulse to pump the system into coherent superposition of states, followed by a phase conjugate second pulse that pushes the system into a non-oscillating excited state, and finally, a third pulse that converts back to a coherent state that produces a measurable pulse. A 2D frequency spectrum can then be recorded by plotting the Fourier transform of the delay {{between the first and}} second pulses on one axis, and the Fourier transform of the delay between a detection pulse relative to the signal-producing third pulse on the other axis. 2D spectroscopy is an example of a four wave mixing experiment, and the wavevector of the signal will be the sum of the three incident wavevectors used in the pulse sequence.
