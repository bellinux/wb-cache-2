As such they denature keratin, irritate and <b>defat</b> the skin, and remove water from it. Work gloves have been worn over plastic gloves and separate, reusable, cotton inner gloves {{have been added to}} absorb sweat since skin problems were first recognized in 1994. All 74 males (mean ± SD, 38. 8 ± 8. 0 years) who work with the fluids were interviewed and given cutaneous examinations when indicated. While 4 cases of severe dermatitis and 31 cases of mild dermatitis were identified, 28 individuals gave a history of similar problems since the use of lubricating fluids. Their symptoms were typical of primary skin irritation. The hands were the commonly affected region (63 of 63 cases: 100 %), followed by the thighs (15. 9 %) and trunk (11. 1 %). The work-related skin symptoms identified were less common in workers who immediately removed the liquid with soap and water, when it is spilled on the hands, than in those who did not, but the difference was not statistically significant (7 / 23 (30. 4 %) vs. 28 / 51 (54. 9 %), p= 0. 051 by chi-square test).

The samples were first ground into powder and soaked in chloroform/dichloromethane to <b>defat</b> them and in essence produce the fat soluble fraction (filtrate). The defatted residues were soaked in methanol for 24 hours to obtain a methanol soluble fraction. This was finally fractioned in a mixture of BuOH/H 2 O (1 : 1) to give the butanol-soluble (BUS) and water-soluble (WAS) fractions respectively. These fractions were subsequently concentrated by rotary evaporation. The fat-soluble (FAS), BUS, and WAS phases were able to inhibit HbS polymerisation to varying degrees from 50 % for FAS to 95 % for BUS. The water-soluble phases of these samples were also found to increase the Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + ratio from 6 % to 95 %. The phases equally reduced LDII activity in serum of ten sickle cell disease patients to varying degrees from 12 % to 40 %. Nutritionally, the different fractions or phases were found to be rich in free amino acids which ranged from 951. 05 mg/ 100 g of sample for tilapia to 1906. 05 mg/ 100 g of sample for crayfish (Astacus; red). The soluble protein concentration of the samples was equally estimated. Dried tilapia has an aggregate protein content of 28. 7. 30 mg/ 100 g of sample while dried prawn has 1626 mg/ 100 g of sample.

The cosmetic result of this flap is uncertain during the main reconstructive procedure, so free flap contouring in head and neck reconstruction following cancer ablation is usually performed at the end of therapy. To obtain an adequate symmetry of the flap a safe thinning during the primary inset or a secondary <b>defatting</b> may be performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS, The study includes 45 patients underwent reconstruction with ALTF for head and neck tumors. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (20 patients underwent a primary thinning of the flap), Group 2 (25 patient underwent a secondary debulking of the flap). Patients were evaluated in terms of total number of cosmetic reconstruction procedures performed, hospital stay and aesthetic satisfaction. RESULTS, Epidemiological analysis showed an average age of 51 years old in patients. Patients were affected by squamous cell carcinoma in 33 cases. Within Group 1, 14 patients underwent surgery only once, 5 underwent surgery twice and one patient three times. In group 2, 8 patients underwent surgery once, 10 patients twice, 3 patients three times and 4 patients four times.
