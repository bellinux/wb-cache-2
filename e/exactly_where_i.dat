So let the people in Chicago enjoy Ferris Bueller." ...|$|E
500|$|Oxford cox Acer Nethercott said [...] "Our bowman {{came off}} {{his seat and}} could not {{continue}} properly – it was race over after that." [...] Regarding the rejected appeal, he claimed that the umpire [...] "had laid down to both coxes before the race {{that there was a}} way he wanted to conduct the race. [...] And then he did something completely different in the race." [...] Kennelly, the bowman, claimed he was [...] "100 per cent confident that if what happened didn't happen we would have won" [...] while Cambridge cox Kenelm Richardson stated [...] "The umpire was very good and told me to hold my line, so I knew I was <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> needed to be".|$|E

"Tuscan Leather" [...] {{generated}} controversy with label mate Nicki Minaj for the line: [...] "Not even talkin' to Nicki, {{communication is}} breakin' / I {{dropped the ball}} on some personal shit, I need to embrace it / I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it / Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'," [...] Speaking of the line, Drake {{said in an interview}} with MTV News: [...] "That line in 'Tuscan Leather' isn't <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am in my life right now, but like a year ago...eight months, seven months ago, it was how I felt, I'd done something wrong, and I wasn't speaking to her." ...|$|E
500|$|Hubbard is {{therefore}} portrayed, {{as he put}} it himself, as a man who [...] "knew <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was going" [...] from the age of three. He is presented as a person who constantly worked towards a single objective. Each event in his life is seen as a stepping stone along the way to the development of Dianetics and Scientology. He is cast as a singular and forward-thinking individual whose unique qualities and knowledge are essential prerequisites for his discoveries. As the Church puts it, [...] "even in his early youth he exemplified a rare sense of purpose and dedication which, combined with his adventurous spirit, made him a living legend." [...] The story of Hubbard's early life, as told by the Church, is closely related to Scientology's own self-image as a synthesis of Western scientific precision with Eastern philosophy. His claimed knowledge of these fields and practices underlines his claim to have founded a religion that combines the best of both to appeal to all people.|$|E

2500|$|Eden {{reported}} that Crowhurst's sailing techniques were good, [...] "But I felt his navigation was a mite slapdash. I prefer, {{even in the}} Channel, to know <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am. He didn't take too much bother with it, merely jotting down figures on a few sheets of paper from time to time." [...] After struggling against westerlies and having to tack out into the Channel twice they arrived at 2.30pm on 15 October, where an enthusiastic BBC film crew started filming Eden in the belief he was Crowhurst. There were 16 days to get ready before the race's deadline on 31 October.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's {{claim that he}} tipped off Patterson exactly {{where to look for}} a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told me he had cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he went down there <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> told him. I told him, 'You go down there and hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E
2500|$|For the First Test against New Zealand Snow {{was told}} by the {{chairman}} of the selectors Alec Bedser that he was dropped so that they could watch Alan Ward in a Test match, but Illingworth rang {{in the middle of the}} Essex vs Sussex match to tell Snow straight that he was dropped for disobeying his orders in the Test. Snow was particularly annoyed as a television firm had arranged to film him at Lord's to make a fifteen-minute programme with John Betjeman about his poem Lords' Test, which was now cancelled. [...] The immediate recipients of Snow's wrath were Essex (6/20) and Hampshire (5/29 & 5/51) to give Sussex their first two wins of the season. He and Illingworth sorted out their differences and [...] "I was to know <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stood with him as did every other player who came under his captaincy". He was recalled for the Second and Third Tests, which were won easily, but Snow took only 3 wickets (51.33), but by dint of being out only once that summer he averaged 50.00 with the bat. In 1969–71 Snow would make 276 runs (34.50) in Tests, so could be regarded as an all-rounder.|$|E

6000|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the villages adjacent would in pity carry them food, and set it at a distance, that they might fetch it if they were able; and sometimes they were not able.

5000|$|According to Sho Baraka, {{the album}} title and concept {{was based on}} the essay Talented Tenth by W. E. B. Du Bois.

Du Bois and Frederick Douglass, and I started reading books about them and the struggle of slavery, post-slavery and the African American plight. Then I stumbled upon Du Bois' Talented 10th, the book he wrote, and it spoke <b>exactly</b> to <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am. <b>Where</b> you have {{a group of people who}} are struggling, who are in pain, whether it be economic, physical or spiritual, but you have people around who have answers, resources, gifts, talents who can help those individuals.And so the whole concept of the album is, based off the book, is kind of like people who have time, talent and treasure using those gifts to the benefit of other folks.
