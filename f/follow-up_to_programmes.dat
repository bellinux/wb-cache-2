The data from this survey, which was conducted in late 2000, was complemented with selected information from the Eighth United Nations Inquiry among Governments on Population and Development, conducted by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs at the United Nations Secretariat in 1998, and from the Inquiry on Country-Level Experiences since the International Conference on Population and Development, which was conducted, also in 1998, by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA);...|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} {{that there is little}} point in putting energy into {{teaching}} literacy if there is no <b>follow-up</b> <b>programme</b> <b>to</b> establish reading habits. The U. P. N. G. Extension Studies Book Programme has highlighted three needs in relation to this: 1) the need to take the books to the people rather than waiting for the people to come to the books, 2) the need to provide books that are easy enough for people to enjoy, and 3) the need for ongoing commitment <b>to</b> the <b>programme.</b> It {{is argued that}} the the reading habit is not only a missing link between literacy and libraries, but it is a link so vital that at every level from village to university the people in PNG are drastically underachieving in their daily work...|$|R
40|$|Background: The World Health Organization {{estimates}} that in sub-Saharan Africa about 4 million HIV-infected patients had started antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{by the end}} of 2008. Loss of patients <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> and care is an important problem for treatment programmes in this region. As mortality is high in these patients compared to patients remaining in care, ART programmes with high rates of loss <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> may substantially underestimate mortality of all patients starting ART. Methods and Findings: We developed a nomogram to correct mortality estimates for loss <b>to</b> <b>follow-up,</b> {{based on the fact that}} mortality of all patients starting ART in a treatment programme is a weighted average of mortality among patients lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> and patients remaining in care. The nomogram gives a correction factor based on the percentage of patients lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> at a given point in time, and the estimated ratio of mortality between patients lost and not lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up.</b> The mortality observed among patients retained in care is then multiplied by the correction factor to obtain an estimate of programme-level mortality that takes all deaths into account. A web calculator directly calculates the corrected, programme-level mortality with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). We applied the method <b>to</b> 11 ART <b>programmes</b> in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients retained in care had a mortality at 1 year of 1. 4 % to 12. 0 %; loss <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> ranged from 2. 8 % to 28. 7 %; and the correction factor from 1. 2 to 8. 0. The absolute difference between uncorrected and corrected mortality at 1 year ranged from 1. 6 % to 9. 8 %, and was above 5 % in four programmes. The largest difference in mortality was in a programme with 28. 7 % of patients lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> at 1 year. Conclusions: The amount of bias in mortality estimates can be large in ART programmes with substantial loss <b>to</b> <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Programmes</b> should routinely report mortality among patients retained in care and the proportion of patients lost. A simple nomogram can then be used to estimate mortality among all patients who started ART, for a range of plausible mortality rates among patients lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up...</b>|$|R

30|$|We analyse {{the data}} from the Polish <b>Follow-up</b> Study <b>to</b> the <b>Programme</b> for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (postPIAAC). The main goals of the study were to gather {{longitudinal}} information on PIAAC respondents in Poland and to collect additional background information not available in the international study. The background questionnaire (BQ) of postPIAAC is based on the PIAAC international questionnaire with many additional questions and some modifications. The methodology of collecting labour market outcomes was not changed. Regarding other outcomes, a question on life satisfaction was added and the question on political efficacy was removed, leaving the rest of the social indicators unchanged (health and trust). The BQ was administered as a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI). The study included parts with direct assessment, both on computer (a working memory test and a basic ICT skills test) and on paper (a coding speed test, a Big Five personality test and a self-assessment of skills). The Grit test was part of the BQ. The analysis is based on postPIAAC data combined with the proficiency estimates from PIAAC. The interval between the interviews for an individual respondent is from 2.5 to 3.5  years. The analysis thus assumes that respondents’ cognitive skills have not changed significantly between the two waves.|$|R

40|$|Objectives  To {{assess the}} {{proportion}} of patients lost <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> (died, lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up,</b> transferred out) between HIV diagnosis and start of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa, and determine factors associated with loss <b>to</b> <b>programme.</b> Methods  Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for studies in adults. Outcomes were the percentage of patients dying before starting ART, the percentage lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up,</b> the percentage with a CD 4 cell count, the distribution of first CD 4 counts {{and the percentage of}} eligible patients starting ART. Data were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. Results  Twenty-nine studies from sub-Saharan Africa including 148   912 patients were analysed. Six studies covered the whole period from HIV diagnosis to ART start. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that of the 100 patients with a positive HIV test, 72 (95 % CI 60 - 84) had a CD 4 cell count measured, 40 (95 % CI 26 - 55) were eligible for ART and 25 (95 % CI 13 - 37) started ART. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies (P <  0. 0001). Median CD 4 cell count at presentation ranged from 154 to 274  cells/μl. Patients eligible for ART were less likely to become lost <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> (25 %vs. 54 %, P <  0. 0001), but eligible patients were more likely to die (11 %vs. 5 %, P <  0. 0001) than ineligible patients. Loss <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> was higher in men, in patients with low CD 4 cell counts and low socio-economic status and in recent time periods. Conclusions  Monitoring and care in the pre-ART time period need improvement, with greater emphasis on patients not yet eligible for ART...|$|R
