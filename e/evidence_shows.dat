5|$|Restricted driver {{visibility}} {{due to the}} air-smoothed casing {{and soft}} steam exhaust from the multiple-jet blastpipe. The exhaust problem was never adequately resolved, and smoke continued to beat down onto the casing while moving, obscuring the driver's vision. There was much experimentation in order to resolve this problem, {{with varying degrees of}} success, and photographic <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> the many guises of this project.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to create an {{evaluation}} tool that would be the new standard for evaluating clinical competencies of interns in the field of orientation and mobility (O&M). Using results from previous research in this area, specific competency skills were identified and the O&M Clinical Competency Evaluation Matrix (CCEM) was developed. O&M university faculty were surveyed to gather content evidence. After revisions were made to the O&M CCEM, the evaluation tool was piloted with O&M clinical internship supervisors and validity and reliability evidence was examined. The combination of all the validity evidence supported the intended inferences. The content <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> that experts in the field agreed that the O&M CCEM as a whole was representative of the content area. The internal structure <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> that scores on the O&M CCEM could be interpreted as measuring clinical competency in relation to standard teaching skills, O&M specific skills, and advanced O&M instruction skills. The external structure <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> that scores on the O&M CCEM are related to scores on the ACVREP evaluation form. The practicality <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> that the tool is useful for measuring clinical competence. In addition, the internal consistency reliability <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> that there was consistency in ratings within dimensions and the inter-rater reliability <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> there was moderate consistency in ratings between supervisors...|$|R

5|$|Species {{that were}} unable {{to adapt to the}} {{changing}} environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species.

5|$|The grape was domesticated between 7,000 and 4,000 BC {{between the}} Black Sea and Persia; archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> that wine {{was being made}} there by 6,000 BC, {{reaching}} Greece and Crete in the fifth millennium BC and Spain by the last millennium BC. Winemaking started in Italy in the ninth century BC, and in France around 600 BC.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{focused on}} the 17th Street and London Avenue canals, where <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> they were {{breached}} even though water did not flow over their tops, indicating a design or construction flaw.

5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68Mya and lasted more than 2 million years. The most recent <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> that the traps erupted over a period of 800,000 years spanning the K–Pg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
5|$|Fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> {{the golden}} white-eye once also {{occurred}} on Tinian and Rota but was extirpated in those locations through {{the impact of}} human activities. Despite its current abundance on Saipan and Aguijan, {{and the fact that}} it has among the highest recorded densities for any bird, it is nevertheless considered to be critically endangered. It is threatened by the invasive brown tree snake, which has become established on nearby Guam, and this predator is expected to cause a rapid decline in the population if it reaches Saipan. Efforts are under way to control the snakes and breed the white-eye in zoos.|$|E
30|$|Dextran and gelatins: Other {{synthetic}} colloids (dextran and gelatins) are {{not well}} studied in the literature. Although there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>showing</b> harm beyond what is seen with other colloids, {{there is also no}} <b>evidence</b> <b>showing</b> benefit. In light of the lack of evidence, and the theoretical potential for adverse effect, the suggestion is not to use gelatins or dextran.|$|R

5|$|Geological <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> the Thera volcano erupted {{numerous}} times over {{several hundred thousand}} years before the Minoan eruption. In a repeating process, the volcano would violently erupt, then eventually collapse into a roughly circular seawater-filled caldera, with numerous small islands forming the circle. The caldera would slowly refill with magma, building a new volcano, which erupted and then collapsed in an ongoing cyclical process.|$|E
5|$|In 1203, Thomas of Marlborough, {{who was a}} monk of Evesham Abbey, pleaded a {{case for}} Evesham before Archbishop Walter, and later, in his chronicle, he noted that Simon, John of Tynemouth, and Honorius, all canon lawyers from the archbishop's household, sided with the abbey. He also {{described}} the three men as magistri mei in scholis. Surviving <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> that Simon and John frequently found themselves on opposing sides of cases, which suggests a rivalry between the two over their expositions of canon law. Thomas appears to have studied under Simon, John and Honorius at Oxford.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} part of its range, the species often occurs with the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), but no <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> they compete with each other. In the south, the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) and the rice rat regularly occur together; water levels are known to influence relative abundance of these two species in Florida. The cotton rat is mainly active during the day, which may help differentiate its niche from that of the rice rat.|$|E

5|$|Miles {{subsequently}} {{supported the}} Empress, and in 1146, Ranulf, the Earl of Chester and temporarily {{on the side}} of the king, attacked and took the town of Bedford, but was unable to take the castle, which continued to be controlled by Miles until his death several years later. Towards the end of the war, Bedford Castle may have been attacked again; Henry II, during the final year of the conflict in 1153, marched through Bedford and documentary <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> damage to the town at this time. Historians are divided as to whether the castle was besieged at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Paleoenvironmental <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> {{that between}} the 9th and 11th centuries the area around Buckton Castle was cleared of woodland. This left little timber, and may have {{factored}} into the use of stone as a building material. The earliest castles in England typically used timber, at least {{when they were first}} built, and building in stone was more expensive than earth and timber. It became more common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael was not Jewish. Slive reports that, {{because of}} Ruisdael's {{depiction}} of a Jewish cemetery and various biblical names in the Ruisdael family, he often heard speculation that Ruisdael must surely be Jewish. The <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> otherwise. Ruisdael {{was buried in the}} Saint Bavo's Church, Haarlem, a Protestant church at that time. His uncle Salomon van Ruysdael belonged to the Young Flemish subgroup of the Mennonite congregation, one of several types of Anabaptists in Haarlem, and it is probable that Ruisdael's father was also a member there. His cousin Jacob was a registered Mennonite in Amsterdam.|$|E

Photographic <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> that four Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns were added, one pair to her searchlight platform and the other pair on the bridge wings, although Ottawa retained her 2-pounder guns even after the Oerlikons were added. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|The great Orcadian Neolithic monuments were {{constructed}} almost a millennium before the sarsen stones of Stonehenge were erected. At one {{time it was}} believed that this flowering of culture was essentially peripheral and that its origins were to be found to the south on mainland Great Britain. However, recently discovered <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> that Orkney was the starting place for much of the megalithic culture, including styles of architecture and pottery, that developed much later in the southern British Isles.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} {{range of}} the species included much of the southern half of the United States, and in the south extended much farther to cover most of the South American continent. In total, its northern range has receded 1,000km (621mi) southward and its southern range 2,000km (1243mi) northward. Ice age fossils of the jaguar, dated between 40,000 and 11,500 years ago, have been discovered in the United States, including some at an important site {{as far north as}} Missouri. Fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>shows</b> jaguars of up to 190kg (420lb), much larger than the contemporary average for the animal.|$|E
