5|$|As <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying is an American metalcore {{band from}} San Diego, California. Founded in 2000 by vocalist Tim Lambesis, the {{establishment}} of the band's first full lineup, which included drummer Jordan Mancino, occurred in 2001. As <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying has released six albums, one split album, and two compilation albums.|$|E
5|$|Although As <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 As <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying started {{recording}} {{a new album}} titled An Ocean Between Us, which was released on August 21, 2007. Debuting at No.8 on the Billboard 200 and No.1 on the Top Rock chart, with first-week sales of 39,000 units, the album was the highest charting release for the band.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} band Society's Finest, {{in which he}} played guitar, vocalist Tim Lambesis formed As <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying in 2000. Starting out as a duet with drummer Jordan Mancino, they first met as a band in February 2001. They both were in the {{hardcore}} punk band Point of Recognition. The band's name came from the novel {{of the same name}} by William Faulkner that was published in 1930; although the band's lyrics and music are not directly inspired by the novel.|$|E
5|$|In its 2006 in Review issue (February 2007), Revolver {{magazine}} dubbed Christian metal {{the phenomenon}} of the year. Editor in Chief Tom Beaujour interviewed the lead vocalists of As <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying, Demon Hunter, Norma Jean, and Underoath (Tim Lambesis, Ryan Clark, Cory Brandan Putman, and Spencer Chamberlain, respectively) as the front-page article for the issue. Tooth and Nail Records, P.O.D., Zao, War of Ages, Still Remains, and He Is Legend were also mentioned.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{continue}} on without Lambesis, Mancino, along with ex-members Phil Sgrosso, Nick Hipa, and Josh Gilbert, {{decided to focus}} on a different style of music under a different band name, Wovenwar, with Shane Blay as the vocalist, This project took shape long before Lambesis' plea. although Mancino still remains a member of As <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying. During this period of time Lambesis was also working on music and found time to release the third full length from Austrian Death Machine called Triple Brutal.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} September 2010, {{the actor}} {{acquired}} the rights to Stephen Elliott's The Adderall Diaries, with the intention to adapt, direct, and star in the film. It was announced in January 2011 that the actor has planned to not only star in, but direct himself in The Night Stalker, a film version of author Philip Carlo's book about the 1980s serial killer, Richard Ramirez. Co-screenwriter of the screenplay, Nicholas Constantine, was initially unconvinced that Franco would be right for the movie, until he learned of Franco's {{desire to be a}} director and later watched three of his short films, one of which featured a serial killer, ultimately confirming to the writer that the actor had a darker side. The actor also has plans to direct a film version of William Faulkner's As <b>I</b> <b>Lay</b> Dying.
