5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{business}} career, Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $190 and $250million, including their retirement account, worth between $20 and $100million. Most of that wealth has been held in blind trusts since 2003, some of it offshore. An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in the name of their children. In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes,</b> for an effective tax rate of 14percent. For the years 1990–2010, their effective federal tax rates were above 13percent with an average rate of about 20percent.|$|E
5|$|His third book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) {{entitled}} The FairTax Book, {{explains the}} proposal to implement a national retail sales tax {{in lieu of the}} <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes,</b> payroll taxes, estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the New York Times bestseller list for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks. The paperback released in May 2006 contains additional information, an afterword and several revisions of misstatements made in the hardcover edition. It also spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Boortz claims to have donated 100% of his royalties from the FairTax book to charity and has commented on his radio show that he has not made one cent from the book. As of July 2006, Boortz claims his charitable donations from book proceeds exceed one hundred thousand US dollars. The book is one of his most frequent topics of discussion.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, 2001, a {{group of}} Wilkinson's {{creditors}} filed suit to have his companies seized. During the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, Wilkinson admitted that his liabilities exceeded his assets by $300 million. During the proceedings, {{it was revealed that}} Wilkinson had been financially insolvent since 1992 and was operating a Ponzi scheme, paying his creditors with money borrowed from others rather than his own profits. He had paid no <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> since 1991. At his deposition in June 2001, Wilkinson invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination over 140 times. Wallace's Bookstore was liquidated for just over $31 million, and ecampus.com was sold for $2.5 million. Wilkinson's wife, Martha, also filed for bankruptcy; his sons were forced to sell their homes to repay loans made to them by their father. During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Wilkinsons moved from Lexington to Naples, Florida.|$|E

Schuler {{admitted that}} he did not report $360,000 in business income on his 2002 <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> return. The plea agreement does not resolve any possible civil liability that Fox or Schuler may have for taxes, interest, and penalties relating to their individual <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> relative to tax years 2002-2010.|$|R

40|$|This thesis compares <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> {{imposed on}} {{corporations}} {{in two different}} tax systems: U. S. and Russian. Russian joint stock companies and U. S.

The focus of the paper is {{to find in the}} U. S. tax system advantages which may be successfully adopted by Russia...|$|R
5|$|Soon afterward, Hill {{dropped out}} of the public eye, {{dissatisfied}} with the music industry and suffering with the pressures of fame. Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 (2002), sharply divided critics and sold poorly compared to her first album and work with the Fugees. Hill's subsequent activity, which includes the release of a few songs and occasional festival appearances, has been sporadic. Her behavior has sometimes caused audience dissatisfaction; a reunion with her former group did not last long. Her music, as well as a series of public statements she has issued, has become critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of whom are with Rohan Marley. In 2012, she pleaded guilty to tax evasion for failure to pay <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes,</b> and in 2013, served a three-month prison sentence.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes,</b> and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of his chain of bookstores, Wilkinson pursued other {{business}} ventures in the fields of real estate development, farming, transportation, banking, coal interests, and construction. He purchased several private aircraft to help him tend to his diverse interests throughout the state, and in 1973, created Wilkinson Flying Service to keep the planes busy when he wasn't using them. After investing in the unfinished Bluegrass Commerce Center in Lexington in early 1977, he purchased one-third interest in the Purcell building on Lexington's Vine Street later that year. The building was only partially occupied, but had become more valuable because of the opening of nearby Rupp Arena in October 1976 and a new Hyatt hotel in May 1977. Developers Donald and Dudley Webb developed plans to construct the Vine Center on the block; by May 1979, they had options to buy every property on the block except Wilkinson's interest in the Purcell building. Unwilling to meet Wilkinson's asking price, they instead formed a partnership with him to co-develop the Vine Center. When Wilkinson eventually sold his interest in the venture at the end of 1981, he turned a profit of at least $1.3 million on his investment. Next, he formed a public-private partnership with the city of Lexington to construct the Capital Plaza Hotel in 1983. The city provided $3 million in capital and another $8.5 million in guaranteed loans to supplement Wilkinson's $1.15 million investment. Wallace's Book Stores was given 95% ownership in the hotel, allowing the company to shield $2 million in assets from <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> and claim over $400,000 in tax credits.|$|E
50|$|Tobin is {{a proponent}} of a flat rate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> of 10 percent. His Chicago-based organization, Taxpayers United of America, {{actively}} supported the 1981 <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> cut and <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> indexing. Tobin also supports the proposed balanced budget Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|R
25|$|Another {{argument}} {{that has been}} raised is {{the theory that the}} <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> cannot be assessed against an individual who has not filed the related <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> return. This argument was rejected in Carroll v. United States.|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, {{the number}} and {{percentage}} of Americans who pay no <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> has increased. According to a 2007 report by the Statistics of Income division of the Internal Revenue Service, in 2006 the Internal Revenue Service received 134,372,678 individual <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> returns, of which 90,593,081 (67.42%) showed that they paid or owed <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> for 2005. That is, 32.58% of those Americans who filed <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> returns did not owe any <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> at all for 2005. This percentage increased substantially in 2008, and for 2009 was 47%.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{the dollar}} {{amounts of the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> {{standard}} deduction and personal exemptions for the taxpayer and dependents are adjusted annually to account for inflation. This results in yearly changes to the personal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> brackets even when the <b>Federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> rates remain unchanged.|$|R

50|$|Any amounts {{received}} {{under an}} NPC {{must be recognized}} by the taxpayer {{in accordance with the}} rules governing recognition of such payments in the Treasury Regulations, which may override the taxpayers normal method of accounting for U.S. <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> purposes. (Treas. Reg. § 1.446-3(e)(2)(i)). In general, amounts paid or received under an NPC are treated as ordinary income (and not capital gain) for U.S. <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> purposes, and are sourced by the residence of the recipient (e.g., if a non-U.S. resident receives a payment under an NPC, that payment is, in general, treated as non-U.S. source <b>income</b> for U.S. <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> purposes). The usual result of this treatment is that non-U.S. persons can receive payments on an NPC without outbound U.S. <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> withholding tax being applied. However, the U.S. <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> rules governing NPCs, withholding tax and the taxation of financial products in general is an intricately complicated subject, and taxpayers as a general matter almost always seek the assistance of a competent adviser to assist them in these matters.|$|R

25|$|One tax protester {{argument}} is that the acquittal of a defendant in a Federal criminal tax case proves {{that there is no}} law imposing the <b>Federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> liability, or that the acquittal relieves the defendant of liability for the <b>Federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax.</b> No court has accepted this argument.|$|R
50|$|Hornung argued {{both that}} the Corvette {{was a gift}} and {{therefore}} exempt from <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax,</b> and alternatively that it was constructively received by him in 1961, and therefore was not subject to <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> {{in the year of}} 1962.

25|$|In October 2016, it was {{revealed}} that Trump had claimed a loss of $916 million on his 1995 tax returns. As tax losses from one year can be applied to offset income from future years, the $916 million loss allowed him to reduce or eliminate his taxable income (and consequently his US <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes)</b> during the eighteen year carry forward period. Trump acknowledged he used the loss but declined to provide details such as the specific years the loss was applied.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the legal}} {{analysis}} and claims {{contained in the}} package have been thoroughly discredited, some persons who purchase this or similar packages have used it {{in an attempt to}} justify their decision to stop paying <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes.</b> Hughes made that choice. He failed to file his 2000 through 2002, and 2004 federal tax returns, despite having more than $300,000 in income over that period. In addition to his failure to file returns, Hughes also took affirmative steps to avoid having federal tax withheld from his income, including the filing of fraudulent forms.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, CBO {{estimated}} {{that more than}} half of the combined benefits of 10 major tax expenditures would apply to households in the top 20% income group, and that 17% of the benefit would go to the top 1% households. The top 20% of income earners pay about 70% of <b>federal</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes,</b> excluding payroll taxes. For scale, 50% of the $1.5 trillion in tax expenditures in 2016 was $750 billion, while the U.S. budget deficit was approximately $600 billion. In other words, eliminating the tax expenditures for the top 20% might balance the budget over the short-term, depending on economic feedback effects.|$|E
