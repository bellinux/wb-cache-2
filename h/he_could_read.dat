5|$|Prescott's main {{secondary}} {{source for}} the history was Leopold von Ranke's Fürste und Völker von Süd-Europa im sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhundert, a comprehensive work which included a detailed history of the papacy. Prescott admired Ranke's empirical historical method, and considered his work {{to be the best}} of his predecessors on the subject. He had four copies of the relevant sections of the work reprinted in a large typeface so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> it without assistance. He had made a broad plan of the work by February 1849. Prescott started writing the draft on July 26. At this time, Prescott was a creditor of John White Webster, the chemist and murderer, and he was subsequently involved in his trial.|$|E
5|$|In 1530 Vermigli was {{appointed}} vicar {{of the monastery}} at San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. There he learned Hebrew from a local Jewish doctor so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> the Old Testament scriptures in their original language. Even among those who sought deeper biblical study, it was uncommon for clergy to learn Hebrew, though not unheard of. In 1533 the chapter-general elected Vermigli abbot of the two Lateran monasteries in Spoleto. At this post he was also responsible for two convents. The discipline in the monastic houses in Vermigli's care had been lax before his arrival, and they had {{become a source of}} scandal in Spoleto. There was also a history of power struggle between the Bishop of Spoleto, Francesco Eroli, and the Spoletan abbacy, {{to the point that the}} bishop had excommunicated Vermigli's predecessor, only to be overturned by Rome. Vermigli brought order to his houses and mended the relationship with the bishop.|$|E

On his college application, Zuckerberg stated that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.|$|E
25|$|Gerard {{was born}} in Cremona in {{northern}} Italy. Dissatisfied with the meager philosophies of his Italian teachers, Gerard went to Toledo. There he learned Arabic, initially so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> Ptolemy's Almagest, which had a traditionally high reputation among scholars, but which, before his departure to Castile, was not yet known in Latin translation. The first Latin translation was made, from the Greek around 1160 in Sicily. Although {{we do not have}} detailed information of the date when Gerard went to Castile, it was no later than 1144.|$|E

During his time in secondary school, he was also influenced by Michel Bréal, a leading French philologist who was the grandfather of one of his classmates. By the time that he entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1916, he was already on the road to studying linguistics and the classics.|$|E
25|$|In 1828 Berlioz heard Beethoven's {{third and}} fifth symphonies {{performed}} at the Paris Conservatoire– an experience that he found overwhelming. He also read Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust {{for the first time}} (in French translation), which would become the inspiration for Huit scènes de Faust (his Opus 1), much later re-developed as La damnation de Faust. He also came into contact with Beethoven's string quartets and piano sonatas, and recognised the importance of these immediately. He began to study English so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> Shakespeare. Around the same time, he also started writing musical criticism.|$|E

25|$|Charles Gildon in {{the early}} 18th century {{recommended}} this play for its beautiful reflections, descriptions, similes, and topics. Gildon thought that Shakespeare drew inspiration from the works of Ovid and Virgil, and that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> them in the original Latin and not in later translations. James Halliwell-Phillipps, writing in the 1840s, {{found that there were}} many inconsistencies in the play, but considered it the most beautiful poetical drama ever written. Henry Austin Clapp, writing in 1885, commented on the inconsistency of the time depicted in the play, as it should take place in four days and nights and seems to last less than two, and felt that this added to the unrealistic quality of the play.|$|E
25|$|The first ruler {{from the}} Laye lineage was Kankan Musa Keita (or Moussa), {{also known as}} Mansa Musa. After an entire year without word from Abubakari Keita II, he was crowned Mansa Musa Keita. Mansa Musa Keita {{was one of the}} first truly devout Muslims to lead the Mali Empire. He {{attempted}} to make Islam the faith of the nobility, but kept to the imperial tradition of not forcing it on the populace. He also made Eid celebrations at the end of Ramadan a national ceremony. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> and write Arabic and took an interest in the scholarly city of Timbuktu, which he peaceably annexed in 1324. Via one of the royal ladies of his court, Musa transformed Sankore from an informal madrasah into an Islamic university. Islamic studies flourished thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Rameau {{was taught}} music before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> or write. He was educated at the Jesuit college at Godrans, {{but he was}} not a good pupil and {{disrupted}} classes with his singing, later claiming that his passion for opera had begun at the age of twelve. Initially intended for the law, Rameau decided {{he wanted to be a}} musician, and his father sent him to Italy, where he stayed for a short while in Milan. On his return, he worked as a violinist in travelling companies and then as an organist in provincial cathedrals before moving to Paris for the first time. Here, in 1706, he published his earliest known compositions: the harpsichord works that make up his first book of Pièces de clavecin, which show the influence of his friend Louis Marchand.|$|E

25|$|Born in Regueiro, Ourense province, on 18 November 1809, Manuel Blanco Romasanta was {{originally}} named Manuela {{as it was}} initially {{thought that he was}} female. He was raised as a girl until the age of six when a doctor discovered his true sex. Because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> and write, very rare for the time, it is believed his family was relatively wealthy. As a grown man he worked as a tailor and, according to various accounts, was of small stature, being between 1.37m (4'6") and 1.49m (4'11") in height. Following the death of his wife in 1833, Romasanta became a travelling salesman, initially in Esgos, then eventually throughout Galicia and Portugal. Romasanta was also known to act as a guide for travellers crossing the mountains to Castile, Asturias and Cantabria which gave him further opportunities for trade.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Embleton, Northumberland, {{the son of a}} Congregational minister, the Rev William Stead and Isabella (née Jobson), a {{cultivated}} daughter of a Yorkshire farmer. A year later the family moved to Howdon on the River Tyne, where his younger brother, Francis Herbert Stead, was born. Stead was largely educated at home by his father, and by the age of five he was already well-versed in the Holy Scriptures and {{is said to have been}} able to read Latin almost as well as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> English. It was Stead's mother who perhaps had the most lasting influence on her son's career. One of Stead's favourite childhood memories was of his mother leading a local campaign against the government's controversial Contagious Diseases Acts — which required prostitutes living in garrison towns to undergo medical examination.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before Augustine's {{death the}} Vandals, a Germanic tribe that had {{converted}} to Arianism, invaded Roman Africa. The Vandals besieged Hippo {{in the spring}} of 430, when Augustine entered his final illness. According to Possidius, one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine, the healing of an ill man, took place during the siege. According to Possidius, Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential Psalms of David be hung on his walls so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> them. He directed that the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein should be carefully preserved. He died on 28 August 430. Shortly after his death, the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned not long thereafter and burned the city. They destroyed all of it but Augustine's cathedral and library, which they left untouched.|$|E
