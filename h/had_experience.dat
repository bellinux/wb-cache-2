An Engineer Section headquarters was organised on 24 December 1943, {{only nine}} days before landing, consisting of five officers and five enlisted men. Later a jeep and a driver were {{borrowed from the}} 114th Engineer Battalion to provide transportation. The officers did not know each other and therefore were unaware of each other's capabilities. As it turned out, none of them <b>had</b> <b>experience</b> with amphibious operations, and only one <b>had</b> <b>experience</b> in airbase construction, although {{this was to be}} their most important task.|$|E

5|$|An article {{published}} by Politico in September 2017, cited a self-assessment by the 173rd Airborne Brigade as {{stating that the}} brigade lacked “essential capabilities needed to accomplish its mission effectively and with decisive speed”. The document detailed a number of “capability gaps”, which had been identified during the brigade′s training with Ukrainian troops that <b>had</b> <b>experience</b> fighting against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The report described deficiencies in air defense and electronic warfare units {{as well as an}} over-reliance on satellite communications and GPS navigation systems. These are said to make the unit vulnerable to an enemy with high-end equipment and technology.|$|E

5|$|In late 1999, a {{group of}} men from Hamburg, Germany arrived in Afghanistan, {{including}} Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Bin Laden selected these men because they were educated, could speak English, and <b>had</b> <b>experience</b> living in the West. New recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al-Qaeda leaders consequently discovered that Hani Hanjour already had a commercial pilot's license. Mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in Western clothing.|$|E

50|$|Campus {{sexual assault}} has {{received}} less attention from researchers outside the United States. Studies that have examined sexual assault experiences {{among college students}} in western countries other than the U.S. have found results {{similar to those found}} by American researchers. A 1993 study of a nationally representative sample of Canadian College students found that 28% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> some form of sexual assault in the preceding year, and 45% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> some form of sexual assault since entering college. A 1991 study of 347 undergraduates in New Zealand found that 25.3% <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> rape or attempted rape, and 51.6% <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> some form of sexual victimization. A 2014 study of students in Great Britain found that 25% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> some type of sexual assault while attending university and 7% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> rape or attempted rape as college students.|$|R

In England and Wales, the 1995 [...] "Home Office Research Study 191" [...] found that in the twelve {{months prior to the}} survey, 4.2% of both men and woman between the ages of 16 and 59 had been assaulted by an intimate. The Canadian General Social Survey of 2000 found that from 1994 to 1999, 4% of men and 4% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 22% of men and 28% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 7% of men and 8% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> IPV across all relationships, past and present. The 2005 Canadian General Social Survey, looking at the years 1999-2004 found similar data; 4% of men and 3% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 16% of men and 21% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 6% of men and 7% of women <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> IPV across all relationships, past and present.|$|R

5|$|Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI) {{was hired}} for the film, having {{previously}} worked on Alien 3.

After receiving the director's approval, ADI began to create small sculptures, sketches, paintings, and life-size models.|$|E

On Parsons' recommendation, Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS, because Caltech <b>had</b> <b>experience</b> in building and operating pilot ordnance plants. He had some misgivings about this, because he thought that the Navy might err too far on the side of workplace safety.|$|E

5|$|The most {{effective}} way to purify uranium oxide in a laboratory was {{to take advantage of the}} fact that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether. Scaling this process up for industrial production was a dangerous proposition; ether was explosive, and a factory using large quantities was likely to blow up or burn down. Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis, Missouri, which <b>had</b> <b>experience</b> with ether. Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt's chemical engineers, Henry V. Farr and John R. Ruhoff, on 17 April 1942. Within a few months, sixty tons of highly pure uranium oxide was produced.|$|E
5|$|Unsurprisingly, the {{two teams}} found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already {{concluded}} they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic Caravelle). As neither company <b>had</b> <b>experience</b> {{in the use of}} high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used– above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that Küchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.|$|E
