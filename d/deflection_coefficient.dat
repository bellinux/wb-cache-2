40|$|A {{distributed}} detection scheme {{where the}} sensors transmit with constant modulus signals over a Gaussian multiple access channel is considered. The <b>deflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{of the proposed}} scheme is shown {{to depend on the}} characteristic function of the sensing noise and the error exponent for the system is derived using large deviation theory. Optimization of the <b>deflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> and error exponent are considered with respect to a transmission phase parameter for a variety of sensing noise distributions including impulsive ones. The proposed scheme is also favorably compared with existing amplify-and-forward and detect-and-forward schemes. The effect of fading is shown to be detrimental to the detection performance through a reduction in the <b>deflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> depending on the fading statistics.

40|$|A {{new method}} {{based on an}} optical delay line {{structure}} is proposed for two-dimensional optical beam steering. For one-dimensional beam steering, the laser beam to be deflected is split into N co-directional sub-beams of equal intensity {{with the aid of}} a plane-parallel plate. These sub-beams experience a relative time delay, which translates into a phase difference, thus forming a phased array. When the laser wavelength is tuned, the relative phase varies and the far-field interference footprint can be steered across a receive plane. By employing two plane-parallel plates in series, the described scheme can be extended to produce a twodimensional N × N, array of sub-beams, allowing two-dimensional beam steering via wavelength tuning. In this paper, preliminary experimental results with four sub-beams are presented.

Since the {{performance}} degrades with increasing network lifetime, the <b>deflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{at the threshold}} lifetime may be below the minimum design value, and therefore, TDMA {{may not be a}} feasible design option. For example, in Figure 10, top right graph, the minimum detection performance is specified by D 2 = 6, and therefore, the ALOHA is the design option. At the threshold lifetime, D 2 ≈ 5.2, which is below the minimum design requirement, and therefore, TDMA cannot be used with such design requirements. However, for scarce energy applications, the threshold lifetime gets smaller, so that TDMA maybe the only viable design option to extend the network lifetime, on the expense of degraded detection performance.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we study numerically the {{equatorial}} lensing and quasiequatorial lensing by Kerr black hole pierced by a cosmic string {{in the strong}} deflection limit. We calculate the strong <b>deflection</b> limit <b>coefficients</b> and the <b>deflection</b> angle, which are found to depend closely on the cosmic string parameter β and dimensionless spin a_*. The magnification and positions of relativistic images are also computed in the strong deflection limit and a two-dimensional lens equation is derived. The most important and outstanding effect is that the caustics drift away from the optical axis and shift in the clockwise direction {{with respect to the}} Kerr black hole. For fixed a_* of the black hole, the caustics drift farther away from the optical axis for a large value of β. And for fixed β, they drift farther for high a_*. We also obtain the intersections of the critical curves with the equatorial plane, which decrease with a_* and β. In particular, we obtain a quantity μ̅_k+ 1 /μ̅_k, which is independent of the black hole spin and mass. Thus, through measuring it, one is allowed to determine the value of β from astronomical observations. Comment: 29 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

The aerodynamic properties of plastic screens are found to differ significantly from those of the conventional metal screens, evidently because of differences in the weaving properties.

The 25 -percent chord line of the wing of the model was swept back 35 deg. The airfoil sections of the wing perpendicular to the 25 -percent chord line were 12 percent thick. Measurements were made of the normal force and pitching moment through an angle-of-attack range from about - 3 deg to 14 deg for several ailavator deflections at Mach numbers from 0. 65 to about 1. 08. The results of the tests indicated no adverse effects of compressibility up to a Mach number of at least 0. 85 at low normal-force coefficients and small ailavator deflections. Up to a Mach number of 0. 85, the neutral point at low normal-force coefficients was at about 25 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord and moved rearward irregularly to 41 or 42 percent with a further increase in Mach number to about 1. 05.
