6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{can get a}} guide," [...] said Tom, after a pause. [...] "The Lanings have {{relatives}} at Timber Run. Let's {{write to}} Mr. Laning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> live," [...] {{says the}} constable, then, to Jo. [...] "You live down in Tom-all-Alone's. That's a nice {{innocent}} {{place to live}} in, ain't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Doggedly.) <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{were last}} night. Mr. Knox also <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were. But I'll wager your husband doesn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it isn't Chet--my own son Chet!" [...] {{he burst}} out, joyfully. [...] "I was just wishing {{with all my}} heart that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were." [...] And he shook hands over and over again.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{fortunate}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were, {{and came}} round {{to pick you}} up," [...] he said, {{and turned to the}} head of the station, who leaned upon the balustrade apparently shaken and bewildered by what had happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Friend," [...] {{he said in}} a {{guttural}} voice, [...] "not foe! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> dwell; {{trust and}} follow me, who am of the kin of Rebecca, wife of Nathan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Plainly this, then,' {{said the}} son, {{with an air}} of great concern, 'that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were last night--from being on the spot, indeed--and whom you saw, and what your purpose was.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A ride! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> have been, sir! He {{goes away}} morning after morning, to that little Mr. Ridley's--his chums, papa, {{and he comes}} back with his hands all over horrid paint. He did this morning; you know you did, Clive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{not your}} address," [...] Ned replied. [...] "And even had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were <b>I</b> {{should not have}} dared to write; for there was no saying into whose hands the letter might not fall. But, countess, excuse me if I turn to other matters, for the time presses sorely. You know that the city will be {{attacked}} today." ...|$|R
5000|$|I've {{never seen}} <b>you,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> exactly <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. You - in the center! ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "How coarse! Well, my dear, <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{picked up}} your {{bachelor}} friends. I {{hope this is}} the last of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Though I be in {{the dust}} ere then, [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> will be." [...] And {{shouldering}} suddenly his spear [...] He faded like some elfin fear, [...] Where the tall pines ran up, tier on tier [...] Tree overtoppling tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I know {{something}} about yours, Mr Whittlestaff. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> have set your wishes. And I know that when a man has {{made up his mind}} in such an affair as this, he shouldn't give way to any young diamond dealer of them all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rebuke, Pathfinder! I never {{dreamt of}} saying {{anything}} disagreeable, and {{least of all}} would I think of rebuking you, because a solitary spy and an Indian or two have escaped us. Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were, I think your absence {{the most natural thing}} in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Father Rocco," [...] {{said the}} child, jumping up, with her bread {{in one hand}} and her grapes in the other--"thank you for giving me so much money for my dinner-mats. There they are, tied up {{together}} in one little parcel, in the corner. Nanina said she was ashamed to think of your carrying them; and <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> lived, and <b>I</b> should like to ask you to let me take them home!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{left the}} brig last night, got ashore on the Beaupre side, {{arranged}} for this canoe, and lay dark all day. Then to-night we got alongside and I roused <b>you</b> easily, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> slept. The friar nearly spoiled all {{when you were}} below, but we gagged him and passed him over the side. Ephraim popped on his gown {{so that he might}} go forward to help you without danger, for we were scared at the delay." ...|$|R
60|$|HARRY. I hate your queen opening. It always flummoxes me. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{learned to}} play so well. I never have a chance against you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'His very words, I assure you. I {{told him}} I was. Did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were at present residing? Yes. In London? Yes. He had casually heard, in a {{roundabout}} way, {{that you had}} left your situation with Mr Pecksniff. Was that the fact? Yes, it was. Did you want another? Yes, you did.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' {{how could}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> wass; efter I had been huntin' for nothin' for two days?" [...] {{retorted}} his son. [...] "Wass I {{to think you}} would be stoppin' in the lame camp till you died? Wass it not more likely that some wan would find you an' bring you in--as they did?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, to be sure, mum," [...] said Bob. [...] "Why, {{you must}} ha' dealt wi' no end o' packmen when you war a young lass--before the master here had the luck to {{set eyes on}} you. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> lived, I do,--seen th' house many a time,--close upon Squire Darleigh's,--a stone house wi' steps----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "D'you know," [...] said Nigel at last, [...] "as <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{want me to}} go to, it may be as well, after all, {{that you}} should row!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, there's nothing {{mean about}} me," [...] she returned, in slang rather {{older than she}} ordinarily used. [...] "If you're not here next Tuesday <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{certainly}} did," [...] replied Blair, warmly. [...] "And I lied like a trooper. <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were or how {{you were}}, but I pretended you were O.K." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not till I {{have had}} a talk with you, ch√®re amie. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> have been {{spending}} your vacation, and how you have commenced sacrificing to the graces, and enjoying life like any other belle. I saw you at the concert the other night, dressed, actually, like anybody else. Who is your tailleuse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Crime! Pooh. They don't {{think much}} of such as that over there! Lots of 'em do it... Well, {{if you take it}} like that I shall go back to him! He was very fond of me, and we lived honourable enough, and as respectable as any married couple in the colony! How did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{wanted me}} to bring a letter down here. You see, he kind er thinks <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> live, an' so he told me I'd got to take it. I couldn't help myself, Carrots, 'cause he hung right on, an' jest as likely's not he'd have given me a thumpin' if I hadn't done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt a hankerin', anyway, {{after some}} of the old people of the Castor; for, after having had all that money divided among us, it made me feel as if we belonged to the same family. I suppose that was one reason why I felt a sort of drawing to you, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> Anyway, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> lived, and <b>I</b> came right here, and arrived this morning. After I'd taken a room at the hotel, I asked for your house and came {{straight}} here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{began to}} be terribly frightened, sir--terribly frightened. I went dis {{afternoon}} and asked Captain Burley {{if he had any}} news ob you. He said 'No'; and asked me ef <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> were. <b>I</b> said 'No, sah;' that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> nuffin about it except that you had gone on some dangerous job. He said as dey had heard nuffin had happened to you. Still I was bery anxious, and tought I would sit up till de last train came in from Richmond. Den I tink I dropped off to sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas, poor damsel! I fear it is deceit hath brought thee to this pass. But I {{must not}} leave you thus unprovided. <b>I</b> must <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are {{to pass the}} night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is very unfortunate, certainly,' {{answered}} he; 'but I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{can find}} him. There is a melon garden {{about two miles}} from here, and as jackals are very fond of melons they are nearly sure to have gone there to feed. If you see a tailless jackal you will {{know that he is}} the one you want.' So the panther thanked him and went his way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should I {{share with}} you?" [...] he said roughly, when, {{a few hours}} later, he and Rateau parted in the street outside the Cabaret de la Liberte. [...] "Who are you, I would like to know, to try and poke your ugly nose into my affairs? How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> come from, and whether you are not some crapulent spy {{of one of those}} pestilential committees?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By Jove! O'Hara, I {{think there}} is a great deal in you; but you must not become proud and you must not talk. You must go back to Lucknow and be a good little boy and mind your book, as the English say, and perhaps, next {{holidays}} if you care, you can come back to me!' Kim's face fell. 'Oh, I mean if you like. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> want to go.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't have an {{opportunity}} for showing what you can do. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> got your utilitarian, radical views; but we'll keep to the point. <b>Where</b> do <b>you</b> think of going?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{lay upon}} the yak skin where {{the snow was}} harder and {{tunnelled}} towards you through the powdery stuff with my hands, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> had sunk {{and it was not}} far off. At last I saw your finger tips; they were so blue that for a few seconds I took them for rock, but thrust the butt of the rifle against them. Luckily you still had life enough to catch hold of it, and you know the rest. Were we not both very strong, it could never have been done." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS WARREN [taken {{aback by}} his assurance] Well, {{you have got}} a nice healthy two inches of cheek all over <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> got it. Not from your father, anyhow.|$|R
