However, when the virus suspension was thermally treated at 121 C for 5 sec {{in the presence of}} 2 % collagen, a stabilizing effect on the virus was observed. The stabilizing effect in the presence of other food additives, such as cholesterol, lecithin, or β-carotene, was less dramatic or there was no effect at all. Pretreatment of the cells with the same additives before inoculation induced various changes in the susceptibility of the cells to infection by poliovirus. Lecithin and cholesterol treatment appeared to increase HeLa cell susceptibility to the invading virus, thereby enhancing infectivity. Ultraviolet examination of thermally inactivated virus (121 C) suspensions did not indicate any severe denaturation of the nucleic acid core. Subsequent phenol extraction of the <b>infectious</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> from the heat-inactivated virions revealed that <b>infectious</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> was still present in the denatured heat-treated (62 to 72 C) samples of virion.

During growth in nutrient broth supplemented with 3 % glycine, 0. 4 % MgSO 4 and 5 to 15 %> sucrose, cells of E. coli develop sensi-tivity to the viral DNA, {{as well as}} to T 4 particles (JT) obtained by disruption with urea. The patterns of competence developed vary with the strain and physiological conditions, but the level of {{competence of}} glycine-spheroplasts is as high as that of lysozyme [EC 3. 2. 1. 17]-EDTA-spheroplasts. However, glycine-spheroplasts are less sensitive to lytic agents and are less fragile osmotically than lysozyme-EDTA-sphero-plasts. Some properties of the system for assay of infectious DNA are described. Bacterial spheroplasts are indispensable for assay of <b>infectious</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids.</b> Moreover, they are increasingly being used as starting material for preparation of various subcellular components, such as chromosomes, cell mem-branes and ribosomes. At present spheroplasts are usually, if not always, prepared using lysozyme [EC 3. 2. 1. 17] and EDTA. Previously Kuno and I reported on the competence for transfection of several bacterial preparations, including lysozyme-spheroplasts, penicillin-spheroplasts, plasmolyzed cells, and cells treated with EDTA or subjected to osmotic shock (1).

We therefore sought to determine whether <b>infectious</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (INA) {{could be used in}} place of virus particles to initiate an oncolytic picornavirus infection in vivo. Infectious RNA encoding coxsackievirus A 21 (CVA 21) was transcribed from plasmid DNA using T 7 polymerase. Within 48 hours of injecting this RNA into KAS 6 / 1 myeloma xenografts, high titers of infectious CVA 21 virions were detected in the bloodstream. Tumors regressed rapidly thereafter and mice developed signs of myositis. At euthanasia, CVA 21 was recovered from regressing tumors and from skeletal muscles. Treatment outcomes were comparable following intratumoral injection of naked RNA or fully infectious CVA 21 virus. Dose–response studies showed that an effective oncolytic infection could be established by intratumoral injection of 1  µg of infectious RNA. The oncolytic infection could also be initiated by intravenous injection of infectious RNA.

40|$|The {{effect of}} polycations on cultured mouse peitoneal macrophages has been examined. Polycations, at {{concentrations}} greater than 5 µg/ml, are toxic for macrophages) {{as measured by}} failure of the cells to exclude vital dyes. At toxic concentrations polycations bind in large amounts to nuclei and endoplasmic reticulum, while at nontoxic levels polycations bind selectively to the cell surface. Nontoxic concentrations of polycations stimulate binding of reovirus double-stranded (ds) RNA to the macrophages by forming polycation-dsRNA complexes either in the medium or at the cell surface. These complexes enter the cell in endocytic vacuoles and are concentrated in secondary lysosomes. Despite exposure to the acid hydrolases within this cell compartment, the dsRNA and the polycation (poly-L-lysine) are conserved in a macromolecular form within the vacuolar system. The mechanism(s) by which the uptake of <b>infectious</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> and the induction of interferon by dsRNA are stimulated by polycations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Animals {{and plants}} evolved systems to permit non-cell-autonomous {{trafficking}} of RNA, whereas DNA plays a cell-autonomous role.

The combined properties of the geminivirus-encoded movement protein and plasmodesmata were shown to impose a strict limitation {{on the size of}} the viral genome at the level of cell-to-cell movement. Size-increased viral genome components underwent homologous and nonhomologous recombination to overcome this strict limitation. Our results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms that underlie viral evolution and provide a likely explanation for why relatively few types of plant DNA viruses have evolved: they would have had to overcome the constraints imposed by an endogenous system operating to ensure that DNA acts in a cell-autonomous manner...|$|R

40|$|The {{present report}} {{describes}} the {{findings on the}} infectivity of DNA partially purified from SV- 40 which was propagated in the monkey kidney cells (BSC- 1) in vitro {{and the importance of}} nucleic acids as oncogenic factors, particularly the induction of tumor by DNA in newborn hamsters. 593 newborn hamsters in total were used in the present experiments, and cannibalism among them posed as a serious problem. On 30 days postinoculation, very remarkable changes occurred in the liver, lung and subcutaneous areas. Cellular responses of the perivascular cells were predominant. and they were distributed in the interstitial tissues of the liver (liver cirrhosis in primates) and lung. Three hamsters of those subcutaneously inoculated with nucleic acids developed tumors and two tumors appeared in the subcutaneous tissues on 130 days postinoculation, which were identified to be the ones induced by intact SV- 40 virus. Other tumors appeared in the liver, lung, intestinal ducts and abdominal surface at 126 days after subcutaneous injection. The cytological observations revealed multiple hemangiosarcoma combined with proliferation of the perivascular cells. On the other hand, cellular responses to nucleic acids were more marked by inoculation of the cell-free filtrate of BSC- 1 infected by DNA than of DNA, and essential histologic findings were similar to the respo. nse to infectious DNA. Thirty-nine hamsters (30 per cent) developed tumor within about 200 days postinoculation of the filtrates. Sarcomas were common and they were confined to the subcutaneous tissues in 35 hamsters and to the peritoneum in two others by subcutaneous inoculation of the filtrates. The intestinal gland-cell carcinomas, however, could be induced at 37 and 59 days postinoculation in two hamsters of one litter (7 newborn hamsters) and in the other three newborn hamsters subcutaneous sarcomas were induced by inoculation of the same agent.

40|$|Textbooks define viruses as <b>infectious</b> agents with <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> genomes (RNA or DNA), which {{replicate}} inside living host {{cells to}} produce particles (virions) that can transfer the genome to other cells [1, 2].

Polydnavirus (PDV) virions consist of enveloped nucleocapsids and package multiple circular, double-stranded (ds) DNAs with aggregate sizes that range from 190 to more than 500 kbp [4]. PDVs are also strictly associated with insects called parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera), which are free living nectar feeders as adults but which develop during their immature stages by feeding inside the body of another insect (the host) [3, 4].

5|$|<b>Infectious</b> {{particles}} possessing <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> {{are dependent}} upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease.

However, serological identification of the infecting agent in secondary or subsequent flavivirus infections is problematic due to the extensive cross-reactivity of flavivirus antibodies. This is particularly difficult in the tropical Americas where multiple flaviviruses cocirculate. A study of sequential flavivirus infection in horses was undertaken using three medically important flaviviruses and five widely utilized diagnostic assays to determine if WNV infection in horses that had a previous St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) or dengue virus type 2 (DENV- 2) infection could {{be diagnosed}}. Following the primary inoculation, 25 % (3 / 12) and 75 % (3 / 4) of the horses mounted antibody responses against SLEV and DENV- 2, respectively.

The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was sensitive in detection but lacked specificity, especially following repeated flavivirus exposure. The WNV-specific IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IgM ELISA) was able to detect an IgM antibody response and was not cross-reactive in a primary SLEV or DENV response. The WNV-specific blocking ELISA was specific, showing positives only following a WNV injection.

Cell-free translation reactions programmed with pP 12 X 3 C (wild-type 3 C) and pP 12 X 3 C-mut produced a capsid precursor, but only the reactions programmed with the plasmid encoding the functional proteinase resulted in P 1 - 2 A processing and capsid formation. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells also produced viral capsid proteins when transfected with these plasmids. Plasmid P 12 X 3 C was administered to mice by intramuscular, intradermal, and epithelial (gene gun) inoculations. Anti-FMD virus (FMDV) antibodies were detected by radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) and plaque reduction neutralization assays only in sera of mice inoculated by using a gene gun. When pP 12 X 3 C and pP 12 X 3 C-mut were inoculated into mice by using a gene gun, both plasmids elicited an antibody response detectable by RIP but only pP 12 X 3 C elicited a neutralizing antibody response. These results suggest that capsid formation in situ is required for effective immunization.

Some researchers hide the secret data in transcribed deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> translated ribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> regions, or active coding segments where it doesn't mention to modify the original sequence, but others hide data in non-transcribed deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> non-translated ribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> regions, or active coding segments. Unfortunately, these schemes either alter the functionalities or modify the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequences. As a result, how to embed the secret data into the deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence without altering the functionalities and to have the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence be able to be retrieved is worthy of investigating. This paper applies reversible information hiding scheme on deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence by using the reversible contrast mapping technique. The reversible property makes the secret data hidden in anywhere in deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> without altering the functionalities because the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence can be recovered exactly in our scheme...|$|R
