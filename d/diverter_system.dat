50|$|A {{specialized}} type of HRSG without boiler drums is the once-through steam generator. In this design, {{the inlet}} feedwater follows a continuous path without segmented sections for economizers, evaporators, and superheaters. This provides {{a high degree}} of flexibility as the sections are allowed to grow or contract based on the heat load being received from the gas turbine. The absence of drums allows for quick changes in steam production and fewer variables to control, and is ideal for cycling and base load operation. With proper material selection, an OTSG can be run dry, meaning the hot exhaust gases can pass over the tubes with no water flowing inside the tubes. This eliminates the need for a bypass stack and exhaust gas <b>diverter</b> <b>system</b> which is required to operate a combustion turbine with a drum-type HRSG out of service.|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid flow}} {{analysis on the}} flow <b>diverter</b> <b>system</b> under consideration for the Space Shuttle main engine high pressure fuel turbopump (SSME HPFTP) is proposed. A three dimensional viscous flow environment is computed to optimize the geometric configuration and location of the flow <b>diverter</b> <b>system.</b> The analysis consists of a fully turbulent cold flow calculation by Navier-Stokes equations and a Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model. The equations are numerically by a finite difference/element procedure. The results will provide the steady and unsteady pressure field and thermal environment required to assess {{the usefulness of the}} flow <b>diverter</b> <b>system</b> in deflecting the cold flow away from the hot turbine components. A geometry optimization study determines the best diverter shape and location to avoid larger thermal gradients on the rotor/stator components...|$|E
40|$|Requirements were {{established}} for a conceptual design study {{to analyze and}} design an engine flow <b>diverter</b> <b>system</b> and to include accommodations for an ejector system in an existing 3 / 4 scale fighter model equipped with YJ- 79 engines. Model constraints were identified and cost-effective limited modification was proposed to accept the ejectors, ducting and flow diverter valves. Complete system performance was calculated and a versatile computer program capable of analyzing any ejector system was developed...|$|E
50|$|The {{efficacy}} of flow diverters can be evaluated using a grading system developed {{by researchers at}} Oxford Neurovascular and Neuroradiology Research Unit (Kamran et al. 2011), {{commonly referred to as}} flow <b>diverter</b> grading <b>system</b> or Kamran grading system.|$|R

50|$|Exhaust system backfires {{occur in}} engines {{that have an}} {{emission}} system malfunction, like an air injection <b>system</b> <b>diverter</b> valve problem, an exhaust leak, or when the catalytic converter has been removed. In some high-performance vehicles, when a driver shifts up and lets off the accelerator, the engine has a moment of running rich. This causes an incomplete burn which causes the fumes to explode in the exhaust system along with an audible pop or bang sound. This {{is a result of}} working equipment, and is unlikely to cause damage.|$|R
40|$|Clogging {{of water}} intakes caused by {{accumulation}} of floating trash {{is a common}} problem experiencing by many run-off-river hydro power plants. Tenom Pangi Hydro Station is significantly affected by it which leads to reduction of power generation or sometime station shutdown. A trash <b>diverter</b> <b>system</b> was developed to prevent the clogging and to accommodate existing station operational constraints. The development involves mainly a brainstorming session to finalize the conceptual design, and computer modeling. Commercial computational fluid dynamic program was utilized to create computer model to analyse and evaluate the river flow characteristics due to trash diverter installation {{in order to determine}} the trash diverter location for effective diversion of trashes and minimum flow resistance into the water intakes. Finite element analysis program was used to do stress analysis on the trash diverter structure. The power station requirement, the design of existing water intakes from other local hydropower and water treatment plants were also considered in finding the effective solution. The results from the modeling and analysis were used to establish preventive measures for preventing existing water intakes clogging and specification for the construction of the trash <b>diverter</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 47 -year-old man with a {{fusiform}} aneurysm of the basilar cerebral artery, who was successfully treated with the placement of a novel flow <b>diverter</b> <b>system</b> (Silk stent). CASE REPORT A 47 -year-old man presented chronic posterior headaches and an episode of syncope. Upon admission, the patient appeared alert and oriented and had stable hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. Cerebral angiography (CA) and CT (figure 1), revealed a 30 mm partially thrombosed aneurysm of the basilar artery (BA).

40|$|Eye Tap {{devices have}} three main parts: * a {{measurement}} system typically {{consisting of a}} cam-era system, or sensor array with appropriate optics; * a <b>diverter</b> <b>system,</b> for diverting eyeward bound lightinto the measurement system and therefore causing {{the eye of the}} user of the device to behave, in effect,as if it were a camera; * an aremac for reconstructing {{at least some of the}} di-verted rays of eyeward bound light. Thus the aremac does the opposite of what the camera does, and is,in many ways, a camera in reverse. The etymology of the word &quot;aremac &quot; itself, arises from spelling theword &quot;camera &quot; backwards...|$|E
40|$|The Little Calumet River System {{located in}} Northwestern Indiana has {{encountered}} numerous flooding events in recent years. In 2008, Hurricane Ike contributed {{a large amount}} of rainfall to The Little Calumet River System leading to destructive flooding events. Following this flooding event, United States Army Corps of Engineers installed a flow diverter near a major tributary in the system for flood mitigation. Levees were also constructed for managing water movement. ^ In this study, a two stage modeling process commonly used in hydrologic modeling was considered. A rainfall – runoff model was prepared in the first stage using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System). Radar rainfall and point rainfall were considered and used to construct flow hydrographs from rainfall events. ^ In the second stage, flow hydrographs were used to model the flood stages in The Little Calumet River System. HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System) was used to conduct unsteady flow simulations. The HEC-RAS model was constructed with the help of field cross sectional surveys done by Purdue University Calumet senior design groups. Simulations were conducted with and without the diverter and levees to determine the performance of the flood management structures. ^ Peak flow and water surface elevations were considered and analyzed for The Little Calumet River System. With the construction of the diverter in the Little Calumet West reach, peak flow in the west reach decreased by 10. 19 %. Peak flow in the Little Calumet East River increased by 10. 05 % following the construction of the diverter. The water surface elevation did not show a significant change throughout the model. An increase in peak flow while maintaining a steady water surface elevation indicates that the construction of the <b>diverter</b> allows the <b>system</b> to direct a larger volume of water without increasing the possibility of flooding. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} the testing of British Nuclear Fuels Limited’s (BNFL’s) Pulsed Jet Mixing (PJM) and the Reverse Flow <b>Diverter</b> (RFD) sampling <b>system</b> in a 3. 96 m (13 ft) ID and 4. 57 m (15 ft) tall dish-bottomed tank using Hanford Tank 241 -AZ- 101 / 102 simulant containing 17, 28, and 36 -wt % insoluble solids. The PJMs readily homogenized the tank contents at both 28 - and 36 -wt % solids. There was some stratification in {{the top half of the}} tank at 17 -wt % solids. This small amount of stratification was due to the design of the pulse tubes being based on actual tank-waste settling data rather than the simulant. The viscosity of the simulant used was very close to the actual tank-waste data, but the settling rate of the solids was four times faster. The faster settling behavior of the simulant enabled demonstrating the PJM performance under worst-case scenario conditions. Although increasing the drive pressure of the PJM could further increase the mixing energy, this was not done because of the limited time available for the tests. By sequencing the operation of the PJMs, the simulant could be kept suspended quite readily. Since homogenization of tank contents is only required when sampling or possibly during transfers, the PJMs may be sequenced for general operations. Sequencing the PJMs results in an 80 % reduction in compressed air and associated vent requirements. The RFD sample system had no difficulty in pumping all concentrations of the simulant tested, up to a height of 12. 2 m (40 ft) through a 0. 02 m (0. 75 inch) pipe approximately 36. 6 m (120 ft) long. A representative sample was taken by the sample tee at 17 -wt % and 28 -wt % solids, but the tee was unable to produce a representative sample at 38 wt % solids due to the sample needle being too small...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes an {{improved}} method {{to assess the}} performance of a gravimetric flow test rig. It addresses the study of two of the most important measurement systems: the weighing scale and all mass-related corrections, and the time measurement system. By performing a regular diverter test according to ISO 4185 : 1980 several times and under different conditions, it was possible to determine not only the statistical variances of the <b>diverter</b> <b>system,</b> but also the variances of the meter under test and of the flow test facility separately. The proposed method allows also under special conditions the determination of systematic errors in the mass determination. The method has been successfully applied at the large water flow calibration facilities of PTB in Braunschweig and Berlin and is recommended as a routine to test the performance of gravimetric flow test facilities...|$|E
40|$|It was {{determined}} that artificial intelligence technology can provide pilots with the help they need in making the complex decisions concerning en route changes in a flight plan. A <b>diverter</b> <b>system</b> should {{have the capability to}} take all of the available information and produce a recommendation to the pilot. Phase three illustrated that using Joshua to develop rules for an expert system and a Statice database provided additional flexibility by permitting the development of dynamic weighting of diversion relevant parameters. This increases the fidelity of the AI functions cited as useful in aiding the pilot to perform situational assessment, navigation rerouting, flight planning/replanning, and maneuver execution. Additionally, a prototype pilot-vehicle interface (PVI) was designed providing for the integration of both text and graphical based information. Advanced technologies were applied to PVI design, resulting in a hierarchical menu based architecture to increase the efficiency of information transfer while reducing expected workload. Additional efficiency was gained by integrating spatial and text displays into an integrated user interface...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the performance of an underslung half-cone inlet mounted on a missile forebody model with the compression surface outboard from the fuselage. The inlet was designed for shock-on-lip operation at Mach number 2. 0 with 25 degree half-angle spike. The cowling {{was attached to the}} fuselage through the boundary-layer plow and served as part of the fuselage boundary-layer <b>diverter</b> <b>system.</b> The performance of the half-cone inlet was compared with that of a scoop-type inlet and a normal-wedge inlet on a maximum-thrust-minus-drag basis. The increase in pressure recovery obtained with the half-cone inlet over that obtained with the reference inlets offset the slightly higher drags observed over the Mach number range for the half-cone so that the performance of this configuration was equal to that of the other inlets at Mach number 2. 0 and was slightly superior at the lower Mach numbers. For a particular configuration, a peak pressure recovery of 0. 879 was obtained at Mach number 2. 0, zero angle of attack, and 4 -percent throat bleed; the subcritical stability was 16 percent. Use of a fuselage-mounted boundary-layer splitter plate ahead of the inlet did not improve the stability. Subcritical distortion values were below 10 percent for all configurations. (author...|$|E
