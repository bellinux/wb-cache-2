40|$|The {{objective}} of this 10 year, retrospective study is to evaluate the indications {{for the removal of}} titanium miniplates following osteosynthesis in maxillofacial trauma and orthognathic surgery. All patients who had miniplates placed in a Regional Oral and Maxillofacial Department between January 1998 and October 2007 were included. The following variables were recorded: patient gender and age, number of <b>plates</b> inserted, <b>indications</b> for <b>plate</b> placement, location of plates, number and location of <b>plates</b> removed, <b>indications</b> for <b>plate</b> removal, time between insertion and removal, medical co-morbidities, and the follow-up period. During the 10 years of the study, 1247 titanium miniplates were placed in 535 patients. A total of 32 (3 %) plates were removed from 30 patients. Superficial infection accounted for 41 % of all plates removed. All complications were minor and most plates were removed within the first year of insertion. A low removal rate of 3 % suggests that the routine removal of asymptomatic titanium miniplates is not indicated...|$|R

40|$|A tectonic {{model of}} the Weddell Sea is built by {{composing}} a simple circuit with optimized rotations describing {{the growth of the}} South Atlantic and SW Indian oceans. The model independently and accurately reproduces the consensus elements of the Weddell Sea's spreading record and continental margins, and offers solutions to remaining controversies there. At their present resolutions, plate kinematic data from the South Atlantic and SW Indian oceans and Weddell Sea rule against the proposed, but controversial, independent movements of small plates during Gondwana breakup that have been attributed to the presence or impact of a mantle plume.

Newer technologies Such as the locking compression plate (LCP) and its derivatives are valuable additions to the orthopaedic traumatologist's armamentarium. As with any emerging technology, the indications will be extended until a threshold is reached and the limitations of the technology are seen. It is vital that surgeons involved in fracture care are aware of when locked plating is superior to other methods and also when they should use another treatment modality.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe aim of {{this study}} is the {{presentation}} of the polyaxial locking NCB-plate in the treatment of femoral fractures, especially in elderly patients and in proximity of a prosthetic implant. The reduction and fixation of these fractures is a challenging surgical procedure with high complication rates reported up to 40 %. Patients and methodsA total of 72 patients with femoral fractures had polyaxial locking <b>plate</b> osteosynthesis. <b>Indications</b> included fractures of the shaft and around an implant. Concerning surgical procedures, three different standardized techniques were performed: (1) minimally invasive with percutaneous distal insertion using a targeting device; (2) mini-open with additional cerclage wire via the same approach and (3) a conventional open reduction and internal fixation. Data collection included intraoperative data and early complications at 6, 24 and 52 weeks. Fifty-two patients had an implant or prosthesis in situ. Thirty-three patients were treated by technique (1), 32 patients had mini-open surgery and seven patients conventional open surgery. ResultsThirty-nine patients attended clinical follow-up after 52 weeks. Twenty-two patients were interviewed by telephone, two were untraceable and nine patients had died. Bony consolidation without secondary loss of reduction was confirmed after 52 weeks in all patients but two. Plate breakage occurred in these two at 25 and 31 weeks after surgery due to non-union. Implant related complications (17 % in total) lead to surgical revision in five other cases: two deep wound infections as well as three minor revisions. When itemizing complications according to surgical technique used, most major complications occurred following open surgery. ConclusionThe availability of polyaxial locking implants widened the range of <b>indications</b> for <b>plate</b> fixation in femoral fractures. The advantages of the polyaxial locking implant combined with minimally invasive surgical technique contribute to successful management of this population category. Early revision rate is noticeably lower compared to similar procedures. Level of evidenceIV retrospective series...|$|R
30|$|The geodynamic {{context of}} the proto-PSP {{isolation}} {{has long been a}} matter of debate. The orthogonality of the CBF rift with the KPR was first interpreted as an <b>indication</b> of <b>plate</b> entrapment. It was proposed that the WPB resulted from a segment of the Kula-Pacific Ridge and associated oceanic crust being trapped in the Middle Miocene (Uyeda and Ben Avraham 1972; Uyeda and McCabe 1983; Hilde and Lee 1984). A variant of this model was later proposed by Jolivet et al. (1989), who posited that a piece of the North New Guinea/Pacific Ridge was trapped during the Middle Eocene. Lewis et al. (1982) first proposed a back-arc origin for the formation of the WPB behind the East Mindanao-Samar Arc. Other authors have also suggested that the WPB opened as a back-arc basin either behind the East Mindanao-Samar Arc (Rangin et al. 1990; Lee and Lawver 1995) or the proto-IBM Arc (Seno and Maruyama 1984) but with poor constraints on the timing and kinematics of these events. Based on considerable geological and paleomagnetic constraints, especially those imposed from ocean drilling data and the Philippine islands, Hall et al. (1995 a,b,c) were the first to propose that the proto-PSP was isolated between two opposing-vergent subduction zones, and then rotated clockwise while migrating north from its initial position near the equator. Hall (2002) later refined the plate tectonic evolution of the whole western Pacific region. Deschamps and Lallemand (2002) used Hall’s model when providing more details on the WPB spreading processes. In the earlier stages of WPB opening, they have accounted for the presence of a plume (Macpherson and Hall 2001) in the generation of the Benham Rise, Urdaneta Plateau, numerous overlapping spreading centers and ridge jumps. The existence of this plume, called the “Oki-Daito” plume by Ishizuka et al. (2013), is supported by numerous petrologic (e.g., Hickey-Vargas 1998) and structural (e.g., Deschamps and Lallemand 2002; Deschamps et al. 2008) studies. The updated ages and relative symmetry of the WPB opening have allowed us to refute the “entrapment model” and definitely consider the WPB as having been formed between two facing subduction zones, the East Mindanao-Samar, also called the proto-Philippine, and the proto-IBM.|$|R
30|$|Distal radius {{fractures}} are {{the most}} common fractures of the upper extremity, with an incidence of 2 fractures per 1000 persons-years [1, 2, 3]. The past 25  years, an increase in open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for distal radius fractures has been observed [4, 5]. Especially, volar plating has increased in popularity [6, 7]. This approach provides better functional and radiological results compared to other surgical techniques [8, 9, 10]. Moreover, documented complications associated with dorsal plating and external fixation, and advancements in the locking plate technology have expanded the <b>indications</b> of volar <b>plating</b> [11]. However, to position the volar plate on the fracture site, the surgeon needs to detach the pronator quadratus muscle from its distal and radial side and lift it for optimal exposure to the fracture site [12]. Although the conventional approach involves repair of the pronator quadratus [12, 13, 14], controversy surrounds the merits of this repair. Some surgeons state the repair of the pronator quadratus will restore pronation strength and will protect the volar flexor tendons by covering the hardware [11, 15]. Conversely, other surgeons argue that the quality of the tissue often precludes a durable repair and a risk of ischaemic contracture of the pronator quadratus after tight closure exist, resulting in limited wrist pronation and supination [16, 17]. Despite these contradicting statements, 83 % of the American hand surgeons repair the pronator quadratus following volar plate fixation [18].|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesSternal {{instability}} after {{cardiac surgery}} occurs infrequently {{but can be}} challenging to manage. The most common treatment of mechanical sternal instability is operative rewiring. Transverse rib-to-rib stabilization with titanium plates designed for sternal fixation is a recent option. We evaluated the clinical utility of the transverse plating system in a cardiothoracic practice. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed our experience with transverse sternal plating using the Synthes titanium sternal plate system (Synthes CMF, Paoli, Pa) from June 2004 to June 2007. ResultsThere were 15 sternal reconstruction procedures performed in 14 patients using the transverse sternal plates. One patient required reoperation for sternal <b>plate</b> fracture. <b>Indications</b> for sternal <b>plating</b> were chronic sternal dehiscence in 9 procedures, acute sternal dehiscence in 3 procedures, previous mediastinitis and sternectomy in 2 procedures, and sternal plate fracture in 1 procedure. The initial cardiac operation was isolated coronary artery bypass in all patients. The mean age was 59 years (range, 51 – 68 years), all patients were men, 12 patients had a body mass index of greater than 30 kg/m 2 (range, 22 – 40 kg/m 2), 9 patients were diabetic, 8 patients were active smokers, and 7 patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mean follow-up period was 15. 5 months (range, 3 – 33 months). All patients achieved sternal stability with minimal postoperative pain. Complications included infection requiring explantation in 1 patient, plate fracture in 1 patient, and seroma formation in 1 patient. ConclusionThe transverse sternal plating system successfully achieved stability in all cases and is valuable in complex sternal reconstructions. Sternal plating is an effective alternative to wire closure in sternum with fractures, chronic and acute instability, or poor bone quality...|$|R
2500|$|In 2010, a {{study was}} {{published}} on the soft parts visible with the [...] "Victoria" [...] specimen. It preserves both true impressions of the skin into the surrounding sediment, and natural casts, where the spaces {{left behind by the}} rotting of the soft body parts have been filled in with sediment. Additionally on some areas a black layer is present, possibly consisting of organic remains or bacterial mats. A part of the lower trunk flank shows rows of small hexagonal, non-overlapping, convex scales, two to seven millimetres in diameter. Higher on the flank two rosette structures are visible with larger central scales, one being twenty by ten millimetres in size, the other ten by eight millimetres. Apart from the scales, an impression of the lower side of a back plate has been found, covering about two hundred square centimetres. This shows no scales but a smooth surface with low parallel vertical ridges. As it is a true impression, with the life animal grooves would have been present. These grooves would have been about half a millimetre deep and stood about two millimetres apart. The impression probably represented the horn sheath of the plate, as would be confirmed by vertical traces of veins. It is the first direct proof of such sheaths with any stegosaurian. The study considered the presence of a sheath to be a strong <b>indication</b> that the <b>plate</b> had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate as a whole and provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly coloured. Thermoregulation, on the other hand — another often assumed rôle of the plates — would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the horn covering.|$|R
