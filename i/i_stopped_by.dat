6000|$|As {{luck would}} have it, at this time I found him. I was passing down Ward No. 6 one day about dusk (4th January, I think), and noticed his glassy eyes, {{with a look of}} despair and hopelessness, sunk low in his thin, pallid-brown young face. One learns to divine quickly in the hospital, and as <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>by</b> him and spoke some commonplace remark (to which he made no reply), I saw as I looked that it was a case for ministering to the affection first, and other {{nourishment}} and medicines afterward. I sat down by him without any fuss; talked a little; soon saw that it did him good; led him to talk a little himself; got him somewhat interested; wrote a letter for him to his folks in Massachusetts (to L. H. Campbell, Plymouth county); soothed him down as I saw he was getting a little too much agitated, and tears in his eyes; gave him some small gifts, and told him I should come again soon. (He has told me since that this little visit, at that hour, just saved him; a day more, {{and it would have been}} perhaps too late.) ...|$|E

He tells us that he is over head and ears in love with your daughter. The communication was indeed made three days ago, but I told him that I should take {{a day or two}} to think of it before I wrote to you. He was very anxious, when he told me, to go off at once to Bowick, and to see you and your wife, and of course the young lady;--but this <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>by</b> the exercise of somewhat peremptory parental authority. Then he informed me that he had been to Bowick, and had found his lady-love at home, you and Mrs. Wortle having by chance been absent at the time. It seems that he declared himself to the young lady, who, in the exercise of a wise discretion, ran away from him and left him planted on the terrace. That is his account of what passed, and I do not in the least doubt its absolute truth. It is at any rate quite clear, from his own showing, that the young lady gave him no encouragement.|$|E
6000|$|... --Well, I {{suppose that}} doesn't {{interest}} you, but leastways {{there was such}} noise after the match that I missed the train home and I couldn't {{get any kind of}} a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was coming on night when I got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twice <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>by</b> the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thick I'd have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road, I spied a little cottage with a light in the window. I went up and knocked at the door. A voice asked who was there and I answered I was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and that I'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as {{if she was going to}} bed when I knocked and she had her hair hanging and I thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, and I thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me was I tired and would I like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. When I handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said: 'COME IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES...' I didn't go in, Stevie. I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the road I looked back and she was standing at the door.|$|E

5000|$|... "Back in 1969 I (Electro-Harmonix) {{was already}} selling the Muff Fuzz, {{which was a}} mild {{overdrive}} circuit in an LPB-1 box. I wanted {{to come out with}} a three knob distortion unit in a bigger box. I asked my buddy, Bell Labs designer, Bob Myer, to design a unit, one that would have a lot of sustain. When I got the prototype from Bob, I loved the long sustain. This was done by cascading the circuit into additional sections, each one clipped by twin diodes. However, when you clip, the tone can be a bit raspy. So, I spent a couple of days changing capacitors to roll off distortion in the highs, and eventually found that the best long sustaining tone that was a sweet violin like sound was done by having three capacitors {{in different parts of the}} circuit rolling off the rasp. We plunged into production and I brought the very first units up to Henry, the boss at Manny's Music Store on 48th Street, NYC. About a week later, <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>by</b> Manny's to buy some cables, and Henry yelled out to me, 'Hey Mike, I sold one of those new Big Muffs to Jimi Hendrix.' [...] " ...|$|E

40|$|I left a road well {{travelled}} {{in primary}} schools {{to become a}} teacher educator.

This was what Rorty (1992, p. 107) describes as a ‘transformative ’ event, an encounter that re-arranged ‘priorities and purposes ’ It changed my understanding of who I am and what I want to do with my life. I continued my journey at University, enjoying teaching pre-service teachers while preparing for a longer adventure, a PhD. Inspired by Kvale’s (1996, p. 4) view of the researcher as traveller, this paper describes and discusses my journey {{in the context of the}} busy life of an educator and administrator. While the journey is interrupted and the traveller often becomes distracted from the central task, there are also events that sustain and inspire me to continue...|$|E
