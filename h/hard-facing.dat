40|$|This {{study was}} {{triggered}} from worker complaints about metal fume odors during metal welding in a mechanic garage. <b>Hard-face</b> welding, which includes {{use of an}} electrode to join metal pieces together, occurs once per year in this occupational setting and was chosen for this study {{because of the large}} amount of smoke that is produced, giving the study a worst-case scenario element. Sampling occurred over a period of one hour, which is {{the same amount of time}} <b>hard-face</b> welding is conducted when applicable. Results show that a worker performing <b>hard-face</b> welding was not exposed to metal fume concentrations above any 8 -hour OEL-TWA established by OSHA, NIOSH or ACGIH. Readings from area samples suggest that welding smoke tends to escape the fume hood, and thus expose neighboring employees, but below any exposure limit. No action levels were breached, therefore the current welding practices do not require changing, but could use optimization. Recommendations include providing training to the welder to modify work practices by moving his face away from the smoke plume during welding, if and when possible. An engineering control recommendation includes installing a fume hood curtain to help contain smoke that strays outside of the fume hood...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the evaluation of}} Pressure Actuated Leaf Seals (PALS) technology readiness for shaft and shroud sealing in power generation and aerospace applications. Seal designs tested are prototypical and constructed using processes appropriate for volume production. Results include both static and dynamic seal leakage measurements running against a 5. 1 in (129. 54 mm) diameter smooth surface test rotor and another that simulates sealing against turbine blade shrouds. A further test was undertaken using a 2 D static rig that determined acoustic noise experienced during testing was attributed to leaves vibrating at their natural frequency {{as a result of}} inter-leaf gaps. The dynamic simulated shroud test includes steps, duplicating small discontinuities of adjacent shroud sealing surfaces and slots to inject air radially under the seal leaves as may occur between shrouds on blades {{with a high degree of}} reaction. Consistent seal performance over 15 hours confirms suitability for turbine blade tip applications. Controlled deflection of PALS leaves with operating differential pressure is effective for startup rub avoidance in service as well as conformal wear-in sizing of leaf tips with the rotor. Tested leaf tip wear-in of approximately 0. 010 in (0. 25 mm) against rotor discs without <b>hard-face</b> coating, shows potential to eliminate seal misalignment and run-out contributions to operating seal clearance. PALS design features prevent further rubbing contact with the operating rotor after initial wear-in sizing thereby sustaining a small effective seal clearance and prospects for long seal life. Measurements of rotor surface wear tracks from the wear-in process and endurance runs are included as well as rotor and leaf tip photos. Test results support the technology readiness of the PALS concept as a viable, robust, low leakage dynamic seal for select commercial application...|$|R
40|$|Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) {{experience}} a much shorter fatigue life than continuous rail sections, especially IRJs located in heavy haul rail corridors. IRJs {{are one of}} the most critical components of the rail system since their failure can lead to multiple catastrophic consequences, including; malfunctioning of the track signalling system due to metal contact across the insulating rail gap and, in cases where joints are damaged at the fishplate or rail bolt holes, derailment of railway vehicles. A literature review on the topic revealed that these joints suffer from a wide range of damage, predominately resulting from either the gradual accumulation of metal under plastic flow across the railhead in the vicinity of the rail end post, or rail end spalling and/or rail end post insulation damage. Other failure modes relate to problems with fishplates/joint bar and rail bolt holes. These include: fishplate cracking, delamination of fishplates, bolt looseness and bolt hole cracking. Therefore, IRJs are regarded as high-risk component and are maintained via expensive maintenance programs requiring high standards. Every year rail operators around Australia and the world install tens of thousands of rail joints, due to their early failure, or the risk of failure of either the signalling system and/or the structural track integrity. For the Australian heavy haul rail industry, the economic costs of IRJ maintenance are very high. In this study, approaches to both advanced characterisation of IRJ damage and to improving IRJs service lifetimes were investigated. Damage accumulation in the vicinity of the joint was characterised by advanced metallographic (optical microscopy, SEM and TEM) and neutron diffraction techniques. In the early stage of the project, surface hard facing was selected as a potential approach to improving IRJ lifetimes, and surface clad rail samples were produced and studied via simulation testing and testing of ex-service rails. The initial hard facing experiments involved comparison of the performance of ex-service laser clad IRJ samples (431 stainless steel cladding produced by Jarvie Engineering Private Limited) with that of uncoated IRJ samples manufactured from normal head hardened 60 kg grade rail. The results indicated IRJ lifetimes can be improved by a hard facing of rail ends. Follow-up investigations were performed using both robots TIG MMAW hard facing deposition approach, and experimentation with a choice of cladding metal and geometry of the <b>hard-face</b> rail surface. Experimentation included advanced metallography and electron microscopy, and limited wear testing of cladding materials. Full-scale wheel on track rig testing was also performed on both coated and uncoated samples, which involves cyclic rolling contact loading on railhead surface was the main objective to investigate the railhead damage. It was concluded that ferritic type commercial hard facing alloys, and maraging steels, appear good candidate materials for hard facing by weld deposition in the vicinity of IRJs. They also appear more suitable than the initial 431 stainless steel used in the laser cladding experiments as deleterious effects of thermal contraction during cooling are less in the ferritic alloys. It was also concluded and that geometry of the hard facing profile should include a steep angle of hard facing with the rail surface where it intersects the top surface of the rail head. Neutron diffraction analysis of ex-service IRJs revealed significant stress evolution in the vicinity of the top surfaces of the rail ends abutting the insulating gap. This distribution is characterised by a compressive layer of approximately 5 mm deep and a counterbalanced tensile layer located 5 - 15 mm at the sub-surface region. It exceeded the distribution along the continuous rail. Residual stresses analysis for the laboratory rig tested rail ends revealed similar characteristic to those found in ex-service rail ends. However, in contrast to the ex-service rail ends, the stress distributions in the test rig samples were slightly different and this difference was attributed to the localization of wheel load under the particular test conditions. A separate neutron diffraction examination of residual stresses near bolt-holes across ex-service IRJ fishplates revealed a stress evolution characterised by both compressive and tensile stresses, extended in a 900 and 450 angles to the longitudinal plane. The later results were consistent with a common observation of fishplate fracture originating at bolt holes at 450 to the running rail surface...|$|R

40|$|Research in {{the field}} of <b>hard-facing</b> of various parts {{mechanical}} systems' are being done for technical and techno-economic reasons. The reasons for introducing the new reparation technologies by <b>hard-facing</b> are numerous: three quarters of all the mechanical parts of engineering could be regenerated or manufactured by hard facing; the working life of the repaired part reaches or even exceeds the working life of a new part, while the working life of the hard faced manufactured part surpasses several times the working life of the new part manufactured by some other technology.

40|$|This {{research}} {{discussed the}} effect of Ti content on the microstructure and wear behavior of Fe-based <b>hard-facing</b> alloys. A series of Fe-Cr-C-Si-Mn-xTi alloy fillers were deposited on SS 400 low carbon steel by {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW). Optical microscope, electron microscope and X-ray diffraction were used to investigate the microstructural characteristics. Wear resistance was estimated with sand wheel wear test, and the worn surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscope. The microstructure of Fe-based <b>hard-facing</b> alloy without of Ti content consisted of primary γ, eutectic [γ+(Fe,Cr) 3 C], eutectic [γ+(Fe,Cr) 2 C], and a few martensite. As the Ti content of the <b>hard-facing</b> alloy increased, the microstructure were composed of primary TiC carbide, γ phase, and eutectic [γ+(Fe,Cr,Ti) 3 C]. The amount and size of the TiC carbide in microstructure was a proportion to the Ti content in Fe-based <b>hard-facing</b> alloy. Nevertheless, the amount eutectic [γ+(Fe,Cr,Ti) 3 C] will decrease, as the Ti content increased. According to the results of hardness test and sand wheel test, the lowest hardness (HRC 54. 93) and the highest wear loss (0. 288 g) were obtained as the <b>hard-facing</b> alloy has no Ti content. The highest hardness of HRC 60. 29 and the lowest weight loss of 0. 041 g were produced, as Ti addition was 4. 87 wt%. The characteristics of worn surface showed that the wear mechanisms in the microstructure of primary austenite and small size TiC carbide were ploughing, micro-void, and fracturing of carbides. Finally, in the microstructure of big size TiC carbide, the wear mechanism was discontinuous ploughing. 本研究探討添加不同鈦含量對鐵基硬面合金顯微組織與磨耗行為之影響，利用鎢極惰性氣體遮護電弧銲接法(Gas Tungsten Arc Welding, GTAW) ，將預先配製的Fe-Cr-C-Si-Mn-xTi合金填料(x＝ 0. 00 ~ 7. 25 wt%) ，銲覆於SS 400 低碳鋼基材表面上。銲覆層之顯微結構藉由光學顯微鏡、電子顯微鏡及X-ray繞射分析進行探討，最後利用乾砂磨耗試驗分析其耐磨耗性質，並以掃瞄式電子顯微鏡(SEM) 觀察磨耗面探討其磨耗行為。 本研究在合金填料中添加六組不同配比之鈦金屬，經GTAW銲覆後，無添加鈦金屬組別顯微組織主要由沃斯田鐵相、少量麻田散鐵相、沃斯田鐵與(Fe,Cr) 3 C及沃斯田鐵與(Fe,Cr) 2 C之共晶組織所構成。隨鈦金屬添加量增加，顯微組織則由初晶TiC碳化物、沃斯田鐵相、沃斯田鐵與(Fe,Cr,Ti) 3 C共晶組織所組成。隨鈦含量增加銲覆層中之TiC碳化物數量與尺寸會增加，而沃斯田鐵與(Fe,Cr) 3 C共晶組織則會減少，並發現銲覆層之硬度與抗磨耗性隨TiC碳化物數量增多而呈上升趨勢。硬度測試與乾砂磨耗試驗之結果顯示，無添加鈦金屬之銲覆層抗磨耗性最差其硬度值為HRC 54. 93 ，磨耗量為 0. 288 g，隨鈦含量之增加，銲覆層之抗磨耗性質有上升的趨勢，當銲覆層鈦含量增加至 4. 87 wt%時，可得最高硬度值HRC 60. 29 ，其磨耗量下降至 0. 041 g，抗磨耗性最佳。 乾砂磨耗試驗磨耗面之觀察結果顯示，顯微組織中具初晶沃斯田鐵相及小尺寸TiC碳化物者，其磨耗機制以塑性犁溝、微坑洞及碳化物剝落為主，顯微結構中之初晶相為大尺寸TiC碳化物者，其磨耗機構為不連續犁溝為主。誌謝 I 摘要 II Abstract III 總目錄 IV 表目錄 VII 圖目錄 VIII 第一章 前言 1 第二章 文獻回顧 4 2 - 1 硬面處理介紹 4 2 - 1 - 1 硬面銲覆之方法 5 2 - 1 - 2 硬面合金之種類 8 2 - 1 - 3 Fe-Cr-C合金常見顯微組織 11 2 - 2 合金元素之影響	 13 2 - 2 - 1 碳元素 13 2 - 2 - 2 鈦元素 16 2 - 2 - 3 鉻元素 19 2 - 2 - 4 矽元素 22 2 - 2 - 5 錳元素 23 2 - 3 碳化物種類與性質 23 2 - 4 磨耗機構介紹 26 2 - 4 - 1 磨耗定義與影響變因 26 2 - 4 - 2 乾砂磨耗機構 29 第三章 實驗步驟與方法 32 3 - 1 實驗流程 32 3 - 2 試片製備 33 3 - 2 - 1 基材與銲覆合金成份設計 33 3 - 2 - 2 銲覆製程 34 3 - 3 銲覆層成份分析 36 3 - 4 顯微結構分析 37 3 - 4 - 1 光學顯微觀察 37 3 - 4 - 2 X光繞射分析	 37 3 - 4 - 3 FE-SEM顯微觀察與EDS半定量分析	 37 3 - 5 機械性質測試 39 3 - 5 - 1 銲覆層上表面硬度測試 39 3 - 5 - 2 銲覆層橫截面微硬度測試 39 3 - 5 - 3 乾砂磨耗試驗 40 第四章 結果與討論 43 4 - 1 銲覆層巨觀觀察	 43 4 - 2 銲覆層成份與顯微組織分析	 45 4 - 2 - 1 銲覆層成份分析 45 4 - 2 - 2 銲覆層顯微組織分析 48 4 - 3 銲覆層晶體結構分析 52 4 - 4 銲覆層顯微結構分析 54 4 - 5 銲覆層硬度分析	 67 4 - 5 - 1 上表面硬度 67 4 - 5 - 2 橫截面硬度分佈 69 4 - 6 銲覆層磨耗性質分析 70 4 - 6 - 1 磨耗量分析 70 4 - 6 - 2 磨耗面觀察 72 第五章 結論 81 第六章 參考文獻 8...|$|E
40|$|Here is {{analyzed}} {{selection of}} the optimal technology for heat treatment during the reparation of the damaged forging dies. Those tools are manufactured from alloyed tool steels for operation at elevated temperatures. Those steels are prone to self-hardening, so in reparatory <b>hard-facing</b> they must be preheated, additionally heated and tempered. During the tempering, in temperature interval 500 - 600 °C, a secondary increase of hardness and decrease of impact toughness occurs, the so-called reversible tempering brittleness. Here is shown {{that it can be}} avoided by application of metallurgical and technological measures. Metallurgical measures assume adequate selection of steels. Since the considered steels are per se prone to tempering brittleness, we conducted experimental investigations to define the technological measures to avoid it.

In 5. 9 pct C cladding, the composite comprised primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) as the reinforcing phase and [alpha + (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) ] eutectic structures as matrix. Various morphologies of carbides were found in primary and eutectic (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides, which included bladelike and rodlike (with a hexagonal cross section). The 5. 9 C cladding with great amounts of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides had the highest hardness (approximately HRC 63. 9) of the all conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} the Taguchi-regression method in developing the optimal plasma transferred arc weld-ing (PTAW) process for obtaining high hardfacing quality char-acteristics. An “optimal ” process means that the best perform-ance characteristic would be produced while the least number of process parameters are involved. In the experimental tests, the surface hardening process is conducted using Cobalt-based and Nickel-based powdery metal materials together with L 18 orth-ogonal arrays. The dependent variable, wear, obeys the-smaller-the-better quality characteristic, and the performance statistics, the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), are obtainable. The experimental results show that the most efficient process parameters based on analysis of variance are set as follows: <b>hard-facing</b> material, the accelerating voltage, the powder feed rate, and the pre-heat treatment temperature. They account for almost 90 % of the total variance of wear. Under the optimal setting, the average error rates for using Taguchi and Taguchi-regression methods are 7. 05 and 5. 50 %, respectively. The outcome of the experiment indicates that predicted values of the optimal setting fit well with the actual data. The reproducibility of the optimal plasma transfer arc hardfacing is obtained from the experimen-tal data of the confirmation run. A reliable analysis based o...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} discusses {{the effects of}} V, Mo, and Ni addition on the morphologies and mechanical properties of primary carbides and eutectic colonies in Cr-Fe-C <b>hard-facing</b> alloys with hypereutectic compositions. Findings show that V, Mo, and Ni addition obviously affects the hardness and indentation fracture (K(C)) of primary carbides and eutectic colonies. V addition to alloy A can slightly increase the hardness of primary carbides varying from 1503 +/- 17 to 1551 +/- 13 HV but slightly decreases the K(C) value of primary carbides ranging from 3. 80 +/- 0. 15 to 3. 64 +/- 0. 14 MPa m(1 / 2). Mo addition to alloy B can increase the K(C) value of primary carbides ranging from 2. 35 +/- 0. 11 to 2. 67 +/- 0. 08 MPa m(1 / 2). Ni addition to alloy B can decrease the hardness of eutectic colonies varying from 769 +/- 9 to 608 +/- 13 HV. Maximum hardness was obtained in the coated surface of alloy B due {{to the formation of}} large amounts of primary M(7) C(3) carbides. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} high carbon Fe-Cr-C {{hardfacing}} alloys were produced by {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW). Chromium and graphite alloy fillers {{were used to}} deposit hardfacing alloys on ASTM A 36 steel substrates. Depending on the four different graphite additions in these alloy fillers, this research produced hypereutectic microstructures of Fe-Cr phase and (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides on <b>hard-facing</b> alloys. The microstructural results indicated that primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides and eutectic colonies of [Cr-Fe+(Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) ] existed in hardfacing alloys. With increasing the C contents of the hardfacing alloys, the fraction of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides increased and their size decreased. The hardness of hardfacing alloys increased with fraction of primary (Cr. Fe) (7) C(3) carbides. Regarding the abrasive characteristics, the wear resistance of hardfacing alloys were related to the fraction of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides. The wear mechanism was also dominated by the fraction of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides. Fewer primary carbides resulted in continuous scratches worn on the surface of hardfacing alloy. In addition, the formation of craters resulted from the fracture of carbides. However, the scratches became discontinuous with increasing fraction of the carbides. More primary carbides can effectively prevent the eutectic colonies from the damage of abrasive particles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} demands of economical, reliable and durable hydraulic and pneumatic systems, {{it is necessary}} to minimize the material damage from cavitation erosion (CE) when systems are handling cavitating and corrosive fluids. Cavitation erosion is a nausea for many engineering components, such as ship propellers & rudders, turbine, diesel engine, cylinder liner, pump impeller vanes, control valves, hydraulic turbines, bearings, pipes, ultrasonic cleaners and mechanical heart valves, which are exposed to the high-speed flowing or vibratory fluids. This paper reviews the rationale behind the application of laser surface modification for achieving CE resistant surfaces of fluid handling components. The problem of CE may be tackled by enhancing the surface properties of the base materials (ferrous and non-ferrous alloys) with various laser surface modification techniques including laser transformation hardening (LTH), laser surface melting (LSM), laser surface alloying (LSA), laser cladding (LC), laser dispersion (LD) and laser plasma hybrid spraying (LPHS).
