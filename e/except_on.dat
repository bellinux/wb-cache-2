5|$|At present Eurostar is {{concentrating on}} {{developing}} its connections with other services, but direct services to other destinations would be possible. However, the routes that any potential services {{are likely to}} take would include infrastructure that Eurostar's rolling stock has not been built to use— German railways mostly have 15 kV AC electrification, while the Netherlands uses 1.5 kV DC (<b>except</b> <b>on</b> HSL Zuid and the Betuweroute).|$|E
5|$|During presidential elections, {{candidates}} may advertise on the Internet <b>except</b> <b>on</b> {{the eve of}} polling day and polling day itself.

5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether <b>except</b> <b>on</b> the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E

5|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} sparse {{through most of}} the life of the railway. In 1905, three trains per day ran from Goole to Haxey Junction and back, with a {{separate}} train operating on the Fockerby Branch. By November, only the morning and evening train ran, <b>except</b> <b>on</b> Wednesdays. A coal strike in 1912 resulted in all services being withdrawn <b>except</b> <b>on</b> Wednesdays and Saturdays for a period of three weeks. At a public meeting held in October 1920, users complained about the poor service and the lack of trucks to carry goods. The chairman of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council was particularly exasperated by the fact that the trains arrived at Haxey Junction shortly after the trains on the other line had departed.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem was}} further {{addressed}} in 2014 when Greyhound rolled {{out a new}} yield management computer system. With the new system, Greyhound is now able to more closely manage the number of tickets sold for each departure and dynamically adjust pricing based on sales. Although the amount of overbooked buses has been sharply reduced with this new system, Greyhound still does not explicitly guarantee a seat to everyone with a ticket (<b>except</b> <b>on</b> Greyhound Express routes).|$|E

5|$|Following the Constitution of May 3, 1791, the senate's competences were altered; in {{most cases}} the {{senators}} could only vote together with the sejm, and the senate's veto powers were limited. Legislative power was limited to the deputies of the sejm (not senators voting separately, <b>except</b> <b>on</b> the senate's privilege of veto, a suspension of a given legislation until the sejm votes on it again during the next session). The king, who nominated senators, ministers and other officials, presided over the senate, and could propose new laws together with the executive government, over which he also presided (the newly created Straż Praw or the Guardianship of Laws). The sejm also had the supervisory role, as government ministers and other officials were to be responsible to it.|$|E
