5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced {{to pay taxes on}} it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for the ability to be turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{knowing that}} she is innocent, Chrissie allows Zoe {{to believe that she}} has killed Den. Consequently, a power {{struggle}} breaks out between Sam – who wants her pub back in return for her silence – and Chrissie, with each woman trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his clothes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time, and begins a relationship with Jake Moon (Joel Beckett); however, Sam has taken the doorstop and hidden it in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) what has happened before she goes.|$|E

In the second season, Wally and Beaver are seen walking home from school with their schoolbooks and entering the house through the front door. In the third through fifth seasons, Wally and Beaver are seen walking towards the Pine Street house. Beaver carries a baseball glove and limps along the curbstone. In the last season, Beaver, arguing with Wally as the two are walking home, pushes Wally <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> they start chasing each other around a tree and into the house.|$|E
25|$|Day's {{interest}} in animal welfare and related issues apparently dates to her teen years. While recovering from an automobile accident, {{she took her}} dog Tiny for a walk without a leash. Tiny ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> {{was killed by a}} passing car. Day later confessed guilt and loneliness about Tiny's untimely death. In 1971, she co-founded Actors and Others for Animals, and appeared in a series of newspaper advertisements denouncing the wearing of fur, alongside Mary Tyler Moore, Angie Dickinson, and Jayne Meadows. Day's friend, Cleveland Amory, wrote about these events in Man Kind? Our Incredible War on Wildlife (1974).|$|E
25|$|Before {{releasing}} the jury for deliberation, Judge Learned Hand altered {{the charges against}} the defendants and attempted to preface the jury of their constitutional duties. Hand dismissed all the charges against Josephine Bell, and dismissed the first count – “conspiracy to cause mutiny and refusal of duty”—against the remaining defendants. Prior to {{releasing the}} jurors, Judge Hand stated, “I {{do not have to}} remind you that every man has the right to have such economic, philosophic or religious opinions as seem to him best, whether they be socialist, anarchistic or atheistic.” After deliberating from Thursday afternoon to Saturday, the jury returned with two decisions. First, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist and, consequently, un-American. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror) but moved to drag the socialist supporter out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> lynch him. Judge Hand, given the uproar, declared a mistrial.|$|E

25|$|On 15 October 2011, about 200,000 people {{gathered}} in Rome to protest against economic inequality {{and the influence}} of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund on government. Many other protests occurred in other Italian cities the same day. In Rome masked and hooded militants wearing makeshift body armor, in black bloc fashion, participated in the protests centered in St John Lateran square and committed numerous violent acts, throwing Molotov cocktails and other homemade explosives, burning and blowing up cars, burning buildings, and smashing up property such as ATMs and shop windows. The Roman Catholic church Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano received extensive damage, including a statue of the Virgin Mary being thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> destroyed. Several unexploded petrol bombs were reportedly found on several streets by Italian police. Over 1,000,000 euros of damage (equivalent to over 1.3 million dollars) was recorded. At least 135 people were injured in the resulting clashes, including 105 police officers, several of whom were left in critical condition, and two news crews from Sky Italia. Two protesters had their fingers amputated by exploding smoke bombs. Almost 20 people have been arrested in connection with the violence. After the 15 October demonstration, people occupied the Santa Croce in Gerusalemme square and started camping as in other cities worldwide. The name of this Rome's group, related to international Occupy movement, is Accampata Roma.|$|E
25|$|Played mid-credits, Amy (Elizabeth Banks) {{worries that}} her boyfriend Anson's (Josh Duhamel) cat, Beezel (an {{animated}} cartoon), is coming between their relationship. Beezel seems to detest Amy {{and anyone who}} comes between him and Anson, but Anson only sees Beezel as innocent. One day, Amy witnesses Beezel masturbating to summer vacation photos of Anson in a swimsuit. Beezel attacks her and violently urinates on her. Anson still finds his pet innocent but Amy threatens to leave if he doesn't get rid of Beezel. Caring more about his relationship, Anson agrees {{to find a new}} home for him. That night, from a closet, Beezel tearfully watches the couple make love (whilst sodomizing himself with a hairbrush and dry humping a stuffed teddy bear). The next day {{when it comes time to}} take Beezel away, he is nowhere to be found. Amy goes outside to look. Beezel then runs her over with a truck and attempts to shoot her to death with a shotgun, but she chases him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> begins beating him with a shovel, which is witnessed by a group of children attending a birthday party at a neighboring house. When Anson approaches to see what is happening, Amy tries to explain Beezel's motives. Beezel acts innocent and Anson sides with his cat. The children of the party then attack and murder Amy for beating up Beezel, stabbing her with plastic forks. Anson grabs Beezel, as Beezel again fantasizes about French kissing his owner.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{pioneering}} work with gas Murdoch {{never made any}} money from this invention due to his failure to obtain a patent. This may have been partly {{a result of the}} advice of James Watt, Junior, that the discovery was not patentable, and partly a result of the commercial failure of his earlier patent of 1791 for an early form of aniline dye. This failure to apply for a patent, despite the commercial participation of Boulton and Watt in this field, left the fledgling industry of gas production and lighting open for exploitation by other commercial interests, such as his former assistant Samuel Clegg and Frederick Albert Winsor. In large part this was due to the failure of Boulton and Watt to make sufficient effort to expand from the factory and mill lighting market which they dominated by 1809 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> domestic lighting market. This reason for this lassitude is unknown but can be attributed to lack of interest, a failure to appreciate the size of the potential market, and a lack of desire to be involved in smaller, less prestigious projects. By May 1809 Boulton and Watt faced little competition in any gas market due to their success in lobbying Parliament to block the granting of a charter for the National Heat and Light Company, their only real competitor in this field. However, despite blocking the charter until 1812 this advantage was squandered as Boulton and Watt did not develop the gas market, or technology, and in 1814 abandoned the gas business. A few decades later most towns in Britain were lit by gas and most had their own gasworks.|$|E

500|$|The group drew {{inspiration}} from short-lived punk bands like the Fat Sluts, The Lone Reagans and Forbidden Mule, whom Ferguson describes as [...] "like all punk bands... very fast and furious." [...] Much of the band's provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers, where to get people's attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics—the group would sometimes walk <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> stop traffic to get noticed.

500|$|Early Thursday morning, a final {{desperate attempt}} to keep the flames from {{spreading}} was made at Gammeltorv. Already-burning houses were fired upon with cannons to make them collapse. When that did not work, an order was given {{to blow up the}} houses with black powder charges. The building housing the wine cellar known as [...] "Blasen" [...] on the corner of Vestergade and Nørregade was to be the first demolition, but this dangerous undertaking failed when the gunpowder blew up while men were still carrying in the charges. While the building did go down, people were killed and injured and the explosion ignited nearby buildings, including the church Vor Frue Kirke. By 9:30a.m. the church spire had fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> soon after the whole church was engulfed in flames; the personal property that people had brought to the church to keep them safe from the fire was lost.|$|E

500|$|The two {{stations}} at Victoria came largely under single {{ownership in}} 1923 with {{the formation of}} the Southern Railway (SR) as part of the Big Four grouping. The following year steps were taken to integrate the two stations. The platforms were renumbered in a single sequence, openings were made in the wall separating them to allow passengers to pass {{from one to the other}} without going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> alterations were made to the tracks to allow for interchangeable working. The work was completed in 1925, and all platforms were renumbered in a contiguous sequence. Electric suburban services to Herne Hill and Orpington first ran on 12 July that year, followed by South London line services on 17 June 1928, and electric services to Crystal Palace and [...] (via [...] ) on 3 March 1929. The SR also concentrated Continental steamer traffic at Victoria, introducing the Golden Arrow, in 1924, and the Night Ferry in 1936.|$|E

500|$|Daoíz, {{the highest-ranking}} {{officer at the}} Monteleón barracks found himself in command of just 4 officers, 3 NCOs and 10 men.

[...] Daoíz's orders from the local junta were {{to remain in the}} barracks and co-operate with French forces but, after conferring with Captain Pedro Velarde y Santillán, he decided that the French troops were hostile to Spain and that they would defend the barracks against any French interference. By this time a large crowd of civilians had gathered at the barracks, requesting weapons with which to oppose the French, and Daoíz ordered the armoury opened to them. With 9 cannon, and 120 soldiers and armed civilians under his command, Daoíz now made arrangements for the defence of the barracks. A battery of 24 pounder guns were placed at the main gate facing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> were loaded with canister shot by their military and civilian crews. A small detachment of French stationed near the barracks were captured by Verlarde and their weapons and ammunition distributed to civilians.|$|E

In May 2009, Robbie said that Donna is a [...] "really likeable character" [...] and that she gets to play out funny and crazy storylines while playing her. In November of that year, it was revealed that Robbie had begged the scriptwriters to let Donna go off the rails or go to rehab. Robbie said that she would like a dramatic storyline, but the show's G rating makes it difficult. Robbie also said that she enjoys playing Donna, as she is [...] "great" [...] and a [...] "bit crazy". She added [...] "I'm really glad I get to play her and not an average, boring teenage girl. You can be an average, boring teenage girl every other day of the week. It's fun {{to be able to say}} and do these things you normally wouldn't".|$|E
