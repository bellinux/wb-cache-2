5|$|Gravitationally induced <b>irregularities</b> in Uranus's {{observed}} orbit led {{eventually to}} the discovery of Neptune in 1846, and presumed <b>irregularities</b> in Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later found to be a mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find Pluto in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all. In 1989, Voyager 2 determined the <b>irregularities</b> to be due to an overestimation of Neptune's mass.|$|E
5|$|A {{pattern of}} <b>irregularities</b> has been {{discovered}} concerning the updating of the list when citizens of Croatia turn 18 or die. In 2005, {{it was estimated that}} the register contained a large number of <b>irregularities</b> and erroneous entries. Since then, public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through roundtables and advertising campaigns; according to GONG—a NGO specializing in election monitoring—although the register was improved, there is room for further improvement. The 2011 census also indicated a large number of voters in the registry who should not be there, leading to claims that up to a half-million voters in the registry should not be included.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—GPUs {{have been}} used to {{accelerate}} many regular applications and, more recently, irregular applications in which the control flow and memory access patterns are data-dependent and statically unpredictable. This paper defines two measures of <b>irregularity</b> called control-flow <b>irregularity</b> and memory-access <b>irregularity,</b> and investigates, using performance-counter measurements, how irregular GPU kernels differ from regular kernels with respect to these measures. For a suite of 13 benchmarks, we find that (i) <b>irregularity</b> at the warp level varies widely, (ii) control-flow <b>irregularity</b> and memory-access <b>irregularity</b> are largely independent of each other, and (iii) most kernels, including regular ones, exhibit some <b>irregularity.</b> A program’s <b>irregularity</b> can change between different inputs, systems, and arithmetic precision but generally stays in a specific region of the <b>irregularity</b> space. Whereas some highly tuned implementations of irregular algorithms exhibit little <b>irregularity,</b> trading off extra <b>irregularity</b> for better locality or less work can improve overall performance.

China Academy of Railway Sciences has studied on China’s three main track <b>irregularity</b> power spectrums, and put forward the fitting function of the track <b>irregularity</b> power spectrum of the three main lines.

5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or <b>irregularities</b> in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The <b>irregularities</b> in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E
