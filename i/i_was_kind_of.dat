A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said.

500|$|The writers {{originally}} wanted American actor Sheldon Leonard {{to voice}} Fat Tony, {{but they were}} unable to get him, so they went with Joe Mantegna instead. Mantegna was offered the role during the show's second season, and since he had seen the show before and thought it was [...] "funny", he decided to give it a shot. He felt honored that they asked him to do a voice for the show. In an interview with The A.V. Club, Mantegna said he thinks the reason he got the role was partly due to his performance in the 1990 Mafia film The Godfather Part III, which opened just prior to when he received the role. He thought the script was smart and clever and that he enjoyed recording it. Mantegna has since appeared many times on the show as Fat Tony, who became a recurring character; it is Mantegna's longest-running role in his acting career. Mantegna commented: [...] "Who knew that Fat Tony was gonna resonate in {{the hearts and minds of}} the [...] out there? Apparently [...] got enough feedback as to how the character was liked that they wrote it in again and again, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a recurring guy that they’d tap into at least a couple episodes a season." ...|$|E

I'm a grown woman now. I've been working with The Cataracs {{for the past three years}} and I met them when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> young and from a small town. I was like, dammit, I'm gonna make a sexy song! So that's what I did." [...] She explained that she wanted the song to be [...] "tasteful, yet sexual" [...] and described it as [...] "very sexy, but very musical at the same time". She said, [...] "The songs I had before, even though they were explicit to an extent, they were just fun. It was time when we just wanted to make that sort of record, and we did. It's probably one of the sexier songs on the record, but I think it needed that!" [...] "In the Dark" [...] was recorded during a session in January 2011; it was one of the first songs to be recorded for Dev's debut album and it was eventually also recorded by Demi Lovato.

Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it.
