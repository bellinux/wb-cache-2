30|$|Retroperitoneal {{haematoma}} can be {{the result}} of haemorrhage secondary to anticoagulation. Such haematomas are often restricted to the posterior pararenal compartment, typically intramuscular within the psoas muscle, or at a distance from the abdominal aorta. A “haematocrit effect” may also be seen as a blood-fluid level [33]. Rarely, haematomas secondary to other vascular injuries in the retroperitoneum, such as rupture of smaller lumbar, renal capsular, or <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> <b>arteries</b> or pseudoaneurysms, can mimic AAA rupture. Analysing the images for other such vascular anomalies, relating the arterial vascular anomalies to the anatomical site of the haematoma, and correlating these to the clinical and previous surgical history can help distinguish AAA rupture from other arterial branch ruptures.|$|R

40|$|Duodenal {{metastasis}} from renal {{cell carcinoma}} is rare, and even rarer is a massive gastrointestinal bleeding from such tumours. Coeliac occlusive disease, although rarely symptomatic, can lead to ischaemic changes with anastomotic dehiscence and leaks when a patient undergoes pancreatoduodenectomy. A 41 -year-old man with known metastasis to the adrenal glands {{and the second part}} of the duodenum close to the ampulla of Vater from clear cell {{renal cell carcinoma}} was admitted to our department due to massive gastrointestinal bleeding from the duodenal metastasis. Endoscopic control of the bleed was not possible, while the bleeding vessel embolization was able to control the haemorrhage only temporarily. An angiography during the embolization demonstrated the presence of stenosis of the coeliac artery and also hypertrophic <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> <b>arteries</b> supplying the proper hepatic artery via the gastroduodenal artery (GDA). The patient underwent emergency pancreatoduodenectomy with preservation of the gastroduodenal artery. The patient had an uneventful recovery and did not experience further bleeding.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{precisely}} {{examined the}} topography of the duodenum, pancreas, bile duct, and supplying vessels {{from the perspective}} of performing duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Little has been reported regarding the detailed surgical anatomy that is crucial in this procedure. METHODS: The authors precisely examined the local anatomy of the pancreas head and duodenum, using materials from 40 autopsy cases. RESULTS: Arcade formation between the anterior superior <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> (ASPD) <b>artery</b> and the anterior <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> (AIPD) <b>artery</b> was found in all of the cases. After departing from the gastroduodenal artery, the ASPD ran toward a point 1. 5 cm below the papilla of Vater, then turned to the posterior aspect of the pancreas to joint the AIPD. In 88 % of the cases, an arcade was found between the posterior superior <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> (PSPD) <b>artery</b> and the posterior <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> (PIPD) <b>artery.</b> The ASPD, AIPD, PSPD, PIPD, or their branches to the duodenum, the bile duct, and the papilla of Vater were not completely buried in the pancreatic parenchyma in any of these cases. Generally, it was easy to dissect the pancreas from the duodenum because of the loose connection. Near the accessory papilla, however, dissection of the vessels was difficult, and the pancreatic parenchyma sometimes was found in the wall of the duodenum. Dissection of the pancreas from the common bile duct and identification of the main pancreatic duct at the junction with the terminal portion of the bile duct were straightforward in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible to remove the head of the pancreas while preserving of the vascular arcades and their branches to the duodenum, the bile duct, and the papilla of Vater...|$|R
50|$|The {{duodenum}} receives {{arterial blood}} {{from two different}} sources. The transition between these sources is important as it demarcates the foregut from the midgut. Proximal to the 2nd part of the duodenum (approximately at the major duodenal papilla - where the bile duct enters) the arterial supply is from the gastroduodenal artery and its branch the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. Distal to this point (the midgut) the arterial supply is from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and its branch the <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> supplies the 3rd and 4th sections.The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (from the gastroduodenal artery and SMA respectively) form an anastomotic loop between the celiac trunk and the SMA; so there is potential for collateral circulation here.|$|E
50|$|The small {{intestine}} receives a blood supply from the coeliac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery. These are both {{branches of the}} aorta. The duodenum receives blood from the coeliac trunk via the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and from the superior mesenteric artery via the <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> <b>artery.</b> These two arteries both have anterior and posterior branches that meet in the midline and anastomose. The jejunum and ileum receive blood from the superior mesenteric artery. Branches of the superior mesenteric artery form a series of arches within the mesentery known as arterial arcades, which may be several layers deep. Straight blood vessels known as vasa recta travel from the arcades closest to the ileum and jejunum to the organs themselves.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. True aneurysms of peripancreatic {{arterial}} arcades (PAAAs) are rare. Most of them {{coexist with}} celiac axis stenosis/occlusion due to median arcuate ligament (MAL) compression or atherosclerosis. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the cause of celiac axis lesion and characterize the anatomy of the aneurysms. These findings may have important management implications. Material and Methods. A retrospective analysis of 15 patients with true PAAAs was performed. The diagnosis was established by contrast-enhanced CT, using a 64 -MDCT scanner. We evaluated the most probable cause of celiac axis lesion. Aneurysms were characterized by their number, location, size, and morphology. Location of the aneurysms was classified either as <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> <b>arteries</b> (PDA) or as dorsal pancreatic arteries (DPA) as they may represent different collateral pathways between superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk. Results. A total of 32 true PAAAs were identified. Celiac trunk was occluded in 12 patients and critically narrowed in 3 patients. Celiac axis lesion was categorized as secondary to MAL compression in 14 cases and due to atherosclerosis in 1 case. The most common location of the aneurysms was <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Only in 1 case aneurysms involved both PDA and DPA. Conclusions. Coexistence of PAAAs with celiac axis compression as well as involvement of either PDAs or DPAs has important therapeutic implications. The uninvolved collateral pathway may be sufficient to preserve effective circulation in celiac trunk branches in case of resection or embolization of the aneurysms. However, further studies are crucial to confirm our findings...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} accuracy of 64 -row computed tomography angiography (CTA) {{in the study of}} vascular anatomy by assessing the incidence of anatomical variations of the origin of the coeliac trunk, mesenteric arteries and collateral branches. Materials and methods. Sixty patients were evaluated with 64 -row CTA (VCT, General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with a collimation of 0. 625 mm after the injection of iodinated nonionic contrast material (4 ml/s). Exclusion criteria were the presence of any pathological condition likely to affect normal vascular anatomy. Results. The coeliac trunk had a normal trifurcation in 56. 7 % of cases. The common hepatic artery was normal in 60 % of patients. The <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> <b>arteries</b> were either absent or not assessable in 8. 3 % of cases and there was a double trunk in 5 %, a common trunk in 83. 3 % and a single vessel in 3. 3 %. The number of jejunal and ileal arteries ranged from a minimum of six to a maximum of 13 (mean value 8. 7 +/- 1. 34). The Riolan arcade was assessable in 31. 7 % and developed in 68. 4 % of these. Conclusions. The 64 -row CTA enables visualisation of small vessels and accessory arteries that are difficult to identify with other techniques. The technique's high sensitivity allowed us to observe that the prevalence of vascular abnormalities is higher than that reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The present {{article is}} the fourth part of a {{comprehensive}} review of the arterial blood supply of the pancreas and completes the study of the arterial vascularization of the pancreatic head dealing with the anterior inferior and posterior <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> aa. and with some minor sources of blood supply not involving the classical system of the pancreaticoduodenal arches. The aim of this review is to summarise the anatomical studies, starting from Haller's reports, and to supply, as far as possible with original material, angiographic evidence for the classic anatomical concepts. For this purpose, 1015 selective angiographs (celiac trunk and its branches, superior mesenteric a.) were taken from the angiographic archives of the Institutes of Radiology of Siena, Rome (Catholic University), and Perugia. These demonstrated the anterior <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> a., present in most instances, as arising from the <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> a., from a common trunk with the posterior <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> a. and the 1 st jejunal a., from the 1 st jejunal a. or from the superior mesenteric a.; on the other hand, the posterior <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> a. was more variable, originating from the <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> a., from a common trunk with the anterior <b>inferior</b> <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> a. and the 1 st jejunal a., from the superior mesenteric a., from the dorsal pancreatic a., or from a right accessory hepatic a. coming from the superior mesenteric a.

With persistent pain and progressively decreasing hemoglobin level, computed tomog-raphy with contrast showed fluid collection in the subphrenic space, a retroperitoneal hematoma, and a pan-creaticoduodenal artery aneurysm that appeared to originate from a branch of the SMA. Urgent angiography indicated spontaneous rupture of a <b>pancreaticoduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> aneurysm. Emergent surgery was undertak-en, and a simple aneurysmectomy was successfully performed.
