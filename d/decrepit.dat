5|$|Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Valestra; a {{powerful}} crime boss who goes into business with Carl Beaumont, and threatens {{to kill him}} for embezzling money. Once Andrea returns, he is an old, <b>decrepit</b> man, dependent on an oxygen tank to live due to years of smoking. He hires the Joker to kill Batman, but the Joker double-crosses him and kills him with Joker venom.|$|E
5|$|Wismer {{sought a}} place for his team to play, but was only able to secure the <b>decrepit</b> Polo Grounds, which had been without a major tenant since the {{departure}} of the New York Giants baseball team in 1957. The stadium stood on the northern tip of Manhattan, across the Harlem River from Yankee Stadium, where the New York Giants NFL team played.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Navy {{went into}} a period of decline. In 1864, the Navy had 51,500men in uniform, and almost 700 ships and about 60 monitor-type coastal ironclads which made the U.S. Navy the second {{largest in the world}} after the Royal Navy. By 1880 the Navy only had 48 ships in commission, 6,000 men, and the ships and shore {{facilities}} were <b>decrepit</b> but Congress saw no need to spend money to improve them. The Navy was unprepared to fight a major maritime war before 1897.|$|E
5|$|Further to {{the east}} of Begumpur Masjid, in the Serai Shahji village, Mughal period {{buildings}} are seen of which the Serai Shaji Mahal is a distinguishing monument. The area surrounding this is scattered with <b>decrepit</b> gates, graves and a large slum area. A little distance from this place is the tomb of Shiekh Farid Murtaza Khan, who during Emperor Akbar’s period, was credited with building a number of Serai's, a mosque and Faridabad village, which is now the presentday large city in Haryana.|$|E
5|$|Marguerite Louise's extravagances perturbed Ferdinando {{because the}} Tuscan {{exchequer}} was nearly bankrupt; {{it was so}} empty that when the Wars of Castro mercenaries were paid for, the state {{could no longer afford}} to pay interest on government bonds. Accordingly, the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so <b>decrepit</b> that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places. In August 1663 Marguerite Louise delivered a boy: Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa in 1667 and Gian Gastone in 1671.|$|E
5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their <b>decrepit</b> conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Some years later, Peg Boggs, a local Avon {{door-to-door}} saleswoman, {{visits the}} <b>decrepit</b> Gothic mansion where Edward lives. She finds Edward alone and offers {{to take him}} to her home after discovering he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her family: her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Despite their initial fear of Edward, they come to see him as a kind person.|$|E
5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male sexual desire, {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even in a physical sense. When Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to please her. His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; {{by the end of}} the book he is an elderly, <b>decrepit</b> shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife– without irony– if he can bring home his fifteen-year-old mistress.|$|E
5|$|By 1894 two Manning Wardle {{locomotives}} were in use: Huddersfield, works number 616, built 1876, and Earl Temple, works number 1249, built 1894. Huddersfield {{was bought}} second-hand and {{had originally been}} named Prestwich. Earl Temple, later renamed Brill No.1, was identical to Huddersfield other than having a covered cab, and was bought new. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad could not afford the price, and thus Earl Temple was owned directly by the Earl and rented to the O Wotton No. 2, works number 1415, built 1899, was bought on 7 February 1899 to replace Huddersfield. All three were 0-6-0ST with inside cylinders. The <b>decrepit</b> Huddersfield was sold in 1901, {{and the other two}} Manning Wardle locomotives were sold in 1909.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, 1915, {{police detective}} Jack Walters (voiced by Milton Lawrence) is {{summoned to the}} siege of a <b>decrepit</b> manor house in Boston. The manor is {{inhabited}} by a bizarre cult called the Fellowship of the Yith, led by one Victor Holt who has asked specifically for Walters to {{come and talk to}} him. Taking cover from an ensuing firefight, Walters finds himself separated from the police and trapped inside the mansion, with no option but to investigate. When the rest of the police finally break in, they find the cultists dead by mass suicide and Walters apparently insane. He is committed to Arkham Asylum, where he stays for six years.|$|E
5|$|The station depot {{remained}} on its concrete platform when the tracks were torn {{up on the}} old main line. In 1996, workers removed the plaque attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, the plaque was stolen shortly afterward {{and has not been}} recovered. The station depot itself was left in <b>decrepit</b> condition, and in 2006, the village of Harriman's building inspector ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern followed through with a demolition permit and in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front loader. The station remains were taken to a dump in Hillburn, New York.|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} a <b>decrepit</b> yacht, the Granma, on 25 November 1956 Castro set sail from Tuxpan, Veracruz, with 81 revolutionaries armed with 90 rifles, 3 machine guns, around 40 pistols and 2 hand-held anti-tank guns. The 1,200 mile crossing to Cuba was harsh, {{and in the}} overcrowded conditions of the ship, many suffered seasickness, and food supplies ran low. At some points they had to bail water caused by a leak, and at another a man fell overboard, delaying their journey. The plan had been for the crossing to take 5 days, and on the ship's scheduled day of arrival, 30 November, MR-26-7 members under Frank Pais led an armed uprising against government buildings in Santiago, Manzanillo and several other towns. However, the Granmas journey ultimately lasted 7 days, and with Castro and his men unable to provide reinforcements, Pais and his militants dispersed {{after two days of}} intermittent attacks.|$|E
5|$|After this {{demonstration}} of power, AJ is promoted by his manager. A montage of AJ being promoted for doing absurd tasks follows. Soon, AJ is promoted to a rank {{with a private}} office. Danny and Morgan refuse to work for AJ further, finding him corrupt with power. AJ throws them out, and afterward he is promoted to CEO by a former officer—a <b>decrepit</b> man within a robotic business suit. AJ floats {{to the top of}} the suit, from which he spots a beach ball-destroying machine to the side. He hallucinates the beach balls as the heads of Morgan and Danny, who say that he has destroyed the spirit of summer. Realizing his mistake, AJ rejects the promotion. He returns to his friends outside, and together they plan the rest of their summer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the novel}} uses fantastic elements, its main focus is a {{realistic}} {{portrayal of the}} excesses of bourgeois materialism. Balzac's renowned attention to detail is used to describe a gambling house, an antique shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home {{similar to the one}} he occupied at the start of his literary career. The central theme of La Peau de chagrin is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression of will, especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a caution from the shopkeeper who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself miserable and <b>decrepit</b> at the story's end.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, {{the local}} {{authority}} began to systematically buy {{up all the}} stalls on the market, eventually bringing the entire market into public ownership. It was radically redesigned in the 1930s: stalls were arranged into parallel rows and a new City Hall was built along the entire {{western side of the}} marketplace to replace the by then inadequate Guildhall. This new arrangement survived with few significant changes {{for the rest of the}} 20thcentury. By the 1990s, the market was becoming <b>decrepit</b> and, in 2003, proposals were made for another radical rebuilding of the area. These proposals were extremely controversial and were abandoned in 2004 in favour of a scheme which retained the parallel rows of stalls, but replaced the old stalls with steel units of four stalls each. The rebuilt market was completed in early 2006 and is one of the largest markets in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th century, York Castle, {{along with}} Nottingham Castle, was {{considered}} a key security asset {{in the north of}} England, but investment even in these castles diminished. Repairs to York Castle grew infrequent from 1400 onwards, and it fell into increasing disrepair. Richard III recognised the issue and in 1483 had some of the most <b>decrepit</b> structures removed, but he died at the battle of Bosworth before replacement work could commence. By the reign of Henry VIII, the antiquary John Leland reported that the castle was in considerable disrepair; nonetheless the water defences remained intact, unlike those of many other castles of the period. As a result of the deterioration, Henry had to be advised that the king's councillors no longer had any official residence in which to stay and work when they were in York. The castle mint was shut down after the death of Edward VI in 1553, and the castle mills were given to a local charitable hospital in 1464. The hospital was then closed during the Reformation, and the mills passed into private ownership once again.|$|E
5|$|Khaplu Palace is {{the second}} fort in Baltistan to be renovated by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. Renovation started in 2005 and was {{completed}} in 2011. The project {{was funded by the}} Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs via its embassy in Islamabad. USAID helped fund an exhibition centre for Balti culture inside the fort. The exhibition centre takes up two-thirds of the site. The renovation work was carried out with the help of people from 400 local families employed as an initiative towards community building. The survey encompassing the topographical features of the renovation site. begun in 2005, used Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) devices. The survey helped in finding the original state of a number of <b>decrepit</b> portions of the palace. The renovation project was carried out following the Venice Charter's standards for restoration. The material procured for the restoration amounted to thirty million rupees (Rs 30 m), while the wages of the labourers aggregated to about twenty five million rupees (Rs 25 m).|$|E
5|$|Restoring Warrior was {{discussed}} in the early 1960s, but did not develop into a serious project. In 1967, the Greater London Council proposed to restore the ship as an attraction in London, but Warrior was still required in Pembroke by the Royal Navy and the scheme went no further. In 1968 the Duke of Edinburgh chaired a meeting that discussed preserving and restoring Warrior and other historic vessels, {{and a year later}} The Maritime Trust was established to save the <b>decrepit</b> ironclad and other historic ships. The Maritime Trust and a major supporter, the Manifold Trust led by the Conservative MP John Smith, maintained an interest in Warrior. In 1976 the Royal Navy announced that the Llanion Oil Depot would close in 1978, and the Manifold Trust began to seek funds to restore her. With the promise of financial support for restoration, the Royal Navy donated the ship to the trust in 1979. The Ship's Preservation Trust acquired ownership of the ship in 1983; it became the Warrior Preservation Trust in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 Shaw Brothers film Brothers {{from the}} Walled City {{is set in}} Kowloon Walled City. The 1984 gangster film Long Arm of the Law {{features}} the Walled City as a refuge for gang members before they are gunned down by police. In the 1988 film Bloodsport, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, the Walled City is the setting for a martial arts tournament. The 1992 non-narrative film Baraka features several highly detailed shots of the Walled City shortly before its demolition. The 1993 film Crime Story starring Jackie Chan was partly filmed in the deserted Walled City, and includes real scenes of building explosions. A walled neighbourhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film Batman Begins {{was inspired by the}} Walled City. The 2006 Hong Kong horror film Re-cycle features a <b>decrepit,</b> nightmarish version of the Walled City, complete with tortured souls from which the protagonist must flee. The 2016 TVB martial arts drama A Fist Within Four Walls takes place in the Triad-ridden Walled City in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The statehouse {{was built}} of blue limestone, two stories high. The {{governor}} and the Supreme Court occupied the lower floor, and the legislature occupied the upper floor, with each house in its own wing. The building {{was the site of}} many great events in its history, including a bier for Abraham Lincoln. The building was popular after its construction but by the 1860s Greek Revival architecture had fallen out of style, and the building was beginning to become <b>decrepit.</b> The building's limestone foundation began to fail, and many feared a general structural collapse of the building. In 1867 the ceiling in the chambers of the Indiana House of Representative collapsed. A debate was held in 1873 about how to preserve the building but no solution was found. By the time that Governor James Williams was elected to office, the building was about to be condemned. It was finally demolished in 1877.|$|E
5|$|The two journey out, {{finding a}} river {{that they were}} unaware of; the couple follow the river and make {{observations}} as they go. While resting under a tree, the man finds {{the remains of a}} campsite, discovering that the area they were in has been inhabited. Later, they find another campsite and massive, oddly shaped trees with markings on one. They find a <b>decrepit</b> boat they could use to cross the river, but continue up into the mountains. While climbing a small hill, the man sees a snake and tumbles down on the woman. Further on, they hear chirping in a tree, and pause briefly to observe a bird and its chick in a nest. While resting at a miniature river, the woman discovers that they are on the cliff of a large waterfall. After contemplating it, they decide to discover what the mountains are like.|$|E
5|$|While the 1976 renovations {{prolonged}} {{the life}} of the 1930s market, by the 1990s the market was once more becoming <b>decrepit.</b> The covers erected in 1976 over the walkways blocked sunlight, leaving much of the market dingy and poorly lit. The walkways themselves, already narrow, were becoming even more restricted as stalls erected external displays and additional weatherproofing. Removable shutters used to secure the stalls overnight were stacked against the sides of the stalls during trading hours, causing further obstruction, while on those stalls fitted with doors the doors opened outwards to maximise the limited space inside the units. In addition, the floors of stalls followed the slope of the hill, a gradient of about 1:12, causing health problems for those market workers who had to stand at this angle for prolonged periods during the day. Norwich City Council decided that these problems needed to be addressed, and in December 2003 invited the public to choose between three proposals for a rebuilt market.|$|E
5|$|In 1813 {{the yard}} of the King's Head {{coaching}} inn was widened to create Davey Place, a new street between {{the market and}} Back of the Inns, at that time a narrow passageway which ran parallel to Gentleman's Walk behind the coaching inns. (Although the inns no longer remain, Back of the Inns survives as a street name.) In 1820 the Gasolier, Norwich's first gas lamp, was installed in the market outside the entrance to Davey Place. Exchange Street, a new road running north from {{the northeast corner of}} the market, was completed in 1828 and a roadway was installed alongside the existing footpath. London Street, the main road connecting the market with the older areas of the city around Tombland and the Cathedral was widened in 1856. In 1860 the <b>decrepit</b> fish market adjacent to the Guildhall, by now over 700 years old, was replaced with a new neoclassical building. In 1863 Gentleman's Walk was paved properly with York stone, and in 1874 the cobbles of the marketplace were replaced by timber blocks. Although by this time the market operated on all working days, Sunday trading laws meant it was closed on Sundays. The market space on Sundays was used for public assemblies and gatherings.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a <b>decrepit</b> old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E
5|$|The film {{concerns}} a middle-aged railway pointsman, Maloin (Miroslav Krobot), {{who lives in}} a <b>decrepit</b> apartment in a port town with his highly-strung wife Camélia (Tilda Swinton) and his daughter Henriette (Erika Bók). One night while in his viewing tower at the port's rail terminus, Maloin witnesses a fight on the dockside. One of the shady combatants is knocked into the water along with the briefcase he carries; when the other flees the dark quayside, Maloin makes a clandestine descent from the tower and retrieves the briefcase, which he finds full of sodden English banknotes. Maloin conceals the money and tells no-one of what he has seen. The next morning, he visits a tavern where he plays chess with the barkeep (Gyula Pauer). On his way home, he stops by the butcher's where his daughter works, and finds to his indignation that they have her washing the floor. Later, from the window of his apartment, he notices Brown (János Derzsi) watching him from below. At dinner, Maloin is increasingly irascible, addressing Henriette brusquely and arguing with Camélia. Meanwhile, Brown searches the water at the dock's edge without success before noticing the watchtower overlooking the quayside, and Maloin within.|$|E
