25|$|Most of {{the books}} Ellis wrote after inventing REBT had a strong autobiographical element. He used anecdotes from his {{personal}} life {{to explain how the}} insights of REBT occurred to him and how they helped him cope with personal problems such as shyness, anger and chronic illness. He also used anecdotes from client sessions to illustrate how his therapy worked. Two of Ellis last books were explicitly autobiographical. Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy: <b>It</b> <b>Works</b> <b>for</b> Me -- It Can Work for You (Prometheus Books, 2004) recounts his early life and crises in an unusually candid way. It illustrates the way he handled his problems, at first through philosophy, and later through the application of his emerging therapeutic skills and insights. All Out!: An Autobiography (Prometheus Books, 2009) —published after his death—is a more traditional narrative of his life and work (though it also meant to be an inspirational story of the use of rational thinking in self-help).|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker {{said the}} pairing of Poehler and Posey led to great comedic scenes, {{but that the}} [...] "heart of the episode" [...] was Leslie's celebration of Ron's birthday.

Hillary Busis, also of Entertainment Weekly, called Posey's performance [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] and called Leslie's construction of the baseball diamond [...] "a sweet coda to a great, funny episode". Postmedia News writer Alex Strachan praised the episode {{not only for its}} likable and easily relatable characters, but for its willingness to address social issues like the divide between classes in Pawnee and Eagleton. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Eagleton" [...] seemed less story-driven and more over-the-top than usual, but that <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>for</b> the series because those episodes are funny and only happen periodically. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic complimented Posey's performance, but especially praised Leslie's birthday surprise for Ron, and claimed {{it was the first time}} since the NBC series Friends that he responded to a television comedy so emotionally. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the episode handled the rivalry between Pawnee and Eagleton nearly as well as some of the classic Cheers episodes about that bar and its rival, the Old Towne Tavern. He also called Offerman [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] in what Porter described as an excellent B-story.|$|E
