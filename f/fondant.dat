5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} thick layer of <b>fondant</b> icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the <b>fondant,</b> and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. <b>Fondant</b> eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The <b>fondant</b> is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E
5|$|The menu {{is created}} by Bosi. He has been {{described}} as an innovator and his work has been compared to that of Heston Blumenthal at The Fat Duck. One of the new dishes Bosi introduced following his move to London was a two-part pork dish. The first part was roasted suckling pig served with sea urchin, kohlrabi and a <b>fondant</b> of sweet potato. The second, inspired by his daughter, featured a sausage roll with a salad and a truffle dressing. Other dishes have included roast chicken with an onion fondue and licorice, and desserts include a chocolate tart served with basil ice cream.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} uses of betanins are in {{coloring}} {{ice cream and}} powdered soft drink beverages; other uses are in some sugar confectionery, e.g. <b>fondants,</b> sugar strands, sugar coatings, and fruit or cream fillings. In hot processed candies, {{it can be used}} if added at the final part of the processing. Betanin is also used in soups as well as tomato and bacon products. Betanin has [...] "not been implicated as causing clinical food allergy when used as a coloring agent".|$|R
50|$|Chocolate {{plays an}} {{important}} part in the Belgian economy, and there are over 2,000 chocolatiers in the country, both small and large. Today, chocolate is very popular in Belgium, with 172,000 tonnes produced each year, and widely exported. Côte d'Or is probably the largest commercial brand, with their products available in virtually every grocery store in the country. The largest manufacturers of wider varieties of chocolates are mentioned at Pralines. Belgian pralines (<b>fondants)</b> shaped like sea shells, fish, diamonds and individualist creations topped with are sold in town centre shops, market stands and many village shops across Belgium.|$|R
25|$|Creamed honey, {{also called}} whipped honey, spun honey, churned honey, honey <b>fondant,</b> and (in the UK) set honey, has been {{processed}} to control crystallization. Creamed honey contains {{a large number}} of small crystals, which prevent the formation of larger crystals that can occur in unprocessed honey. The processing also produces a honey with a smooth, spreadable consistency.|$|E
25|$|A Cadbury Creme Egg is a {{chocolate}} product {{produced in the}} shape of an egg. The product consists of a thick chocolate shell, housing a white and orange <b>fondant</b> filling which mimics the albumen and yolk of a chicken egg. The Creme Eggs are the best selling confectionery item between New Year's Day and Easter in the UK, with annual sales in excess of 200 million and a brand value of approximately £55 million. However, in 2016 sales plummeted after the controversial decision to change the recipe from the original Dairy Milk chocolate to a cheaper substitute, with reports of a loss of more than £6m in sales.|$|E
500|$|The frog cake is {{a dessert}} {{in the shape}} of a frog's head, {{composed}} of sponge cake and cream covered with <b>fondant.</b> It was created by the Balfours bakery in 1922, and soon became a popular treat in South Australia. Originally frog cakes were available exclusively in green, but later brown and pink were added to the range. Since then other variations have been developed, including seasonal varieties (such as snowmen and Easter [...] "chicks"). The frog cake has been called [...] "uniquely South Australian", and has been employed in promoting the state. In recognition of its cultural significance, in 2001 the frog cake was listed as a South Australian Heritage Icon by the National Trust of South Australia.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{to create}} a lace heart, a patch of white <b>fondant</b> is rolled out first on a {{silicone}} mat. Then an embossed <b>fondant</b> roller is slowly rolled {{across the surface of}} the <b>fondant.</b> A heart shaped cookie cutter is used to cut out the <b>fondant</b> hearts. The heart shaped <b>fondant</b> is then peeled off the silicone mat carefully so as not to mar the embossed design. Next, the <b>fondant</b> is trimmed and placed on top of the cookie. Finally the fondant-covered cookie may be brushed with a light dusting of pearl luster dust.|$|E
5000|$|Rolled <b>fondant,</b> <b>fondant</b> icing, or pettinice, {{which is}} not the same {{material}} as poured <b>fondant,</b> is commonly used to decorate wedding cakes. Although wedding cakes are traditionally made with marzipan and royal icing, <b>fondant</b> is increasingly common due to nut allergies as it does not require almond meal. Rolled <b>fondant</b> includes gelatin (or agar in vegetarian recipes) and food-grade glycerine, which keeps the sugar pliable and creates a dough-like consistency. It can also be made using powdered sugar and melted marshmallows. Rolled <b>fondant</b> is rolled out like a pie crust and used to cover the cake.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fondant</b> {{is another}} type of icing {{that is used to}} {{decorate}} cookies. <b>Fondant</b> can be colored by kneading the coloring into the dough. It can be rolled out, and then cut in shapes to match the cookies or their designs. <b>Fondant</b> can be purchased ready-made; however it is not favored for its taste. A homemade <b>fondant</b> that is often praised for its taste and function is marshmallow <b>fondant,</b> which is also used by cake decorators for covering cakes.|$|E
50|$|An {{impression}} mat can be {{used with}} <b>fondant</b> to add design and/or texture. First the <b>fondant</b> is rolled out and then the mat is placed face down on the <b>fondant.</b> Finally, by gently but firmly going over the mat with the rolling pin, the impression is made in the <b>fondant.</b> Then the shapes are cut out.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fondant</b> is a {{creative}} form of frosting style that is rolled out and draped over tiers. Its smooth, firm sugar icing is often embellished with appliqués, gum-paste flowers, or royal-icing details. <b>Fondant</b> {{can be cut}} into designs, formed into shapes, flavored or tinted. Poured <b>fondant</b> is used to glaze petits fours and other detailed confections. Such <b>fondant</b> gives a glossy finish and a sweet sugary taste.|$|E
50|$|The {{rolled out}} <b>fondant</b> may be cut into shapes {{with the same}} cookie cutters used to cut the cookies. Once cut out, the <b>fondant</b> is placed {{on top of the}} cookie. Some types of <b>fondant</b> will adhere right away to the cookie. If the <b>fondant</b> doesn't stick well, the cookie surface may be brushed with a little vanilla extract, corn syrup or piping gel to provide more {{sticking}} power.|$|E
50|$|Sculpting <b>fondant</b> {{is similar}} to rolled <b>fondant</b> but with a stiffer consistency, {{which makes it a}} good {{sculpting}} material.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fondant</b> icing, also {{commonly}} referred to simply as <b>fondant</b> ( [...] , from the [...] ), is an edible icing used to decorate or sculpt cakes and pastries. It is made from sugar, water, gelatin, and glycerol. It {{does not have the}} texture of most icings; rolled <b>fondant</b> is akin to stiff clay, while poured <b>fondant</b> is a thick liquid. The word, in French, means [...] "melting", coming from the same root as fondue and foundry.|$|E
50|$|Using {{this new}} form of <b>fondant</b> artistry should be used on a heavy cake consistency. It can, however, be used on the {{traditional}} cake mix purchased in a store. <b>Fondant</b> is heavier than traditional knife spread frosting. Pre-made <b>fondant</b> that {{is available in the}} cake decorating section in stores has little flavoring. A homemade <b>fondant</b> can be made quickly for very little cost, and tends to have a better flavor than the pre-made store bought version.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fondant</b> potatoes, or pommes <b>fondant,</b> is {{a method}} of {{preparing}} potatoes that traditionally involves cutting them into cylinders, browning the ends, and then slowly roasting them in butter and stock.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{shelf-stable}} rolled <b>fondant</b> often consists principally {{of sugar}} and hydrogenated oil. However, different formulations for commercial shelf-stable <b>fondant</b> are available and include other ingredients, such as sugar, cellulose gum, and water.|$|E
50|$|A {{black-and-white}} cookie, or half-and-half cookie, is a soft, sponge-cake-like shortbread {{which is}} iced on one half with vanilla <b>fondant,</b> {{and on the}} other half by chocolate <b>fondant.</b> This cookie was created in Germany.|$|E
