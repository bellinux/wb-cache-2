40|$|The <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stove</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} equipment devices in the blast furnace iron making process. The temperature and duration of hot air are the crucial parameters to assess the performance of the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stove.</b> In order to sustain the desired high temperature air, it requires rapid completed combustion reaction, stable flue gas flow structure, and uniform temperature distribution throughout the regenerator. In the present work, a 3 D numerical model with all essential turbulence, heat transfer, and combustion considerations has been developed to assess the performance of a typical hot air stove. The flow field of the whole domain and temperature distribution within the regenerator were simulated using the model. The predicted results show that the velocity at each nozzle varies substantially due to the uneven pressure distribution in cavity of the traditional <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stove,</b> generating the eccentric vortex that leads to nonuniform temperature distribution in the regenerator. In order to solve this problem, a new structure design of top combustion regenerative <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stove</b> is proposed. Numerical simulations were then carried out to compare based on the performance of the new <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stove</b> design against the traditional <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stove...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During <b>Hot</b> <b>Blast</b> <b>Stove</b> (HBS) combustion, NOx forms rapidly {{when the}} flame {{temperature}} above 1420 ℃. In order {{to restrain the}} amount of NOx formation during combustion of HBS, the formation mechanism of NOx is investigated, and the NOx formation rate and amount in HBS are calculated by means of thermodynamic model. A new type of dome combustion HBS is developed based on high temperature air combustion (HTAC) technology. A comparison on the combustion process and characteristic of conventional HBS and HTAC HBS is performed by application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation model. Temperature and concentration distribution, flame shape and NOx concentration distribution of two kinds of stove are calculated. The result shows quite symmetrical HTAC stove temperature distribution. Under the same dome temperature, NOx amount is 80 ppm only, reduced by approximate 76 % in comparison with conventional stove...|$|R

40|$|An {{issue of}} {{improvement}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the operation of a block of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stoves</b> of the blast furnace in order to rise the temperature of the blast-furnace air was considered. It was shown that an increase of the temperature of the blast-furnace air without the use of natural gas and oxygen for combustion is possible due to the changing of the operation modes of a block of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stoves</b> and at the increase of the pressure of the exchange gas. An analysis of the recent researches and publications describing the methods for determining the parameters of the operation of the block of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stoves</b> of the blast furnace was performed; their advantages and disadvantages were described. The goal of the research was set. A database of process parameters of the block was processed to determine the main characteristics of the operation of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stoves</b> of the blast furnace. Averaged values of the basic technical and design parameters were obtained; they characterize the operation of each hot blast stove of the block with the use of which the adjustment of a mathematical model of the operation of each of hot blast stove of the block was achieved. A method for determining the main unit operating parameters on the block on the account of the desired blast temperature was designed. The values of the duration of the cycle "heating + air blasting" depending on the set-point temperature of the smoke at various values of air blasting temperatures were determined for each hot blast stove of the block using a mathematical model. The authors suggested to use such dependencies to determine the temporal parameters of the operation of the block of <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> <b>stoves.</b> The obtained values of the duration of heating periods and air blasting of each hot blast stove of the block should be corrected if the continuity of the air blast supply to the blast furnace is not ensured.

To improve the energy efficiency it is necessary to investigate how to improve the hot blast stove operation.
