5|$|At {{least one}} of the objects now in the British Museum can be seen in a cabinet in the {{background}} of a family portrait from 1838 (left), the year before Ferdinand was born. In his Reminiscences Ferdinand recalled <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> as a child when he was allowed to help wrap and unwrap his father's collection, which spent the summers in a strongroom when the family left Vienna for a country villa.|$|E
5|$|Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit {{in front}} of a warm fire, {{continuing}} from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal {{went on to become a}} good and noble king.|$|E
5|$|The summer {{transfer}} {{window at}} Real Sociedad saw {{the arrival of}} Alonso's childhood friend Mikel Arteta. Arteta was ecstatic {{at the prospect of}} partnering Alonso in midfield but <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> was short lived. Alonso was not picked for Real Sociedad's pre-season friendlies, signalling that an offer by Liverpool was being treated seriously. The Basque side announced on 20 August 2004 that they had made a deal worth £10.7million with Liverpool and Alonso had agreed terms with the Merseyside team. Alonso did not lament the fact that a move to Real Madrid had not materialised. Instead, he concentrated on integrating with the new Spanish contingent at Liverpool under the guidance of former Valencia manager Rafael Benítez.|$|E

25|$|Newly {{promoted}} FA Premier League team West Ham United {{completed the}} signing of Benayoun in July 2005 for a fee of £2.5million, with Benayoun signing a four-year contract.

They would also promote shows in the US. Shaefer stated in a press release that he had intended to promote in the UK for some years and spoke of <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> to be in partnership with Haye.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2009–10 season, Rafael Benítez {{departed}} Liverpool {{after six}} years and was succeeded as manager by Roy Hodgson, who quickly assured fans that Gerrard would not be sold. To further eliminate any speculation surrounding his future at the club, Gerrard made a statement emphasising <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> at the coming season with Liverpool and praising the signing of Joe Cole. Gerrard soon played his first pre-season match of the 2010–11 season against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 1 August 2010 alongside new signing Joe Cole.|$|E
25|$|Congolese {{biologist}} Marcellin Agnagna led the 1983 expedition of Congolese to Lake Tele. According {{to his own}} account, Agnagna {{claimed to}} have seen a Mokèlé-mbèmbé at close distance for about 20 minutes. He tried to film it, but said that in <b>his</b> <b>excitement,</b> he forgot to remove the motion picture camera's lens cap. In a 1984 interview, Agnagna claimed, contradictorily, that the film was ruined {{not because of the}} lens cap, but because he had the Super 8 camera on the wrong setting: macro instead of telephoto.|$|E

25|$|A second {{invasion}} {{was planned}} {{in the winter}} of 55–54 for the summer of 54 BC. Cicero wrote letters to his friend Gaius Trebatius Testa and his brother Quintus, both of whom were serving in Caesar's army, expressing <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> at the prospect. He urged Trebatius to capture him a war chariot, and asked Quintus to write him a description of the island. Trebatius, as it turned out, did not go to Britain, but Quintus did, and wrote him several letters from there – as did Caesar himself.|$|E
25|$|Tristan relapses and {{recalls that}} the {{shepherd}}'s mournful tune {{is the same}} as was played when he was told of the deaths of his father and mother ("Muss ich dich so versteh'n, du alte, ernst Weise"). He rails once again against his desires and against the fateful love potion ("verflucht sei, furchtbarer Trank!") until, exhausted, he collapses in delirium. After his collapse, the shepherd is heard piping the arrival of Isolde's ship, and, as Kurwenal rushes to meet her, Tristan tears the bandages from his wounds in <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> ("Hahei! Mein Blut, lustig nun fliesse!"). As Isolde arrives at his side, Tristan dies with her name on his lips.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his pride}} in touring with Ellington (one of two letters to Grappelli relates <b>his</b> <b>excitement),</b> {{he was not}} fully {{integrated}} into the band. He played a few tunes {{at the end of}} the show, backed by Ellington, with no special arrangements written for him. After the tour, Reinhardt secured an engagement at Café Society Uptown, where he played four solos a day, backed by the resident band. These performances drew large audiences. Having failed to bring his usual Selmer Modèle Jazz, he played on a borrowed electric guitar, which he felt hampered the delicacy of his style. He had been promised jobs in California, but they failed to develop. Tired of waiting, Reinhardt returned to France in February 1947.|$|E

5000|$|Mr G's {{attitude}} towards his fellow {{staff members and}} to his students is often controlling; he enjoys taking authority as (temporary) Director of Performing Arts. He is sensitive about his colleagues touching his property and has frequently used a label maker to emphasise this. <b>His</b> apparent <b>excitement</b> in the mornings contrasts that of his colleagues - [...] "Coffee, coffee, coffee before we teachy, teachy!". <b>His</b> constant <b>excitement</b> for the subject of drama has been a frequent comic point of Summer Heights High, {{as well as his}} undying love for Celine, his pet dog, and his never ending commitment to his musicals - [...] "It's G time, not free time!".|$|R
25|$|According to musicologist Gerald Abraham, the operas on {{the whole}} embody an {{enormous}} mass of music far too beautiful and interesting to be ignored. Moreover, he maintains, Tchaikovsky's search for operatic subjects, along with his views on their nature and treatment and his own work on librettos, throw considerable light on his creative personality. Nevertheless, according to musicologist Francis Maes, most of Tchaikovsky's operas failed for three reasons. First, the composer could not get good librettos, despite continued requests to some of Russia's leading playwrights and his brother Modest. Second, he was no Verdi, Puccini or Leoncavalo. While he could write music that was often beautiful and sometimes very moving, it was generally not as arresting dramatically as anything those three provided. Third, and perhaps most sadly, Tchaikovsky's enthusiasm for opera writing did not match his theatrical sense. Apparently either unaware of this deficiency or unable to curb <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> long enough to take a cold, {{hard look at the}} true stage-worthiness of a libretto, he seemed destined to repeat his failures.|$|E
500|$|In August 2012, ABC {{ordered a}} pilot from Joss Whedon, who wrote and {{directed}} The Avengers, for a series set within the MCU. Paul Lee, president of ABC, compared the pilot to the series Once Upon a Time, in terms of budgetary and technological ambition, and spoke of <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> for the crossover potential with the larger film universe. [...] "Pilot" [...] was executive produced by Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, Jeffrey Bell and Jeph Loeb.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MSNBC, Lucas expressed <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> about the film and amazement at Denzel Washington's portrayal. However, Lucas admitted to several news outlets {{that only a small}} portion of the film was true, and that much of it was fabricated for dramatic effect. In addition, Richie Roberts criticized the film for portraying him in a custody battle while in real life he never had a child. Roberts criticized the portrayal of Lucas, describing it as [...] "almost noble".|$|E

He does so with Ashley in a makeshift theater in his room. Meanwhile, Cooze and Denise finally sleep together, and Cooze discovers that what Denise is [...] hiding is the fact that she ejaculates during sex, much to <b>his</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|E
500|$|At the party, Leslie discovers Andy and April plan to {{surprise}} everyone by getting married that night. Leslie {{spends most of}} the party trying to dissuade them, since they have been dating {{less than a month}} and have no place to live. However, Ron believes it is not Leslie's place to interfere with their decision. Tom (Aziz Ansari) is thrilled when Andy makes him his best man, but <b>his</b> <b>excitement</b> lessens when Andy also asks Ron, Chris, and several others to be his [...] "best men".

[...] Irwin bought [...] "large tracts of land" [...] in Australia, Vanuatu, Fiji and the United States, which he described as [...] "like national parks" [...] and stressed the importance of people realising that they could each make a difference.|$|E
