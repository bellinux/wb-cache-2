With the exception of Fountains of Wayne's [...] "Prom Theme" [...] (1999), every song featured within [...] "Valley Girls" [...] was released prior to or in 1983, the year in which Lily's flashbacks take place.

His sharp comical yapping was unbearable, like stabs through one's brain, and Fyne's deeply modulated remonstrances abashed the vivacious animal no more than the deep, patient murmur of the sea abashes a nigger minstrel on a popular beach.

We make here a special note that the last 3 birds were seen by Steve Dinsmore, who found the flycatcher and warbler himself through his diligent checking of that migrant trap par excellence, Oliver Reservoir. The Glossy Ibis was found by Joel Jorgensen, through his equally diligent checking of the Rainwater Basin (disclaimer: WRS wrote this!). Slightly different types of first stat records, but possibly more significant biologically, included the first confirmed breeding records this century (!) for two species: Sandhill Crane and Pileated Woodpecker.

These intersections push many members of the lorong to be involved in risky drug use and drug rnjecting practices as well as unsafe sexual practices that render them vulnerable to HIV infection. Furthermore, risky drug use and unsafe sexual activities that potentially leads to HIV infection is not an isolated behaviour and must be understood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> social context of the lorong.

Additionally, harm reduction programs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lorong should be cognizant to the cultural and structural constraints hindering young men in this locality to apply safer drug injecting practices and safer sexual practices...|$|R
