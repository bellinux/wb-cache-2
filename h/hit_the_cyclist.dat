50|$|In October 1931, Morris was a {{passenger}} in {{a patrol car}} which collided with 19 year old cyclist Alfred Francis Edgcombe on the main Totnes to Plymouth road. The car was being driven by Constable Frederick H. Hammond, who <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>cyclist</b> at 20 mph, killing him outright. At a subsequent inquest, {{the layout of the}} road was determined to have been a significant factor, with recommendations made that proper lines and signage be laid down. The inquest heard that Constable Hammond had done everything in his power to avoid the cyclist, and no charges were brought.|$|E
5000|$|Anne takes {{a special}} {{interest}} in Maggie's well-being, but James can't understand her sudden teary investment in their housekeeper’s personal life. James, whose priorities have become skewed toward work rather than toward his wife, soon becomes suspicious that Bill may be involved in that fatal hit-and-run. When confronted, Bill initially denies the allegation, but soon tells James that the next day he will go to the police and confess, if that is what he wants, although he sees no benefit from his confessions. Back home, when James tells Anne about his conversation with Bill, she has also some striking confessions to make. Anne reveals one hurtful secret while making a salad: she was actually driving Bill’s car when drunk and accidentally <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>cyclist.</b> While artfully arranging ingredients on a platter, she informs her already distraught husband that she has also been having an affair with Bill. Telling her story, she asserts that Bill doesn't really mean anything to her, because he doesn't make demands or judge her, as James does in little, incessant ways. Precisely because he's a lout, Bill makes her feel oddly liberated, if not loved.|$|E
5000|$|Film critic Mark Mesaros {{discussed}} the stylistic {{aspects of the}} film, writing, [...] "Death of a Cyclist is a polemical tale that borrows the grammar of the Hitchcockian murder mystery {{as well as the}} forbidden romance of film noir to achieve its ideologic ends...Beginning with the techniques that are most efficacious, it’s necessary to emphasize Bardem’s brilliant use of cuts and dissolves throughout. What will be remembered most by viewers is the way the film jump cuts effortlessly between the seemingly primary melodrama and scenes of so-called 'social realism'. At first the cuts are employed between bourgeois and working class milieus, but later more abstract associations will be made. It’s apparent that our pair of privileged sinners lie totally outside of 'social reality': when their sports-car <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>cyclist</b> we do not see his twisted frame, only the twisted frame of the bicycle, and the reactions of Juan and María José. Through the course of events Juan will be forced to interlope within the reality of <b>the</b> <b>cyclist</b> and his family, while María José will be further ensconced in the delicate net of her delusion." ...|$|R

50|$|The inaugural Tour de Hongrie {{took place}} on 27 June 1925. <b>The</b> <b>cyclists</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> road as early as four in the morning, and the Budapest-Szombathely-Győr-Budapest stage was {{accomplished}} the quickest by Károly Jerzsabek, who managed to cover the distance of 510.5 kilometres in 22 hours and 10 minutes {{to become the first}} ever champion of the event.|$|R
40|$|There {{are nearly}} 200 cyclist road {{deaths a year}} in the Netherlands. They are, therefore, the largest group of {{so-called}} vulnerable road users. The Netherlands has with 18 %, therefore, also the highest European Union percentage cyclist road deaths of all road deaths. Where motor vehicles are the crash opponent of cyclists, 80 % of these opponents are cars. The most common collision type is the crash in which <b>the</b> <b>cyclist</b> is <b>hit</b> in <b>the</b> flank by the front of a car. This study has concentrated on this collision type. For this study, the summons form was used to supplement the data from the standard police registration form. The accident analysis used the data of 209 crashes in which 10 cyclists were killed and 199 were in-patients. The number of analyzed summons forms was 32. In many cases, nothing was known {{about the nature of the}} cyclists' injuries, but it became clear that <b>the</b> <b>cyclist's</b> head was often injured. Head injury was more common among those killed than among the in-patients; the contact place was often the windscreen and the car roof. In general, <b>cyclist</b> casualties usually <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> windscreen and the roof in crashes on roads with a speed limit of 80 km/h and higher. A literature study confirmed these findings. In addition, it illustrated that pedestrians more often strike the bonnet with the head than the windscreen and its frame as is <b>the</b> case for <b>cyclists.</b> This report also discusses the requirements that, from 2005, will be valid for new cars. These requirements are based on collisions of motor vehicles and pedestrians, and not on those between motor vehicles and <b>cyclists.</b> <b>The</b> vehicle parts that are often <b>hit</b> by <b>cyclists</b> (<b>the</b> windscreen and its frame) are, however, not covered by the new requirements. With regard to these new requirements, we recommend additional research of the contacts with the windscreen and its frame. A proposal to evaluate the new requirements by means of EU research is supported inasmuch as it is not limited it to collisions with pedestrians, but also includes collisions with cyclists. In order to reduce the severity of collisions with cyclists (and pedestrians), what is needed is not only intervention in the construction of the vehicle front, but also measures to reduce the driving and, thus, the collision speeds. A collision speed of 30 km/h provides cyclists (and pedestrians) with a good chance of not incurring any severe injury. The layout of the infrastructure, and (in due time) the installation of locally controlled in-vehicle speed limiters, can result in a driving speed of 30 km/h...|$|R

50|$|On the March 2007 ride in San Francisco, a rider {{was arrested}} on felony (later reduced to misdemeanor) charges in San Francisco's Tenderloin {{neighborhood}} for denting a limousine using a bicycle lock.

After exchanging words with one of <b>the</b> <b>cyclists,</b> <b>the</b> driver said he grabbed one of the bicycles and tried to pull it out of the way.

5000|$|A form {{of strict}} {{liability}} has been {{law in the}} Netherlands since the early 1990s for bicycle-motor vehicle accidents. In a nutshell this means that, in a collision between a car and a <b>cyclist,</b> <b>the</b> driver's insurer is deemed to be liable to pay damages (n.b. motor vehicle insurance is mandatory in <b>the</b> Netherlands, while <b>cyclist</b> insurance is not) to <b>the</b> <b>cyclist's</b> property and their medical bills as long as 1) <b>the</b> <b>cyclist</b> did not intentionally crash into the motor vehicle, and 2) <b>the</b> <b>cyclist</b> was not in error in some way. If <b>the</b> <b>cyclist</b> was in error, {{as long as the}} collision was still unintentional, the motorist's insurance must still pay half of the damages — though this doesn't apply if <b>the</b> <b>cyclist</b> is under 14 years of age, in which case the motorist must pay full damages.
