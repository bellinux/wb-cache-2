25|$|District heating (also {{known as}} heat {{networks}} or teleheating) {{is a system}} for distributing heat generated in a centralized location for residential and commercial heating requirements such as space heating and water heating. The heat is often obtained from a cogeneration plant burning fossil fuels but increasingly also biomass, although heat-only boiler stations, geothermal heating, heat pumps and central solar heating are also used, as well as nuclear power. <b>District</b> <b>heating</b> <b>plants</b> can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers. According to some research, district heating with {{combined heat and power}} (CHPDH) is the cheapest method of cutting carbon emissions, and has one of the lowest carbon footprints of all fossil generation plants. A combination of CHP and centralized heat pumps are used in the Stockholm multi energy system. This allows the production of heat through electricity when there is an abundance of intermittent power production and cogeneration of electric power and district heating when the availability of intermittent power production is low.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Due {{to the low}} {{heavy metal}} concentrations, the bottom ash from a 32 MW {{municipal}} <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> {{was determined to be}} a potential forest fertilizer as such. However, additional Ca would be needed, because its Ca concentration of 1. 9 -% (d. w.) was lower than the statutory Finnish minimum limit value of 6. 0 - % (d. w.) for Ca in forest fertilizer. Due to the elevated As concentration (53. 0 mg/kg; d. w.) in the fly ash from the 32 MW municipal <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>plant,</b> and Cr concentration (620 mg/kg; d. w.) in the ash fraction (i. e. mixture of the bottom ash and fly ash) from the 6 MW municipal <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>plant,</b> which exceed the limit values of 30 mg/kg (d. w.) and 300 mg/kg (d. w.) for As and Cr, respectively, these residues are not suitable as forest fertilizers. Although these ash fractions cannot be used as a forest fertilizer as such, they can be used for the landscaping of landfills or in industrial and other areas that are closed to the public. However, an environmental permit is then needed. Keywords—Ash, fertilizer, peat, forest residue, waste A I...|$|R

40|$|Moisture and its {{variation}} in wood chips make {{the control of}} burning in small scale heating appliances difficult resulting in emissions and loss of efficiency. If the quality of wood chips would be better, i. e. dried and sieved fuel with more uniform size distribution would be avail able, the burning could be much cleaner and efficiency higher. In addition higher power out put could be obtained and the investment costs of the burning appliances would be lower. The production of sieved and dried wood chip with good quality could be accomplished {{in connection with a}} <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>plant.</b> Then the plant would make profit, in addition to the <b>district</b> <b>heat,</b> from the dried wood chips sold to the neighboring buildings and enterprises sep a rated from the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> net using wood chips in energy production. The peak power of a <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>plant</b> is required only a short time during the coldest days of the winter. Then the excess capacity during the milder days can be used as heat source for drying of wood chips to be marketed. Then wood chips are sieved and the fuel with best quality is sold and the reject is used as fuel in the plant it self.
