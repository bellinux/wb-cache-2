5|$|One of {{the first}} {{industries}} in the Guild's Lake area was a sawmill built in the 1880s. Although {{large parts of the}} land remained undeveloped until the early 20thcentury, lumber mills, <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> structures, railroads, and docks appeared along the waterfront. The Guild's Lake Rail Yard, built by the Northern Pacific Railway in the 1880s, became an important switching yard for trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlements}} were small, forming family based communities, {{but some}} of them were more sizable and functioned over many generations. They lacked artificial fortifications, but natural factors facilitating self-defense were often utilized. Such settlements could form small clusters separated by uninhabited areas. One rather large dwelling place, which functioned from the 2nd to the 4th century, was discovered and investigated in Osowo near Suwałki. The living quarters consisted of pillar supported houses, while the farming infrastructure area included eighty <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> caves. Small fortified refuge areas were built to a limited extend beginning {{at the end of the}} 4th century, but on a larger scale fortified settlements were constructed by the Western Balts only during the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 85th United States Congress, McGovern {{became a}} member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. As a representative, McGovern was {{attentive}} to his district. He became a staunch supporter of higher commodity prices, farm price supports, <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> programs, and beef import controls, believing that such stored commodities programs guarded against drought and similar emergencies. He favored rural development, federal aid to small business and to education, and medical coverage for the aged under Social Security. In 1957, he traveled and studied conditions in the Middle East under a fellowship from the American Christian Palestine Committee. McGovern first allied with the Kennedy family by supporting a House version of Senator John F. Kennedy's eventually unsuccessful labor reform bill.|$|E

40|$|The {{flight of}} the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), near <b>grain</b> <b>storages</b> and at {{distances}} from them, was investigated to assess the potential of these beetles to infest grain and spread insecticide resistance genes. We caught R. dominica in pheromone-baited flight traps (and blank controls) set at storages, in fields away from storages, and in native vegetation across a 12 -mo period. A functional set of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers was developed, enabling population genetic analyses on the trapped beetles. Pheromone-baited traps caught just as many R. dominica adults at least 1 [*]km from <b>grain</b> <b>storages</b> as were caught adjacent to <b>grain</b> <b>storages.</b> Samples of beetles caught were genetically homogeneous across the study area (over 7, 000 [*]km 2) in South Queensland, Australia. However, a change in genetic structure was detected at one bulk storage site. Subsequent analysis detected a heterozygous excess, which indicated a population bottleneck. Only a few beetles were caught {{during the winter months}} of June and July. To assess the mating status and potential fecundity of dispersing R. dominica females, we captured beetles as they left <b>grain</b> <b>storages</b> and quantified offspring production and life span in the laboratory. Nearly all (95 %) of these dispersing females had mated and these produced an average of 242 offspring. We demonstrated that R. dominica populations in the study area display a high degree of connectivity and this {{is a result of the}} active dispersal of mated individuals of high potential fecundity...|$|R

5|$|Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of {{mammalian}} chymotrypsin-like serine proteases in vitro, the best-studied example being barley serpin Zx (BSZx), {{which is}} able to inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin {{as well as several}} blood coagulation factors. However, close relatives of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases are absent in plants. The RCL of several serpins from wheat grain and rye contain poly-Q repeat sequences similar to those present in the prolamin storage proteins of the endosperm. It has therefore been suggested that plant serpins may function to inhibit proteases from insects or microbes that would otherwise digest <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> proteins. In support of this hypothesis, specific plant serpins have been identified in the phloem sap of pumpkin (CmPS-1) and cucumber plants. Although an inverse correlation between up-regulation of CmPS-1 expression and aphid survival was observed, in vitro feeding experiments revealed that recombinant CmPS-1 did not appear to affect insect survival.|$|E

Dax and Sisko find the bomb before it can kill Kirk and the Defiant transports it into space where it explodes. The crew of the Defiant use the Bajoran Orb to travel {{back to the present}} time, and Sisko finishes explaining the situation to the Temporal Agents. The episode ends with Quark (Armin Shimerman) in his bar on Deep Space Nine's promenade, with numerous tribbles around him.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion {{continued}} to grow, and Maria's stepmother began talking of dreams that Maria {{had been murdered}} and buried in the Red Barn. On 19 April 1828, she persuaded her husband {{to go to the}} Red Barn and dig in one of the <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> bins. He quickly uncovered the remains of his daughter buried in a sack. She was badly decomposed but still identifiable. An inquest was carried out at the Cock Inn at Polstead (which still stands today), where Maria was formally identified by her sister Ann from some physical characteristics. Her hair and some clothing were recognisable, and she was known to be missing a tooth which was also absent from the jawbone of the corpse. Evidence was uncovered to implicate Corder in the crime: his green handkerchief was discovered around the body's neck.|$|E
50|$|Grains are {{produced}} on a seasonal basis. In many places {{there is only}} one harvest a year. Thus most production of maize, wheat, rice, sorghum, millet, etc. must be held in storage for periods varying from a few days up to more than a year. Storage therefore plays a vital role in grain supply chains. For all <b>grains,</b> <b>storage</b> losses can be considerable but the greatest losses appear to be of maize, particularly in Africa. Losses in stored grain are determined by the interaction between the <b>grain,</b> the <b>storage</b> environment and a variety of organisms.|$|R

However, Gerrold's agent was concerned that requiring a miniature of the station to be built {{as well as the}} additional sets would cause it to be too expensive for a single episode. Because of his agent's comments, Gerrold modified the pitch to place the action on a colony planet instead. This pitch included the plot points such as the creatures getting into a poisoned <b>grain</b> <b>storage,</b> but omitted the Klingons; and Cyrano Jones was called Cyrano Smith. The five pitches were submitted by Gerrold's agent in February 1967, and received a response in June. At the time the show had already purchased too many scripts for the second season but story editor D. C. Fontana suggested that they should purchase the story and assign it to a staff writer as it was better than some of the other stories they already had.|$|E

40|$|Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) {{has been}} used as a model {{organism}} to develop and test important ecological and evolutionary concepts and is also a major pest of grain and grain products globally. This beetle species is assumed to be a good colonizer of <b>grain</b> <b>storages</b> through anthropogenic movement of grain, and active dispersal by flight is considered unlikely. Studies using T. castaneum have therefore used confined or walking insects. We combine an ecological study of dispersal with an analysis of gene flow using microsatellites to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics and adult flight of T. castaneum in an ecological landscape in eastern Australia. Flying beetles were caught in traps at <b>grain</b> <b>storages</b> and in fields at least 1 km from the nearest stored grain at regular intervals for an entire year. Significantly more beetles were trapped at storages than in fields, and almost no beetles were caught in native vegetation reserves many kilometres from the nearest stored grain. Genetic differentiation between beetles caught at storages and in fields was low, indicating that although T. castaneum is predominantly aggregated around <b>grain</b> <b>storages,</b> active dispersal takes place to the extent that significant gene flow occurs between them, mitigating founder effects and genetic drift. By combining ecological and molecular techniques, we reveal much higher levels of active dispersal through adult flight in T. castaneum than previously thought. We conclude that the implications of adult flight to previous and future studies on this model organism warrant consideration...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks {{have been}} {{implemented}} in many indoor applications such as offices, hospitals, laboratories for monitoring the parameters such as temperature, humidity etc. Most of the applications have used omnidirectional antennas. In randomly deployed ad hoc wireless sensor networks, this {{may be useful to}} achieve coverage and connec tivity with unknown neighbors. In case of deterministic deployments such as in case of food <b>grain</b> <b>storages</b> where loca tions of the sensor nodes are mostly fixed, the main challenges are unstable and vacillating conditions in the godowns during loading and unloading of sacs as well as unpredictable changes in climate. Most of the commercial motes gener ally use omnidirectional antennas. Energy overheads increase considerably with omnidirectional antennas. Directivity increases energy saving but may be at the cost of redundancy. This paper is mainly focused on the energy advantage in ad hoc wireless sensor networks deployed in large food <b>grain</b> <b>storages</b> and energy overheads required for obtaining certain level of redundancy using directional antennas. Finally, we conclude that energy advantage can be achieved even if we overcome redundancy to certain extent. </p...|$|R
