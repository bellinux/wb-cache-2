5|$|The {{report writer}} is a {{declarative}} facility for creating reports. The programmer need only specify the report layout {{and the data}} required to produce it, freeing them from having to write code to handle things like page breaks, data formatting, and headings and <b>footings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The aviary at Tyntesfield is {{situated}} {{to the west}} of the house, adjacent to the <b>footings</b> of the old conservatory. It was built in 1880 to house exotic birds, but was converted into a playhouse for Doreen, the first Lord Wraxall's daughter. The aviary is considered one of the most distinctive features of the estate, and is Grade II listed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the site of Fort Jackson had become the <b>footings</b> for a new {{railroad}} bridge, constructed in 1903. Three years later, a road bridge was constructed just to the west. A brickworks was also located nearby, sometimes utilizing the clay that formed the bastions of Fort Runyon as raw material for the bricks that would later go into the walls of Washington homes. These projects obliterated what little trace there was of Fort Jackson.|$|E
5|$|St Aelrhiw's Church at Y Rhiw {{was built}} in 1860 on the <b>footings</b> of an earlier church. It {{consists}} of a small nave and short chancel; aisles {{to the north and}} south; and has boulder-built walls and a slate roof. The churchyard contains the graves of some of the bodies that were washed up at Porth Neigwl during the First World War. Above Porth Iago is the site of the ancient St Medin's Church; now just a mound {{in the middle of a}} field, it was the parish church of Bodferin.|$|E
5|$|Blore's {{new plan}} for the corps de logis of house was {{constrained}} by Vorontsov's wish to use the <b>footings</b> and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, size and layout of the palaces principal rooms. However, rather than erect a compact and low classical villa, as Harrison had designed, Blore's plan was radically different, with strong English Tudor Renaissance features on the northern side, and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic features on the southern. The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to be incorporated, once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge <b>footings</b> operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} {{surrender}} of the Confederate States of America in 1865, Fort Jackson was abandoned. The lumber used in its construction was promptly salvaged for firewood and construction materials and, {{due to its}} proximity to the Long Bridge, the earthworks were flattened {{in order to provide}} easier access to Long Bridge. In the early 20th century, the fort's site was used for the <b>footings</b> and approaches to several bridges connecting Virginia and Washington. Today, no trace of the fort remains, though the site of the fort is contained within Arlington County's Long Bridge Park, and a National Park Service 2004 survey of the site indicated some archaeological remnants may still remain beneath the park.|$|E
5|$|In July 2000, Silver Dollar City {{announced}} {{that they would be}} adding the Wildfire roller coaster to their park in 2001. At a cost of $14 million, the ride would be the most expensive attraction in the park's history. At the time of the announcement, construction was already underway on an undeveloped portion of land in the outskirts of the park. All of the ride's <b>footings</b> were in place with some of the steel supports already erected. Construction was expected to be completed in early January the following year, leaving three months for testing, landscaping and theming. On April 4, 2001, Wildfire officially opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|The National Trust {{took control}} of the Tor in 1933, but repairs were delayed until after the Second World War. During the 1960s, {{excavations}} identified cracks in the rock, suggesting the ground had moved in the past. This, combined with wind erosion, started to expose the <b>footings</b> of the tower, which were repaired with concrete. Erosion caused by the feet of the increasing number of visitors was also a problem and paths were laid to enable them to reach the summit without damaging the terraces. After 2000, enhancements to the access and repairs to the tower, including rebuilding of the parapet, were carried out. These included the replacement of some of the masonry damaged by earlier repairs with new stone from the Hadspen Quarry.|$|E
5|$|Construction on Intimidator began {{during the}} summer of 2009 with land {{clearing}} and <b>footings</b> being constructed. Track pieces first began to arrive at Carowinds on August 7, 2009. About 3 weeks later, Intimidator was officially announced on August 26, 2009 by Carowinds. Along with the announcement, Carowinds reached a licensing agreement with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to utilize the Dale Earnhardt brand as part of the ride. One of Earnhardt's sons, Kerry Earnhardt, was on-hand for the press conference announcing the attraction and endorsed the ride on behalf of the family. The first supports and track for Intimidator were installed on September 1, 2009. The lift hill was erected on October 1, 2009 and was completed on October 13, 2009. In order to install the last lift piece, 3 cranes were required. Construction on the roller coaster layout continued through November and December with the final track piece installed on December 21, 2009. Construction on the station, mechanics, and landscaping of Intimidator took place during the months of January and February. On February 4, 2010, testing of Intimidator commenced with the new roller coaster officially opening to the public on March 27, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The next {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} {{at the site}} was an 860-foot (262-meter) steel girder bridge, the third to be named for Cullen. Its first span opened in 1965, and it was widened by the addition in 1976 of a second span slightly {{to the west of}} the first one, the newer span carrying southbound traffic while the older span became one-way northbound. When the first span opened in 1965, the inlet was 23 feet (7 meters) deep, but inlet currents led to scouring of the piers of the bridge, first noticed in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, scouring was severe enough to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divers to swim beneath one of the span's concrete <b>footings.</b> The Corps installed protective riprap around the bridge piers in 1989, but this was only a temporary solution; realizing that the bridge could be compromised by damage from just one severe storm, Delaware officials listed it as structurally deficient and requiring replacement. Scouring had increased the inlet's depth to over 100 feet (30 meters) by 1999, leading the Corps of Engineers and Delaware officials to question the stability of the pilings and their protective riprap. By 2005, various reports gave the bridge an expected lifespan of three to five years and estimated that it would have to be closed sometime between 2008 and 2011 and would collapse sometime between 2008 and 2013. By 2007, the bridge carried 14,000 cars on an average day and an average of 28,000 cars per day during the summer months, and the disruption to traffic if the bridge had to be closed before a replacement could open was of increasing concern.|$|E
25|$|Michigan Stadium was {{designed}} with <b>footings</b> {{to allow the}} stadium's capacity to be expanded beyond 100,000. Fielding Yost envisioned a day where 150,000 seats would be needed. To keep construction costs low at the time, {{the decision was made}} to build a smaller stadium than Yost envisioned but to include the <b>footings</b> for future expansion.|$|E
25|$|Remnants of both {{events can}} still be seen. Broken cement walls and <b>footings</b> in the Slipper area are visible from the sea.|$|E
25|$|Title to {{the land}} under the future HUD {{building}} was held by the D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, and site preparation began in November 1965. Groundbreaking and construction had already begun {{by the spring of}} 1966. John McShain, Inc., one of the largest federal building contractors in the Washington metro area, was named the lead construction contractor. A strike by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America temporarily delayed construction in May 1966. The building's cornerstone was laid by Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey in November of that year. Unfortunately, during the HUD building's construction, the <b>footings</b> for the western portion of the building were accidentally built 1.5 to 3.5 feet (0.46 to 1 metre) over the property line. The three-feet-thick (1 metre) <b>footings</b> were 23 feet (7 metres) underground. When L'Enfant Properties, leaseholder of the property abutting the HUD site, began construction of L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in 1971, the company was forced to sue John McShain, Inc. and the Redevelopment Land Agency for removal of the <b>footings,</b> stabilization of the HUD structure, and associated costs. The action spawned several lengthy court battles which lasted through the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Another {{failure occurs}} when the fill at each end moves (through {{resonant}} effects) in bulk, in opposite directions. If there is an insufficient founding shelf for the overpass, then it may fall. Additional shelf and ductile stays may be added to attach the overpass to the <b>footings</b> at one or both ends. The stays, rather than being fixed to the beams, may instead be clamped to them. Under moderate loading, these keep the overpass centered in the gap {{so that it is}} less likely to slide off its founding shelf at one end. The ability for the fixed ends to slide, rather than break, will prevent the complete drop of the structure if it should fail to remain on the <b>footings.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{design for}} the Schoharie Creek Bridge {{originally}} called for leaving sheet piles in place (which are used to keep water out of excavation areas during construction). The riprap would have filled the area left between the pier <b>footings</b> and the sheeting. However, this sheeting was not left in place.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{signal box}} at County School was demolished after passenger closure, but the locking room <b>footings</b> survived and were restored {{to allow for}} the delivery of the original signal cabin from Halesworth to be relocated to the site from Halesworth Middle School, where it had been displayed since 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is a three-level red-brick structure with limestone <b>footings</b> and Donnybrook stone trimmings. There is a square tower, originally intended to be central, with castellated parapets. The interiors exhibit fine craftsmanship in joinery, with jarrah timber panelling and art nouveau leadlighting and glass. A grand staircase of jarrah connects the three levels of the building.|$|E
25|$|Cuddebackville: Orange County has {{developed}} a county park along the Neversink here, just south of Hamilton Bicentennial Elementary School off Route 209. The <b>footings</b> of Roebling's aqueduct still stand, and {{a portion of the}} bed and towpath persist in the adjacent woods. The Neversink Valley Museum, also located in the park, has some exhibits related to the canal.|$|E
25|$|Historic buildings, made of {{unreinforced}} masonry, {{may have}} culturally important interior detailing or murals {{that should not}} be disturbed. In this case, the solution may be to add a number of steel, reinforced concrete, or poststressed concrete columns to the exterior. Careful attention must be paid to the connections with other members such as <b>footings,</b> top plates, and roof trusses.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{walls are}} often used at the {{transition}} between elevated road fill and overpass structures. The wall is used both to retain the soil and so enable {{the use of a}} shorter span and also to transfer the weight of the span directly downward to <b>footings</b> in undisturbed soil. If these walls are inadequate they may crumble under the stress of an earthquake's induced ground motion.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, archaeological work in {{the former}} prison grounds led to the {{discovery}} of three rare panopticons (named after Jeremy Bentham’s prison design of 1791) located near the A and B Divisions that were built of bluestone in the 1850s. The first uncovered and excavated was to the north of A division and was built of bluestone in the 1850s. The circular design, with walls coming out from the centre, created wedge shaped 'airing yards' where prisoners would be permitted access for one hour per day without coming into contact with each other. The panopticons fell out of use, due to prison overcrowding, and were largely demolished in the early 1900s. The panopticons were based on the design concepts of British philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham. The <b>footings</b> of the first panopticon that was excavated and uncovered is located to the north of A Division and remains relatively intact. The excavation and uncovering of the other two panopticons next to B Division only revealed the remains of its rubble <b>footings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Towers {{were built}} of {{numbered}} angle iron sections with concrete <b>footings.</b> Some facilities used concrete arrows pointing {{in the direction}} of towers. In areas where no connection to a power grid was available, a generator was housed in a small building. Some buildings also served as weather stations. Many arrow markings were removed during World War II, to prevent aiding enemy bombers in navigation, while 19 updated beacons still remain in service in Montana.|$|E
25|$|A {{personal}} inspection by Charles Follen McKim {{also found}} the East Room clearly sinking. The problem, not rectified until 1952, was that the interior walls rested on brick columns in the basement, which themselves were sitting on loose rubble <b>footings</b> atop soft soil. The columns were sinking into the soil under the mansion's weight. But forced by Roosevelt to finish the restoration as quickly as possible, McKim was unable to make any structural changes to solve the problem.|$|E
25|$|One form of {{retrofit}} is {{to drill}} numerous holes into {{the surface of}} the wall, and secure short L-shaped sections of rebar to the surface of each hole with epoxy adhesive. Additional vertical and horizontal rebar is then secured to the new elements, a form is erected, and an additional layer of concrete is poured. This modification may be combined with additional <b>footings</b> in excavated trenches and additional support ledgers and tie-backs to retain the span on the bounding walls.|$|E
25|$|Two screens {{divided the}} length of the church: a rood screen and a pulpitum. Only the <b>footings</b> of both survive, {{although}} they are very clear. There are also foundations of two nave altars against the pulpitum. Beyond the screens, the chancel and presbytery are the oldest parts of the building, begun in the later 12th century. The only major subsequent alteration was the insertion of a large and impressive east window in the 14th century. This still dominates the church, as it was intended to do.|$|E
25|$|The river can be crossed on foot or bicycle by {{a public}} {{footbridge}} upstream from The Harbour Inn, which gives access {{to the village of}} Walberswick. This bridge, known as the Bailey Bridge, is based on the <b>footings</b> of the original iron Southwold Railway swing bridge. It replaced that bridge, which contained a central swinging section to allow the passage of wherries and other shipping, and which was largely demolished at the start of World War II as a part of precautions against German invasion.|$|E
25|$|Between Stoney Creek Station and Kuranda {{there are}} another two tunnels, and 22 bridges. After leaving Stoney Creek Station {{there is a}} steel lattice girder bridge (Bridge 29) with wrought iron piers on {{concrete}} bases at 22.92km. This is followed by Stoney Creek Bridge (Bridge 30) at 23.15km, with seven spans of steel lattice girders supported by wrought iron trestles on concrete <b>footings.</b> A concrete pier and two timber trestles support the uphill approach spans. This bridge has a total length of 88.4m, with a curved track.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge <b>footings</b> operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called 'caisson disease' but later the 'bends' because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early {{reports of the}} disease had been made {{at the time of}} Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
25|$|Falsework {{centering}} (in British English: arch frame) is fabricated, typically from timbers and boards. Since each arch of a multi-arch bridge will {{impose a}} thrust upon its neighbors, {{it is necessary}} either that all arches of the bridge be raised at the same time, or that very wide piers be used. The thrust from the end arches is taken into the earth by substantial (vertical) <b>footings</b> at the canyon walls, or by large inclined planes forming in a sense ramps to the bridge, which may also be formed of arches.|$|E
25|$|The only {{written record}} of the {{interior}} is from 1746 in which the wives of justices and vestrymen were assigned a box pew in the northern corner of the chancel and young women of the parish were assigned their former pews. There is one original baluster (the second from the left end on the altar rail). The rood screen is based on <b>footings</b> discovered in the 1950s while the sounding board, that is 17th-century in origin, was found in 1894 in a barn at Macclesfield, a nearby plantation. The single baluster and sounding board are the only original interior appointments.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} span is of a seldom-built type, a self-anchored suspension bridge. It {{is unique}} in being both single tower and asymmetrical, a design tailored to the site. For ship channel clearance, the bridge would require at least one long span, while ready access to bedrock was found only close to Yerba Buena Island. A two tower cable-stayed design would require very deep tower <b>footings,</b> and a conventional two tower suspension bridge would additionally require a massive anchor {{to be built in}} deep bay mud. The curved nature of the approach places additional constraints upon the design.|$|E
25|$|There is a multivallate {{promontory}} fort on Isle Head {{consisting of}} 3 ramparts and 2 ditches with a probable 4th rampart now {{reduced to a}} slight scarp. On the seaward side of the promontory are intermittent stretches of rubble linking and utilising natural outcrops of rock and in the south-east corner inner and outer faces, indicating the <b>footings</b> of a wall up to 3 yards wide. On the levelled summit area are slight indications of rubble walling and artificial scarping on {{the south and east}} sides and in the north-east corner are the possible remains of a hut circle.|$|E
25|$|Jurisdiction {{over the}} {{memorial}} site was {{transferred from the}} District of Columbia to the Department of the Interior (National Park Service) by the Federal and District of Columbia Government Real Property Act of 2006 (Public Law 109–396). Title II, Section 201(a)(2) gave the federal government control over the site, barred the realignment of C Street SW without {{the approval of the}} Architect of the Capitol, and required an east-west pedestrian walkway across {{the southern part of the}} site. Jurisdiction over the subsurface (<b>footings,</b> soils, tunnels, walls, and related items) was retained by the District of Columbia.|$|E
25|$|The parish {{church of}} St John the Evangelist is {{situated}} in the scattered hamlet of Wotton {{at the end of}} Church Lane overlooking a broad sweep of the North Downs. The parish itself is a long finger stretching from the foot of the North Downs to Friday Street. The church dates back to Saxon times, although {{only a few of the}} original <b>footings</b> now remain to the west of the Norman tower. Much of the church was of necessity restored in Victorian times, but there are still many interesting original features to see. John and Mary Evelyn are buried in the Evelyn Chapel in St John's Church, Wotton.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Cardiff Castle, Castell Coch (Red Castle) {{is located in}} Tongwynlais, {{in the north of}} the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian folly designed by William Burges for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the <b>footings</b> of a much older medieval castle possibly built by Ifor Bach, a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.|$|E
