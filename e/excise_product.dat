40|$|Staphylococcus aureus staphylococcal {{cassette}} chromosome mec type IV (SSCmec IV) {{is associated}} with virulent community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and frequent horizontal transfer among staphylococci. To gain insight into the mechanism of transfer, we studied the ccrA/B type 2 recombinase-mediated excision of SCCmec IV (n = 5 strains) and SCCmec II (n = 2). In SCCmec IV- but not SCCmec II-containing strains, spontaneous excision of the cassette was observed. Introduction of ccrA/B type 2 recombinase genes under control of an S. aureus bacterial phage promoter in the different strains yielded excision of SCCmec II and multiple excision variants of SCCmec IV. Sequencing of the alternatively <b>excised</b> <b>products</b> in SCCmec IV strains identified a 100 -bp shortened SCCmec′ variant and a 5, 877 -bp, conserved SCC-like element that lacks mecA and ccrA/B recombinases.

A crowdsourced online search engine for Open Access publications has been developed, meaning that the application relies on users to add and curate the collection of indexed publications. Gamification, which is the use of game design elements in non-game contexts, has been applied to the system to increase users’ motivation to contribute. The research questions of this thesis concerns how to provide findability of open access publications, as well as how users can be motivated to add, quality assure and curate publications. The process of designing the application has been conducted as a user centered process. The empirical methods applied throughout the phases of establishing requirements, prototyping and evaluating the final design, includes a review of <b>excising</b> <b>products,</b> a domain expert interview, a heuristic evaluation, observation and thinking aloud, user interviews and questionnaires. A summative evaluation showed that the implemented game design elements moderately increased users’ motivation to add, quality assure and curate publications. The evaluation showed that all users agree or strongly agree that the system is easy and pleasant to use, and the search interface was proved to be quite adequate. This indicates that the system does to some extent achieve the goal of providing findability of OA publications {{at the time of the}} summative evaluation.

We characterized conservative recombination after I-SceI cleavage as gene conversion or intrachromatid crossing over associated with random reintegration of the <b>excised</b> reciprocal <b>product.</b> We identified two dominant-negative RAD 51 forms that specifically inhibit conservative recombination: the yeast ScRAD 51 or the yeast–mouse chimera SMRAD 51.

Consistently, although resistance to γ-rays remains unaffected, MmRAD 51 stimulates whereas ScRAD 51 or SMRAD 51 prevents radiation-induced recombination. This suggests that mRAD 51 does not significantly affect the global DSB repair efficiency but controls the classes of recombination events. Finally, both ScRAD 51 and SMRAD 51 drastically inhibit spontaneous recombination but not cell proliferation, showing that RAD 51 -dependent spontaneous and DSB-induced conservative recombination can be impaired significantly without affecting cell viability...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacteriophage L 5 is a {{temperate}} phage that forms lysogens in Mycobacterium smegmatis. These lysogens carry an integrated L 5 prophage inserted {{at a specific}} chromosomal location and undergo subsequent excision during induction of lytic growth. Both the integrative and excisive site-specific recombination events are catalyzed by the phage-encoded tyrosine integrase (Int-L 5) and require the host-encoded protein, mIHF. The directionality of these recombination events is determined by a second phage-encoded protein, <b>Excise,</b> the <b>product</b> of gene 36 (Xis-L 5); integration occurs efficiently {{in the absence of}} Xis-L 5 while excision is dependent upon it. We show here that Xis-L 5 binds to attR DNA, introduces a DNA bend, and facilitates the formation of an intasome-R complex. This complex, which requires mIHF, Xis-L 5 and Int-L 5, readily recombines with a second intasome formed by Int-L 5, mIHF and attL DNA (intasome-L) to generate the attP and attB products of excision. Xis-L 5 also strongly inhibits Int-L 5 -mediated integrative recombination but does not prevent either the protein-DNA interactions that form the attP intasome (intasome-P) or the capture of attB, but acts later in the reaction presumably by preventing the formation of a recombinagenic synaptic intermediate. The mechanism of action of Xis-L 5 appears to be purely architectural, influencing the assembly of protein-DNA structures solely through its DNA-binding and DNA-bending properties. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the Philippines, a motion to increase the PE has already been made by lawmakers, and this prompted the researchers to conduct a study on the effect of this disposable income of fixed income earners on their spending pattern on identified goods and services to VAT and other taxes collected by the government. The study made use of descriptive-survey method given to 100 random respondents earning fixed income in the City of Davao, Philippines. The study determined that the respondents’ age, civil status, sex, and number of qualified dependents affects her/his spending pattern. Married people spend more on basic commodities than single people, male spends more alcohol and tobacco than the female, zero dependents spends more on recreation than more dependents and there is a decrease of spending in recreation as people aged.

40|$|Despite England’s growing {{international}} trading wealth, {{an expanding}} secondary sector, and more productive agriculture the mid-seventeenth century state with its outdated tax system was politically and militarily weak. Civil war {{and its aftermath}} created the urgent and protracted supply need which instigated the creation and honing of radically new effective tax forms and processes which proved indispensable during the Restoration and beyond. Drawing on Kent, London and Bristol case studies this thesis explores how the land tax became a mainstay of an increasingly powerful early modern English state by considering its administration, processes and tax mechanics from its 1643 inception to the excise crisis. Economic development offered fiscal opportunity and whilst the <b>excise</b> exploited <b>product</b> supply chains, the land tax targeted rent and income generated from agricultural, commercial and domestic real estate. Occupiers and landlords shared immediate fiscal burdens. Land taxes exploited cashflows around financial and seasonal production cycles, particularly in the more commercialised South and East, where fresh {{attempts were made to}} value and tax land. Effective local governors had for decades bolstered their own authority by delivering national initiatives and now worked in partnership with legislators to nurture the new tax and create resilience. The state’s bargain was that parliament would determine deadlines and fixed tax amounts from each locale, but local governors had immediate process ownership to determine its detailed application. Continued fiscal success required fresh waves of innovation, adaption and involvement including: empowerment, delegation, the deployment of more experienced officials, simplification, and improved stakeholder oversight. As post-Revolutionary conflict drove fiscal burdens higher, land taxes became a permanent fiscal implement of the state, despite regular outbreaks of political angst at the tax’s power. The resulting coordinated collective commitment {{of tens of thousands of}} officials, across county, city and country, was the great fiscal achievement of the age; a picture long obscured by institutionalised state narratives.

40|$|Background: Genome-wide {{methylation}} of cytosine can be modulated in {{the presence}} of TET and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) enzymes. TET is able to oxidise 5 -methylcytosine (5 mC) to 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC), 5 -formylcytosine (5 fC) and 5 -carboxylcytosine (5 caC). TDG can <b>excise</b> the oxidative <b>products</b> 5 fC and 5 caC, initiating base excision repair. These modified bases are stable and detectable in the genome, suggesting that they could have epigenetic functions in their own right. However, functional investigation of the genome-wide distribution of 5 fC has been restricted to cell culture-based systems, while its in vivo profile remains unknown. Results: Here, we describe the first analysis of the in vivo genome-wide profile of 5 fC across a range of tissues from both wild-type and Tdg-deficient E 11. 5 mouse embryos. Changes in the formylation profile of cytosine upon depletion of TDG suggest TET/TDG-mediated active demethylation occurs preferentially at intron-exon boundaries and reveals a major role for TDG in shaping 5 fC distribution at CpG islands. Moreover, we find that active enhancer regions specifically exhibit high levels of 5 fC, resulting in characteristic tissue-diagnostic patterns, which suggest a role in embryonic development. Conclusions: The tissue-specific distribution of 5 fC can be regulated by the collective contribution of TET-mediated oxidation and excision by TDG. The in vivo profile of 5 fC during embryonic development resembles that of embryonic stem cells, sharing key features including enrichment of 5 fC in enhancer and intragenic regions. Additionally, by investigating mouse embryo 5 fC profiles in a tissue-specific manner, we identify targeted enrichment at active enhancers involved in tissue development...|$|R

40|$|The correct {{regulation}} of epigenetic modifications {{is crucial for}} cell plasticity {{and the establishment of}} cell identity. The underlying molecular mechanisms are not clear, but a role for DNA repair proteins has been implicated in this context, the investigation of which was the overall aim of my PhD thesis. The Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG) was described to <b>excise</b> the deamination <b>products</b> of cytosine (C) and 5 -methylcytosine (5 -mC), thereby initiating base excision repair (BER; Neddermann and Jiricny, 1994; Wiebauer and Jiricny, 1990). Furthermore, TDG was implicated in transcriptional regulation both physically and functionally (Leger et al., 2014; Tini et al., 2002; Um et al., 1998). Also, TDG was suggested to directly demethylate 5 -mC (Zhu et al., 2000; Jost, 1993), however, this finding was highly controversial. It turned out only recently, that TDG indeed is critically involved in DNA demethylation by <b>excising</b> the oxidation <b>products</b> of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins. The current view of active DNA demethylation is that the TET proteins iteratively oxidize 5 -mC to 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5 -hmC), 5 -formylcytosine (5 -fC) and 5 -carboxycytosine (5 -caC) and TDG then excises 5 -fC and 5 -caC, thereby initiating a repair process that integrates non-methylated C (He et al., 2011; Maiti and Drohat, 2011). However, the exact mechanisms for the recruitment, targeting and {{regulation of}} TET and TDG are still unclear. I was involved in the characterization of the phenotype of the first Tdg knockout mouse to be reported, which unexpectedly showed an embryonic lethal phenotype. Analyses of TDG-proficient and TDG-deficient cells did not reveal a defect in DNA repair, but instead misregulation of developmental genes in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This correlated with an imbalance of histone marks and stochastic accumulation of DNA methylation in CpG island (CGI) promoters of developmental genes in TDG-deficient cells, linking TDG-dependent DNA repair to the establishment and maintenance of an active chromatin state at gene promoters during lineage commitment (Appendix III). We generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of TDG-proficient and TDG-deficient ESCs and in vitro differentiated neuronal progenitor cells (NPs). In differentiated cells only, we identified a large number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Surprisingly, DMRs overlapping with CGIs were almost exclusively hypomethylated in TDG-deficient NPs. Since these CGIs were prone to acquire DNA methylation in TDG-proficient NPs, this indicates that TDG is required to establish de novo methylation upon differentiation. Global levels of 5 -mC, and particularly its oxidized derivatives 5 -fC and 5 -caC, were elevated in TDG-deficient ESCs. We observed this also at the very CGI DMRs, implicating an engagement of TDG activity in cyclic DNA methylation and demethylation at CGIs undergoing epigenetic transitions during cell differentiation (Appendix I). I then characterized the genomic sites, where TET proteins and TDG engage to effect cyclic DNA methylation and demethylation. I established procedures for chromatin-immunoprecipitation-coupled next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for TET 1, TET 2 and TDG and generated the respective datasets. Bioinformatical analyses revealed clear but differential correlation of TET and TDG association with gene regulatory elements, especially gene promoters and active enhancers. Notably, sites of 5 -fC enrichment in TDG-deficient cells, CGIs and bivalent chromatin domains showed a preferential co-occupancy with all three proteins, indicating that highly dynamic active DNA demethylation may involve TET 1, TET 2 and TDG. Contrarily, sites where uniquely TDG shows chromatin association were more often located in active enhancers. There further was a strong correlation particularly of TET 1 -TET 2 -TDG co-occupancy with the occurrence of the dynamic histone variants H 3. 3 and H 2 A. Z, suggesting that the targeted oxidation and excision of 5 -mC by TET-TDG at gene regulatory elements may serve the generation of single-stranded DNA breaks to trigger nucleosomal dynamics and facilitate epigenetic plasticity and transcription at developmental genes (Appendix II). Preliminary evidence further supports a role for TDG in the regulation of transcription by directly affecting the assembly and progression of the transcription machinery (Supplementary Results). Taken together, my PhD thesis contributes {{to the understanding of the}} epigenetic function of TDG-mediated active DNA demethylation with respect to time (during differentiation) and space (at gene regulatory elements). My model depicts an attractive concept where TDG maintains chromatin plasticity at critical genomic regions destined to undergo epigenetic regulation in response to developmental or environmental cues. We propose that the targeted demethylation of DNA by TDG finally facilitates transcription...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Most smokers {{who quit}} {{typically}} do so unassisted although pharmaceutical products are increasingly used {{by those who}} want a quitting aid. Previous Scandinavian surveys indicated that many smokers stopped smoking by switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco {{in the form of}} snus. However, usage of various cessation aids may have changed in Sweden during recent years due to factors such as the wider availability of pharmaceutical nicotine, the public debate about the health effects of different tobacco <b>products,</b> <b>excise</b> tax increases on snus relative to cigarettes, and the widespread public misconception that nicotine is the main cause of the adverse health effects associated with tobacco use. Methods A population-based, cross-sectional survey was done during November 2008 and September 2009 including 2, 599 males and 3, 409 females aged between 18 and 89 years. The sampling technique was random digit dialing. Data on tobacco habits and quit attempts were collected through structured telephone interviews. Results The proportion of ever smokers was similar among males (47 %) compared to females (44 %). About two thirds of them reported having stopped smoking {{at the time of the}} survey. Among the former smokers, the proportion who reported unassisted quitting was slightly lower among males (68 %) compared to females (78 %). Among ever smokers who reported having made assisted quit attempts, snus was the most frequently reported cessation aid among males (22 %), whereas females more frequently reported counseling (8 %), or pharmaceutical nicotine (gum 8 %, patch 4 %). Of those who reported using snus at their latest quit attempt, 81 % of males and 72 % of females were successful quitters compared to about 50 - 60 % for pharmaceutical nicotine and counseling. Conclusions This survey confirms and extends previous reports in showing that, although most smokers who have quit did so unassisted, snus continues to be the most frequently reported cessation aid among male smokers, whereas usage of pharmaceutical nicotine was more prevalent among females. Use of snus at the latest quit attempt appeared to be associated with a higher success rate among both males and females than other reported methods, although statistically significant differences were mainly observed among males. </p...|$|R

As a result, the number of those unemployed rose from 134, 000 to 144, 000 in seasonally adjusted terms. Annual inflation rose to 0. 4 percent in the year ended March 2016 (up from 0. 1 percent in the 2015 calendar year), with consumer goods and services prices rising by 0. 2 percent in the March quarter. The price of cigarettes and tobacco products rose by 9. 4 percent over the quarter following an increase in tobacco and tobacco <b>products</b> <b>excise</b> duties from 1 January. If cigarettes and tobacco products were excluded from the Consumers Price Index, overall prices would have fallen by 0. 1 percent in the quarter. The largest downward contributor to consumer prices was a 7. 7 percent drop in petrol prices. The national median house price rose to $ 495, 000 in March 2016 (up $ 20, 000 over the year), while the median house price in Auckland rose to $ 820, 000 according to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (compared with $ 720, 000 in March 2015). There were 9, 527 dwellings sold during the month, the highest number of sales for a March month since 2007. Quotable Value has released average house price data for April, which shows that the national average house price rose by 12 percent over the year to $ 568, 058, while annual house price inflation in Auckland was 16. 5 percent (with an average house price of $ 942, 760 in April). The Reserve Bank Governor, Graeme Wheeler, left the official cash rate steady at 2. 25 percent in April. This follows an unexpected reduction in the official cash rate in March of 25 basis points. In announcing his latest rate decision the Governor noted that the New Zealand dollar remains “higher than appropriate” given current international commodity prices for our main exports. He expects inflation to strengthen as capacity pressures build within the economy, and as the effects of lower oil prices drop out of the equation. The International Monetary Fund has revised its projected world economic growth rate for 2016 to 3. 2 percent (from its previous projection of 3. 4 percent in January). The rate of growth was revised down for the advanced economies, while that for China was revised upward to 6. 5 percent (from 6. 3 percent). OECD composite indicators are pointing to an easing in the rate of growth in the OECD area as a whole...|$|R

The recombinant expression of heterologous proteins in microorganisms, such Escherichia coli, is often improved by producing the protein of interest translationally linked to another, often unrelated, protein giving rise to a "fusion protein" construct. For many applications it is desirable or imperative to separate the extraneous material from the protein of interest. An increasingly popular approach to this task is the use of site-specific endoproteases 10 <b>excise</b> the protein <b>product.</b> A number of commercially available site-specific proteases exist, but many are not capable of generating an authentic N-terminus for the product, display unsatisfactory specificity leading to adventitious cleavage of the product, or they are unsuitable for an industrial process. Mutants of the serine protease a-Lytic protease have been shown to satisfy many of the criteria for an industrially suitable protease and have been applied to the cleavage of some important fusion proteins used in the production of members of the Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF) family Lacking from these examples, however, is any viable proteolytic solution for the liberation of human IGF-I from fusion proteins. This has been primarily attributed to the Proline bearing N-terminal tripeptide sequence of this protein, which is known to be refractory to the activity of many site-specific proteases. It has been suggested that in the generation of two combinatorial mutant libraries of a-Lytic protease, the preference for amino acids C-terminal to the cleavage site may have been altered. It is the purpose of this work to first determine if such an alteration has been made in any of the mutants so as to allow cleavage immediately before the N-terminus of human IGF- 1, and then to task the lead mutant(s) to the cleavage of the full-length fusion protein. All members of the two mutant libraries were cultured and their activity confirmed and quantified against a generic B-casein substrate in a high-throughput assay. A second high-throughput technique was then employed to query the mutant proteases for their ability to catalyse proteolysis at the required sequence in a peptide model. Finding that many mutants appeared successful at this task, the findings were verified on a longer peptide model of the cleavage site. Initially the yields achieved by cleavage of the full-length IGF- 1 fusion protein by a lead candidate mutant a-Lytic protease were not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of an industrial process, despite alteration of the reaction conditions. However, the insight gained from these reactions could be applied to the redesign of the protein structure around the intended site of cleavage, significantly improving site-specific proteolysis. The IGF- 1 generated by this cleavage {{has been shown to be}} bioequivalent to commercial reference standard to cultured mammalian cells and the yield of this process is approximately 5 -fold improved over the existing cleavage system.

40|$|The Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG) was {{initially}} discovered by {{its ability to}} <b>excise</b> the deamination <b>products</b> of cytosine and 5 -methylcytosine (5 -mC), and therefore thought to initiate base excision repair (BER) of the resulting G•U and G•T mismatches. Later, TDG was also found to act in concert with transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression. With its apparently two-sided nature, TDG has riddled researchers {{for many years and}} the stimuli and interactions that control TDG function are still under investigation. The aim of my thesis was to dissect the role of TDG in DNA repair with a focus on its regulation by post-translational modification, and to investigate how TDG-initiated BER contributes to epigenetic stability at CpG islands (CGIs) during cell differentiation. Both described functions of TDG, in DNA repair and in the regulation of gene expression, require its post-translational modification and non-covalent interaction with the small ubiquitin-like modifiers, SUMO 1 and SUMO 2 / 3. Extensive biochemical studies by our laboratory have shown that SUMOylation of TDG may induce its dissociation from the abasic (AP-) site after base excision. However, in vivo evidence corroborating an involvement of SUMOylation in TDG-dependent BER has been pending and the function of non-covalent SUMO-binding has remained elusive. I thus generated a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) system to monitor the interaction between TDG and SUMO 1 or SUMO 3 in cells. I was able to confirm a modulation of the SUMO 1 -TDG interaction dynamics in response to DNA damage, whereas the interaction with SUMO 3 remained unaffected, suggesting that modification by SUMO 3 might regulate TDG function in a context other than DNA repair. To investigate the biological function of TDG genetically, we generated a Tdg knockout mouse. In contrast to any other known DNA glycosylase, deletion of Tdg caused embryonic lethality. Further characterization of MEFs isolated from TDG-proficient and -deficient embryos revealed no evidence for a DNA repair defect, but a significant number of misregulated genes in differentiated Tdg-/- cells, as well as a loss of active histone marks, gain of repressive histone modifications and an accumulation of 5 -mC at CGI promoters. A phenotype we did not observe in embryonic stem cells. From these data, we proposed a dual function of TDG in maintaining active chromatin states at promoters in differentiating cells, first by structurally coordinating histone modifying enzymes and second by counteracting errors of the DNA methylation machinery by initiating repair of aberrantly methylated cytosines in CGIs. Consistent with a TDG-dependent engagement of DNA repair at such sites, we found BER factors to associate with these promoters and DNA repair intermediates to accumulate in differentiating cells in a TDG dependent manner. To investigate further how TDG is involved in DNA methylation control, we mapped DNA methylation in the genomes of TDG-proficient and -deficient mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), neuronal progenitor cells (NPs) and MEFs and found differential methylation to arise only with differentiation. Further characterization of the resulting differentially methylated regions (DMRs) revealed that those overlapping with a CGI were almost exclusively hypomethylated in TDG-deficient compared to -proficient cells, reflecting a failure to establish methylation at these CGIs during differentiation. In search of the reason for this failure in a 24 h differentiation timecourse, we found global 5 -mC levels to rise with differentiation in cells lacking TDG activity, in parallel to the generation of the final products of TET-protein catalyzed 5 -mC oxidation, 5 -formylcytosine (5 -fC) and 5 -carboxylcytosine (5 - caC), the latter two of which are proposed intermediates of active DNA demethylation and substrates for TDG. Differentiation thus appeared to induce methylation but also the intermediates of active demethylation. We therefore analyzed 5 -mC and 5 -caC levels at the CGI DMRs and found both to rise with differentiation in wildtype cells, suggesting that the loss of pluripotency induces a cycle of DNA methylation and demethylation specific CGIs. In Tdg knockout cells, though, this induction appeared to fail whereas in cells expressing a catalytically dead mutant TDG (TDG-cat), the cycle of methylation and demethylation was induced but blocked by the inability of TDG-cat to excise 5 -caC. Taken together, in collaboration with colleagues from different laboratories I was able to show that differentiation triggers a state of high epigenetic plasticity at these CGIs and that catalytically active TDG is required to maintain an equilibrium of DNA methylation and demethylation. The imbalance of epigenetic marks resulting from knockout of TDG disrupts gene expression programs and the accumulation of aberrations eventually leads to loss of viability on the cellular and on the organismic level. ...|$|R
