50|$|By late 1974, Crosby Valves and Edward Le Pas {{had decided}} {{that they wanted to}} {{concentrate}} on other products besides <b>electric</b> <b>trucks.</b> The local management team, headed by Mike Warrington, decided to attempt a management buyout. There was considerable support from within the existing company, and with some outside financial backing, the company transferred to its new ownership in 1975. They moved to a factory on Rockingham Road, and traded briefly as McGibbon, as one of the backers was the former Northamptonshire cricketer Lewis McGibbon, until the registration of Harbilt <b>Electric</b> <b>Trucks</b> Ltd was completed.|$|R

5000|$|... 1 US {{gallon of}} fuel is {{equivalent}} to =33.7kwh, according to the US Department of Energy. This <b>electric</b> <b>truck</b> uses 2 kilowatt-hours per mile which {{is the equivalent of}} using only 10 kwh per every 5 miles. The diesel truck that it replaces uses the equivalent of 33.7kwh per 5 miles. Thus the diesel truck is using 3.37 times the amount of energy that the <b>electric</b> <b>truck</b> is using. Thus the only variables that are stopping non commercial use of electric pickup trucks are original vehicle cost and range. As mass production happens the cost should eventually be comparable to diesel vehicles and with improvement in batteries the limited range of the <b>electric</b> <b>truck</b> will be a non issue.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{frequent}} stop-and-go operation and long idling periods when driving in congested urban areas, the electrification of commercial delivery trucks {{has become an}} interesting topic nationwide. In this study, environmental impacts of various alternative delivery <b>trucks</b> including battery <b>electric,</b> diesel, diesel-electric hybrid, and compressed natural gas trucks are analyzed. A novel life cycle assessment method, an environmentally-extended multi-region input-output analysis, is utilized to calculate energy and carbon footprints throughout the supply chain of alternative delivery trucks. The uncertainties due to fuel consumption or other key parameter variations in real life, data ranges are taken into consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, variations in regional electricity mix greenhouse gas emission are also considered to present a region-specific assessment for each vehicle type. According to the analysis results, although the battery <b>electric</b> delivery <b>trucks</b> have zero tailpipe emission, <b>electric</b> <b>trucks</b> {{are not expected to}} have lower environmental impacts compared to other alternatives. On average, the <b>electric</b> <b>trucks</b> have slightly more greenhouse emissions and energy consumption than those of other trucks. The regional analysis also indicates that the percentage of cleaner power sources in the electricity mix {{plays an important role in}} the life cycle greenhouse gas emission impacts of <b>electric</b> <b>trucks...</b>|$|R
