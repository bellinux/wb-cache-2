5000|$|A new herbicide-resistant {{strain of}} Amaranthus palmeri has appeared; it is glyphosate-resistant and so cannot {{be killed by}} {{herbicides}} using the chemical. Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions. This could be of particular concern to cotton farmers using glyphosate-resistant cotton. The species Amaranthus palmeri (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in soybean yields and {{has the potential to}} reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments. Palmer amaranth is among the [...] "top five most troublesome weeds" [...] in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicides</b> and acetolactate synthase inhibitors. This makes the proper identification of Amaranthus species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.|$|E
40|$|A dinitroaniline-resistant (R) biotype of Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertner. (goosegrass) is {{demonstrated}} to be cross-resistant to a structurally non-related herbicide, amiprophosmethyl, and supersensitive to two other classes of compounds which disrupt mitosis. These {{characteristics of the}} R biotype were discovered in a comparative test {{of the effects of}} 24 different antimitotic compounds on the R biotype and susceptible (S) wild-type Eleusine. The compounds tested could be classified into three groups based upon their effects on mitosis in root tips of the susceptible (S) biotype. Class I compounds induced effects like the well known mitotic disrupter colchicine: absence of cortical and spindle microtubules, mitosis arrested at prometaphase, and the formation of polymorphic nuclei after arrested mitosis. The R biotype was resistant to treatment with some class I inhibitors (all <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicides</b> and amiprophosmethyl) but not all (e. g. colchicine, podophyllotoxin, vinblastine, and pronamide). Roots of the R biotype, when treated with either <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicides</b> or amiprophosmethyl, exhibited no or only small increases in the mitotic index nor were the spindle and cortical microtubules affected. Compounds of class II (carbamate herbicides and griseofulvin) cause misorientation of microtubules which results in multinucleated cells. Compounds of class III (caffeine and structually related alkaloids) cause imcomplete cell walls to form at telophase. Each of these last two classes of compounds affected the R biotype more than the S biotype (supersensitivity). The cross-resistance and high levels of resistance of the R biotype of Eleusine to the <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicides</b> and the structurally distinct herbicide, amiprophosmethyl, indicate that a mechanism of resistance based upon metabolic modification, translocation, or compartmentation of the herbicides is probably not operative...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the Maricopa Agricultural Center to compare various cotton weed control programs that combined {{the use of the}} over-the-top herbicides Buctril, Roundup Ultra and Staple with reduced or eliminated preemergence herbicide applications in dry planted cotton. Roundup Utra provide superior large seedling Palmer amaranth control compared to Buctril or Staple. The yield and end of the season weed control data showed that BXNBuctril and Staple weed control strategies require the application of a <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicide</b> prior to planting. The data also suggest that a band application of Prowl in combination with timely postemergence Buctril or Staple applications would be just as effective as preplant incorporated application of Prowl. In contrast to the Buctril and Staple herbicide treatments, {{the end of the season}} weed control ratings and seed cotton yield were the same for all of the Roundup Ready cotton treatments suggesting that Roundup Ready cotton weed control strategies do not necessarily require a <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicide</b> (Prowl or Trejlan) application prior to planting...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicides</b> are antimicrotubule {{drugs that}} bind to tubulins and inhibit polymerization. As {{a result of}} {{repeated}} application of <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicides,</b> highly resistant and intermediately resistant biotypes of goosegrass (Eleusine indica) developed in previously wild-type populations. Three alpha-tubulin cDNA classes (designated TUA 1, TUA 2, and TUA 3) were isolated from each biotype. Nucleotide differences between the susceptible and the resistant (R) alpha-tubulins were identified in TUA 1 and TUA 2. The most significant differences were missense mutations that occurred in TUA 1 of the R and intermediately resistant (I) biotypes. Such mutations convert Thr- 239 to Ile in the R biotype and Met- 268 to Thr in the I biotype. These amino acid substitutions alter hydrophobicity; therefore, they may alter the dinitroaniline binding property of the protein. These mutations were correlated with the dinitroaniline response phenotypes (Drp). Plants homozygous for susceptibility possessed the wild-type TUA 1 allele; plants homozygous for resistance possessed the mutant tua 1 allele; and plants heterozygous for susceptibility possessed both wild-type and mutant alleles. Thus, we conclude that TUA 1 is at the Drp locus. Using polymerase chain reaction primer-introduced restriction analysis, we demonstrated that goosegrass genomic DNA can be diagnosed for Drp alleles. Although not direct proof, {{these results suggest that}} a mutation in an alpha-tubulin gene confers resistance to dinitroanilines in goosegrass...|$|E

40|$|The {{intracellular}} binding of <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicides</b> was {{studied in}} order to analyze the mechanism of their colchicine-like action. When corn root apices (5 millimeters) are incubated in [14 C]oryzalin (a dinitroaniline herbicide), the 14 C is taken up rapidly, reaching a plateau in about 4 hours, which corresponds to the minimum incubation time in oryzalin required to get maximum inhibition of elongation. At 4 hours, the [14 C]oryzalin concentration inside the roots is 35 times higher than that in the incubation medium. Since this accumulation of [14 C]oryzalin is not affected by 1 millimolar sodium azide {{and there is no}} metabolism of [14 C]oryzalin under these conditions, the [14 C]oryzalin must be accumulated (bound) in corn root apices by a process not requiring metabolic energy...|$|E

Derivatives of compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized. In these derivatives the functionality at the C- 1 amine position or the C- 4 position was substituted with groups with various hydrophilicities to determine if a direct relation existed between water solubility and overall activity. The chlorinated precursors of these derivatives were also examined and were found to be less active in the C. parvum assays, a result in direct contrast to earlier work with Leishmania.

Maximal motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities (MCV and SCV, respectively) in the median, sural and tibial nerves, postural sway, and brain-evoked potentials (auditory event-related and visual-evoked potentials) were measured in 80 male tobacco farmers and age- and sex-matched 40 controls in Kelantan, Malaysia. Median SCV (finger-wrist) in farmers using Delsen (mancozeb, dithiocarbamate fungicide), who showed significant decrease of serum cholinesterase activities, were significantly lower compared with the controls. Sural SCV in farmers using Fastac (α-cypermethrin, pyrethroid insecticide) and median MCV (elbowwrist) in farmers using Tamex (butralin, <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicide)</b> were significantly slowed compared with their respective controls.

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of herbicides in agriculture becomes {{an important factor in}} environmental pollution, especially in case of slowly degradable compounds. Some agents act on plants during a long period of time, even if a very low concentration of the herbicide remains in the soil. Here, we investigated the toxicological effect of a low concentration of <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicide,</b> trifluralin, on growing seedlings of Hordeum vulgare L. Trifluralin in concentration of 1 μg/ml inhibited root growth. The mitotic activity of meristematic cells was suppressed due to the retardation of metaphase progression — alteration that can be caused by cytoskeleton disorder. Using antibodies to α-tubulin, we investigated the distribution of microtubules in root meristem cells. During all stages of mitosis, the highly regular system of microtubular cytoskeleton observed in control cells was slightly disorganized. An examination of root structure using light and electron microscopy demonstrated that the cell walls did not form normally during cell division that led to the appearance of large multinucleated cells. Also, the premature (pathological) cell differentiation was induced by trifluralin. A part of differentiating cells showed intracellular structural changes that are consistent with programmed cell death. It seems that the development of alterations in trifluralin-treated roots was due to the microtubular cytoskeleton disorganization...|$|R
40|$|Oryzalin, a <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicide,</b> was {{previously}} reported to bind to plant tubulin with a moderate strengthe interaction (dissociation constant [Kd] = 8. 4 [mu]M) that appeared {{inconsistent with the}} nanomolar concentrations of drug that cause the loss of microtubules, inhibit mitosis, and produce herbicidal effects in plants (L. C. Morejohn, T. E. Bureau, J. Mole-Bajer, A. S. Bajer, D. E. Fosket [1987] Planta 172 : 252 - 264). To characterize further the mechanism of action of oryzalin, both kinetic and quasi-equilibrium ligand-binding methods were {{used to examine the}} interaction of [14 C]-oryzalin with tubulin from cultured cells of maize (Zea mays L. cv Black Mexican Sweet). Oryzalin binds to maize tubulin dimer via a rapid and pH-dependent interaction to form a tubulin-oryzalin complex. Both the tubulin-oryzalin binding strength and stoichiometry are underestimated substantially when measured by kinetic binding methods, because the tubulin-oryzalin complex dissociates rapidly into unliganded tubulin and free oryzalin. Also, an uncharacterized factor(s) that is co-isolated with maize tubulin was found to noncompetitively inhibit oryzalin binding to the dimer. Quasi-equilibrium binding measurements of the tubulin-oryzalin complex using purified maize dimer afforded a Kd of 95 nM (pH 6. 9; 23 [deg]C) and an estimated maximum molar binding stoichiometry of 0. 5. No binding of oryzalin to pure bovine brain tubulin was detected by equilibrium dialysis, and oryzalin has no discernible effect on microtubules in mouse 3 T 3 fibroblasts, indicating an absence of the oryzalin-binding site on mammalian tubulin. Oryzalin binds to pure taxol-stabilized maize microtubules in a polymer mass- and number-dependent manner, although polymerized tubulin has a much lower oryzalin-binding capacity than unpolymerized tubulin. Much more oryzalin is incorporated into polyment during taxol-induced assembly of pure maize tubulin, and half-maximal inhibition of the rapid phase of taxol-induced polymerization of 5 [mu]M tubulin is obtained with 700 [mu]M oryzalin. The data are consistent with a molecular mechanism whereby oryzalin binds rapidly, reversibly, and with high affinity to the plant tubulin dimer to form a tubulin-oryzalin complex that, at concentrations substoichiometric to tubulin, copolymerizes with unliganded tubulin and slows further assembly. Because half-maximal inhibition of maize callus growth is produced by 37 nM oryzalin, the herbicidal effects of oryzalin appear to result from a substoichiometric poisoning of microtubules...|$|R

On the basis of its structure, we developed a rational structure-activity model for chloralin.

The report describes a few scenario analyses affecting emissions to the European regional seas up to 2020 for Lindane, Trifluralin and Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) taken as pilot substances. The scenarios developed are agreed with stakeholders at DG ENV following some preparatory meetings. The scenarios do not intend be exhaustive, but examples of what can be further achieved making use of the modelling and database development made in the different phases of the project. For Lindane, the model estimated European sea load of 745 tons per 1995, based on the official emission data provided by EMEP, appears to be reduced by 98. 3 % in 2005, ten years after the start of the EU regulations for γ-HCH. Besides, under the BAU scenario, a Lindane sea load of ca. 12. 5 tons per year should be expected. The trend and ban scenarios support, respectively, a reduction of the load to the European seas in 2020 by 74 % and 95 % when compared to the BAU estimate. Aimed at Trifluralin, according to the BAU scenario, an annual load of ca. 61. 7 tones is estimated in 2020. However, this is an overestimation, because the aggregated emission data of EUROSTAT for the agriculture use of the entire group of <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicides</b> in for EU 25 have been considered as model input data. The complete ban scenario forecasts ca. 0. 07 t/y and in practice eliminates the concern about loads of Trifluralin to European seas to a negligible level in a time-frame of one year due to degradation in soil. Considering PFOS under BAU scenario conditions the total sea load from all European contries is estimated to be 5. 8 tons per year.

40|$|No - till {{systems have}} been widely adopted by farmers in Australia {{over the past decade}} to reduce soil erosion, improve soil {{physical}} and chemical properties, conserve soil moisture and save on fuel costs. These changes in tillage practices can have a major influence on the ecology and management of weeds. Studies were undertaken on the seed biology of six important Australian weed species to provide underpinning knowledge of their response to tillage. Field studies were also undertaken to investigate the effect of no - till on weed seedling emergence, seed bank persistence and herbicide behaviour. Seed germination of threehorn bedstraw and wild turnip, the latter only at sub - optimal temperatures, was inhibited by light. In contrast, seed germination of common sowthistle and Indian hedge mustard was stimulated by light. Seed germination of small - flowered mallow was not influenced by the light conditions. Seedling emergence of threehorn bedstraw, wild turnip, small - flowered mallow and annual ryegrass was low on the soil surface but increased with shallow burial, which suggests that farming practices that achieve shallow burial of seeds are likely to promote greater seedling emergence of these weed species. In contrast, seedling emergence of common sowthistle and Indian hedge mustard was greatest for the seeds present on the soil surface and emergence decreased with increased burial depth. In field experiments, low soil disturbance tillage systems left more seeds on the soil surface after crop sowing, whereas high soil disturbance systems buried most of the seeds. Seedling emergence of annual ryegrass, threehorn bedstraw and wild radish was greater under minimum tillage than no - till system. In contrast, seedling emergence of Indian hedge mustard, common sowthistle, silvergrass, small - flowered mallow and turnipweed was greater under the no - till system. Seedling emergence of wild oat and wild turnip was not influenced by the tillage system. Even though seedling emergence of annual ryegrass was much lower under no - till, the persistence of residual viable seeds of annual ryegrass from one season to the next was similar between the tillage systems. This was because of much greater seed decay under no - till (48 to 60 %) than that recorded under minimum tillage (12 to 39 %). All <b>dinitroaniline</b> <b>herbicides</b> (trifluralin, pendimethalin and oryzalin) were more effective in reducing the number of plants, spikes, dry matter and seed production of annual ryegrass when incorporated at sowing with tines than with the discs. At Minlaton in 2004 and 2005, bioavailable trifluralin was greater under tillage systems with greater levels of soil disturbance than under lower soil disturbance systems. In the absence of the herbicide, annual ryegrass was less competitive with wheat under the disc - sown systems. The response of grain yield to herbicides was greater under the tine - sown systems than the disc - sown systems. The performance of S - metolachlor on annual ryegrass control was investigated under no - till. The control of annual ryegrass was greater than 80 % when S - metolachlor was applied at sowing (incorporated by sowing or post - sowing pre - emergence). However, application of the herbicide at sowing resulted in phytotoxic effects on crop emergence and grain yield of wheat. Application of S - metolachlor at 20 or 23 days before sowing not only provided effective control (74 to 83 %) of annual ryegrass, it was also safe on wheat. Application of this herbicide at 40 or 46 days before sowing was relatively ineffective in controlling annual ryegrass (33 to 49 % weed kill) but safe on wheat. In conclusion, soil disturbance caused by tillage was found to have a major influence on the behaviour of the seed bank of different species including seedling emergence and decay rates of weed seeds. However, the response to tillage tended to be species - specific and was related to their seed biology.
