He's that sort of man. I hate individualism; it's ruining England. You won't find better cottages, or better farm-buildings anywhere than on my estate. I go in for centralisation. I dare say you know what I call myself--a 'Tory Communist.' To my mind, that's the party of the future. Now, your father's motto was: 'Every man for himself!' On the land that would never do.

5000|$|When {{predicting}} future emotional states {{people must}} first construct a good {{representation of the}} event. If people <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> with the event then they can easily picture the event. When {{people do not have}} much experience with the event they need to create a representation of what the event likely contains. For example, if people were asked how they would feel if they lost one hundred dollars in a bet, gamblers are more likely to easily construct an accurate representation of the event. [...] "Construal level theory" [...] theorizes that distant events are conceptualized more abstractly than immediate ones. Thus, psychologists suggest that a lack of concrete details prompts forecasters to rely on more general or idealized representations of events, which subsequently leads to simplistic and inaccurate predictions. For example, when asked to imagine what a 'good day' would be like for them in the near future, people often describe both positive and negative events. When asked to imagine what a 'good day' would be like for them in a year, however, people resort to more uniformly positive descriptions. Gilbert and Wilson call bringing to mind a flawed representation of a forecasted event the misconstrual problem. Framing effects, environmental context, and heuristics (such as schemas) can all affect how a forecaster conceptualizes a future event. For example, the way options are framed affects how they are represented: when asked to forecast future levels of happiness based on pictures of dorms they may be assigned to, college students use physical features of the actual buildings to predict their emotions. In this case, the framing of options highlighted visual aspects of future outcomes, which overshadowed more relevant factors to happiness, such as having a friendly roommate.|$|E

And {{while this is}} very {{different}} to what I've done before, the model is no different. If you don't have any debt, which we won't have, and you don't have any excessive payrolls for people driven by ego, which we won't have, this business can only go one way and that's up.

It's a business which needs a lot, but not a lot. That sounds like a contradiction, but there are stupid things which are broken and simply by fixing them we'll make Vale Park a better place. The only way we can influence things on the pitch is by creating the commercial resources to increase our income. We'll filter that down to the squad. It's difficult to list priorities because there are so many things that are broken, damaged or tarnished - from the toilets to the stadium seating to people's perception of the business and the overall match-day experience. But this should not be a one-day-a-week venue. The resources here are massively under-used at the moment and we want to change that... We'll have a board for operational purposes, but there will be just two shareholders - Paul, who will be chairman, and myself, and we'll take no salaries or dividends. We're planning to take nothing out of this club whatsoever. We're bringing in people from within our current group of businesses, but it will be a very flat structure, and even their costs will come from within the group of businesses that we run, so the finance and operational side of things will not be a cost to Port Vale... If you're coming to the game, come earlier, drink our beer and eat our pies because everything we can do to increase turnover will directly go straight into the playing squad, It's that simple."

50|$|During the 1920s, Chelouche devoted {{himself to}} the writing of his memoir, called in Hebrew Parashat Hayai (Reminiscences of My Life), which he {{regarded}} as his legacy to the future generations living in Palestine. Chelouche's book portrays his life, spanning from his childhood to the bloody incidents in Palestine in August 1929. Being a native born Palestinian who was an active player in the events that {{took place during the}} region's historic transformations, Chelouche's view, as revealed by his memoir, is colorful, vivid and fascinating. Chelouche describes his childhood in Jaffa, his years in a high-class Jewish boarding school in Beirut, his early marriage and his first steps in the field of construction. Later on, Chelouche recites his close involvement in the establishment of Tel Aviv as a constructor and local activist. A considerable part of the book is devoted to the events of World War I in Palestine, including the deportation of the inhabitants of Tel Aviv to the northern parts of the land. The period after World War I is portrayed in Chelouche's memoir as a time of decline in the relations between Jews and Arabs. Chelouche recalls his personal efforts to secure peace in spite of the increasing tensions. The book concludes with two complementary essays: an open letter to the Arab people that was published in a Syrian newspaper following the 1929 incidents, and a piercing and agonizing epilogue in which Chelouche analyzes the relations between the different peoples living in Palestine. Regarding the historic role of the Palestinian-born Jews, Chelouche wrote the following words (as translated by Addy Cohen):And whoever is knowledgeable about the history of our Yishuv from beginning till now, knows that getting closer to our neighbors and making peace with them was our first obligation, the natives, and we fulfilled it according to our conception, and if we succeeded in our task - {{and it was a great}} success - it was because we respected our neighbors and we took into consideration the fact that we had to live next to them in good relations if we need to build our Yishuv in this land.However - and we utter here the bitter and terrible truth - the truth is that our leaders and many of the founders of the Yishuv who came from the Diaspora in order to lead us, did not comprehend the high value of relations between neighbors at all, this basic and simple rule. Perhaps they did not understand, or did not want to pay attention to it, but in doing so, they are guilty of not coping with the problem, which gradually became more and more complicated, till it became the most painful problem of the Yishuv. Many have already written about it, discussed it and commented on it publicly, that since the day of Herzl’s appearance with the idea of the political Zionism, the Zionist propaganda in all countries and languages described the land where we were going to establish our National Home, as a land of desert and desolation, where nobody dwelt, and it was on the basis of this description, in writing and by heart, that it was only a virgin land, that all the Zionist methods of the establishment of the Yishuv were developed, and they included all but one thing, the attention to those inhabitants who had already been living in this land....And this attitude of indifference by the new immigrants, to their neighbors in the country, the country they meant to settle and live in. Due to this attitude, our neighbors did not wish to appreciate the great benefit of our settlement activity, which was valuable to them as well. They were not satisfied with our sons, probably due to the indifference of the leaders of the Yishuv, although they knew that the greater part of the national and private capital of the Jews passed into their hands in various ways. And only due to this attitude of indifference, they were not satisfied to acknowledge this important fact, that they also gained many reforms and improvements in their economic and cultural life.What have they seen in us and in our work from the beginning of our settlement till today? Only cold indifference, estrangement and alienation, and in addition, they also heard from our chief spokesman in the Zionist press a lot of idle talk and nonsense that sometimes caused us a lot of damage.And a very interesting fact is that the Muslim Arabs, the enlightened ones among them, tried several times in the past, to find ways to get closer to us, because many of them already then and know it today that the Jews are the only element that can bring the progress in the development, in all its aspects, to this desolate land. And the bright people among them, know also that their opposition now is only artificial, created by outside causes, by agitators. And they, as well as us, the natives, know it clearly that it is very possible to create a relationship of mutual understanding between us and them. We only have to work with tact and cautious psychological understanding, to make this relationship that was so much damaged, and apply it in concrete and true steps, mainly in correct deeds and actions, to attain the goal.And we have to build the bridge between us and them, because otherwise, all our work in the Yishuv will be delayed, because it relies only on our poor resources and on British bayonets, which may change according to the spirit of the time and the political situation of the Empire, as in the biblical formula from the era of the War between Amalek and Moses, when Moses hands where heavy they raised his hands and Israel won the battle and vice versa, and it is impossible for us to feel completely safe and we must not rely on British bayonets.We can build this bridge if we only adopt this true outlook, that thisLand is OUR LONDON, that only here in this land can we find the solution to this problem, and also if approach it with pure and correct attitude, with true and compassionate relationship, not one sided, by party politics or foreign motives, which are contrary to the way of peace and truth....My greatest wish is that the chapters in my book, where I tell and describe my true and compassionate relationship with our neighbors, the Muslims, would motivate the ones who intend to deal with the problem of our relationships with our neighbors, to use another method and other tactics, the methods and tactics of the natives, who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> in the relationships with our neighbors, and to correct ,as much as possible, the twisted relations with them.Parashat Hayai was published in Tel Aviv in 1931 but was not widely distributed. In spite of that, the book became a unique source for historic research of the times and places it depicted, though its humanistic messages were mostly neglected. Its original perspective on the possibility of Jewish-Arab coexistence made Babel publishers from Tel Aviv to publish an annotated edition of the book in 2005.|$|E
