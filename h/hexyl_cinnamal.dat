50|$|Hexyl {{cinnamaldehyde}} (<b>hexyl</b> <b>cinnamal)</b> is {{a common}} additive in perfume and cosmetic industry as aroma substance. It is found naturally in the essential oil of chamomile.|$|E
30|$|These {{findings}} {{are in line}} with previous analyses and show that the situation {{does not seem to have}} improved in the last years: Rastogi and his coworkers had found that 91  % of natural cosmetics on the Danish market contained at least one of the allergenic fragrances [44]. Steinemann found that the composition of volatile organic compounds in ‘green’-labeled fragranced products was not significantly different from that of other fragranced products with regard to the number of hazardous chemicals as defined under U.S. federal law [45]. Dodson described, that most common natural fragrance chemicals included the allergenic terpenes limonene, <b>hexyl</b> <b>cinnamal,</b> and linalool [27]. The frequency of the ‘ 26 fragrance allergens’ was analyzed also in the ingredient lists of conventional deodorants in a previous study where 76  % of the products contained at least one of the ‘ 26 fragrance allergens’ [46].|$|E
40|$|Background Fragrance mix I (FM I) and {{fragrance}} mix II (FM II) in the European baseline {{series are}} used as screening tools for fragrance contact allergy. In 2005 the European Union (EU) required labelling of 26 fragrances when present in cosmetic products. INCI nomenclature is obligatory for such labelling. Objectives To describe frequencies of contact allergy to these 26 fragrance substances, and to evaluate clinical relevance of these positive reactions. Methods Three hundred and twenty patients with eczema suspected of being contact allergy to fragrances or cosmetics were patch tested with the EU-declared fragrance chemicals, FM I and FM II. Results There were 76 positive reactions in 33 patients. Most reactions were to <b>hexyl</b> <b>cinnamal</b> and hydroxyisohexyl 3 -cyclohexene carboxaldehyde in 3. 1 %, followed by Evernia furfuracea (2. 5 %) and cinnamyl alcohol (2. 5 %). Twelve reactions to FM I and II were not confirmed by separate ingredients. Clinical relevance of positive reactions to fragrances was certain in 20 / 33 (61 %). Conclusions 10. 3 % of the patients had positive patch tests in the EU-list. Hydroxyisohexyl 3 -cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, a component of FM II, was the most frequent allergen, followed by Evernia furfuracea. Since Evernia furfuracea {{is not part of}} FM I or FM II, relevant reactions can be missed when only the European baseline series is used...|$|E
40|$|The European {{legislation}} {{on cosmetic products}} has recently required the declaration of 26 compounds (24 volatile chemicals and 2 natural extracts) on the label of final products when exceeding a stipulated cut-off level. In this work a rapid reliable and specific RP-HPLC method coupled with diode array detector (DAD) has been developed for the simultaneous determination and quantification of the 24 volatile chemicals: amyl cinnamal, benzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, citral, eugenol, hydroxy-citronellal, isoeugenol, amylcinnamyl alcohol, benzyl salicylate, cinnamal, coumarin, geraniol, Lyral (hydroxy-methylpentylcyclohexene carboxaldehyde), anisyl alcohol, benzyl cinnamate, farnesol, Lilial (2 -(4 -tert-butylbenzyl) propionaldehyde) linalool, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, <b>hexyl</b> <b>cinnamal,</b> limonene, methylheptin carbonate, alpha-isomethyl ionone (3 -methyl- 4 -(2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -yl) - 3 -buten- 2 -one). The 24 analytes were appropriately separated over a running time of 40 min, on a C 18 column using a simple gradient elution (acetonitrile/water) with flow rate from 0. 7 to 1. 0 ml/min and UV acquisition at 210, 254 and 280 nm. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r 2 > 0. 99) within test ranges. The method was successfully applied to the qualitative and quantitative determination of the potential allergens in four commercial scented products, with satisfactory accuracy and precision. The results indicated that this simple and efficient method {{can be used for}} quality assessment of complex matrices such us cosmetic scented products...|$|E
