50|$|Wafer {{testing is}} a step {{performed}} during semiconductor device fabrication. During this step, performed before a wafer is sent to die preparation, all individual integrated circuits that are present on the wafer are tested for functional defects by applying special test patterns to them. The wafer testing is performed by a piece of test equipment called a wafer prober. The process of wafer testing {{can be referred to}} in several ways: Wafer Final Test (WFT), <b>Electronic</b> <b>Die</b> Sort (EDS) and Circuit Probe (CP) are probably the most common.|$|E

A Multichip Module (MCM) was {{designed}} and submitted for fabrication to the Lockheed Martin foundry using a licensed process called High Density Interconnect (HDI). The HDI process uses thin film techniques to create circuit interconnect patterns on multiple layers of dielectric film which are deposited directly on top of unpackaged <b>electronic</b> <b>die.</b> This results in an optimally small package that approaches {{the area of the}} bare die themselves.

Both experimental sample creation and transient thermal modeling were conducted. This thesis will report thermal simulation and experimental results as well as discussing the joining process {{and the results of}} shear strength and thermal cycling reliability testing. A new pre-heating method was developed after results revealed that the initial temperature of the system is vital in predicting how successful a joint will be.

Daisy chain LCP assemblies were thermal cycled from - 135 to + 85 degC (Mars surface conditions for motor control electronics). The LCP assembly method was further utilized to embed an operational amplifier designed for operation within the Mars surface ambient.

40|$|Light {{modulators}} {{and switches}} based on silicon photonic microrings can be fabricated with the conventional CMOS technology. For the first time, an optical interconnect integrated on a VLSI <b>electronic</b> <b>die</b> can be realistically envisioned. In {{spite of this}} exciting development, there is still one fundamental problem that must be overcome: wavelength nonuniformity, which {{is a result of}} miniaturization of the ring and the precision limit of the current fabricating process. Existing electronic or thermo-optical tuning methods are simply not scalable. An approach that combines techniques from both the device and architecture point of view is presented in this paper. It intends to show how the device-level wavelength nonuniformity problem can be tackled at the architecture level. An analytical model is also developed for evaluating the probability of finding a common wavelength among multiple microring resonators. The model can provide useful insights into the design of any microring-based interconnection network...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{information on}} an experiment which validates silver sintering paste manufacturerâ€™s die attach processes and examines feasibility {{for use in}} commercial products. Four silver pastes were used in constructing die attach samples, which were then void and shear tested. The silver sintering materials that are investigated in this work are compared with manufacturer data and also with data from conventional attaches such as conductive epoxy and solder. In addition, materials demonstrating the highest shear strength were down-selected and processed to compare thermal characteristics with solder and conductive epoxy. Under theoretical analysis, the characteristics of silver provide the most optimal solution as a die attach material for extreme conditions. Additionally, silver sintering paste technology has been significantly increasing over the last decade, leading to the potential for silver sintering pastes {{to be the next}} standard in power <b>electronic</b> <b>die</b> attaches, specifically in high temperature and rugged designs [1]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Central ray is the {{projection}} of the centre-of-rotation of a computed tomography (CT) system. It is required for all kind of CT image reconstruction algorithms. The current common practice is to determine it by scanning a wire phantom. This is a manual work and very time-consuming. Besides, when a minute object is scanned with large magnification, it usually encounters large errors in {{the determination of the}} central ray due to the mechanical movements required. When the source-to-object distance becomes further smaller, it might be even impossible to insert the wire phantom. This paper describes the basic idea of directly using {{the projection}} data of an object to be inspected for the determination of the central ray. With this method, the left and right boundary points of the whole-round projection of the object are identified from the sinogram of one slice and the system projection geometry is used to calculate the central ray. This approach significantly simplifies the micro-CT scanning process and saves much operation time as well. The inspections of a small <b>electronic</b> <b>die</b> and a small electric wire-bundle successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. 1...|$|E

The threshold intensities for die release and silicon damage will be explored as a function of operating laser beam characteristics.

40|$|Smart {{surfaces}}, surfaces that {{respond to}} an external stimulus in a defined manner, hold considerable potential as components in molecular-based devices, not least as discrete switching elements. Many stimuli {{can be used to}} switch surfaces between different states, including redox, light, pH, and ion triggers. The present review focuses on Molecular switching through <b>die</b> <b>electronic</b> excitation of molecules on surfaces with light. In developing light-responsive surfaces, investigators face several challenges, not only in achieving high photostationary states and fully reversible switching, but also in dealing with fatigue resistance and the effect of immobilization itself on molecular properties. The immobilization of light-responsive molecules requires the design and synthesis of functional molecular components both to achieve light switching and to anchor the molecular entity onto a surface. This review discusses several demonstrative examples of photoswitchable molecular systems in which the photochemistry has been explored in the immobilized State under ambient conditions and especially on electroactive surfaces, including self-assembled monolayers, bilayers, and polymer films...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} shown the {{tremendous}} need for visual recording in consumer, telecom and security. Especially mobile phones have driven that trend to today's ultra-small cameras embedded into the handset. While the image capture IC features ever-decreasing pixel geometries and surging megapixel numbers, the readout circuitry and optical systems are now challenged to follow-up with this trend. This paper describes a miniaturization approach using advanced packaging techniques for the <b>electronic</b> system (bare <b>die</b> assembly in stack-wirebond and flip-chip) onto a high density circuit board and leveraging a MEMS based optical system providing the possibility for variable focus lens an aperture concept. This can {{give rise to a}} camera including the optical system with just about 3 mm x 10 mm x 10 mm total dimensions. For prototypes, some electronic bare dice are mimicked by de-capsulating the IC from the plastic housing and rebumping it for use as flip chip. This prototype procedure is also described. Operation of the MEMS device challenges the assembly technique for particulate free manufacturing of al back end processes. Bare die assembly with wirebond and flip chip provides ultimate miniaturization onto a rigid-flex multi layer PCB. The process flow for MOEMS assembly, electronic components assembly and final housing is designed to be generically applicable to current and future needs of ultraminiaturized cameras...|$|R
