30|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{whether or not}} the use of <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> alters the outcome of sentinel lymph node assessment in patients with malignant skin neoplasms of the upper and lower extremities. Some lymphatic channels were observed using early phase <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> only, and sentinel lymph node assessment was altered in some cases. Determination of whether a lymph node is a sentinel lymph node depends on visualization of the lymphatic network. In the cases of the lower extremities, the average diagnostic confidence value of sentinel lymph node assessment is usually higher with observation of <b>dynamic</b> <b>images.</b> In many cases, information about lymphatic flow was added with observation of <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> and it was helpful for sentinel lymph node assessment.

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to confirm the {{contribution}} of <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> in sentinel lymphoscintigraphy in malignant skin neoplasms: precisely, to investigate if <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> were necessary and to observe if <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> could reduce the areas needed for biopsy and dissection. Twenty-five patients with malignant skin neoplasms of the lower (n = 21) and upper (n = 4) extremities were retrospectively investigated. Images were evaluated by two independent reviewers, an expert in diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine and a diagnostic radiologist in training. Visualized hot spots were assessed to be sentinel nodes using only static planar images. Next, both static planar and <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> were assessed. Reviewers scored diagnostic confidence values of determined sentinel nodes as follows: 0, cannot be decided; 1, possible; 2, probable; and 3, definitive. Patterns of lymphatic drainage were categorized into six different pathways: (1) inguinal type, (2) popliteal type, (3) inguinal and popliteal type, (4) axillary type, (5) cubital type, and (6) axillary and cubital type. In cases in the lower extremities, with <b>dynamic</b> <b>images,</b> the expert reviewer changed assessment in three cases and the trainee reviewer changed it in one case. There were no cases in which a decision was changed to be the same between both reviewers. Although the average diagnostic confidence value of assessment is usually higher with <b>dynamic</b> <b>images,</b> significant differences were not present. In cases of the upper extremities, both reviewers changed their assessment in one patient. By mutual agreement, cases in which assessment was changed with <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> were the inguinal and popliteal type, and the axillary and cubital type. The expert reviewer noticed lymphatic channels only visualized on <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> and changed assessment. Determination of whether or not a lymph node is a sentinel node depends on visualization of the lymphatic network. In the present circumstances, all biopsies of hot spots determined to be lymph nodes should not be excluded. However, excessive biopsies should be avoided as much as possible. It is necessary to use <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> alongside skillful observation.|$|R

The proposed research aims: to confirm that the recognition advantage for <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> is robust, to discover the reasons why <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> are recognised better than multi-static or static images, to develop a formal theory of recognition memory that can account for recognition of <b>dynamic</b> <b>images.</b> To achieve these aims, a series of experiments will be carried out, in which the determinants of the dynamic superiority effect will be explored. The experiments will focus particularly on the contribution of storage and retrieval processes (and their interaction) to the dynamic superiority effect. The role of motion information per se will also be investigated. The experimental results will form the basis {{for the development of a}} formal model of recognition memory for dynamic and static materials...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate grading performance when estimating the severity of static versus <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> of contact lens-related ocular pathology. METHODS: Thirty-eight subjects used the Efron Grading Scales for Contact Lens Complications to grade the severity of ocular pathological changes depicted in static and dynamic (movie clip) computer-displayed images of each of the following contact lens complications: bulbar conjunctival redness, limbal redness, papillary conjunctivitis, corneal staining, corneal infiltrates and meibomian gland dysfunction. The viewing of static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> was separated by seven weeks. RESULTS: Grades assigned to <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> were 0. 6 and 0. 7 grading scale units higher than those assigned to static images for limbal redness and papillary conjunctivitis, respectively (p < 0. 0001 for both). No difference was observed for the other four complications. There was an apparent trend for grading variability to be reduced (that is, observers grading in closer agreement) when grading <b>dynamic</b> versus static <b>images.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Absolute grades based on an assessment of signs of pathology represented in static images may, in some instances, underestimate the true severity of the condition...|$|R

30|$|Radioguided {{sentinel}} {{lymph node}} detection in malignant skin neoplasms is currently both common and indispensable (Gennari et al. 2000; Jacobs et al. 2001; Belhocine et al. 2002 a; Alazraki et al. 2002; Rossi et al. 2006; Mariani et al. 2002; Mariani et al. 2004; Uren et al. 1996). In cases of malignant cutaneous neoplasms {{in the arms}} and legs, sentinel lymphoscintigraphy can occasionally reveal lymph nodes in the poples, cubitus, and several other unexpected areas (Uren et al. 2003; Vidal-Sicart et al. 2003; Vidal-Sicart et al. 2004; Tiffet et al. 2004; Matter et al. 2007) which are called interval nodes, in-transit lymph nodes, ectopic lymph nodes, and so on (Matter et al. 2007). The risk of metastasis to an interval node {{is similar to that}} of other sentinel lymph nodes, and the interval node may be the only metastatic site (Matter et al. 2007). Therefore, searching such areas should not be excluded in sentinel lymph node detection. Conversely, if all downstream lymph nodes in the groin and axilla are second echelon lymph nodes, interval node biopsy alone may be sufficient. This abbreviated lymph node dissection should reduce the invasiveness of the investigation. However, in some cases, there are lymphatic channels that are visualized only in early phase <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> immediately after tracer injection (Taylor et al. 1996; Maza et al. 2003; Toubert et al. 2008; Miura et al. 2010). If <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> are not observed, assessment of the sentinel lymph node might be different in these cases (Matter et al. 2007; Toubert et al. 2008; Miura et al. 2010). Therefore, it is important to determine if the hot spot is a sentinel lymph node, as this can be closely related to the patient’s prognosis (Gennari et al. 2000; Taylor et al. 1996; Maza et al. 2003). The aim of the present study was to confirm the contribution of <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> in sentinel lymphoscintigraphy: precisely, to investigate if <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> were necessary and to observe if <b>dynamic</b> <b>images</b> could reduce the areas needed for biopsy and lymph node dissection.|$|R

40|$|Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) orient less to {{socially}} salient stimuli, such as <b>dynamic</b> social <b>images,</b> than typically developing children. In turn, {{this lack}} of social orienting is thought to impair affected individuals' socio communicative development. Here, we aim to explore the relationship between time spent on <b>dynamic</b> social <b>images</b> and ASD behaviors, such as joint attention and communication, in preschoolers on the autism spectrum. In this study, social orienting is measured using eye-tracking during a task consisting of side-by-side presentations of <b>dynamic</b> social <b>images</b> and <b>dynamic</b> geometric <b>images.</b> The {{side of the screen}} where each type of video was presented alternated between items to avoid visual perseveration from influencing the location of participants' first fixations. Visual exploration patterns recorded during the task from 33 preschoolers with ASD were compared with those of 27 typical developing (TD) children. Additionally, we quantified joint attention behaviors and used standardized parent reports to measure communication. We observed reduced orienting to <b>dynamic</b> social <b>images</b> in preschoolers with ASD compared to TD children. Also, ASD participants went to the <b>dynamic</b> social <b>images</b> less frequently for their first fixations. However, we observed great heterogeneity within the ASD group. ASD preschoolers who spent more time on the <b>dynamic</b> social <b>images</b> also presented more pronounced visual engagement with the <b>dynamic</b> social <b>images</b> (longer mean fixation duration and fewer saccades per second). Moreover, in the ASD group, more time spent on <b>dynamic</b> social <b>images</b> correlated with increased frequency of joint attention behaviors, which in turn correlated with improved communication skills. Our results support reduced social orienting in children with ASD, which correlated with their visual exploration patterns. Further, reduced orienting to the social world in young children with ASD is related to socio communicative deficits and should, therefore, be a focus of intervention programs as early as possible...|$|R
