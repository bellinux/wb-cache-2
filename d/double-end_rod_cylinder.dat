50|$|Tie <b>rod</b> style {{hydraulic}} <b>cylinders</b> use {{high strength}} threaded steel rods {{to hold the}} two end caps to the cylinder barrel. They are most often seen in industrial factory applications. Small bore cylinders usually have 4 tie rods, and large bore cylinders may require as many as 16 or 20 tie rods in order to retain the end caps under the tremendous forces produced.

50|$|This {{extremely}} simple pump {{was made}} of cast iron, and had no pistons, <b>rods,</b> <b>cylinders,</b> cranks, or flywheels. It operated by the direct action of steam on water. The mechanism consisted of two chambers. As the steam condensed in one chamber, it acted as a suction pump, while in the other chamber, steam was introduced under pressure and so it acted as a force pump. At {{the end of every}} stroke, a ball valve consisting of a small brass ball moved slightly, causing the two chambers to swap functions from suction-pump to force-pump and vice versa. The result was that the water was first suction pumped and then force pumped.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} low-cost, high {{precision}} and efficient throttle-less hydraulic circuit that utilizes off-the-shelf industrial elements to control single <b>rod</b> hydraulic <b>cylinders.</b> The circuit uses an on/off solenoid valve to redirect the differential flow {{of a single}} <b>rod</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder,</b> and two counterbalance valves to manage switching (resistive–assistive) loads. Conducted experiments on a prototype system indicated a maximum steady state positional error of 0. 2 mm. The circuit consumes only 20 % of energy that is required by a valve controlled circuit to follow the same tracking signal. A simple proportional controller, that uses readings of a linear position transducer, is employed for all experiments, which makes the designed circuit easy to be implemented...|$|R
50|$|An {{application}} for telescopic cylinders commonly seen {{is that of}} the dump body on a dump truck used in a construction site. In order to empty the load of gravel completely, the dump body must be raised to an angle of about 60 degrees. To accomplish this long travel with a conventional hydraulic cylinder is very difficult considering that the collapsed length of a single stage <b>rod</b> <b>cylinder</b> is approximately 110% of its output stroke. It would be very challenging for the design engineer to fit the single stage cylinder into the chassis of the dump truck with the dump body in the horizontal rest position. This task is easily accomplished, however, using a telescopic style multi-stage cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} a {{hydraulic}} cylinder is the total of the stroke, {{the thickness of the}} piston, the thickness of bottom and head and the length of the connections. Often this length does not fit in the machine. In that case the piston rod is also used as a piston barrel and a second piston rod is used. These kinds of cylinders are called telescopic cylinders. If we call a normal <b>rod</b> <b>cylinder</b> single stage, telescopic cylinders are multi-stage units of two, three, four, five or more stages. In general telescopic cylinders are much more expensive than normal cylinders. Most telescopic cylinders are single acting (push). Double acting telescopic cylinders must be specially designed and manufactured.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the mechanism of the formation and the convection of vortices shedding from the cylinder with an upstream rod. The aerodynamic characteristics of the <b>rod</b> and <b>cylinder</b> are modelled in two dimensions by using Fluent® with laminar flow. It is found that the mean drag and the lift fluctuation of the cylinder can be reduced by the upstream rod, especially in the cavity flow mode with the rod diameters d / D = 0. 3 and 0. 5 (here d and D are the diameters of the <b>rod</b> and the <b>cylinder,</b> respectively). With <b>rod</b> diameters d / D = 0. 3 and 0. 5, the simulation indicates that there are two flow modes of the flow field around the <b>rod</b> and <b>cylinder,</b> which appear with the variation of the center-to-center spacing ratio L / D: the cavity flow mode and the wake impinge mode. There is a pair of standing vortices between the <b>rod</b> and the <b>cylinder</b> in the cavity mode, which results in the pressure decrease on the windward side of the cylinder. It is found that the characteristics of the flow significantly depend on the spacing ratio L / D. Instantaneous flow fields, force fluctuation, force spectrum and so on are presented to identify the flow modes and to understand the underlying mechanism of the cylinder drag reduction. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Development of an {{asymmetric}} {{axial piston}} pump for displacement-controlled system Jiahai Huang 1, 2, Hu Zhao 1, Long Quan 1, 2 and Xiaogang Zhang 1 Pump-controlled systems can eliminate throttling losses {{and improve the}} work efficiency of mobile hydraulic system. But one difficult problem for that is the differential volumetric flow through a single <b>rod</b> <b>cylinder</b> which is widely used in mobile hydraulic system. Several solutions have been presented {{to deal with it}} so far, but there still has not been a cost-effective solution to it. In recent years, an asymmetric pump-controlled asymmetric cylinder strategy has been presented to deal with this problem. In order to achieve this goal, an asymmetric axial piston pump with three ports was developed in this research. The flow rate ratio of the three ports of asymmetric axial piston pump was designed as 1 ::(1), in which was the area ratio of a single <b>rod</b> <b>cylinder.</b> An important task in the development of asymmetric axial piston pump was the design of the valve plate. There were three intake/discharge slots (slots A, B, and T) in the valve plate. The pumping dynamics of a fixed displacement asymmetric axial piston pump were investigated using software package ITI-SimulationX and the performances of its prototype were tested. Simulation and experimental results show that with careful design, a V-shaped cross-section groove at the leading side of slot T can effectively improve the performance of asymmetric axial piston pump, and delivery pressure performance of port B is better than that of port T. Therefore, port T should be linked with low-pressure sources such as accumulator, and port B can be connected to high pressure sources.

40|$|Pump-controlled {{hydraulic}} circuits {{are more}} efficient than valve-controlled circuits, as they eliminate the energy losses due to flow throttling in valves and require less cooling effort. Presently existing pump-controlled solutions for single <b>rod</b> <b>cylinders</b> encounter an undesirable performance during certain operating conditions. This paper investigates the performance issues in common pump-controlled circuits for the single rod actuators. Detailed analysis is conducted that identifies these regions in a load-velocity plane and the factors affecting them. The findings are validated by experimental results. A new design is then proposed that employs a limited throttling valve alongside two pilot operated check valves for differential flow compensation to improve the performance. The valve is of the flow control type and is chosen to have a throttling effect over critical regions; it has the least throttling over other operating regions, thus maintaining efficiency. Experimental work demonstrates improved performance in a full operating range of the actuator as compared to a circuit that uses only the pilot-operated check valves. This circuit is energy efficient and capable of recuperating energy...|$|R

The primary goal of this project was to design a robust mechanical system while reducing the complexity and thus overall cost of the solar trough assembly for the production line. The mechanism suggested in this thesis actuates both sides of the solar trough simultaneously, as well as exploit hydraulic cylinder's full range stroke in order to deliver +/- 110 ° rotational requirement. The rotational motion is achieved through a pulley and a wire rope system, actuated by a single, double action double <b>rod</b> <b>cylinder.</b> As this project funding was received from our sole sponsor, an Italian multinational energy company, during the design process the ultimate goal of eventual production line was kept in mind.
