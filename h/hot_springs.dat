5|$|Throughout its history, Banff National Park {{has been}} shaped by tension between {{conservationist}} and land exploitation interests. The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> Reserve, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> there and who {{had the right to}} develop the <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>springs</b> {{and other}} {{geothermal}} manifestations are widespread in Iran {{and using them}} to gain geothermal energy has been studied; {{according to a report}} of 2002 <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> at that time were mainly used for therapeutic purposes and bathing. A report in 2002 indicated that Taftan may be a feasible place to install a binary cycle power plant at Taftan.|$|E
5|$|In August 1886, Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan sent Company M, 1st U.S. Cavalry to the Park, {{where they}} {{established}} Camp Sheridan, named after General Sheridan, at Mammoth <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs.</b> Camp Sheridan consisted of {{an arrangement of}} temporary facilities {{at the base of}} Capitol Hill just east of the Mammoth <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> travertine terraces.

5|$|For centuries, {{the people}} of Iceland have used their <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> for bathing and washing clothes. The first use of {{geothermal}} energy for heating did not come until 1907 when a farmer ran a concrete pipe from a hot spring that led steam into his house. In 1930, the first pipeline was constructed in Reykjavík, and was used to heat two schools, 60 homes, and the main hospital. It was a 3km pipeline that ran {{from one of the}} <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> outside the city. In 1943, the first district heating company was started with the use of geothermal power. An 18km pipeline ran through the city of Reykjavík and by 1945 it was connected to over 2,850 homes.|$|E
5|$|Fort Yellowstone was a U.S. Army fort, {{established}} in 1891 at Mammoth <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> in Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone was designated in 1872 but the Interior Department {{was unable to}} effectively manage the park. Administration {{was transferred to the}} War Department in August 1886 and General Philip Sheridan sent a company of cavalry to Mammoth <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> to build a cavalry post. The army originally called the post Camp Sheridan in honor of General Sheridan but the name was changed to Fort Yellowstone in 1891 when construction of the permanent fort commenced. The army administered the park until 1918 when it was transferred to the newly created National Park Service. The facilities of Fort Yellowstone now comprise the Yellowstone National Park headquarters, the Horace Albright Visitor Center and staff accommodations.|$|E

5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> such as Mammoth <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>springs</b> {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. <b>Hot</b> <b>springs</b> comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>springs</b> {{have been}} used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times. The oldest known spa is a stone pool on China's Lisan {{mountain}} built in the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the Huaqing Chi palace was later built. In the first century AD, Romans conquered Aquae Sulis, now Bath, Somerset, England, and used the <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> there to feed public baths and underfloor heating. The admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal power. The world's oldest geothermal district heating system in Chaudes-Aigues, France, has been operating since the 14th century. The earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello, Italy.|$|E
5|$|The 1959 Hebgen Lake {{earthquake}} {{just west}} of Yellowstone at Hebgen Lake damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found, and many existing <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> became turbid. It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|Thermus aquaticus is a {{bacterium}} {{found in the}} Yellowstone <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating DNA {{as part of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E
