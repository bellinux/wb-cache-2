500|$|Speaking at an April 2008 {{event in}} New York, Byrne {{confirmed}} {{the release of}} a new album, calling it a [...] "record of sung songs" [...] in contrast to the experimental music from MyLifeintheBushofGhosts and later told the NewYorkDailyNews that [...] "Brian had written a lot of music, but needed some words, which <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> What's it sound like? Electronicgospel. That's all I'm saying." [...] Eno also explained the differences between this album and their previous one saying, [...] "his is quite different from MyLife in that the intention of that album was to not use our voices at all, but instead to find voices and stick them on to the music. This new one is different—these are songs written and sung by David... They go from electronic folkgospel to quite indefinable areas of music." ...|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the {{religious}} imagery was a calculated move by Gaga to create controversy. Simon Voxick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly felt that the move was calculated, saying, [...] "Gaga wants to offend people. She's a provocateur. Gaga would probably be disappointed if no one was offended by her latest video. She's doing that stuff for a reason." [...] He {{did not think that}} the risks were very original or as exciting as the ones in [...] "Telephone." [...] "The risks that she was taking [...] were easier targets [...] It's a little bit been there, done that," [...] he said. The New York Timess Jon Caramanica thought the controversy was Gaga's attempt to take the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] throne. He said, [...] ""I'm sure she'd say she loves Madonna ... but I also think she's saying, 'This [...] is mine.' And also, like, 'I'm murdering you with my own style. I've learned this. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this ... And look how flawlessly I do it.'" [...] He did feel, however, that the religious imagery was obvious and lazy: [...] "Even the worst provocation is going to succeed. She got what she wanted." [...] Singer Katy Perry took to her Twitter account and wrote, [...] "Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling fart jokes." [...] The Huffington Post ascertained that while Gaga had not been mentioned directly by name that it was definitely a slam by Perry towards Lady Gaga. In an interview on NRJ Radio's Le 6/9, Perry said that the tweet was not solely about Gaga, stating that it was based on her personal views of religion.|$|E

When I {{want to get}} away from hot weather <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. New York, sir, is the finest summer resort in the country. Keep in the shade and watch your diet, and don't get too far away from an electric fan. Talk about your Adirondacks and your Catskills! There's more solid comfort in the borough of Manhattan than in all the rest of the country together. No, siree! No tramping up perpendicular cliffs and being waked up at 4 in the morning by a million flies, and eating canned goods straight from the city for me. Little old New York will take a few select summer boarders; comforts and conveniences of homes--that's the ad. that I answer every time." ...|$|E

But if you had heard what that old woman said about young doctors, and you in particular, you would know that you wasn't goin' to have {{anything}} to do with this case--at least, you wouldn't show in it. But I've got no more time for talkin'. I came down here on business. When the old lady said, `Catherine, hold out your hand!' and she held it out, I had nothin' to do but step up and feel her pulse. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, for I have done a lot of nussin' in my life. And then it seemed nat'ral to ask her to put out her tongue, and when she did it I gave a look at it and nodded my head. `Do you think it is her brain?' said the old woman, half whisperin'. `Can't say anything about that yit,' said I. `I must go down-stairs and get the medicine-case. The fust thing to do is to give her a draught, and I will bring it up to her as soon as it is mixed.' You have got a pocket medicine-case with you, haven't you?" ...|$|E

60|$|Pshaw! I know another trick I'd {{like to work}} on him, and I almost {{regret that}} I {{did not do it}} at the moment I was captured. I could make him sick, what of his clutch on my collar. His fingers, tight-gripping, are buried inside my collar. My coat is tightly buttoned. Did you ever see a tourniquet? Well, this is one. All I {{have to do is to}} duck my head under his arm and begin to twist. I must twist rapidly--very rapidly. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it; {{twisting}} in a violent, jerky way, ducking my head under his arm with each revolution. Before he knows it, those detaining fingers of his will be detained. He will be unable to withdraw them. It is a powerful leverage. Twenty seconds after I have started revolving, the blood will be bursting out of his finger-ends, the delicate tendons will be rupturing, and all the muscles and nerves will be mashing and crushing together in a shrieking mass. Try it sometime when somebody has you by the collar. But be quick--quick as lightning. Also, be sure to hug yourself while you are revolving--hug your face with your left arm and your abdomen with your right. You see, the other fellow might try to stop you with a punch from his free arm. It would be a good idea, too, to revolve away from that free arm rather than toward it. A punch going is never so bad as a punch coming.|$|E
60|$|DEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 1st instant came to hand {{three or}} four days ago. When this shall reach you, you will have been Fanny's husband several days. You know my desire to befriend you is everlasting; that I will never cease while <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything. But you will always {{hereafter}} be on ground that I have never occupied, and consequently, if advice were needed, I might advise wrong. I do fondly hope, however, that you will never again need any comfort from abroad. But should I be mistaken in this, should excessive pleasure still be accompanied with a painful counterpart at times, still let me urge you, as I have ever done, to remember, in the depth and even agony of despondency, that very shortly you are to feel well again. I am now fully convinced that you love her as ardently as you are capable of loving. Your ever being happy in her presence, and your intense anxiety about her health, if there were nothing else, would place this beyond all dispute in my mind. I incline to think it probable that your nerves will fail you occasionally for a while; but once you get them firmly guarded now that trouble is over forever. I think, if I were you, in case my mind were not exactly right, I would avoid being idle. I would immediately engage in some business, or go to making preparations for it, which would be the same thing. If you went through the ceremony calmly, or even with sufficient composure not to excite alarm in any present, you are safe beyond question, and in two or three months, to say the most, will be the happiest of men.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was after}} she had begun her {{statement}} of her own idea about Kate that he began, on his side, to reflect that--with her manner of offering it as really sufficient if {{he would take the}} trouble to embrace--it she couldn't half hate him. That was all, positively, she seemed to show herself for the time as attempting; clearly, if she did her intention justice, she would have nothing more disagreeable to do. [...] "If I hadn't been ready to go very much further, you understand, I wouldn't have gone so far. I don't care what you repeat to her--the more you repeat to her, perhaps the better; and, at any rate, there's nothing she doesn't already know. I don't say it for her; I say it for you--when I want to reach my niece <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it straight." [...] So Aunt Maud delivered herself--as with homely benevolence, in the simplest, but the clearest terms; virtually conveying that, though a word to the wise was, doubtless, in spite of the advantage, not always enough, a word to the good could never fail to be. The sense our young man read into her words was that she liked him because he was good--was really, by her measure, good enough: good enough, that is, to give up her niece for her and go his way in peace. But was he good enough--by his own measure? He fairly wondered, while she more fully expressed herself, if it might be his doom to prove so. [...] "She's the finest possible creature--of course you flatter yourself that you know it. But I know it, quite as well as you possibly can--by which I mean a good deal better yet; and the tune to which I'm ready to prove my faith compares favourably enough, I think, with anything you can do. I don't say it because she's my niece--that's nothing to me: I might have had fifty nieces, and I wouldn't have brought one of them to this place if I hadn't found her to my taste. I don't say I wouldn't have done something else, but I wouldn't have put up with her presence. Kate's presence, by good fortune, I marked early; Kate's presence--unluckily for you--is everything I could possibly wish; Kate's presence is, in short, as fine as you know, and I've been keeping it for the comfort of my declining years. I've watched it long; I've been saving it up and letting it, as you say of investments, appreciate, and you may judge whether, now it has begun to pay so, I'm likely to consent to treat for it with any but a high bidder. I can do the best with her, and I've my idea of the best." ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{the set of}} The Train Robbers, in June 1972, he told Nancy Anderson of Copley News Service {{that winning}} the Oscar for The Last Picture Show {{was not going to}} change him and he would not raise his salary request to studios because of it.

5000|$|It's {{a really}} rich period in history, where this giant {{opposition}} we had going for 10 {{years with the}} Nazis is gone, and we're not completely positive what the rules are anymore.
