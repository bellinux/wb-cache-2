5|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million {{years ago in the}} Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family <b>Gavialidae).</b> Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E
500|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of crocodilians {{has been the}} subject of debate and conflicting results. Many studies and their resulting cladograms, or [...] "family trees" [...] of crocodilians, have found the [...] "short-snouted" [...] families of Crocodylidae and Alligatoridae to be close relatives, with the long-snouted <b>Gavialidae</b> as a divergent branch of the tree. The resulting group of short-snouted species, name Brevirostres, was supported mainly by studies which analyzed skeletal features alone.|$|E
2500|$|Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true {{crocodiles}} are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of {{whose members are}} considered {{true crocodiles}}, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader {{sense of the term}} crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes Tomistoma, is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies to only the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes [...] the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family <b>Gavialidae),</b> and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.|$|E
2500|$|Tomistomines {{have been}} {{traditionally}} classified as crocodiles. However, molecular {{analyses of the}} false gharial, the only living tomistomine, suggest that the subfamily is actually within <b>Gavialidae</b> (along with the modern gharial of the subfamily Gavialinae) rather than Crocodylinae. The [...] presence of a prominent crista that runs along the postorbital in Eogavialis testifies to its position as a gavialid. Other characteristics such as a rectangular skull table, subcircular orbits with everted orbital rims, and a constricted antorbital area are also shared with Eogavialis and other modern gavialids, as seen in a well preserved skull of E. africanum housed at Yale (YPM 6263) and material from Kenya of E. andrewsi.|$|E
50|$|Gavialoidea {{contains}} the family <b>Gavialidae</b> and several more basal extinct forms such as Thoracosaurus and Eosuchus. Within <b>Gavialidae</b> are two subfamilies: Gavialinae, {{which includes the}} living gharial, and Gryposuchinae, which includes several extinct forms such as Gryposuchus and Aktiogavialis.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the three}} {{surviving}} groups of crocodilians {{are regarded as}} separate families, then the gharial becomes one of {{two members of the}} <b>Gavialidae,</b> which is related to the families Crocodylidae (crocodiles) and Alligatoridae (alligators and caimans).|$|E
50|$|<b>Gavialidae</b> is {{a family}} of {{reptiles}} within the order Crocodilia. <b>Gavialidae</b> have conventionally consisted of only one surviving species, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), which is native to India and Nepal. Many extinct species are also known. The false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) has usually been {{thought to be a}} member of the family Crocodylidae based on several characters including skull morphology, but has sometimes been viewed as a member of this family due to general similarities in morphology and habit. However, numerous molecular studies have consistently shown the two species to be very closely related, supporting the view that they are in the same family.|$|E
50|$|The Crocodylidae {{family of}} crocodylians {{includes}} the true crocodiles {{which are the}} members of the subfamily Crocodylinae and the Tomistoma genus. Currently, the family includes two subfamilies, Crocodylinae and Tomistominae, with the latter being a subject of controversy whether it is a crocodile or belongs to the family <b>Gavialidae.</b> Further genetic analysis has to be done to come to a final conclusion.|$|E
50|$|Hua and Jouve {{performed}} a cladistic analysis incorporating their new taxon, and found Argochampsa to be a gavialoid, but {{outside of the}} clade <b>Gavialidae.</b> They noted that the snout shape of Argochampsa is unusual among crocodilians, with only pholidosaurids and Terminonaris having similarly shaped snout tips, and suggested that this layout may have facilitated precise occlusion. Argochampsa lived in an environment otherwise dominated by dyrosaurid marine crocodyliforms.|$|E
50|$|According to {{molecular}} genetic {{studies the}} gharial and the false gharial (Tomistoma) are close relatives, which would support {{to place them}} in the same family. Furthermore, molecular studies consistently and unambiguously show the <b>Gavialidae</b> to be a sister group of the Crocodylidae to the exclusion of Alligatoridae, rendering Brevirostres paraphyletic and Gavialoidea perhaps polyphyletic. The clade including crocodiles and gharials has been suggested to be called Longirostres.|$|E

50|$|Piscogavialis {{is known}} {{only from a}} single specimen, but it {{represents}} {{some of the best}} preserved gavialid material known from South America. The skull is preserved in three dimensions and is nearly complete. A mandible and some postcranial material have also been found in association with the skull. Several important features of the occipital region of the skull support a referral to the family <b>Gavialidae,</b> which also includes the extant gharial and false gharial.|$|E
50|$|The two extant genera of true crocodiles, Crocodylus and Osteolaemus, {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Crocodylinae. Even {{according to}} traditional classification, the Tomistoma is not a true crocodile, {{though it is a}} member of the family Crocodylidae. Latest molecular evidence points to an even greater difference, creating the possibility that in fact Tomistoma is genetically closer to the gharial than true crocodiles. If proven, the species will be classified under the family <b>Gavialidae.</b>|$|E
50|$|The gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), {{also known}} as the gavial, and the {{fish-eating}} crocodile, is a crocodilian of the family <b>Gavialidae,</b> native to {{the northern part of the}} Indian Subcontinent. The global wild gharial population is estimated at fewer than 235 individuals, which are threatened by loss of riverine habitat, depletion of fish resources, and entanglement in fishing nets. As the population has declined drastically in the past 70 years, the gharial is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the gharial, {{the false}} gharial's snout {{broadens}} considerably towards {{the base and}} so is considerably more {{similar to those of}} true crocodiles than the gharial, whose osteology indicates a distinct lineage from all other living crocodilians. However, preliminary nuclear genetic sequences may indicate the gharial and false gharial had a shared ancestor at some point in prehistory. Other molecular studies have similarly indicated that it is the nearest relative (the sister taxon) of the gharial. Along with close fossil relatives, such as Maroccosuchus, it is thus increasingly classed in the family <b>Gavialidae.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{morphological}} analyses, extant {{members of}} the orderCrocodylia are divided into three families, Alligatoridae, Crocodylidae, and <b>Gavialidae.</b> <b>Gavialidae</b> includes one species, the gharial, Gavialis gangeticus. In this study we have examined crocodilian relationships in phylogenetic analyses of seven mito-chondrial genomes that have been sequenced in their entirety. The analyses {{did not support the}} morpho-logically acknowledged separate position of the gharial in the crocodilian tree. Instead the gharial joined the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch that was shown to constitute a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae (less Tomistoma). Thus, the analyses suggest the recognition of only two Croco-dylia families, Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae, with the latter encompassing traditional Crocodylidae plus Gavialis/Tomistoma. A molecular dating of the diver-gence between Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae sug-gests that this basal split among recent crocodilians took place 140 million years before present, at the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary. The results suggest that at least five crocodilian lineages survived the mass extinction at the KT boundary...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{observations}} on methacholine-stimulated secretion by lingual salt glands in populations of Crocodylus porosus living in salt and brackish water and C. johnstoni living in fresh and salt water confirm {{the usefulness of}} methacholine injection as a technique for inferring salt gland capability in crocodilians. Observations on twelve species of the Family Crocodylidae from Asia, Africa, Australia and North America confirm the presence of lingual salt glands throughout all the Sub-family Crocodylinae yet examined, and their absence from the Sub-family Alligatorinae. They appear to be lacking in the Family <b>Gavialidae.</b> Data on secretion by Tomistoma schlegelii (Tomistominae) is lacking but gross morphology suggests that it has functional salt glands. Coupled with biochemical evidence which suggests a comparatively recent Tertiary radiation of the Crocodylinae, the data support the argument that, contrary to currently accepted views, the Crocodylinae have a marine ancestry from which {{there has been a}} radiation into fresh water habitats throughout the tropics...|$|E
40|$|Crocodilian is {{a common}} name used to refer broadly to crocodiles, alligators, caimans and gavials. All of them belong to the Order Crocodylia. These animals are {{widespread}} occupants of aquatic environments in tropics and subtropics, with a few species reaching into the warm temperate zones. They are prominent animals due to their large size and, in some situations, ferocity. Ecologically they are considered as key species, {{in the top of}} the food web of the ecosystems they occupy. There are 23 extant crocodilians, grouped in three families (or sub-families according to some) : The <b>Gavialidae,</b> with only one species (Gavialis gangeticus); the Alligatoridae, with eight species, seven of them found in America and one in China; the Crocodylidae, of pantropical distribution, with 14 species (King and Burke 1997). The American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and the Orinoco crocodile (C. intermedius) are two of the four species of crocodilians found in the Neotropics. These are species of contrasting historical distribution. The former is restricted to the lowlands of the Orinoco River drainage in Colombia and Venezuela, whereas the American crocodile is widely distributed and is found in rivers, coastal and lowlan...|$|E
