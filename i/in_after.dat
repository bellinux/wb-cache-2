5|$|A {{native of}} {{what would become the}} {{province}} of Ontario, May moved to Manitoba soon after completing education in his hometown. In Manitoba, he would take to briefly farming, before entering into the construction industry, which he would establish prominence <b>in.</b> <b>After</b> doing work for the railway, he would move to Winnipeg where he would join a contracting firm and become involved in the construction of many buildings. After moving west and living briefly in Carberry, Manitoba, May came to Edmonton in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of Yao's sophomore season, Rockets' head coach Rudy Tomjanovich {{resigned}} because of health issues, and long-time New York Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy was brought <b>in.</b> <b>After</b> Van Gundy began focusing the offense on Yao, Yao averaged career highs in points and rebounds for the season, and had a career-high 41points and 7assists in a triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks in February 2004. He was also voted to be the starting center for the Western Conference in the 2004 NBA All-Star Game {{for the second straight}} year. Yao finished the season averaging 17.5 points and 9.0 rebounds a game. The Rockets made the playoffs {{for the first time in}} Yao's career, claiming the seventh seed in the Western Conference. In the first round, however, the Los Angeles Lakers eliminated Houston in five games. Yao averaged 15.0 points and 7.4 rebounds in his first playoff series.|$|E
5|$|Bradford {{opened the}} scoring after only eight {{minutes of the}} match through teenage {{hometown}} midfielder Hamilton. A long pass from Huxford down the right flank was headed by Shutt into Hamilton's path. He beat three defenders and, despite the fact he was stumbling, shot past Notts County goalkeeper Ward, with the ball going <b>in</b> <b>after</b> hitting the crossbar. It had been Bradford's first shot of the game. Steve Finnan had County's first chance after 14 minutes but shot straight at Bradford keeper Jonathan Gould. Minutes later, City had two successive chances through Shutt and Youds, but the first was blocked and the second went wide. During this spell of play, County's two central defenders Murphy and Gary Strodder both received yellow cards. Just before half-time, Shutt {{had the chance to}} double City's lead but his weak shot hit Ward's ankles after good work by Kiwomya.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to these}} losses, the {{battalion}} {{did not return}} to the front until July 1944. It subsequently took part in the Allied advance towards Florence and {{is believed to have been}} first to reach the city on 4 August. During this time Major Arapeta Awatere led the battalion as its acting commanding officer after Young was hospitalised with jaundice, although he returned in late August and subsequently led them through the fighting around Rimini in September. In November, Awatere took over command substantively, and in December the battalion launched an attack around Faenza, for which its commanding officer later received a Distinguished Service Order. The winter snow set <b>in</b> <b>after</b> this and, as Allied attentions were temporarily focused elsewhere, offensive action died down. Thus, throughout January, February and into March the battalion undertook defensive duties, before being withdrawn from the line in mid-March.|$|E
5|$|During the winter, {{they played}} for the Fitzroy Baseball Club, often {{competing}} in matches played as curtain raisers to the elite Australian rules football competition, the Victorian Football League. Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day's cricket for Fitzroy, and Plant, Liddicut and other club personnel were often invited. Under the influence of Plant and Liddicut, the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach, using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular. In 1942–43, Neil broke into Fitzroy's First XI, joining his older brothers Merv, Mick, and Ray. During that season, the family held down the first four batting positions for Fitzroy; Merv and Mick opened the batting and Ray and Neil came <b>in</b> <b>after</b> them. The four brothers entered the Victorian team in the 1940s; Merv in 1940–41, Neil in 1946–47, and Ray and Mick in successive seasons thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished Thror's map to be tipped in (that is, glued <b>in</b> <b>after</b> {{the book has}} been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held up to the light. In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E

5|$|Following Charan Singh's resignation, Reddy summoned Chandrashekhar and Jagjivan Ram to Rashtrapati Bhavan to {{look into}} the {{possibility}} of forming an alternate government. Reddy, convinced {{that they would not be}} able to form one, accepted Singh's advice and dissolved Lok Sabha, calling for a mid term election. Singh was asked to continue as the caretaker prime minister till a new government was sworn <b>in</b> <b>after</b> the election. Reddy's decision was met with angry denunciations and protests by members of the Janata Party who even threatened to have him impeached. Although heading a caretaker government, Singh proposed as many as seven ordinances on a broad range of matters from effecting changes in company law, providing state funding of elections and reservation of jobs for the backward classes. Reddy however refused to promulgate the ordinances arguing that such momentous changes could not be made by a caretaker government.|$|E
5|$|Following the incident, the {{government}} offered dialogue which the opposition {{said they will}} only take part <b>in</b> <b>after</b> {{the withdrawal of the}} army. The general labor union called for a general strike. Internationally, the attack on protesters was condemned by Barack Obama and Human Rights Watch. High Representative of European Union expressed her deep concerns and called for restrain and immediate dialogue. Britain revoked over forty arms licenses to Bahrain after an earlier announcement that it would review them and German president canceled a planned visit to the country. Buhmaid is remembered by the opposition as a martyr, leader and symbol of peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire found itself <b>in</b> <b>after</b> it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs {{in the event of}} a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and it was hoped that Britain would come to fulfill this same role.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's {{performances}} were rewarded with selection for an Australian XI in a tour match against the England cricket {{team at the}} start of the 1954–55 season. However, the match was curtailed by rain and Harvey was not able to exhibit his talents on a sticky wicket highly difficult for batting. Listed at No. 4, Harvey came <b>in</b> <b>after</b> the dismissal of his brother and made seven in his only innings. As a result, Ray was not chosen for the Test team alongside his brother during the season.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} {{pledge not to}} run for re-election, retired {{to his home in}} Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set <b>in</b> <b>after</b> Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{arrive at}} the school during the school-dance to steal the grease in the school's kitchen which Bart told him about.

Homer tries to escape, but Willie grabs his legs and strangles him with the hose sucking the grease, which explodes due to the increased pressure, causing the grease to flood into the dance hall.

5|$|In 1163, a {{conflict}} arose between {{the king and}} the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, over {{the rights of the}} king in the English church. At a council held at Westminster in October 1163, the king and Becket contended over the question, with the bishops supporting Becket against the king. Robert was involved in the conflict not only as a bishop-elect, but as an envoy to Becket from the pope, as he accompanied Philip of Aumone, a French abbot, who was sent by Alexander to Becket <b>in</b> <b>after</b> the Council of Westminster to urge Becket not to inflame the situation. Robert went with Philip, probably because it was hoped {{he would be able to}} influence Becket.|$|E

Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case.

5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it. At Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble {{discovered}} what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska. Gold extraction was slow, because almost no heavy machinery was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley. By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley.
