5|$|Anhingas, {{also known}} as darters or snakebirds, are cormorant-like water birds with long necks and long, {{straight}} beaks. They are fish eaters, <b>diving</b> <b>for</b> long periods, and often swim with only their neck above the water, looking rather like a water snake.|$|E
5|$|Night diving {{can allow}} the diver to {{experience}} a different underwater environment, because many marine animals are nocturnal. Altitude <b>diving,</b> <b>for</b> example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure.|$|E

5000|$|New Zealand {{fur seals}} [...] "porpoise" [...] {{out of the}} water when {{traveling}} quickly at sea. They can dive deeper and longer than any other fur seal. Females can <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> about 9 minutes and to a depth of about 312 meters, and can dive deeper and longer in autumn and winter. Males can <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> about 15 minutes to a depth of about 380 meters. On average New Zealand fur seals only <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> 1-2 minutes. When they <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> food they <b>dive</b> deeper during the day but shallower at night, because during the day their prey typically migrates to deeper depths and migrates back up during the night.|$|R

5|$|Recreational diving (sometimes called sport diving or subaquatics) is {{a popular}} leisure activity. Technical diving {{is a form of}} {{recreational}} diving under especially challenging conditions. Professional diving (commercial diving, <b>diving</b> <b>for</b> research purposes, or for financial gain) involve working underwater. Public safety diving is the underwater work done by law enforcement, fire rescue, and underwater search and recovery dive teams. Military diving includes combat diving, clearance diving and ships husbandry.|$|E
5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when <b>diving</b> <b>for</b> food.|$|E

5|$|The College {{has been}} a member of the Independent Girls' Schools Sporting Association (IGSSA) since its {{foundation}} in 1922, and through this association senior students compete against 27 other girls' schools in graded weekend sports and carnivals. Sports available to students through IGSSA include swimming, diving, rowing, cross country, athletics, gymnastics, softball, tennis, basketball, soccer, Field hockey, netball, cricket and water polo. The College also offers sports such as skiing, snowboarding, equestrian and badminton through other competitions. In 2007 PLC won three IGSSA carnival premierships: in <b>diving</b> (<b>for</b> the ninth consecutive year), swimming, and gymnastics.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before <b>diving</b> <b>for</b> a few minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They {{are capable of}} diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are {{to a depth of}} 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.|$|E
5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and <b>diving</b> <b>for</b> several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E

5|$|Pursuit diving exerts greater {{pressures}} (both evolutionary and physiological) on seabirds, but {{the reward}} {{is a greater}} area in which to feed than is available to surface feeders. Propulsion underwater can be provided by wings (as used by penguins, auks, diving petrels and some other species of petrel) or feet (as used by cormorants, grebes, loons and several types of fish-eating ducks). Wing-propelled divers are generally faster than foot-propelled divers. In both cases, the use of wings or feet for diving has limited their utility in other situations: loons and grebes walk with extreme difficulty (if at all), penguins cannot fly, and auks have sacrificed flight efficiency in favour of underwater <b>diving.</b> <b>For</b> example, the razorbill (an Atlantic auk) requires 64% more energy to fly than a petrel of equivalent size. Many shearwaters are intermediate between the two, having longer wings than typical wing-propelled divers but heavier wing loadings than the other surface-feeding procellariids, leaving them capable of diving to considerable depths while still being efficient long-distance travellers. The deepest diving exhibited by shearwaters {{is found in the}} short-tailed shearwater, which has been recorded diving below 70m. Some albatross species are also capable of limited diving, with light-mantled sooty albatrosses holding the record at 12m. Of all the wing-propelled pursuit divers, the most efficient in the air are the albatrosses, and they are also the poorest divers. This is the dominant guild in polar and subpolar environments, as it is energetically inefficient in warmer waters. With their poor flying ability, many wing-propelled pursuit divers are more limited in their foraging range than other guilds, especially during the breeding season when hungry chicks need regular feeding.|$|E
