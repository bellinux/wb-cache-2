40|$|Cloud {{data sets}} {{compiled}} from surface observations {{were used to}} develop an algorithm for incorporating multiple cloud layers into a multiple-scattering radiative transfer model. Aerosol extinction and ozone data sets were also incorporated to estimate the seasonally averaged ultraviolet (UV) flux reaching {{the surface of the}} Earth in the Detroit, Michigan, region for the years 1979 - 1991, corresponding to Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) version 6 ozone observations. The calculated UV spectrum was convolved with an <b>erythema</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> to estimate the effective biological exposure for erythema. Calculations show that decreasing the total column density of ozone by 1 % leads to an increase in erythemal exposure by approximately 1. 1 - 1. 3 %, in good agreement with previous studies. A comparison of the UV radiation budget at the surface between a single cloud layer method and a multiple cloud layer method presented here is discussed, along with limitations of each technique. With improved parameterization of cloud properties, and as knowledge of biological effects of UV exposure increase, inclusion of multiple cloud layers may be important in accurately determining the biologically effective UV budget at the surface of the Earth...|$|E

The thesis includes three studies: 1. The validation of a semi-automated Minimal Phototoxic Dose (MPD) Tester for topical photochemotherapy Thirty seven psoriasis patients referred to the phototherapy unit at St. Woolos, Newport were recruited. Patients had two sets of minimal phototoxic dose (MPD) tests performed on symmetrical, contralateral sites on the lower back. MPD test results from a panel of PUVA-lamps with a UV-opaque template and windows were compared to those from the modified hand-held MPD tester. The hand-held MPD results were linearly related to the PUVA-panel MPD results and this was therefore {{shown to be a}} convenient and reliable method of assessing MPD. However, the difference in MPD between the PUVA lamp and the modified handheld MPD tester (CFL TL- 10 lamp) was much less than predicted from the PUVA action spectrum of previously published studies suggesting that formal re-evaluation of the <b>erythema</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for PUVA was now appropriate...|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} (UVR) is {{hazardous to}} patients with photosensitive skin disorders, such as lupus erythematosus, xeroderma pigmentosum and skin cancer. As such, these patients are advised to minimize their exposure to UVR. Classically, this is accomplished through careful avoidance of sun exposure and artificial tanning booths. Indoor light bulbs, however, are generally not considered to pose significant UVR hazard. We sought to test this notion by measuring the UV emissions of 19 different compact fluorescent light bulbs. The ability to induce skin damage was assessed with the CIE <b>erythema</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectrum,</b> ANSI S(λ) generalized UV hazard spectrum and the CIE photocarcinogenesis action spectrum. The results indicate {{that there is a}} great deal of variation amongst different bulbs, even within the same class. Although the irradiance of any given bulb is low, the possible daily exposure time is rather lengthy. This results in potential daily UVR doses ranging from 0. 1 to 625 mJ cm− 2, including a daily UVB (290 – 320 nm) dose of 0. 01 to 15 mJ cm− 2. Because patients are exposed continually over long time frames, this could lead to significant cumulative damage. It would therefore be prudent for patients to use bulbs with the lowest UV irradiance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Volcanic eruptions can inject {{large amounts}} of aerosol into the atmosphere, and, at large solar zenith angles, {{scattering}} by these aerosols can actually increase the flux of UV-B (290 - 320 nm) radiation reaching the surface. This is surprising since aerosols increase the reflection of sunlight to space. As previous explanations of this phenomenon are heuristic and incomplete, we first provide a rigorous and complete explanation of how this surprising effect occurs. This phenomenon makes Antarctica during spring the most susceptible place on Earth to the scattering effect of volcanic aerosols, due to the combined effect of the spring ozone hole and the large solar zenith angles characteristic of this time of year. We show that an aerosol layer lying above Antarctica during spring will decrease the integrated aily dose of biologically weighted irradiance, weighted by the <b>erythema</b> <b>action</b> <b>spectrum,</b> by only up to 5 %. Hence the effects of any significant destruction of ozone induced by volcanic aerosols will not be offset by aerosol scattering. Thus after a volcanic eruption, life in Antarctica during spring will suffer the combined effects of the spring ozone hole and ozone destruction induced by volcanic aerosols, with the latter effect only slightly offset by aerosol scattering...|$|E
40|$|To measure {{erythemogenic}} UV radiation in Iceland. Material and methods: Erythemogenic UV radiation {{was measured}} {{during the period}} from April through September 2010. We used a UV sensor that measures the <b>Erythema</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Spectrum</b> as has been defined by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) as the standard representation of the average skin response to UVB and UVA. The sensor was located in Skorradalur, Iceland (64, 533287 N; - 21, 526338 W; altitude 63 m.). The location of the sensor was carefully chosen to ensure that it was never in the shade. The maximum UV-index measured was higher than three 21 days in May, 26 days in June, 26 days in July and 23 days in August. The highest value recorded was 7, 3 on June 18 th, at 13 : 25. UV index was measured as 5 or higher on 16 days in June. The highest erythema weighted daily dose was measured to 19, 2 SED in April, 27, 1 SED in May, 32, 2 SED in June, 30 SED in July, 23, 5 SED in August and 11, 6 SED in September. These are the first results from measurements of UV-index and standard erythema dose (SED) in Iceland. The data shows that on a sunny day the UV-index can be relatively high. When the standard erythema dose was considered, high values were obtained during the summer months, with values up to six times what can cause sunburn.

40|$|<b>Action</b> <b>spectra</b> for the {{assimilation}} of nitrate and nitrite have been obtained for several blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) with different accessory pigment composition. The <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> for both nitrate and nitrite utilization by nitrate-grown Anacystis nidulans L- 1402 - 1 cells exhibited a clear peak at about 620 nanometers, corresponding to photosystem II (PSII) C-phycocyanin absorption, the contribution of chlorophyll a (Chl a) being barely detectable. The <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for nitrate reduction by a nitrite reductase mutant of A. nidulans R 2 was very similar. All these <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> resemble the fluorescence excitation spectrum of cell suspensions of the microalgae monitored at 685 nanometers—the fluorescence band of Chl a in PSII. In contrast, the <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for nitrite utilization by nitrogen-starved A. nidulans cells, which are depleted of C-phycocyanin, showed a maximum near 680 nanometers, attributable to Chl a absorption. The <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for nitrite utilization by Calothrix sp.

The <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for the preillumination phase of potentiation, during which preillumination followed by a dark period brings about lag elimination in chlorophyll synthesis when the cells are subsequently exposed to postilluminating light, shows a high peak in the blue region (at about 433 nm) with a small peak in the yellow-orange region (at about 597 nm); the postillumination phase yields an <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{very similar to that}} obtained for chlorophyll synthesis in continuous light in normal, unpotentiated cells, with peaks at 433 and 631 nm.

40|$|Many solar UV measurements, either {{terrestrial}} or personal, weight the {{raw data}} by the erythemal <b>action</b> <b>spectrum.</b> However, a problem arises when one tries to estimate the benefit of vitamin D(3) production based on erythemally weighted outdoor doses, like those measured by calibrated R-B meters or polysulphone badges, because the differences between <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> give dissimilar values. While both <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> peak in the UVB region, the erythemal <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> continues throughout the UVA region while the previtamin D(3) <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> stops near that boundary. When one uses the previtamin D(3) <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> to weight the solar spectra (D(eff)), one gets a different contribution in W m(- 2) than what the erythemally weighted data predicts (E(eff)). Thus, to do proper benefit assessments, one must incorporate <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> conversion factors (ASCF) into the calculations to change erythemally weighted to previtamin D(3) -weighted doses.

The desensitizing effects of backgrounds of different wavelengths were measured and the background irradiance needed to desensitize the cone {{by a factor of}} 10 (1 log unit) was defined as threshold. The reciprocals of these thresholds were used to construct the field sensitivity <b>action</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The field sensitivity <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> of long-wavelength-sensitive (L) and medium-wavelength-sensitive (M) cones depended upon the wavelength of the test flash used to measure them. This excludes the possibility that turtle cones can function as single-colour mechanisms in the Stiles sense. In fourteen L-cones, the average wavelength of peak sensitivity of the field sensitivity <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> was 613. 7 ± 7. 7 nm for the 500 nm test and 635. 6 ± 9. 6 nm for the 700 nm test.

Two physiological mechanisms are suggested as contributing to the dependency of the field sensitivity <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> upon test wavelength.

40|$|An <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{for growth}} delay induced in Escherichia coli B/r by far-ultraviolet {{radiation}} (230 to 295 nm) was obtained. It resembles the <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for killing {{obtained in the}} same experiments, indicating that the chromophore for growth delay is probably {{the same as the}} chromophore for killing. Another <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for killing, obtained under conditions more suitable for chromophore identification, suggests that nucleic acid, either deoxyribonucleic acid or ribonucleic acid, is the chromophore for growth delay induced by far ultraviolet. Isoprenoid quinones, which seem to be important chromophores for growth delay induced by near-ultraviolet radiation (above 300 nm), appear to play a negligible role in growth delay induced by wavelengths below 300 nm...|$|R
40|$|An <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> was {{determined}} for the photoinduced formation of perithecia in a homothallic strain of Nectria haematococca Berk. and Br. var. cucurbitae (Snyder and Hansen) Dingley. Dose-response curves for perithecial formation {{were obtained from}} 340 to 510 nanometers at 10 -nanometer intervals. Radiation longer than 510 nanometers was not effective for inducing perithecial formation. The <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> indicated peaks of activity near 360, 440, and 480 nanometers with shoulders near 420 and 460 nanometers. Minima occurred near 350 nanometers, 390 to 410 nanometers, and 470 nanometers. The general shape of this <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> appears {{to be similar to}} those obtained for many different near ultraviolet-blue-sensitive organisms in which a flavoprotein molecule was postulated to be the photoreceptor...|$|R
40|$|An <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> was {{measured}} for photoinduction of colored carotenoids in dark-grown, early stationary-phase cells of Myxococcus xanthus. Maximum activity {{was observed at}} 405 to 410 nm with subsidiary maxima at 512, 533, 548, 585, and 635 nm. These maxima correspond closely in position and magnitude with absorption maxima of protoporphyrin IX, which had previously been isolated from M. xanthus cells and had been shown to increase during the stationary phase of the culture. Late stationary-phase, dark-grown cells undergo photolysis which had {{been shown to have}} an <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> resembling the absorption spectrum of protoporphyrin IX. The similarity of the <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> of photolysis and photoinduced carotenogenesis in M. xanthus and of other photoinduced biological phenomena is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{monochromator}} the <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for ultraviolet phototherapy of psoriasis {{was determined}} for radiation between 254 and 313 nm and {{compared to the}} <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> for <b>erythema</b> of uninvolved adjacent skin. Daily exposures of different doses of 254, 280, 290, 296, 300, 304 and 313 nm radiation were observed. Wavelengths of 254, 280, and 290 nm were erythemogenic but not therapeutic even at 10 to 50 times the minimal erythema dose. At the other wavelengths studied, the 2 <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> were similar. In general, fixed daily doses cleared at lower cumulative dose than did incrementally increased daily doses. The small number of suberythemogenic exposure doses required suggests that monochromatic radiation may have advantages over broadband sources...|$|R
40|$|The <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the {{positive}} topo-phototaxis in Cryptomonas was determined by photometry {{in the region of}} 400 to 680 nm at a stimulus intensity of 8. 3 × 10 − 11 Einsteins cm− 2 sec− 1. The <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> had a main peak at about 560 nm unlike peaks for most other flagellated algae. Blue light was not very effective and red light above 640 nm had not effect. Swimming rates of individual organisms were measured by dark field photomicrography. We concluded that the photokinetic effect was negligible. Among the component pigments of this alga, phycoerythrin had an absorption spectrum whose main peak appeared to coincide with that of the phototactic <b>action</b> <b>spectrum...</b>|$|R
