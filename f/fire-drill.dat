60|$|Day after day, as we sailed on, reminiscences of {{the same}} sort crowded thicker and thicker upon me. Never reminiscences of my later life, but always early scenes brought up by {{distinct}} suggestion of that Australian voyage. When we passed a ship, it burst upon me how we'd passed such ships before: when there was <b>fire-drill</b> on deck, I remembered having assisted years earlier at just such <b>fire-drill.</b> The whole past came back like a dream, so that I could reconstruct now the first {{five or six years}} of my life almost entirely. And yet, even so there was a gap, a puzzle, a difficulty somehow. I couldn't make the chronology of this slow-returning memory fit in as it ought with the chronology of the facts given to me by Aunt Emma and the Moores of Torquay. There was a constant discrepancy. It seemed to me that I must be a year or two older at least than they made me out. I remembered the voyage home far too well for my age. I fancied I went back further in my Australian recollections than would be possible from the dates Aunt Emma assigned me.|$|E
60|$|All my toils {{and devices}} led to her; all my far visions saw {{her at the}} end. When I made the <b>fire-drill</b> and fire-socket, it was for her. It was for her, {{although}} I did not know it, that I put the stake in the pit for old Sabre-Tooth, tamed the horse, slew the mammoth, and herded my reindeer south {{in advance of the}} ice-sheet. For her I harvested the wild rice, tamed the barley, the wheat, and the corn.|$|E

I know every rope on a merchantman, kin name 'em from fore royal stay to topping lift, but that ain't the {{hundredth}} part on it. We've got to learn our vessel jest as a person has got {{to learn a new}} city and its streets, fer boats ain't built one like another, not by a jugful! And after we have learned the ship, we've got to learn the guns, and the <b>fire-drill,</b> and how to clear ship for action, and a lot more, not to say a word about learning how to knock out them Dons, as some calls 'em. Oh, we'll have our hands full after we get on board, don't forget it!" [...] And Si Doring shook his head vigorously.|$|E
5000|$|These objects have {{received}} little study, perhaps because edged tools and weapons have more intrinsic interest to private collectors, but closer study {{of them might}} reveal something of domestic practices and toolmaking technology. There is no agreement upon their purpose or purposes, which may have included the processing of food, medicine or pigments, storage, arrow-production or <b>fire-drilling.</b> As such, they could represent a primitive form of mortar and pestle. The age of these man-made structures are difficult to ascertain, but generally they {{are believed to have}} been produced in the bronze-age and Upper Paleolithic although some, for example in North America and Europe, were generated at a later date.|$|R
40|$|The recent loss {{of lives}} and traffic jams (Figure 1) {{for tens of}} miles as hurricanes Rita and Katrina {{approached}} the Gulf coast demonstrate the enormous difficulty in evacuating urban areas [6]. Besides hurricanes, evacuation may be necessary due to other potential disasters, e. g., fire, terrorism, and nuclear or chemical plant accidents. Thus, the local emergency management community engages in evacuation route planning and required drills, e. g., <b>fire-drills</b> in schools and large office buildings. Figure 1 : Hurricane Rita Evacuation (Best viewed in color), Source: National Weather Service, Dallas News. During emergency evacuation, transportation scientists, first responders and other stakeholders pose many questions requiring spatio-temporal computations, e. g., what are the best routes (or transportation modes, shelters, timeslots) to evacuate affected locations? How many evacuees are likely to use each route, shelter, and logistics facility? Challenges arise due to violation of key assumptions behind transportation planning tools, e. g. microscopic traffic simulators, and popular shortest path algorithms. For example, transportation planning tools (e. g. DYNASMART, TRANSIM) rely on game-theory-based Wardrop equilibrium [9] among selfish commuters, who may change routes between trips to/from work. However, evacuation traffic may not exhibit such behavior. In addition, common shortest path algorithms (e. g. Dijktra's, A*) are based on dynamic programming and thus assume a stationary ranking o...|$|R
60|$|This much {{being said}} as to incurable vice of method, {{and there are}} fervent disciples of Rousseau now living who will regard one's craving for method in talking about men as a foible of pedantry, we may briefly remark {{on one or two}} {{detached}} objections to Rousseau's story. To begin with, there is no certainty as to there having ever been a state of nature of a normal and organic kind, any more than there is any one normal and typical state of society now. There are infinitely diverse states of society, and there were probably as many diverse states of nature. Rousseau was sufficiently acquainted with the most recent metaphysics of his time to know that you cannot think of a tree in general, nor of a triangle in general, but only of some particular tree or triangle.[189] In a similar way he might have known that there never was any such thing as a state of nature in the general and abstract, fixed, typical, and single. He speaks of the savage state also, which comes next, as one, identical, normal. It is, of course, nothing of the kind. The varieties of belief and habit and custom among the different tribes of savages, in reference to every object that can engage their attention, from death and the gods and immortality down to the uses of marriage and the art of counting and the ways of procuring subsistence, are infinitely numerous; and the more we know about this vast diversity, the less easy is it to think of the savage state in general. When Rousseau extols the savage state as the veritable youth of the world, we wonder whether we are to think of the negroes of the Gold Coast, or the Dyaks of Borneo, Papuans or Maoris, Cheyennes or Tierra-del-Fuegians or the fabled Troglodytes; whether in the veritable youth of the world they counted up to five or only to two; whether they used a <b>fire-drill,</b> and if so what kind of drill; whether they had the notion of personal identity in so weak a shape as to practise the couvade; and a hundred other points, which we should now require any writer to settle, who should speak of the savage state as sovereign, one, and indivisible, {{in the way in which}} Rousseau speaks of it, and holds it up to our vain admiration.|$|E
6000|$|Then again, {{there is}} another cause for the passing eclipse of {{interest}} in wisdom of the world. Extraordinary advances {{have been made in}} ordered knowledge of the various stages of the long prehistoric dawn of human civilisation. The man of the flint implement and the <b>fire-drill,</b> who could only count up to five, and who was content to live in a hut like a beehive, has drawn interest away from the man of the market and the parlour. The literary passion for primitive times and the raw material of man has thrust polished man, the manufactured article, into a secondary place. All this is in the order of things. It is fitting enough that we should pierce into the origins of human nature. It is right, too, that the poets, the ideal interpreters of life, should be dearer to us than those who stop short with mere deciphering of what is real and actual. The poet has his own sphere of the beautiful and the sublime. But it is no less true that the enduring weight of historian, moralist, political orator, or preacher depends on the amount of the wisdom of life that is hived in his pages. They may be admirable by virtue of other qualities, by learning, by grasp, by majesty of flight; but it is his moral sentences on mankind or the State that rank the prose writer among the sages. These show that he has an eye for the large truths of action, for the permanent bearings of conduct, and for things that are for the guidance of all generations. What is it that makes Plutarch's Lives [...] "the pasture of great souls," [...] as they were called by one who was herself a great soul? Because his aim was much less to tell a story than, as he says, [...] "to decipher the man and his nature"; and in deciphering the man, to strike out pregnant and fruitful thoughts on all men. Why was it worth while for Mr. Jowett, the other day, to give us a new translation of Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War? And why is it worth your while, at least to dip in a serious spirit into its pages? Partly, because the gravity and concision of Thucydides are of specially wholesome example in these days of over-coloured and over-voluminous narrative; partly, because he knows how to invest the wreck and overthrow of those small states with the pathos and dignity of mighty imperial fall; but most of all, {{for the sake of the}} wise sentences that are sown with apt but not unsparing hand through the progress of the story. Well might Gray ask his friend whether Thucydides' description of the final destruction of the Athenian host at Syracuse was not the finest thing he ever read in his life; and assuredly the man who can read that stern tale without admiration, pity, and awe may be certain that he has no taste for noble composition, and no feeling for the deepest tragedy of mortal things. But it is the sagacious sentences in the speeches of Athenians, Corinthians, Lacedaemonians, that do most of all to give to the historian his perpetuity of interest to every reader with the rudiments of a political instinct, and make Thucydides as modern as if he had written yesterday.|$|E
50|$|Indigenous Australians soaked the {{flowering}} spike in water {{to produce a}} sweet drink. The soft, white leaf bases were eaten {{as well as the}} growing point of the stem. The flower spike exudes a resin which could be used as an adhesive in the manufacture of tools and the stem used for the lower portion of a spear. Stems were also used to make a base for a <b>fire-drill</b> to start a fire.The resin was also collected and sent to commercial processors where it was made into lacquer for furniture of cabinet makers.|$|E
50|$|Ritual Significance Despite his {{importance}} {{in the act of}} creation, Black God (or Haashch’eezhini) appears very seldom in Navajo ritual. The only sacrament involving Him is the Nightway (or Yeibichai), a nine-day midwinter healing ceremony. On the ninth and final day of the ritual, a man arrives in the guise of the Black God. It is not uncommon for Black God to be portrayed by an old man dressed in traditional garb including: fox skin, black body paint, and the Black God mask. The impersonator carries with him a <b>fire-drill</b> (a device that uses friction to incite ignition) and shredded bark (tinder) with which he will demonstrate his pyromancy.|$|E
50|$|The top {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{recognizable}} toys found on archaeological sites. Spinning tops originated independently in cultures all over the world. Besides toys, tops have also historically been used for gambling and prophecy. Some role-playing games use tops to augment dice in generating randomized results; it is in this case referred to as a spinner. A thumbtack may also be made to spin on the same principles. Gould mentions maple seeds, celts (leading to rattlebacks), the <b>fire-drill,</b> the spindle whorl, and the potter's wheel as possible predecessors to the top, which he assumes was invented or discovered multiple times in multiple places.|$|E
5000|$|A {{ceremonial}} pole symbolizes {{a variety}} of concepts in several different cultures. For example, in the Miao culture in Yunnan China. In The Evolution of the Idea of God, Grant Allen notes that Samoyeds of Siberia, and Damara of South Africa plant stakes at the graves of ancestors. According to Zelia Nuttall in The Fundamental Principles Of Old and New World Civilizations, tree and pole reverence to Anu in ancient Babylonia-Assyria may have evolved from the <b>fire-drill</b> and beam of the oil press, stating that it was extremely probable that the primitive employment of a fire-stick by the priesthood, {{for the production of}} [...] "celestial fire," [...] may have {{played an important role in}} causing the stick, and thence the pole and tree, to become the symbol of Anu.|$|E
5000|$|In Colorado, Brian Christensen's Akron Rams (Class 1A) {{high school}} {{football}} team has made running the Single Wing offense a local tradition. Akron won back-to-back undefeated state championships in 2001 and 2002. They also took home State titles in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Christensen's teams have made the playoffs every year since 1996 and have made it to at least the semi-finals of the state playoffs all but 4 times within that span. The Akron Rams are renowned for their [...] "exceptional prowess executing the single-wing offense,". One coach characterized Akron's single-wing attack as, [...] "A Chinese <b>fire-drill</b> in the backfield every single play. You have to play mistake-free defense or Akron's single-wing attack will burn you,". [...] Christensen took over the Akron program in 1996, his overall record at Akron is: 163-31 (.841 winning percentage).|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} myths related to agriculture. Humans {{are said to}} have been taught the use of fire by Suiren (Yang 2005: 71). Suiren, also known as the Drill Man, used a <b>fire-drill</b> to start fires, and thus to {{allowing}} food to be cooked (Christie 1968: 84). Also: animal husbandry and the use of draft animals, inventions of various agricultural tools and implements, the domestication of various species of plants such as rice and ginger and radishes, the evaluation and uses of various types of soil, and irrigation by digging wells. Other myths include events which made agriculture possible by destroying an excessive number of suns in the sky or ending the Great Flood. Also there were all sorts of deities or beings in charge of bringing rain, drought, and various cyclical phenomena such as day and night or the various seasons in their proper order, which are vital aspects of successful agriculture. Other myths include the invention of farmers markets and the invention of fermentation.|$|E
50|$|The Wildcats {{entered the}} 2013 season ranked No. 22 in the polls. After winning their {{first four games}} and {{achieving}} a No. 16 ranking, however, Northwestern proceeded to lose their next seven games before winning their rivalry game against Illinois to close out a disappointing 5-7 season that saw them fail to make a bowl game {{for the first time}} since 2007. 5 of the 7 losses came by 10 points or less: against Ohio St. a controversial non-4th down conversion call blew the Wildcats' chances (Northwestern lost 40-30, but one of the Buckeye TDs came as time expired when they recovered a fumble following a failed Hail Mary), against Nebraska a Hail Mary gave the Wildcats a heartbreaking 27-24 loss, against Michigan a <b>fire-drill</b> FG as time expired robbed Northwestern of a 9-6 victory (the Wildcats would proceed to lose 27-19 in 3 overtimes), against Iowa the Wildcats lost another heartbreaking overtime game 17-10, and against Minnesota the Wildcats lost 20-17 after giving up a crucial 3rd and 6 conversion under 2 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|While {{traditional}} Chinese mythology depicted {{cooking and}} agriculture as {{key elements of}} civilization, the Daoists created a [...] "counter-narrative" [...] (Campany 2005:16) to justify the idea of grain avoidance. For example, the Confucianist Xunzi and Legalist Hanfeizi describe Suiren as cultural folk hero.In the earliest times ... the people lived on fruit, berries, mussels, and clams - things that sometimes became so rank and fetid that they hurt people's stomachs, and many became sick. Then a sage appeared who created the boring of wood to produce fire so as to transform the rank and putrid foods. The people were so delighted by this that they made him ruler {{of the world and}} called him the <b>Fire-Drill</b> Man (Suiren 燧人). (Hanfeizi 49, tr. Campany 2005:15) In contrast, the Zhuangzi [...] "Mending Nature" [...] chapter mentions Suiren first in a list of mythic sage-rulers - Fu Xi, Shennong, Yellow Emperor, Tang of Shang, and Yu the Great, traditionally credited with advancing civilization - but depicts them as villains who began the destruction of the primal harmony of the Dao. Campany (2005:16) calls this [...] "the decline of Power and the ever-farther departure from the natural Dao into systems of social constraint and what passes for culture." [...] The ancients, in the midst of chaos, were tranquil together with the whole world. At that time, yin and yang were harmoniously still, ghosts and spirits caused no disturbances; the four seasons came in good time; the myriad things went unharmed; the host of living creatures escaped premature death. … This condition persisted until integrity deteriorated to the point that Torchman Suiren and Fuhsi arose to manage all under heaven, whereupon there was accord, but no longer unity. Integrity further declined until the Divine Farmer and the Yellow Emperor arose to manage all under heaven, whereupon there was repose, but no longer accord. Integrity declined still further until T'ang and Yu arose to manage all under heaven. They initiated the fashion of governing by transformation, whereby purity was diluted and simplicity dissipated.

40|$|Constructing highly {{realistic}} agents {{is essential}} if agents {{are to be}} employed in virtual training systems. In training for collaboration based on face-to-face interaction, the generation of emotional expressions is one key. In training for guidance based on one-to-many interaction such as direction giving for evacuations, emotional expressions must be supplemented by diverse agent behaviors to make the training realistic. To reproduce diverse behavior, we characterize agents by using a various combinations of operation rules instantiated by the user operating the agent. To accomplish this goal, we introduce a user modeling method based on participatory simulations. These simulations enable us to acquire information observed by each user in the simulation and the operating history. Using these data and the domain knowledge including known operation rules, we can generate an explanation for each behavior. Moreover, the application of hypothetical reasoning, which offers consistent selection of hypotheses, to the generation of explanations allows us to use otherwise incompatible operation rules as domain knowledge. In order to validate the proposed modeling method, we apply it to the acquisition of an evacuee’s model in a <b>fire-drill</b> experiment. We successfully acquire a subject’s model corresponding {{to the results of}} an interview with the subject...|$|E
