50|$|Custody {{transfer}} {{is one of}} the most important applications for flow measurement. Many flow measurement technologies are used for custody transfer applications; these include differential pressure (DP) <b>flowmeters,</b> turbine <b>flowmeters,</b> positive displacement <b>flowmeters,</b> Coriolis <b>flowmeters</b> and ultrasonic <b>flowmeters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ultrasonic {{flow meters}} come in three {{different}} types: transmission (contrapropagating transit time) <b>flowmeters,</b> reflection (Doppler) <b>flowmeters,</b> and open-channel <b>flowmeters.</b> Transit time <b>flowmeters</b> work by measuring the time difference between an ultrasonic pulse sent in the flow direction and an ultrasound pulse sent opposite the flow direction. Doppler <b>flowmeters</b> measure the doppler shift resulting in reflecting an ultrasonic beam off either small particles in the fluid, air bubbles in the fluid, or the flowing fluid's turbulence. Open channel flow meters measure upstream levels in front of flumes or weirs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a large number of tests carried out about the reliability of discharge measurements given by <b>flowmeters</b> for pressure pipes of different kinds (electromagnetic, ultrasonic and turbine <b>flowmeters),</b> on the basis of the experimental data collected at Laboratorio di Idraulica “G. Fantoli” of Politecnico di Milano. In fact, since 2002, this laboratory is the seat of the Settore Portate of Centro SIT n. 104, that is a structure of Politecnico di Milano accredited for <b>flowmeters</b> calibration in the discharge range from 3 l/s to 80 l/s, with a so-called “best measurement capability” (BMC) equal to 0. 2 %. During these years, a lot of calibrations of different <b>flowmeters</b> have been carried out (61 <b>flowmeters</b> were tested so far: 44 electromagnetic, 9 ultrasonic, 8 turbine <b>flowmeters).</b> So, the tested <b>flowmeters</b> are supposed to give a relevant sample of experimental data, and therefore it seems interesting to carry out some statistical analyses about their performances and reliability.

In comparison to other flowmeters, the turbine <b>flowmeter</b> {{has a significant}} cost advantage over ultrasonic flowmeters, especially in the larger line sizes, and {{it also has a}} favourable price compared to the prices of DP flowmeters, especially in cases where one turbine meter can replace several DP meters.|$|E

To improve the measurement accuracy of Coriolis mass <b>flowmeters,</b> a phase and frequency matching-based signal processing method for Coriolis mass <b>flowmeters</b> is proposed. Estimated phase difference is obtained {{by means of}} frequency estimation, 90 ° phase shift, generating reference signals and cross-correlation. Simulated results demonstrate that the proposed method has better phase difference estimation and anti-interference performance than the Hilbert transform method, cross-correlation method, data extension-based correlation method, and quadrature delay estimator.

The four-vane rotor in the hydrogen system produced four electrical impulses per revolution and turned approximately 3,700 rpm at nominal flow.

50|$|The {{needle valve}} may be located {{proximal}} or distal to the inlet port; {{these two types}} of <b>flowmeter</b> are respectively called 'non-compensated' or 'compensated'. The original Thorpe tube <b>flowmeter</b> is the non-compensated type: it works with a fixed orifice and variable pressure. The non-compensated type is more accurate for low flow rates, such as are used in neonatal units, laboratory experiments, or anaesthetic machines. Compensated flowmeters work with a variable orifice and fixed pressure. They read back pressure, and take into account resistance changes downstream from the needle valve. If pressure exceeds 50 psig downstream, flow ceases.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{ultrasonic}} <b>flowmeters</b> {{is continuing}} to grow for custody transfer. Unlike PD and turbine meters, ultrasonic <b>flowmeters</b> do not have moving parts. Pressure drop is much reduced with an ultrasonic meter when compared to PD, turbine, and DP meters. Installation of ultrasonic meters is relatively straightforward, and maintenance requirements are low.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>flowmeter</b> {{consisting}} of a long capillary is connected in series with the powder bed. The pressure drop across the <b>flowmeter</b> (measured by a manometer) {{is proportional to the}} flowrate, and the proportionality constant can be measured by direct calibration. The pressure drop across the bed is measured by a similar manometer. Thus the required pressure/flow ratio can be obtained from the ratio of the two manometer readings, and when fed into the Carman equation, yields an [...] "absolute" [...] value of the air permeability surface area. The apparatus is maintained at a constant temperature, and dry air is used so that the air viscosity can be obtained from tables.|$|E

5000|$|Various {{devices are}} used for {{administration}} of oxygen. In most cases, the oxygen will first pass through a pressure regulator, used to control the high pressure of oxygen delivered from a cylinder (or other source) to a lower pressure. This lower pressure is then controlled by a <b>flowmeter,</b> which may be preset or selectable, and this controls the flow in a measure such as litres per minute (lpm). The typical <b>flowmeter</b> range for medical oxygen is between 0 and 15 lpm with some units able to obtain up to 25 liters per minute. Many wall flowmeters using a Thorpe tube design are able to be dialed to [...] "flush" [...] which is beneficial in emergency situations.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss {{velocity}} profile effects in Coriolis <b>flowmeters</b> and to review related research work. The measurements made by Coriolis <b>flowmeters</b> are dependent upon the steady flow velocity distribution within them whenever certain features of the fluid vibrational fields are not uniform inside the measuring tube. This dependence is confirmed by simulation results on two straight tube configurations, one operating in a beam-type modeand the other in a shell-type mode. Findings to date and open questions regarding velocity profile effects in Coriolis <b>flowmeters</b> are discussed for both fully developed and disturbed inlet flow conditions...|$|R
