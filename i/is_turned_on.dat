5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the console {{features}} an illuminated slot-loading optical media drive which accepts only 12cm Wii Optical Discs and 8cm Nintendo GameCube Game Discs. (Units sold in South Korea and later revisions do not support GameCube discs.) The blue light in the disc slot illuminates briefly when the console <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on,</b> and pulses when new data is received through WiiConnect24. After the update (including System Menu 3.0), the disc-slot light activates whenever a Wii disc is inserted or ejected. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light stays off. The disc-slot light remains off during game play or when using other features. Two USB ports are located at its rear. An SD-card slot is located behind the cover on the {{front of the}} console.|$|E

30|$|The FCU, as the {{supplementary}} {{equipment for}} dehumidification and additional cooling, was {{installed on the}} window side of {{the ceiling of the}} living room. If dehumidification or/and supplementary cooling was required for any room, the FCU <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on.</b> Based on sensor-measured values in each room, if the difference between the radiant floor surface temperature and the indoor dew point temperature was less than 1  K, the FCU <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> for dehumidification. In contrast, if the difference between room temperature and set room temperature was more than 0.5  K continuously for 20  min, the FCU <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> for supplementary cooling.|$|R

25|$|When {{the light}} <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on,</b> the {{electric}} power heats up the cathode enough {{for it to}} emit electrons (thermionic emission). These electrons collide with and ionize noble gas atoms inside the bulb surrounding the filament to form a plasma {{by the process of}} impact ionization. As a result of avalanche ionization, the conductivity of the ionized gas rapidly rises, allowing higher currents to flow through the lamp.|$|E

The person <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> their back with a secure grip used to tow from behind. If the person is cooperative they may be towed {{in a similar fashion}} held at the armpits. If the person is unconscious they may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin and cheeks, ensuring that the mouth and nose are well above the water.|$|E
25|$|The poorest {{section of}} the {{population}} of Damascus live in the Southern neighborhoods which also receive the poorest service quality both in terms of quantity and quality. These neighborhoods are served primarily by wells whose quality is dubious, especially in terms of nitrates (see pollution). Due to overexploitation the amount of water available is insufficient for continuous supply, especially during summer when demand increases and groundwater levels drop (see intermittent supply). Due to pressure changes when supply <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> and off, pollutants are sucked into leaky distribution pipes which further contaminates drinking water. This phenomenon is more widespread in the poorer neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|This simple {{design is}} {{effective}} and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially Energy Star rated ones, use a relay to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, {{so that the}} degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off {{at the end of}} the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on,</b> and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.|$|E

25|$|E. coli is {{normally}} unable to grow aerobically on citrate {{due to the}} inability to express a citrate transporter when oxygen is present. However, E. coli has a complete citric acid cycle, and therefore metabolizes citrate as an intermediate during aerobic growth on other substances, including glucose. Most E. coli can grow anaerobically on citrate via fermentation, if a co-substrate such as glucose is available to provide reducing power. The anaerobic growth is possible due to {{the expression of a}} transmembrane citrate-succinate antiporter gene, citT, which was first identified in 1998. This gene is co-regulated with other genes involved in citrate fermentation found on the cit operon, which <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> only when oxygen is absent.|$|E
25|$|An instant start ballast {{does not}} preheat the electrodes, instead using a {{relatively}} high voltage (~600V) to initiate the discharge arc. It is the most energy efficient type, but yields the fewest lamp-start cycles, as material is blasted {{from the surface of}} the cold electrodes each time the lamp <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on.</b> Instant-start ballasts are best suited to applications with long duty cycles, where the lamps are not frequently turned on and off. Although these were mostly used in countries with 100-120volt mains supplies (for lamps of 40W or above), they were briefly popular in other countries because the lamp started without the flicker of switch start systems. The popularity was short lived because of the short lamp life.|$|E
25|$|The BMD-3 {{is fully}} amphibious and is {{propelled}} by two water jets mounted one {{on either side}} {{at the rear of}} the vehicle, allowing the vehicle to achieve speeds of up to 10km/h in the water and in a sea state of up to three. A snorkel is erected from the driver's position and a trim vane is erected at the front of the vehicle when entering water and the automatic bilge pump <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on.</b> Unlike its predecessors, the BMD-3 can be airdropped with its all its crews and passengers inside the vehicle, allowing combat engagement to be immediate after landing. For the BMD-1 and BMD-2, the crew would be dropped separately, which required additional time to marry up with their fighting vehicle.|$|E
