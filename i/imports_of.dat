40|$|Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases play {{a central}} role in protein {{synthesis}} by charging tRNAs with amino acids. Yeast mitochondrial lysyl tRNA synthetase (Msk 1), in addition to the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA, also functions as a chaperone to facilitate the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> cytosolic lysyl tRNA. In this report, we show that human mitochondrial Kars (lysyl tRNA synthetase) can complement the growth defect associated with the loss of yeast Msk 1 and can additionally facilitate the in vitro <b>import</b> <b>of</b> tRNA into mitochondria.

From 1871, the American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley warned Europeans about the potential for an accidental infestation caused by the transportation of the beetle from America.

Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994.

5|$|Dhaka {{suffered}} stagnation {{and decline}} began during the mid 19th-century.

In 1824, an Anglican bishop described Dhaka as a city of magnificent ruins. During the mutiny of 1857, the city witnessed revolts by the Bengal Army. The British Indian rule was established following the mutiny. It bestowed privileges on the Dhaka Nawab Family, which dominated the city's political and social elite. The Dhaka Cantonment was established as a base for the British Indian Army. The British developed the modern city around Ramna, Shahbag Garden and Bahadur Shah Park. A modern civic water system was introduced in 1874. The electricity supply began in 1901.|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> nuclear <b>import</b> <b>of</b> T-DNA, complexes {{consisting of the}} virulence proteins VirD 2 and VirE 2 as well as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) were tested for import into plant nuclei in vitro. <b>Import</b> <b>of</b> these complexes was fast and efficient and could be inhibited by a competitor, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) coupled to BSA. For <b>import</b> <b>of</b> short ssDNA, VirD 2 was sufficient, whereas <b>import</b> <b>of</b> long ssDNA additionally required VirE 2. A VirD 2 mutant lacking its C-terminal NLS was unable to mediate <b>import</b> <b>of</b> the T-DNA complexes into nuclei. Although free VirE 2 molecules were imported into nuclei, once bound to ssDNA they were not imported, implying that when complexed to DNA, the NLSs of VirE 2 are not exposed and thus do not function. RecA, another ssDNA binding protein, could substitute for VirE 2 in the nuclear <b>import</b> <b>of</b> T-DNA but not in earlier events of T-DNA transfer to plant cells. We propose that VirD 2 directs the T-DNA complex to the nuclear pore, whereas both proteins mediate its passage through the pore. Therefore, by binding to ssDNA, VirE 2 may shape the T-DNA complex such that it is accepted for translocation into the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|Various {{portions}} of the extension peptides of P- 45 O(SCQ precursor were chemically synthesized.
