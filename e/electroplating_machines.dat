50|$|The {{zinc-bromine battery}} can be {{regarded}} as an <b>electroplating</b> <b>machine.</b> During charging zinc is electroplated onto conductive electrodes, {{while at the same time}} bromine is formed. On discharge the reverse process occurs, the metallic zinc plated on the negative electrodes dissolves in the electrolyte and is available to be plated again at the next charge cycle. It can be left fully discharged indefinitely without damage.|$|R

Two subsystems namely Grinding <b>machine,</b> <b>Electroplating</b> <b>machine</b> are supported by stand-by units with perfect switch over devices and the remaining four subsystem are prone to failure. The mathematical model of Tab manufacturing plant has been developed using Markov birth – death Process. The differential equations has been developed {{on the basis of}} probabilistic approach using transition diagram which are further solved for steady state availability in order to develop the decision matrices which provide the various availability levels for different combinations of failure and repair rates of each subsystem. ...|$|R

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been proposed for some ATLAS liner applications. This paper describes the processes used to fabricate machined and shrink fitted impactors which {{have been used for}} copper impactors in 1100 aluminum liners and 6061 T- 6 aluminum impactors in 1100 aluminum liners. The most successful processes have been largely empirically developed and rely upon a combination of shrink fitted and light press fitting.

40|$|Abstract. The dishing {{phenomena}} of soft materials in chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process were problematic in delineating inlaid metal patterns. The inlaid copper structures were fabricated on Si wafer where SiO 2 was thermally grown. Seed layer was deposited by thermal evaporate method followed by copper electrodeposition. Copper was electrodeposited with IBM paddle type <b>electroplating</b> <b>machine</b> to obtain uniform thickness of coating. The dishing amounts were measured at various current density and current type. The dishing amounts with pattern density and line width were also measured. The losses of copper were not sensitively dependent on current density however those were dependent on current type. The dishing amount of copper was decreased at high pattern density especially over 50 % and increased with line width. Surface topology and grain size of coating were investigated with surface profilometer and FESEM...|$|R
40|$|The metal fmishing {{industry}} uses over 40 {{production processes}} {{to produce a}} wide range of metal products. Waste streams generated include wastewater, waste oils, spent solvents, and spent process solutions. Current 1,v a wide variety of techniques which minimize waste are available. Cost-effective methods to reduce electroplating wastewater contamination include water conserv&ion and drag-out reduction, recovery and management. Ways to cost-effectively reduce the generation of spent metal-working fluids include establishing a fluid management program and installing a fluid recovery system. However, before any techniques are selected, a waste reduction survey should fmt be conducted. The metal finishing industry incorporates {{a wide range of}} products and production processes. Finished products range from paper clips to components of the space shuttle. The operations performed at metal finishing facilities usually begin with material in the form of raw stock, such as rods, bars, sheets, and castings, and can progress to the most sophisticated surface finishing operations. This can include painting, <b>electroplating,</b> <b>machining,</b> and anodizing. Standard industrial categories in the metal finishing industry include...|$|R
30|$|The copper {{electrodeposition}} solution {{used was}} composed of 0.6  M CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O (Dae Jung, Korea) and 1.0  M boric acid (H 3 BO 3, Dischem, USA). To apply the electrodeposition, an <b>electroplating</b> <b>machine</b> (Sung Won Forming, Korea) was used. In addition, a copper plate (Daeguang metal, Korea) with dimensions of 3  ×  3  cm {{was used as an}} anode. For the fabrication of a cathode, Cr (50  nm) and Cu (500  nm) were deposited sequentially on a silicon wafer (Win Win Tech, Korea). The silicon wafer was then diced to a sample size of 1  ×  1  cm. In addition, the solution temperature, stirring rate, and applied current density were maintained at 60  °C, 200  rpm, and 50  mA/cm 2, respectively. For the stirring of the solution, a magnetic stir bar (Cowie technology, UK) with a diameter of 0.8  cm and length of 5.0  cm was used. The morphology of the electrodeposited structure was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S- 4800, HITACHI, Japan). Furthermore, an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS) (7593 -H, HORIBA, Japan) was used to analyze the composition of the fabricated samples.|$|R

While the basic design of this window saddle is straightforward, its fabrication is not, given the scale and precision of the component. They solved the problem {{through the use of}} a two segment copper mandrel to electroform the gold window saddle. The segments were micro-machined using a combination of single-point diamond turning and single point diamond milling. These processes as well as the <b>electroplating</b> conditions, final <b>machining</b> and mandrel removal are described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Product {{miniaturization}} is an {{ever increasing}} customer demand in aerospace, bio-medical, defense and electronics industries. These microparts {{play a vital}} role and are required to abide by stringent norms set forth by various quality control agencies. To maintain their functionality over a period of time, they are made of special engineering materials rather than silicon as commonly used in microelectronics. Lithography, etching, embossing, <b>electroplating,</b> laser <b>machining</b> and other micro manufacturing techniques have been employed traditionally to manufacture microcomponents; however, these techniques would be expensive, cause surface damage, or produce a very rough surface. Electrochemical polishing is capable of machining/polishing any conducting material while holding close dimensional tolerances. This research develops a high frequency electrochemical nanopolishing technique for commercially pure alpha titanium. An alcohol and salt based electrolyte was used with direct current as well as alternating current on alpha titanium plate. For both current types, optimal surface roughness R_(a) ~ 300 nm was obtained on poly grained surface using interferometry and ~ 2 nm within a single grain by atomic force microscopy. Comparable results were obtained by other researchers with 30 - 120 nm R_(a) for titanium and titanium alloys. Linear regression models were developed to predict the surface roughness. The surface roughness predicted by the models was found to be within 26 % of the measured values...|$|R

40|$|In {{fuel cell}} technology, certain {{components}} are used {{that are responsible}} for guiding liquid media. When these components are produced by conventional manufacturing, there are often sealing issues, and trouble- and maintenance-free deployment cannot be ensured. Against this background, a new process combination has been developed in a joint project between the University of Duisburg-Essen, the Center for Fuel Cell Technology (ZBT), and the company Galvano-T electroplating forming GmbH. The approach is to combine multi-jet modelling (MJM), electroforming and milling in order to produce a defined external geometry. The wax models are generated on copper base plates and copper-coated to a desirable thickness. Following this, the undefined <b>electroplated</b> surfaces are <b>machined</b> to achieve the desired measurement, and the wax is melted out. This paper presents, first, how this process is technically feasible, then describes how the MJM on a 3 -D Systems ThermoJet was adapted to stabilise the process. In the AiF-sponsored ZIM project, existing limits and possibilities are shown and different approaches of electroplating are investigated. This paper explores whether or not activation of the wax structure by a conductive initial layer is required. Using the described process chain, different parts were built: a heat exchanger, a vaporiser, and a reformer (in which pellets were integrated in an intermediate step). In addition, multiple-layer parts with different functions were built by repeating the process combination several times...|$|R
