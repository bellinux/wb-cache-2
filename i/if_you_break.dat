500|$|As Planet Terror took shape, Tarantino {{developed}} {{the story for}} Death Proof, based on his fascination for the way stuntmen would [...] "death-proof" [...] their cars. As {{long as they were}} driving, stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60mph (97km/h) and survive. This inspired Tarantino to create a slasher film featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his [...] "death-proof" [...] car. Tarantino remembers, [...] "I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of women-in-prison films, there is no other genre quite as rigid. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>break</b> that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized—let me take the structure of a slasher film and just do what I do. My version is going to be fucked up and disjointed, but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film, hopefully against you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The contestants {{performed}} {{in a series of}} rounds and number of contestants trimmed in each round. [...] In the first round they performed a song, in the second round they were asked to compose a melody for one of five set of lyrics, and 80 remained after this round. [...] In the third round the contestants were separate into the girls and boys and they {{performed in}} small groups. They chose a song from [...] "Superstar", Seal's [...] "Kiss from a Rose", Barry Manilow's [...] "Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again", Freda Payne's [...] "Band of Gold", and Dionne Warwick's [...] "You'll Never Get to Heaven (<b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Break</b> My Heart)". [...] During the group performance, Corey Clark, who was later to claim a relationship with Paula Abdul, sang to Paula directly and kissed her hand. 48 contestants were left {{at the end of this}} round.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1973 season, Aaron {{received}} a plaque from the US Postal Service for receiving more mail (930,000 pieces) than any person excluding politicians. Aaron {{received a}}n outpouring of public support in response to the bigotry. Newspaper cartoonist Charles Schulz created a series of Peanuts strips printed in August 1973 in which Snoopy attempts to break the Ruth record, only to be besieged with hate mail. Lucy says in the August 11 strip, [...] "Hank Aaron is a great player...but you! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>break</b> Babe Ruth's record, it'll be a disgrace!" [...] Coincidentally, Snoopy was only one home run short of tying the record (and finished the season as such when Charlie Brown got picked off during Snoopy's last at-bat), and as it turned out, Aaron finished the 1973 season one home run short of Ruth. Babe Ruth's widow, Claire Hodgson, even denounced the racism and declared that her husband would have enthusiastically cheered Aaron's attempt at the record. As the 1974 season began, Aaron's pursuit of the record caused a small controversy. The Braves opened the season on the road in Cincinnati with a three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds. Braves management wanted him to break the record in Atlanta, and were therefore going to have Aaron sit out the first three games of the season. But Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ruled that he had to play two games in the first series. He played two out of three, tying Babe Ruth's record in his very first at bat—on his first swing of the season—off Reds pitcher Jack Billingham, but did not hit another home run in the series.|$|E

[...] Sherpa Capital is an investor in Airbnb Inc. and Uber, both of which are fighting regulators.|$|R
