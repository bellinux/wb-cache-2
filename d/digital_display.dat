5|$|Effective in the 2014 racing season, the {{grandstand}} capacity was reduced from 92,000 to 68,000. This {{was accomplished by}} removing approximately 12,000 seats near Turn 1 and installing a hospitality area and a <b>digital</b> <b>display</b> showing speeds along the straightaway. In addition, seats were further reduced {{as a result of}} modifying average seat width from 18 inches to 23 inches. The capacity quoted does not include luxury boxes and infield seating, which when added up reaches a capacity of approximately 100,000.|$|E

25|$|While a <b>digital</b> <b>display</b> {{can easily}} be {{extended}} in resolution, the extra digits are of no value if not accompanied by care {{in the design and}} calibration of the analog portions of the multimeter. Meaningful (i.e., high-accuracy) measurements require a good understanding of the instrument specifications, good control of the measurement conditions, and traceability of the calibration of the instrument. However, even if its resolution exceeds the accuracy, a meter can be useful for comparing measurements. For example, a meter reading 5½ stable digits may indicate that one nominally 100,000 ohm resistor is about 7 ohms greater than another, although the error of each measurement is 0.2% of reading plus 0.05% of full-scale value.|$|E

When combined with a digital pen, these prints enable users to capture handwritten content. When augmented by <b>digital</b> <b>displays,</b> these prints integrate the high spatial resolution of wide-format printing with the high temporal resolution of <b>digital</b> <b>displays.</b> By having paper and <b>digital</b> <b>displays</b> work together as an ensemble, GIGAprints provide {{the best of both}} worlds...|$|R

Typically, the tourniquet instrument allows the perioperative staff {{to set the}} tourniquet pressure, inflate or deflate the tourniquet cuff, and adjust safety settings such as the maximum allowed pressure and time limits. The <b>digital</b> <b>display</b> and control buttons give the surgical staff a straightforward method of monitoring the tourniquet pressure and time, and for changing the various tourniquet settings. Personalized tourniquet instruments have non-volatile memory to enable surgical staff to store specialized settings most appropriate for certain surgeries (e.g. paediatric and hand surgery), relevant data about significant surgical events related to tourniquet usage, and to enable a data printout or transfer to an operating room information network. In addition, personalized tourniquet instruments use intuitive audio-visual alarms to alert the surgical staff of events related to patient safety.|$|E
25|$|Recently, two trams were {{completely}} renovated to world-class standards with {{front and back}} glass, fluorescent lights, FM radio, <b>digital</b> <b>display</b> boards, slanted seats and a fibreglass ceiling. More renovated trams are planned; from 2008 to 2010 the Nonapukur workshop manufactured 19 new-look trams, of which four are {{in the final stages}} of completion. The rooftop is clear polycarbonate sheeting with a wide window space, comfortable seating and better visibility from inside and out. Nonapukur Workshop is now manufacturing new tram cars and renovating existing steel-body (BSCL) cars. After plans for banquet/cafeteria trams and air-conditioned trams to attract commuters and foreign tourists as well as to increase revenue for the company, one single-coach air-conditioned banquet tram has now been introduced and offers heritage tours to north Kolkata in the morning and south Kolkata in the evening. However, the AC tram received poor patronage when it was introduced, although there are plans for more AC trams in Kolkata.|$|E

500|$|Vig started doubting {{it could}} be done fully analog once the tapes for the first song recorded, [...] "Miss the Misery", started falling apart, but Grohl {{reassured}} him [...] "no, Butch, I don't want any computer in this house at all." [...] The producer said that during recording he [...] "had to force my brain to fire different synapses" [...] to remember {{how to deal with the}} analog equipment and the lack of a <b>digital</b> <b>display.</b> One of the habits Vig had to call back was editing using a razor blade—"I used to be able to do 20 edits in half an hour if need be. It took me about 20 minutes to do the first edit!"—a technique he employed for the first songs recorded. Eventually he gave up and decided to punch in and punch out tapes instead, as the process was time-consuming and a more editable tape sent to Vig from Smart Studios was mostly ruined by one of Grohl's daughters. While many recordings had inserts and some parts rerecorded, the only song that had to be redone from scratch was [...] "I Should Have Known", as Grohl felt Vig was [...] "trying to make this into a radio single" [...] when the singer wanted it [...] "to sound really raw and primal".|$|E

2500|$|Display: The glucose {{value in}} mg/dl or mmol/l is {{displayed}} on a <b>digital</b> <b>display.</b> The preferred measurement unit varies by country: mg/dl are preferred in the U.S., France, Japan, Israel, and India. mmol/l are used in Canada, Australia and China. Germany {{is the only country}} where medical professionals routinely operate in both units of measure. (To convert mmol/l to mg/dl, multiply by 18. To convert mg/dl to mmol/l, divide by 18.) Many meters can display either unit of measure; there have been a couple of published instances in which someone with diabetes has been misled into the wrong action by assuming that a reading in mmol/l was really a very low reading in mg/dl, or the converse. [...] In general, if a value is presented with a decimal point, it is in mmol/l, without a decimal it is most likely mg/dl.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCalamities (e. g. accidents) in the {{vicinity}} of freeway interchanges can simultaneously block several branches of the interchange for road traffic, resulting in heavy congestion or unsafe driving conditions. Therefore, drivers should be informed in time about these calamities. <b>Digital</b> <b>displays</b> alongside freeways are an excellent medium to warn drivers approaching the interchange and provide some rerouting alternatives. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effectiveness of a sequential message strategy (including <b>digital</b> <b>displays)</b> announcing that a calamity has occurred and therefore advise the drivers to reroute. In this study, different types of messages and two types of <b>digital</b> <b>displays</b> (gantry and cantilever) are used to indicate that an accident occurred at the interchange and that one or more branches are blocked. Furthermore, these messages instruct the drivers to take the exit and follow a calamity route (i. e. diversion). After leaving the freeway, the calamity routes are indicated using different letters (e. g. ‘A’) for the possible destinations. Sixteen subjects participated in the simulator study and drove through five scenarios after receiving instructions concerning their destination. The apparatus used consisted of a medium fidelity simulator mock-up equipped with an eye tracking system. Instead of being exposed to a virtual driving environment, participants drove through a real-life full HD video recorded road environment in which 3 D virtual traffic signs had been digitally integrated. Participants’ route choice and their visual behavior were monitored while navigating through the scenarios. Results indicate that most of the participants obeyed the instructions on the <b>digital</b> <b>displays</b> and thus made the correct route choice. However, some participants neglected the advice and did not take the appropriate exit. Furthermore, small differences were found between the two types of <b>digital</b> <b>displays.</b> In general, cantilever displays generated longer fixation times than the gantry displays...|$|R
