40|$|Some brands in {{the market}} opt to offer a single "deal " price (e. g., Pepsi brand soft drink at $ 1. 09 every {{alternate}} week), whereas others opt to offer 2 or more deal prices (e. g., Coca-Cola brand soft drink at $ 0. 99 in Week 1 and $ 1. 19 in Week 3). It was hypothesized that offering multiple deal prices is {{likely to result in}} underestimation of deal frequency and average <b>deal</b> <b>price,</b> which will bias the price consumers {{are willing to pay for}} the brand. Results from 3 laboratory experiments, a longitudinal experiment, and a survey support the hypotheses. In addition, consumers are likely to be willing to pay more for the brand when it is offered at 2 deal prices with a small difference compared with a single <b>deal</b> <b>price.</b> Implications of these findings for consumer welfare and pricing policy are discussed. Marketers often offer different deal prices {{in the market}} (Raju, 1990). <b>Deal</b> <b>price</b> refers to the offer of a brand at a price that is lower than the regular price for the brand. In a recent survey of soft drink prices that we conducted for 12 weeks, we found varying numbers of deal prices. For example, at the same store, Dr. Pepper brand soft drink (regular price of $ 1. 69) was offered at two deal prices with a relatively large difference ($ 0. 99 and $ 1. 49), Pepsi was offered at a single <b>deal</b> <b>price</b> ($ 0. 99), and Coca-Cola was offered at two deal prices with a relatively small difference ($ 0. 99 and $ 1. 19).

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{different}} explanatory factors behind the magnitude of bid premium paid in corporate acquisitions. Synergy creation and bargaining power is emphasized when evaluating the strength of the chosen determinants. Furthermore bid premiums relation to target and a bidder abnormal return is studied. Since corporate acquisitions are often the biggest investments that companies undertake, it is essential to understand factors that commonly have an impact on <b>deal</b> <b>price.</b> DATA AND METHODOLOGY The data set consists acquisitions that have taken place within the European Union during January 2000 to November 2011. Acquisitions with deal value less than 10 million euro are excluded from the final sample of 647 acquisitions. Data regarding determinants explaining the size of the bid premium are gathered from SDC Platinum and Thomson ONE Banker databases. Data regarding abnormal returns is collected from Datastream. Determinants' explanatory power is researched by using OLS-regression, having bid premium as the dependent variable. Main focus is in premium that is calculated four weeks prior the announcement. Bid premium's relation to announcement effect is tested by using [- 20, + 20] time window. RESULTS Statistically significant positive relation to bid premium was found when there are multiple bidders involved, when the acquisition type is cross-border and when the bigger the size difference between bidder and target is. On the contrary, having a toehold has a significant negative correlation to the amount of bid premium. As expected, bid premium and target abnormal returns have a strong positive correlation. However, a vice versa relation was not found to apply bidder abnormal returns. In fact when the <b>deal</b> <b>price</b> was less than target's market value, bidders' cumulative average abnormal return was negative...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop an}} arbitrage-free {{framework}} for consistent valuation of derivative trades with collateralization, counterparty credit gap risk, and funding costs, following the approach first proposed by Pallavicini and co-authors in 2011. Based on the risk-neutral pricing principle, we derive a general pricing equation where Credit, Debit, Liquidity and Funding Valuation Adjustments (CVA, DVA, LVA and FVA) are introduced by simply modifying the payout cash-flows of the deal. Funding costs and specific close-out procedures at default break the bilateral {{nature of the}} <b>deal</b> <b>price</b> and render the valuation problem a non-linear and recursive one. CVA and FVA are in general not really additive adjustments, and the risk for double counting is concrete. We introduce a new adjustment, called a Non-linearity Valuation Adjustment (NVA), to address double-counting. The theoretical risk free rate disappears from our final equations. The framework can be tailored also to CCP trading under initial and variation margins, as explained in detail in Brigo and Pallavicini (2014). In particular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding rates, replacement close-out and re-hypothecation. The valuation equation {{takes the form of}} a backward stochastic differential equation or semi-linear partial differential equation, and can be cast as a set of iterative equations that can be solved by least-squares Monte Carlo. We propose such a simulation algorithm in a case study involving a generalization of the benchmark model of Black and Scholes for option pricing. Our numerical results confirm that funding risk has a non-trivial impact on the <b>deal</b> <b>price,</b> and that double counting matters too. We conclude the article with an analysis of large scale implications of non-linearity of the pricing equations. Comment: An updated version of this report will appear in the volume: Veronesi, P.

40|$|Critics {{claim that}} {{short-term}} profit orientation and high <b>deal</b> <b>price</b> strategies of private equity (PE) firms can negatively affect {{the ability of}} management buyouts to initiate and sustain entrepreneurial management. This study investigates this claim by comparing effects of majority PE backed and other buy-outs {{at different levels of}} financial leverage on post buy-out increases in entrepreneurial management. We propose that PE can be used as an organizational refocusing device that simultaneously increases entrepreneurial and administrative management. We find that majority PE-backed buy-outs significantly increase entrepreneurial management practices. Furthermore, the increased financial leverage positively affects administrative management in management buy-outs. However, the effect of high financial leverage is larger for majority PE-backed buy-outs. These results support the notion that PE firms help buy-out companies develop ambidextrous organizational change: i. e. simultaneously develop entrepreneurial and administrative management practices.

40|$|In negotiations, {{people tend}} to {{perceive}} a deadline as more detrimental to themselves than to their opponents. This phenomenon is termed myopic perception. The present research proposes that myopic perception {{can be understood as}} a result of an anchoring effect due to the question order used in probing the perception of a deadline. When people estimate deal prices before rating the influence of a deadline, their judgements are anchored on their negotiation outcomes, making their perception egocentric, which leads to myopic perception. As a result, myopic perception was hypothesized to be reduced by reversing the above question order to change the respondents 2 ̆ 7 judgement anchor from negotiation outcomes to negotiation procedures. In Study 1, myopic perception disappeared when participants rated the general influence of a deadline before estimating <b>deal</b> <b>price</b> in a negotiation scenario. In Study 2, pairs of participants negotiated under a tight deadline. Myopic perception of a deadline was manipulated before the negotiation.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to help {{business}} marketers with offline channels to make decisions on whether to sell through Group-buying (GB) websites and how to set online price with the coordination of maximum deal size on GB websites. Design/methodology/approach: Considering the deal structure of GB websites especially for the service fee and minimum deal size limit required by GB websites, advertising effect of selling on GB websites, and interaction between online and offline markets, an analytical model is built to derive optimal online price and maximum deal size for sellers selling through GB website. This paper aims to answer four research questions: (1) How to make a decision on maximum deal size with coordination of the <b>deal</b> <b>price?</b> (2) Will selling on GB websites always be better than staying with offline channel only? (3) What kind of products is more appropriate to sell on GB website? (4) How could GB website operator induce sellers to offer deep discount in GB deals? Findings and Originality/value: This paper obtains optimal strategies for sellers selling on GB website and finds that: Even if a seller has sufficient capacity, he/she may still set a maximum deal size on the GB deal to take advantage of Advertisement with Limited Availability (ALA) effect; Selling through GB website may not bring a higher profit than selling only through offline channel when a GB site only has a small consumer base and/or if there is a big overlap between the online and offline markets; Low margin products are more suitable for being sold online with ALA strategies (LP-ALA or HP-ALA) than high margin ones; A GB site operator could set a small minimum deal size to induce deep discounts from the sellers selling through GB deals. Research limitations/implications: The present study assumed that the demand function is determinate and linear. It will be interesting to study how stochastic demand and a more general demand function affect the optimal strategies. Practical implications: This paper provides a very useful model framework and optimal strategies for sellers’ selling on GB website. It takes advantage of the analytical model to explain much typical practical phenomenon for E-commerce like free sale with limited availability and so forth. It also helps GB website operator to induce deep discount from sellers. Originality/value: This paper is a first attempt to examine the seller's GB sale decision problem regarding to price and bounds on deal sizes.

The {{theme of}} the master’s work is „The {{assessment}} and analysis of Latvian real estate market” The objective of the master’s thesis is to analyze real estate market in Latvia by giving conclusions and proposals for its further problem solving and analysis. If compared with developed cities like Helsinki or Berlin, dwelling fund is not large enough but this {{on the other hand}} gives potential of growth to it. In five years from 2001, when one working inhabitant can buy 1 sqm. with one months salary till 3 quarter of 2006 when one worker should spend 3 salaries to buy the same 1 sqm., situation has changed. Also, Riga inhabitants are paying more than inhabitants of other European cities. However it is not predicted that in the next months prices will go up in Riga microdistricts and nearby territories as the number of potential credit takers has decreased by taking into account coefficient of price per sqm. to income. In the situation of ever increasing building costs it is predicted that prices will go up for new dwellings, however. Thus government and municipalities should work actively to foster building of new houses, stop people emigrating from Latvia, should finance programs to assist young families and young people with limited money resources to obtain their first dwelling. Main tendency in the office market in march, 2007 is increasing demand for quality offices and trading places. Prices of land have increased very fast In nearby Riga - by 60 %, in 2006 as people have flown away from Riga to build their own houses The government measures taken to curb inflation of real estate prices have some of the effects on the real estate market –but negative impact is least felt by those who buy house/ apartments for living or land for building house. Measures have more pronounces effect on speculators. Generally everybody will be negatively impacted by more regulations as additional payments in taxes and payments are due when making real estate deals. Situation should be changed however to avoid situation where deal makers use techniques to avoid paying or decrease payments to budget Amount of duties should not be increased by more than 1 % of the <b>deal</b> <b>price</b> to bring more money in budged and help to protect people from fraud...|$|E
