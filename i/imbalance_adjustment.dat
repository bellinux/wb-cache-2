40|$|Recent {{empirical}} research rejecting twin deficits in indebted countries and current account imbalances adjustment in Europe {{led to the}} idea to test the twin imbalances at different public debt-to-GDP intervals. The analysis covers 14 EU countries over the time period 1995 - 2012. A panel data threshold model with fixed effects estimates two debt-to-GDP thresholds (40. 2 % and 96. 6 %), which determine three debt-to-GDP intervals in the twin relationship. If public debtto-GDP is less than 40. 2 %, the model determines a negative relationship (twin divergence) between budget balance and current account. Twin deficits (surpluses) are confirmed exclusively if debt-to-GDP is in the interval between 40. 2 % and 96. 6 %. A twin divergence is also confirmed if public debt-to-GDP is more than 96. 6 % (e. g., as in Greece and Italy).

40|$|A {{large number}} of interpretations has been {{proposed}} for current global imbalances, {{with a variety of}} future scenarios for world economy. The perspective here adopted tries to be fully respectful of the assumption of global economic interdependence as well as to cope with the complexity of a political, and not exclusively an economic, problem. By the use of the three alternatives outlined by Keynes in his 1945 memorandum "Overseas Financial Policy in Stage III" for the restart of multilateralism at a global level, we propose to rearrange views about current imbalances according to the unilateral, bilateral or multilateral nature of the adjustment they propose - if any - for their unwinding. Comparisons are made between Keynes's "Starvation Corner" and "gloomy views", together with scenarios suggesting the need of unilateral adjustments. Keynes's "Temptation" is used to analyse views stating that global imbalances are sustainable due either to the working of market mechanisms, related to the strength of the American economy, or to the (tacit) agreement of a "revived Bretton Woods system". The parallel with Keynes's "Justice" leads to consider views highlighting shared responsibilities for the imbalances and prompting for collective actions to reduce them.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{emergence}} of large current account imbalances in a few large countries, the factors behind the emergence, the role of those imbalances in the financial crisis of 2008 - 09, {{and the implications of}} achieving global balance. Imbalances reflect a country’s net savings and suggest that growth in GDP of a surplus country is partly dependent upon growth in external demand of deficit countries. Although a country can incur a surplus or deficit for ever, we suggest that the increasing surpluses of relatively large and rapidly growing countries is likely to be destabilizing to global growth in the long-run. The adjustment will likely require a surplus country, such as China, to rely more on domestic demand for growth while a deficit country, such as the U. S., may need to rely more on external demand for growth. We suggest the Eurozone imbalances are not directly linked to U. S. imbalances. There are a variety of potential causes of global imbalances including excess savings in surplus countries, the twin deficit hypothesis, the export-led growth hypothesis, and the possible miss-measurement of the U. S. current account due to repatriation of profits from U. S. owned foreign affiliates. However, whatever the combination of causes of the growing <b>imbalances,</b> <b>adjustments</b> need to be made to return to long-terms sustainable growth. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|The {{influential}} work of Obstfeld and Rogoff {{argues that}} a closing-up of the US current account deficit involves a large exchange rate adjustment. However, the Obstfeld-Rogoff model works exclusively via demand-side channels and abstracts from possible supply-side changes. We extend the framework to allow for endogenous supply-side changes and show that this fundamentally alters the mechanism of the adjustment process. Allowing for such an extension attenuates quite significantly the implied exchange rate adjustment. The paper also provides some empirical evidence of variations in the supply-side structure and correlations with the exchange rate and the current account. The policy implications are that measures to foster a supply-side reaction would facilitate the external adjustment by alleviating an exclusive reliance on demand and exchange rate changes, with the latter being potentially destabilising for the global financial system.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} causes of the transpacific trade {{imbalances}} using an empirical global model. It also evaluates the impact of various policies to reduce these imbalances. We find the fundamental cause of trade imbalance since 1997 is changes in saving-investment gaps, attributed to the surge of the U. S fiscal deficits and the decline of East Asia's private investment after the 1997 financial crisis. Our simulation results show that a revaluation of East Asia's exchange rates by 10 percent (effectively a shift in monetary policy) cannot resolve the imbalances. We find East Asia's concerted efforts to stimulate aggregate demand can have significant impacts on trade balances globally, but the impact on the US trade balance is not large. US fiscal contraction is estimated to have large impacts on the US trade position overall and on the bilateral trade balances with East Asian economies. These results suggest that in order to improve the transpacific <b>imbalance,</b> acroeconomic <b>adjustment</b> will need to be made {{on both sides of the}} Pacific. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of a real current account {{adjustment}} on terms of trade, aggregate productivity and welfare-based exchange rate in a two-country general equilibrium model. As in Melitz (2003), firms are heterogeneous in productivity and endogenously enter and exit their domestic and export markets. The real adjustment of the current account leads to the increase of Home exports through the intensive and the extensive margins of trade : incumbent firms export more and new exporters endogenously enter the market. In the benchmark case, the extensive margin of trade accounts for about 19 % of the overall adjustment and the depreciation of the national currency is lower with respect to models where this margin is not considered. In the literature, the change in the terms of trade is lower when goods are more substituable. This common finding is overturned by the endogenous entry of new exporters. For a given dispersion of productivity across firms, a higher elasticity of substitution reduces the role played by the extensive margin on the adjustment and yields a higher depreciation of the exchange rate.

40|$|The {{crisis in}} Greece and other mainly {{southern}} Eurozone countries {{has been discussed}} primarily as a fiscal issue. Current account deficits of the same countries have received less attention {{in spite of the}} relatedness of current account and fiscal deficits. We argue that the failure of many countries within the Eurozone to develop adequate internal adjustment mechanisms is also an important factor behind the crisis. After reviewing the major perspectives that have been offered on the crisis, we present data that support our argument by demonstrating the lack of price and cost convergence in the Eurozone since 1999. Ironically, it seems that the surplus countries have carried out more of the adjustment pointed to by the endogenous optimum currency area (OCA) theory than the deficit countries. We recommend that the responsibility of a ‘European Debt Surveillance Authority’ should include surveillance of intra-euro payment flows, <b>imbalances</b> and <b>adjustment</b> in labour and goods markets, and setting benchmarks for the Eurozone guarantees of sovereign debt based on ability to adjust internally. Thereby, a potential moral hazard problem of an implicit Eurozone guarantee of countries’ sovereign debt could be avoided. ...|$|R

Macroeconomic outcomes are distinguished from macroeconomic policies, structural reforms and reversals, shocks, and institutional constraints. Based on previous work, a composite measure of structural reforms is constructed for the 1970 - 2004 period. We find that outcomes and policies are more volatile in low growth episodes, while shocks (except U. S. interest rates) are similar across episodes. Fiscal policy volatility is associated with lower growth, but fiscal policy procyclicality is not. Low levels of market-oriented reforms and structural reform reversals are also associated with lower growth.

First, it affected the official exchange rates and its determination, hence fiscal developments for the country. At the same time, the windfall also led to an unbalanced sectoral change within the economy. Both {{the internal and external}} economic situation since the oil shock had shown persistent <b>imbalances</b> requiring <b>adjustments.</b> In analysing the oil shock effect, a comprehensive assessment of the influences of exchange rates and structural adjustment problems employs the valuable strengths of the monetary approach aspects of exchange rates determination; particularly on the question of external payments adjustment and of inflation of domestic price levels. The function of exchange rate as an instrument of stabilization policy in an economy such as Nigeria is imperative. A relatively stable exchange rate standard in a world of significant variability is important in evaluating the impact of exchange rate changes on the economy; precisely because the financial infrastructures are at the developing state. When tight controls on the foreign trade sector also lead to the establishment of an unofficial market in foreign exchange, the question of stability would depend on which of the two markets adjust quicker. The market with the more rapid rate of adjustment can therefore provide a guide to exchange rate policy performance. In analysing the stuctural adjustments {{impact of the}} oil revenues, features of both national and global economic environment that are significant for macroeconomic performance, which are also proximately related to exchange rates determination are considered by using the dutch-disease framework.

However, it is not always possible to include all covariates in adjustment. We aimed to find the optimal imbalance threshold for entering covariates into regression. Methods We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations on virtual populations of 5, 000 subjects. We performed PS 1 : 1 nearest-neighbor matching on each sample. We calculated standardized mean differences across groups to detect any remaining imbalance in the matched samples. We examined 25 thresholds (from 0. 01 to 0. 25, stepwise 0. 01) for considering residual imbalance. The treatment effect was estimated using logistic regression that contained only those covariates considered to be unbalanced by these thresholds. Results We showed that regression adjustment could dramatically remove residual confounding bias when it included all of the covariates with a standardized difference greater than 0. 10. The additional benefit was negligible when we also adjusted for covariates with less imbalance. We found that the mean squared error of the estimates was minimized under the same conditions.

The running characteristic of a water-to-water GEHP has been investigated experimentally and the PER was measured. Based on the analysis and experimental results, it could be concluded that if both the gas-fired boilers and electric air conditioners are replaced by GEHPs in some percentage, we can narrow the gaps between the requirement and provision of electricity and natural gas and balance the seasonal consumption differences of electricity and natural gas between summer and winter simultaneously. In order to improve energy efficiency, environmental quality and energy consumption structure effectively, the governmental incentive policies for promoting use of GEHPs should be formulated in China and some other developing countries.

The empirical model uses as explanatory variables domestic output growth, price inflation, real exchange rate fluctuations, energy price inflation, global growth, and regional growth. The evidence from the estimation of the model indicates the importance of fluctuations in output growth to the cyclicality of the current and financial account balances. The necessary and sufficient condition to sustain a large current account deficit is high domestic growth, which tends to stimulate financial inflows and provides adequate resources for financing. Other factors appear to be less important to the cyclicality of the current and financial account balances and their negative correlations.

This is reflected by the fact that of the developed countries the USA is producing a substantial, historically unprecedented magnitude of current account deficit vis-a-vis the current account surplus of a well-defined group of mainly emerging countries and of some developed countries. This is probably not an optimal situation, {{and in the course of}} solving this problem there is the question of what impacts the Hungarian economy may be exposed to and what steps Hungarian monetary policy can take. In examining the various scenarios of global adjustment, it is important to distinguish between an adjustment originating in Asia or in the USA. The former stimulates the Hungarian economy, while the latter temporarily hinders the Hungarian economy. A correction triggered by the markets has stronger output consequences for the Hungarian economy, than that of a restrictive fiscal policy in the USA. Hungarian monetary policy has an effect on whether output or inflation will become more volatile. Hungarian monetary policy tracking the ECB involves higher fluctuations in inflation and lower changes in GDP, whereas the situation is just the opposite in case of independent policies. If the exchange rate of the forint weakens due to a decline in global risk appetite, this would initially result in growing inflation, although over the longer term even lower GDP and inflation cannot be ruled out either. global <b>imbalance,</b> current account <b>adjustment,</b> forcasting, simulation. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{reduction}} in the U. S. current account deficit vis-Ã -vis emerging Asia involves a shift in demand from U. S. to emerging Asia tradable goods and a change in international relative prices. This paper quantifies the required adjustment {{in the terms of}} trade and real exchange rates in a three-country open economy model of the U. S., China, and other emerging Asia. We compare scenarios where both Chinese and other emerging Asian export prices change by the same proportion to the case where export prices remain constant in one country and increase in the other. Our results are robust to different assumptions about elasticities of substitution and to introducing a high degree of vertical fragmentation in production in the model.

40|$|AbstractIn {{teenagers}} groups {{where there}} are positive interrelations, activities are more effective, thus the social climate, the level of socialization and interpersonal relationships are directly determined by positive and constructive learning experiences and influence the school adjustement of 9 th graders in high school environment. Socio-emotional imbalances can occur at any age over the time spent by the student in this context, being however more frequently in the transition from one stage of education to another, because these transitions require student's readjustment to new educational needs. The purpose of educational research aimed to analyse the relationship between establishing and maintaining dificulties of 9 th graders’ positive interpersonal relationships and their status within the class by means of sociometric techniques, qualitative methods, educational climate analysis in school activity. In this respect, our research was focused on experimenting an intervention program to improve the interpersonal relationships of these students. The lower interpersonal relationships skills of 9 th graders, the more will be reduced the quality and frequency of positive and constructive learning experiences, leading to emotional and behavioral disturbance and academic <b>adjustment</b> <b>imbalances.</b> Frequency and quality of constructive learning experiences are, significantly, the positive predictive factor not only for academic achievements, but also for socio-emotional equilibrium of adolescents, experiences that bring them satisfaction, success in relationships with others. At the 9 th graders the conflict states are strongly influenced by the degree of communication and cooperation between them. In this paper we intend to exceed the investigation stage and accede to formative and improvement intervention level towards identification of feasible solutions for a quality educational practice, able to provide counselling of students concerning optimal preparation for social life. We discuss scientific and educational implications of these results for understanding the development of social and emotional skills among adolescents and for educational practices designed to promote this development...|$|R
