40|$|We {{explored}} {{patterns of}} change in bacterioplankton and phytoplankton community composition in response to typhoons in a subtropical, subalpine freshwater humic lake in Taiwan. Thermal profiles with depth, nearsurface dissolved oxygen, and meteorological conditions were measured at high temporal resolution using an <b>instrumented</b> <b>buoy.</b> We collected samples across a time series spanning two typhoon seasons and assessed bacterial community composition {{at each time point}} using a fingerprinting technique targeting the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA operon. Wind and rain associated with the typhoons mixed the otherwise stably stratified water column. After each of six typhoon-induced mixing events, the bacterial community composition was reset to similar conditions, revealing a surprisingly deterministic pattern of recovery that was reminiscent of secondary succession following large infrequent disturbances in terrestrial ecosystems. Distinct bacterial assemblages were associated with epilimnion and hypolimnion samples collected more than 80 d after a mixing event. These assemblages were also distinct from the communities observed in the generally unstratified water column within 7 d after a typhoon. Our results were surprising since bacterial communities are not expected to respond in such predictable ways because of their immense complexity and diversity. In contrast...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{hydrocarbon}} seepage from marine environments is {{an important}} source of methane and other gases to the atmosphere. Quantifying this flux is necessary for constraining global budgets and understanding local air pollution sources. A field of strong hydrocarbon seepage offshore of Coal Oil Point near Santa Barbara, California produces extensive areas of bursting bubbles at the sea surface. An <b>instrumented</b> <b>buoy</b> was deployed in the Coal Oil Point field to measure directly the atmospheric gas flux from three seeps of varying size and intensity. Spatial scales of continuity of the seeps, quantified by semivariograms, are small, ranging from < 1 m to about 9 m such that flux values on larger scales are uncorrelated. These de-correlation scales are comparable to the horizontal extents of individual bubble plumes estimated visually at the sea surface. Semivariograms for each seep are used in an ordinary Kriging procedure to interpolate flux measurements onto a regular grid and produce objective maps of the spatial distribution of flux. Spatial integrals yield total flux estimates from the three seeps of ~ 7400 m 3 day- 1 which amount to 4 - 13 % of the total flux from the Coal Oil Point field based on estimates from previous studies...|$|E

40|$|The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) and the TNO Physics and Electronics Laboratory (TNO-FEL) {{deployed}} in situ sensors near and on Meetpost Noordwijk (MPN) during MAPTIP {{to describe the}} surface layer processes and also to evaluate models for near-surface aerosol profiles. Vertical profiles of aerosol counts were measured on the MPN tower by TNO-FEL with Rotorod impaction samplers. The aerosol distribution measurements were made for l 0 radius bins, with centered radii ranging from 6. 5 to 75 pm. Atmospheric surface-layer turbulence and stratification were measured by NPS from an <b>instrumented</b> <b>buoy</b> that was located {{a short distance from}} MPN. Existing models relate aerosol profiles to source, sink, and turbulent transport processes. The assumed source process is bursting air bubbles at the surface. The removal processes are turbulent deposition and gravitational fallout. Turbulent transport is described by the friction velocity and the near-surface stratification. The combined buoy and MPN data sets are shown to provide valuable descriptions of surface layer properties during the variable period from 26 October through 3 November. Results from eleven profile sampling periods were compared with model predictions for which buoy measured parameters and aerosol sizes were inputs. The predicted concentration often decreased more with height than observed. This is believed due to the coastal input to the aerosol source since advected aerosol would reduce influences on gradient of bubble production at the surface...|$|E

Temperatures calculated for thirty-four images covering the period May 2000 to March 2002 are compared with {{water temperatures}} measured at 10 <b>instrumented</b> <b>buoy</b> locations supplied by the Savannah River Technology Center. The data set {{was used to examine}} the effect of image quality on temperature retrieval as well as to document any bias between the sensor chip arrays (SCA's). A portion of the data set was used to evaluate the influence of proximity to shoreline on the water temperature retrievals. This study found errors in daytime water temperature retrievals of 1. 8 C for SCA 2 and 4. 0 C for SCA 1. The errors in nighttime water temperature retrievals were 3. 8 C for SCA 1. Water temperature retrievals for nighttime appear to be related to image quality with the largest positive bias for the highest quality images and the largest negative bias for the lowest quality images. The daytime data show no apparent relationship between water temperature retrieval error and image quality. The average temperature retrieval error near open water buoys was less than corresponding values for the near-shore buoys. After subtraction of the estimated error in the ground truth data, the water temperature retrieval error was 1. 2 C for the open-water buoys compared to 1. 8 C for the near-shore buoys.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of JERICO-NEXT are {{to address the}} challenge of observing the complexity and high variability of coastal areas at Pan-European level, in the framework established by European Directives (WFD, MSFD) and the operational marine services. The JERICO-NEXT project aims at extending the EU network of coastal observations developed in JERICO (FP 7) by adding new innovative infrastructures while integrating biogeochemical and biological observations. The main target of JERICO-NEXT is to provide the researchers with continuous and more valuable coastal data coupling physical and biological information. The JERICO research infrastructure (JERICO-RI) is valorised through six Joint Research Activity Projects (JRAP) that address key environment challenges and scientific questions; the ultimate objectives being to maximise the value and impact of the RI while providing key recommendations for the further development of the infrastructure, in terms of sampling capabilities, representativeness of coastal processes, support to services, among others. Each JRAP gathers {{a critical mass of}} expertise from the consortium, allowing tackling the challenges of multi-disciplinarity and the variability of European coastal environments. The present report (D 4. 1) summarises the approaches proposed for assessing the value and the present and future relevance of the JERICO-RI, to provide high-value datasets for addressing these key challenges at European level. Dedicated sampling strategies have been elaborated and formulated to answer key scientific questions, related to these challenges and will be tested during the next two years of the project, with the aim to provide sounded inputs to the JERICO-RI science strategy (WP 1. 2) for the short term, and concrete recommendations to the roadmap for the future. Focus is set on (1) integrating physical, chemical and biological observations for improved understanding of complex coastal key-processes; (2) testing/integrating new technologies and methodologies of high added-value for the observation of the coastal processes.   JRAP- 1 - Pelagic biodiversity Biodiversity of plankton, harmful algal blooms and eutrophication Most phytoplankton species are beneficial to the marine ecosystems, since they form the base of the food-web, but some may be harmful. The EU Marine Strategy Framework descriptors on biodiversity, food webs, invasive/non indigenous species and eutrophication (Harmful Algal Blooms = HAB) are being addressed in JRAP- 1. HAB are also relevant e. g. to human health, fisheries, aquaculture and tourism. Traditional phytoplankton monitoring is often made at low sampling frequencies due to high cost. In JRAP- 1 automated systems for investigating phytoplankton diversity and abundance with a focus on harmful algae are used on research vessels, ferries and at fixed ocean observatories in the Baltic Sea, the Kattegat-Skagerrak, the North Sea-eastern English Channel area and in the Western Mediterranean Sea. One aim is to combine different methods to make cost efficient observations. Another aim is to measure at a frequency high enough to approach resolving the natural variability. Field work is underway; flow cytometry and bio-optical measurements are some of the methods used. Two workshops on methodology, data handling, planning of common work and early results will be arranged in 2016. An <b>instrumented</b> <b>buoy</b> has been deployed in the Northern Baltic proper. Ferrybox systems on three ships in the Baltic Sea are in operation. Bio-optical data are being collected continuously and automated water sampling is also carried out. Water samples are analysed in the laboratory, e. g. for phytoplankton composition. The Utö observatory in the Archipelago Sea is being set up. The focussed studies in the Baltic Sea will be carried out in 2017. In the Kattegat-Skagerrak a study of plankton dynamics near a mussel farm at the Swedish Skagerrak coast will be made in August-October 2016. Also instrumented oceanographic buoys and a Ferrybox system are in operation. One objective of the study is to investigate the coupling between physical processes and harmful algal blooms. The focus organisms are phytoplankton that produces biotoxins that may accumulate in shellfish. In the eastern English Channel – North Sea area the phytoplankton are being studied using automated systems on several research vessels, ferries, instrumented buoys and also using fixed ocean observatories. Flow cytometers are operated on the research vessels. By combining the different data set the development of algal blooms can be followed. Phytoplankton functional diversity and spatio-temporal distribution at the meso-scale are studied also in the western Mediterranean thanks to the installation of a new Ferrybox system with a flow cytometer and additional instruments on the ferry “Le Carthage”. In 2017 and partly also in 2018, additional field work implying at least two partners and several methods will be carried out in JRAP- 1 and the data collected will be combined with results from other JERICO-NEXT activities. The combination of results from JRAP- 1, data on the carbonate system related to primary production, data from HF radar, results from physical models etc. will lead to an improved understanding of the dynamics of algal blooms and to cost efficient observation systems.   JRAP- 2 One approach in view of monitoring the ecological quality status of benthic habitats is to: (1) assess the relationship linking disturbance intensity, benthic diversity and ecosystem function, (2) monitor disturbance intensity, and (3) use it as a proxy. In coastal Seas, this approach is clearly complicated by the spatial heterogeneity and the strong temporal dynamics of both disturbances and benthic communities. It is therefore essential to develop approaches allowing for a sound assessment of spatio-temporal changes in disturbance intensity and its effects on benthic habitats. This can be achieved through comparative studies provided that: (1) spatio-temporal changes in disturbance intensity are properly assessed (e. g. through modelling), (2) temporal and spatial integration scales of biological/biogeochemical compartments processes are determined, and (3) appropriate data analysis procedures are used. The overall aim of JRAP- 2 is therefore: (1) to carry out several actions (new sequences of observations) in view of practically assessing the interaction between disturbance(s), benthic diversity and functions, and (2) by doing so to contribute to define an optimal strategy to assess the interactions between these three parameters/ processes. More specifically, considering the remineralization of Particulate Organic Matter (POM) settling at the sea-floor as an indicator of the functioning of the sediment-water interface, JRAP- 2 will deploy a series of measurements of  (1) benthic (both micro and macro-) diversity, and (2) the functioning of the water-sediment interface in different study areas facing different sources of disturbance. This includes: (1) the West-Gironde Mud Patch, a major pro-delta exhibiting strong spatio-temporal gradient in sediment stability and organic enrichment; (2) the Bay of Brest, an area which is suffering from dredging and is also currently experimenting a colonization by the invasive American slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata; and (3) the Cretan Sea, a largely oligotrophic area locally and temporarily affected by the sewage outfall of the city of Heraklion.   JRAP- 3 Marine coastal waters are receptors of thousands of chemical pollutants emitted through waste water, deposited from the atmosphere or released directly to the sea from vessels or other coastal infrastructures during both professional and recreational activities. Priority lists for regulations are generally limited to a few dozens of chemicals with well-studied toxic properties. There is a paucity of information on marine water contamination and fate and distribution of contaminants in the marine ecosystem. Gathering fundamental information {{on the nature of the}} contaminants present in coastal water, their distribution and possible biological responses is necessary to implement regulation and marine protection (as requested by chapter 8 of the EU-MSFD). These activities are currently out of reach of national and international routine monitoring programmes in Europe and beyond, due to elevated costs and delay in developing adequate regulation. The overall goal of JRAP- 3 is to exploit the coastal infrastructure network and the set of parameters to deliver a “transversal” study where contamination data, biological data and water quality data will be fully integrated. Specifically, the addressed objectives are: i) to identify new contaminants in European coastal waters that are not yet addressed by regulation but which can pose a pressure to the coastal marine ecosystem; ii) to describe spatial distribution of chemical contaminants in European coastal waters exploiting integrated fixed and mobile monitoring infrastructures; iii) to investigate the patterns of the spatial distribution exploiting information from physical and chemical sensors available on the infrastructures; iv) to analyse co-linearity between contaminant signals and biological signals (specifically tracking the presence of pollution feeding microorganisms in areas with high exposure to chemical contaminants. Through these activities, JRAP- 3 will contribute in valorising the JERICO-RI in the context of the descriptor 8 of the MSFD. The work is articulated in 3 tasks in the following areas: Portuguese coasts, Bay of Biscay, North Sea, Kattegat, Skagerrak and Norwegian coasts. Task 1 includes the first pan-European monitoring of chemical pollutants using passive samplers deployed on moorings. Task 2 foresees monitoring campaigns using a set of Ferrybox platforms (mobile) in the outflow of the Baltic (Oslo and Kiel transect), the North Sea, and the Norwegian Sea. Task 3 focuses on a high spatio/temporal resolution campaign based on Ferrybox platform along the Oslo-Kiel transect focusing on the analysis of coupled chemical signals (several pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and biological responses (DNA-based biomarkers of bacteria adapted in feeding on chemical pollutants. In all cases, physical/optical parameters from sensors present on the selected infrastructures will be used along with chemical and biological parameters, to identified collinearities between the signals. Complementary {{objectives of}} JRAP- 3 are: i) To deliver technical protocols and best practices for the monitoring of chemical pollutants using existing coastal infrastructures. ii) To optimize existing chemical sensor technology for use on fixed coastal monitoring infrastructures. iii) To provide guidelines for the implementation of contaminant monitoring using JERICO infrastructures. We expect to provide a substantial contribution to expand the list of emerging contaminants discovered in European coastal waters and demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated large scale (pan-European) observation of marine chemical pollution. We will also focus on delivering the first large scale correlative analysis integrating contaminant data and microbial data to tackle biological responses in relation to exposure to pollution.   JRAP- 4 Surface transport in coastal areas is driven by a large variety of processes (tides, current instabilities, coastal jets, eddies, fronts, etc.) acting simultaneously, in response to different forcing, and over a broad spectrum of time-space scales. These processes play a key role in the dispersal/retention of pollutants, planktonic species, and more generally in cross-shelf exchanges. The characterisation and better predictability of these structures are critical to understand the physical and biological interactions in the coastal zone and to accurately monitor the resulting complex surface circulation. In this context, the JRAP 4 aims to demonstrate the potential of coastal observatories and the JERICO Research Infrastructure for the understanding and monitoring of the 4 D shelf/slope circulation. Additional effort is devoted to quantify the potential impact of ocean transport on the distribution of floating and dissolved matter in line with the 2, 7 and 10 Marine Strategy Framework Directive descriptors. Through JRAP 4, several new deployments, in addition to historical observations, will be used to make a step forward on the characterisation of the main coastal ocean processes and resulting 4 D transports at different temporal and spatial scales. The work will concentrate in three pilot areas (SE Bay of Biscay, NW Mediterranean and German Bight) and rely on the use of information from Observing Systems (OS) based on HF radar for surface currents, moored high-frequency thermistor chains, drifting buoys and high-resolution numerical model experiments (OSSES). Three main work lines common to all the study areas are defined as follows: (i) retrieval of 4 D transports in each study area through an optimal observational strategy and applying eulerian and lagrangian analyses, (ii) use different methods to obtain transport short time prediction using data or combination of data and models and (iii) apply 4 D transports to address issues in relation with different MSFD drivers. Specific actions within the different study areas will be devoted on producing information and maps on integrated transport that can be used as a basis for several applications, including those of interest of other JRAPs.   JRAP- 5 "Coastal carbon fluxes and biogeochemical cycling" Marine carbon cycle has a key role on global climate change. In open oceans, carbon uptake is dominated by physical dynamics and chemical processes (solubility pump), while in productive coastal areas with high spatial and temporal variability biological processes may dominate (biology pump). While solubility pump aims in balancing atmospheric and marine pCO 2, the biological pump depends on the rates of primary production and respiration. In both cases the physical state of the sea (mixing, temperature etc.) and carbonate system components need to be evaluated to get comprehensive description of air-sea carbon fluxes This JRAP will guide development of optimal observation network for C-flux studies, provide concepts and methods towards harmonized measurements and will ultimately give recommendations of setting up a combined physical, chemical and biological measurement network for carbon cycle studies as needed for understanding the role of coastal systems in global C cycles. During the spring 2016, we will first investigate and analyse the methodology used for carbon and biological observations within the JRAP participants. Based on outcome, a comparison WS may be organized. The main research period of this JRAP is from spring 2017 to spring 2018, in which we will collect combined carbon and relevant biological data throughout European Sea and analyse the data especially for spatial and temporal variability, and links between the biology, and physical and chemical state of the sea.   Concluded remarks If each JRAP is dedicated to one priority, efforts have been made to maximise cross-cutting activities between JRAPs, creating bridges where appropriate. For example, the link between physical (transport) process study (JRAP- 4), contaminant distribution (JRAP- 3) and forecasting capability (JRAP- 6) has been reinforced to maximise the outcomes of these JRAPs. Likewise, the connection between JRAP- 1 and JRAP- 5 has been emphasised when appropriate. The ambition of the sampling program for each JRAPs may partly be pending on other projects and funding sources, and might therefore need to be adapted the real context. The progress and a first revision of the sampling programs per JRAPs will be presented in D 4. 2. Feedback on the strategies after the field deployments and analysis will be communicated to the WP 1 in the lasted stage of the project (deliverable D 4. 5) ...|$|E

40|$|Field {{measurements}} {{from small}} boats and sparse arrays of <b>instrumented</b> <b>buoys</b> {{often do not}} provide sufficient data to capture the dynamic nature of biogeophysical parameters in may coastal aquatic environments. Several investigators have shown the MODIS 250 m images can provide daily synoptic views of suspended sediment concentration in coastal waters to determine sediment transport and fate. However, the use of MODIS for coastal environments can be limited {{due to a lack}} of cloud-free images. Sediment transport models are not constrained by sky conditions but often suffer from a lack of in situ observations for model calibration or validation. We demonstrate here the utility of MODIS 250 m to calibrate (set model parameters), validate output, and set or reset initial conditions of a hydrodynamic and sediment transport model (ECOMSED) developed for Lake Pontchartrain, LA USA.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} landings by tuna purse seine fishing vessels are taken around drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). Although these FADs {{and their use}} by the fishing industry to capture tropical tuna have been well documented, operative tools to collect data around them are now required. Acoustic, video, photographic and visual data were collected on fish aggregations around drifting FADs in offshore waters of the western Indian Ocean. Multibeam sonars, multifrequency echosounders, pole-mounted digital video camera and an automated 360 ° rotating digital photographic camera were deployed from a vessel {{in the vicinity of}} FADs, and their observation capability evaluated with underwater visual census made by divers. Two prototypes of <b>instrumented</b> <b>buoys</b> equipped with scanning sonar were tested providing positive results on their feasibility and operability as pelagic observatory. Acoustics methods combined with digital underwater video represent interesting possibilities to remotely study the composition and behaviour of these fish aggregations. The acoustic methods allowed the accurate description of the spatial organisation and dynamics of individual fishes, schools and biotic scattering layers around the FAD, but species identification was difficult. In situ visual, photographic and video observations systems permitted species identification within a range of 0 to ~ 25 m. However, scuba divers observations were more efficient compared to the photographic and video cameras at detecting the presence of certain fish species around FADs. Obviously both methods are complementary, since the acoustic methods could not identify most fish species and could not detect the presence of small fishes found less than 5 meters under the FAD. These fishes represent {{a small part of the}} overall biomass of fish aggregations but they are part of the biodiversity of pelagic ecosystems and may play a major role in ecological processes associated with FADs. The opportunity to incorporate observation tools into the development of future autonomous <b>instrumented</b> drifting <b>buoys</b> for remotely monitoring fish diversity and abundance in the pelagic ecosystems is presented. The perspective of autonomously collecting large amounts of basic information useful for ecological and fisheries studies in an ecosystemic approach for open sea or coastal pelagic environment is emphasized.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} {{a method to}} observe pelagic fish around rifting fish aggregating devices (DFADs). A triple-frequency vertical echosounder was employed to observe fish distributions {{in the vicinity of}} DFADs. Surveys were conducted in a star pattern that was centred at the DFADs. The objective {{of the study was to}} define a methodology for future acoustic studies. This goal was pursued by (i) studying the spatial distribution of fish aggregations, (ii) developing concepts for the grouping of observed aggregations and (iii) developing specifications for future autonomous acoustic tools. For this purpose 5 cruises were carried out in the western Indian Ocean. The multi-frequency approach proved useful as a means of separating acoustic detections into sound-scattering layers (e. g. plankton and micronekton), fish aggregations and individual fish. Fish target strength (TS) was measured. Four types of aggregations were found near DFADs: (i) dense structure (ii) medium structure (iii) loose structure and (iv) structure consisting of separated targets. More than 90 % of these structures were found within a radius of 400 m and about 75 % within 200 m of the DFADs. The spatial configuration of DFAD fish aggregations appeared to be more dynamic compared to aggregations near moored FADs. The spatial distribution and structure of DFAD aggregations have direct implications for their catchability by tuna purse-seiner. We have carried out the first quantitative acoustic recordings around DFADs, and obtained a better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fish aggregations around DFADs in the Indian Ocean. Based on this knowledge we are now working on specifications for <b>instrumented</b> <b>buoys</b> that are intended as autonomous data recording observatories for such pelagic environments...|$|R

The telemetry system {{will be used to}} telemeter oceanographic data from an experimental <b>instrumented</b> ocean <b>buoy</b> to be moored at continental shelf depths on Cobb Seamount to shore facilities at Seattle, Washington. Cobb Seamount is located in the Pacific Ocean approximately 300 {{miles off the coast of}} the State of Washington. A general description of the telemetry system and its operational characteristics, which are dictated by the statistical characteristics of the meteor burst mode of propagation, is presented. This is followed by a more detailed description of equipment elements of the system. The developmental status, the results of a propagation path field test, and plans for additional tests are discussed. Development results to date are sufficiently encouraging to generate confidence in the utility of a meteor burst telemetry system for oceanographic data acquisition...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{is quite}} clear that for {{studying}} Arctic climate changes, and better understand interacting processes {{it is essential to}} follow an integrated approach for observing and modeling the whole Arctic system encompassing the atmosphere, the ocean and sea-ice at once. Due to the difficulties in retrieving key parameters, satellite observations alone are not the right answer. The project we are developing, is an attempt to tackle this challenge by providing and maintaining a new integrated observing network of <b>instrumented</b> <b>buoys</b> over the Arctic Ocean in order to collect simultaneously and in real time information related to the state of the upper Ocean, the lower Atmosphere and the Arctic sea-ice/snow. It is planned to operate several autonomous platforms in a network in the Arctic Ocean for a period of at least 5 years. Each platform is equipped to vertically sense and profile key variables in the ocean, sea-ice and atmosphere using- CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) vertical profilers sensors collecting ocean temperature and salinity down to 800 m depth,- Temperature and heat conductivity in snow and ice from ice-mass-balance systems- Cloud and aerosol lidar profiling of the lower atmosphere- Diffuse and direct solar flux using wide angle radiometer- Meteorological standard parameters at the surfacePlatforms allow measurements to be transmitted in near real time via Iridium satellites. As they will be drifting, it is planned to replace part of them every year. Major tests were performed deploying progressively fully equipped IAOOS platform at the North Pole in April 2012, 2013 and 2014. These platforms drifted from the North Pole in April to Fram Strait (September, October) providing spring summer and fall field data. Important fieldwork for IAOOS was also taking place within the Norwegian ice camp on board R/V Lance organized by the Norsk Polar Institute from January to June 2015, as part of the Norwegian young ICE (N-ICE 2015) cruise project. These intensive tests were very timely. The first IAOOS array deployment will start in August 2015 from R/V Araon during the Korean cruise organized by the KOPRI in the Canadian Basin and from R/V Polarstern during the German cruise TRANSARC II organized by the Alfred Wegener Institute in the Eurasian Basin. First results obtained in the frame of IAOOS will be presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel variational Wave Acquisition Stereo System (WASS) that {{exploits}} new stereo reconstruction techniques for accurate {{estimates of the}} spatio-temporal dynamics of ocean waves. WASS has a significant advantage as a low-cost system in both installation and maintenance. A stereo camera view provides three-dimensional data (both in space and time) whose statistical content is richer {{than that of a}} time series retrieved from wave gauges, ultrasonic <b>instruments</b> or <b>buoys,</b> the latter being expensive to install and maintain. Indeed, wave spectra can be easily estimated from the multi-dimensional images obtained with WASS. The estimated spectra present an inertial range that decays as k- 2. 5, k being the wave number, in agreement with wave turbulence theory (Zakharov 1999, Socquet-Juglard et al. 2005). Further, the empirical probability density functions derived from the reconstructed surface data compare very well with theoretical models (Tayfun & Fedele 2007, Fedele 2008). The variational WASS is a promising technology with broader impacts in offshore engineering since it will enrich the understanding of the statistics of waves for an improved design of offshore structures...|$|R
40|$|Ships of {{opportunity}} such as scheduled ferry services offer {{the potential for}} cost effective oceanographic measurements to be undertaken with a high temporal resolution. This provides a convenient mechanism to measure near surface water properties {{as a series of}} transects along regularly scheduled routes. There are many potential applications for this kind of system which can effectively compliment more traditional approaches to marine based monitoring such as <b>instrumented</b> moorings, <b>buoys,</b> satellite image analysis and dedicated research cruises. Typical applications include environmental monitoring, scientific studies of coastal and shelf seas, and the provision of validation data for numeric modelling and assimilation purposes. OPne such system or FerryBox has been implemented by Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL) aboard and Irish Sea passenger ferry servicing the Birkenhead to Dublin/Belfast, Ireland routes. This paper discusses the design, implementation and proposed future development of the FerryBox from an engineering based perspective.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the cycling of dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients using moored <b>instrumented</b> <b>buoys</b> (SmartBuoys) during the spring bloom in the North Sea. The instrumentation on the buoys enabled high frequency measurements of water-column integrated irradiance and in situ chlorophyll to be made, and also preserved water sample collection which were used for dissolved inorganic and organic nutrient analyses. The SmartBuoys were located in the year-round well-mixed plume zone associated with the River Thames and in the summer stratified central North Sea. These site locations allowed comparison of nutrient concentrations and cycling, and spring bloom development at two contrasting sites. The spring bloom was expected to be initiated at both stations due to increasing insolation and decreasing suspended load leading to higher water-column integrated irradiance. Due to differences in suspended load between the sites, the spring bloom started ~ 2 months earlier in the central North Sea. The spring bloom in the Thames plume also resulted in higher maximum phytoplankton biomass due to the higher pre-bloom nutrient concentrations associated with riverine input. The use of SmartBuoys is also shown to allow the cycling of dissolved organic nutrients to be examined over the critical, and often undersampled, spring bloom period. Dissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON) clearly increased during the spring bloom in the central North Sea compared to winter concentrations. DON also increased in the Thames plume although showing greater winter variability related to higher riverine and sedimentary dissolved organic matter input at this shallow (~ 18 m) coastal site. DON increase during the spring bloom was therefore related to primary production at both sites probably due to active release by phytoplankton. At both stations DON decreased to pre-bloom concentrations as the bloom declined suggesting the released DON was bioavailable and removed due to heterotrophic uptake and production. The preserved nutrient samples from the central North Sea site were also suitable for Dissolved Organic Phosphorus (DOP) analysis due to their low suspended load with similar trends and cycling to DON, albeit at lower concentrations. This suggested similar processes controlling both DON and DOP. The variable timing of short term events such as the spring bloom makes sampling away from coastal regions difficult without the use of autonomous technology. This study demonstrates for the first time the applicability of using preserved samples from automated buoys for the measurement of dissolved organic nutrients...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. An <b>instrumented</b> spar <b>buoy,</b> Met-on-a-Stick (MOAS), was designed, deployed, and validated {{for measuring the}} air sea interface processes at multiple levels. This system was deployed in June 2010 {{off the coast of}} California, and January and February 2011 in Monterey Bay. The system provides mean measurements of wind, temperature, and humidity at multiple levels within 3 m above the sea surface and measurements of sea surface temperature at three levels below ocean surface. It is small enough to be deployed and retrieved by two people. This thesis work introduces the design and the instrumentation of the system and evaluates the ability of the system for characterizing near-surface vertical variations of the marine boundary layer. The results indicate that the platform performance is as expected and is capable of providing measurements to characterize the fine variations close to the air-sea interface. We foresee a broad use of the MOAS in the future due to its low-cost and ease of deployment. Future improvements of the system include the use of better wind and GPS sensors to increase the quality of wind and wave measurements from the MOAS...|$|R
40|$|Lake Analyzer is a {{numerical}} code coupled with supporting visualization tools for determining indices of mixing and stratification {{that are critical}} to the biogeochemical cycles of lakes and reservoirs. Stability indices, including Lake Number, Wedderburn Number, Schmidt Stability, and thermocline depth are calculated according to established literature definitions {{and returned to the}} user in a time series format. The program was created for the analysis of high-frequency data collected from <b>instrumented</b> lake <b>buoys,</b> in support of the emerging field of aquatic sensor network science. Available outputs for the lake Analyzer program are: water temperature (error-checked and/or down-sampled), wind speed (error-checked and/or down-sampled), metalimnion extent (top and bottom), thermocline depth, friction velocity, Lake Number, Wedderburn Number, Schmidt Stability, mode- 1 vertical seiche period, and Brunt-Vaisala buoyancy frequency. Secondary outputs for several of these indices delineate the parent thermocline depth (seasonal thermocline) from the shallower secondary or diurnal thermocline. Lake Analyzer provides a program suite and best practices for the comparison of mixing and stratification indices in lakes across gradients of climate, hydro-physiography, and time, and enables a more detailed understanding of the resulting biogeochemical transformations at different spatial and temporal scales.

30|$|Time-series {{observation}} of settling particle from a sediment trap deployed {{adjacent to a}} surface <b>buoy,</b> <b>instrumented</b> for meteorology, physical oceanography, and biogeochemistry, revealed that cyclonic eddies are likely an important mechanism for nutrient supply. Unlike the spring bloom, which occurs after deep winter mixing brings nutrients to the surface, eddies tend to supply the nutrients to a level below the surface that {{is still in the}} euphotic zone. As a consequence, the resulting bloom occurs below the surface and is not apparent in satellite data. For this reason, we refer to this as a “missing nutrient source.” Surprisingly, typhoons were not observed to {{play a significant role in}} the nutrient supply in this study. While we have focused on the supply of nutrients from deep winter mixing, eddies, and typhoons, other sources may also contribute. In particular, further work is needed to quantify the role of N 2 fixation and eolian input for supplying nutrients in this oligotrophic ocean region.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOwing to the {{predicted}} and already observed dramatic impact of climate warming in the Arctic, {{there is a great}} need for monitoring this region not only to assess the magnitude of changes but also to understand the physical processes governing heat, salt and dynamical exchanges between ocean, ice and atmosphere, with improvement of climate models predictability as a challenging perspective. OPTIMISM (Observing dynamical and thermodynamical Processes impacting The sea-Ice Mass balance from In Situ Measurements) is a 4 -year ANR/IPEV-funded project (2009 - 2013) involving 5 French laboratories. A backbone aspect of this project is the development of an autonomous <b>instrument</b> ("Ice-T" <b>buoy</b> + "BEAR" meteo mast), providing a comprehensive observation of the relevant parameters driving the sea ice mass balance. Processes are investigated from observations collected at two main sites: the central Arctic, and a coastal polynya of the Svalbard archipelago. A complementary approach, yet an ongoing task, is to build up a high resolution (< 2 km) ice-ocean modelisation of the Svalbard area to simulate physical processes in an Arctic coastal polynia. These spatially-limited regions have been recently known to contribute significantly to the dense water formation of the Northern Hemisphere. The simulation is based on the most recent ice and ocean models (LIM 3 - NEMO 3. 4). It runs over a period long enough to study interannual variability but it also includes high frequency dynamics such as tides, which partly drive turbulent mixing and thus control ice melting and dense water formation.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{documents}} {{the study of}} the radar signature of the sea surface on the images collected by an X-band weather radar and its application to remote sensing of the coastal zone. The main radar parameters considered here are the reflectivity factor [which was converted into a normalized radar cross section (NRCS) ], the differential reflectivity, and the mean radial velocity. Measurements of the NRCS in the vicinity of an <b>instrumented</b> offshore <b>buoy</b> allowed for identifying its variations with wind speed and relative direction, which are found to be consistent with the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) model and other measurements. A more accurate empirical model for the NRCS is developed. For moderate to strong winds, the mean radial velocity is linearly related to the radial component of the wind speed, showing the potentiality of weather radars to map the radial surface wind speed at the scale of a basin. The influence of surface currents is weak here but should be likely taken into account in other places with stronger currents. Measurements of the differential reflectivity are also consistent with other measurements made elsewhere for the polarization ratio. The analysis of radar data over the entire coverage could also be performed using surface wind estimates from a meteorological model. Similar but less accurate results are obtained for the NRCS and the mean radial velocity. The extra spatial variability not due to wind speed variations is identified. An inversion procedure is proposed to recover the wind vector field from radar measurements after calibration of the NRCS values. Results are promising and pave the way to the concept of weather radar for ocean remote sensing...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{validation}} of satellite-derived winds includes comparison with insitu {{data collected by}} <b>instruments</b> located on <b>buoy</b> platforms or ship masts. These comparisons, though not perfect due to the spatial/temporal mismatch between the observations, are useful {{for most of the}} typical wind conditions found over the oceans. Validation of satellite high wind speeds is more difficult as buoy and ship data are frequently not available or are not always accurate under such intense weather conditions. The Ku- 2001 geophysical model function used to derive 10 -meter surface wind speeds and directions from the SeaWinds (on QuikSCAT) scatterometer observations delivers wind speeds between 0 and 70 m/s. Here, we present validation results from several case studies used to determine the accuracy of retrieved winds greater than 20 m/s. These studies show winds above 20 m/s are 5 – 10 m/s too high. We also introduce results from an improved model function, Ku- 2003. The QuikSCAT data will be entirely reprocessed with this new model function and re-released later this year...|$|R
