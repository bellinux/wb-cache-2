5|$|Contrary to {{what many}} outsiders believed, most {{residents}} of the Walled City behaved similarly to other Hong Kong natives. In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households. The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents used them to relax, and children would play or <b>do</b> <b>homework</b> there after school.|$|E
5|$|The {{students}} learn {{during their first}} day of classes that academics are weighed equally with performance. Doris, overwhelmed by the energy and spontaneity in the lunchroom, flees and meets Montgomery. As the year progresses, Coco tries to convince Bruno to book performing gigs with her. Doris befriends Montgomery, but worries that she is too ordinary against the colorful personalities of the other students. Leroy and his English teacher, Mrs. Sherwood, clash over his refusal to <b>do</b> <b>homework.</b> It is later revealed that Leroy is illiterate and ashamed to admit it. Bruno and his father argue over Bruno's reluctance to play his electronic music publicly. Miss Berg, the school's Dance teacher, warns Lisa {{that she is not}} working hard enough. Michael, a graduating senior, wins a prestigious scholarship and tells Doris that the William Morris Agency wants to send him out for auditions for television pilots.|$|E
25|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive genetic blood disorder {{which leads to}} alterations {{in the shape of}} red blood cells. Not only can SCD impact the immune system, but it can lead to complications with memory. Children with SCD have shown impairments in event-based prospective memory. They may struggle with aspects of daily life that require prospective memory, such as forgetting to <b>do</b> <b>homework</b> even with a schoolbag nearby. More importantly, it is more difficult to manage the disease as they can forget about when to take medication or go to a doctor appointment. These effects can also persist into adulthood.|$|E

25|$|George and Madeline took a kind {{but firm}} {{approach}} in rearing their children, encouraging {{hard work and}} regular schedules. In his autobiography, White relates that his parents ran a strict schedule on Sundays; they locked him in his room for silent prayer, a time so boring that he almost begged to <b>do</b> <b>homework.</b> His father forbade Walter from reading any books less than 25 years old so he chose to read Dickens, Thackeray, and Trollope {{by the time he}} was 12. When he was 8, he threw a rock at a white child who called him a derogatory name for drinking from the fountain reserved for blacks. Events such as this shaped White's self-identity. He began to develop skills to pass for white, which he used later to preserve his safety as a civil rights investigator for the NAACP in the South.|$|E
25|$|Once girls enter school, patriarchal {{norms and}} values work against norms {{and values of}} modern {{education}} which aims to provide equal education for boys and girls. Parents may allow girls to attend school but still expect them to fulfill traditional duties rather than giving then time to <b>do</b> <b>homework</b> or arrive at school before school gates are shut. Girls are expected to participate in class contrary to their training for non-participation. If girls try to meet school norms for participation they are subjected to psychological violence reinforcing patriarchal norms. Girls may also be subjected to violence and abuse at home if they act on new school norms contrary to tradition. This clash of norms continues {{on the way to}} and from school with older boys and adult men seeing adolescent girls as unprotected by marriage. Consequently, girls experience physical and sexual violence and are at risk of abduction. Girls' attempts to cope with the educational system may increase their risk of violence and sexual abuse. Girl students were some of the main perpetrators of violence against other girls and they could act as go-betweens for boys in the hope that boys would favor them.|$|E

40|$|We aim {{to explore}} the {{independent}} associations of sedentary behaviors (SB) with body mass distribution among Chinese children. Data on the screen-based sedentary time (television viewing and computer use) and <b>doing</b> <b>homework,</b> physical activities and dietary intake of 1586 Chinese children (50. 3 % girls) aged 7 – 15 years were obtained through validated questionnaires. Skin-fold thickness, body height, and weight were measured to calculate percent body fat (%BF), fat mass index (FMI), and fat-free mass index (FFMI). Parental characteristics were collected by questionnaires. Among girls, time of SB (screen time or <b>doing</b> <b>homework)</b> {{was positively related to}} %BF, FMI, and FFMI (p 0. 09), while time of <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> was positively related to %BF and FMI (p = 0. 03).

50|$|An {{example of}} a highly evaluable {{attribute}} is the SAT score. It is widely known in the United States that an SAT score below 800 is very bad while an SAT score above 1500 is exceptionally good.

40|$|We take a {{different}} look at the PISA 2006 data considering time input {{as one of the}} main ingredients for scholarly achievement. Across countries there does not exist any clear relationship between total time spent studying (sum of class time, homework time and time spent in private lessons) and scholarly achievement, while more individual study time (homework time or private lessons) seems to relate negatively to scholarly achievement. On the other hand at the country level, better performing students are clearly the ones spending more time in class and <b>doing</b> <b>homework.</b> However, when considering different groups of students, this positive relationship breaks down. For instance girls, students with a migratory background, and in some countries private school students spend more time <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> but perform worse. In order to establish a causal relationship between time input and educational output we estimate a production function for education controlling for students' individual characteristics and different school environments. Results show that while the productivity of additional study time varies across countries, more classes {{and to a lesser extent}} more time spent <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> have a positive effect on scholarly achievement while the effect of private lessons is negative or at most insignificant...|$|R
