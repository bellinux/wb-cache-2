40|$|Evidence for {{shellfish}} toxin {{illness in}} British Columbia (BC) {{on the west}} coast of Canada {{can be traced back to}} 1793. For over two hundred years, domestically acquired bivalve shellfish toxin illnesses in BC were solely ascribed to paralytic shellfish poisonings caused by algal blooms of Alexandrium. This changed in 2011, when BC experienced its first outbreak of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). As a result of this outbreak, Canada’s first DSP symposium was held in November, 2012, in North Vancouver, BC. Three of the objectives of the symposium were to provide a forum to educate key stakeholders on this emerging issue, to identify research and surveillance priorities and to create a DSP network. The purpose of this paper is to review what is known about shellfish poisoning in BC and to describe a novel volunteer network that arose following the symposium.

The benefit of using HYCOM boundary conditions instead of climatology is established by comparing the nested model to altimetry, in situ temperature time series, andADCP and high-frequency (HF) radar currents. Jointly with the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, the model is applied to assist in <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>bloom</b> forecasts. The model currents are used to estimate the trajectories of water parcels where red tide organisms have been detected. This system {{has been able to}} simulate the onset of the 2005 red tide event. HF Radar Currents are assimilated to improve the shelf circulation. An ensemble simulation of the WFS ROMS model is carried out under different wind forcings in order to estimate the error covariance of the model state vector and the covariance between ocean currents and winds. Radial currents measured by HF Radar antennas near St. Petersburg and Venice, FL, are assimilated using this ensemble-based error covariance. Different assimilation techniques using a time-average ensemble, a filter to reduce surface gravity waves and an extended state vector including wind stress were tested. Results of WFS ROMS model assimilating surface currents show an improvement of the model currents not only at the surface but also at depth.

40|$|National audienceSince {{several years}} an {{alarming}} worldwide expansion of <b>Harmful</b> <b>Algae</b> <b>Bloom</b> (HAB) {{was observed in}} coastal and / or confined waters. Alexandrium catenella, a paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) producer, is now regularly found in Thau lagoon (south of France) at concentrations up to 15 x 106 cellules. l- 1. In the same periods, events of oyster’s mortality are also observed causing huge economic losses. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the relationship between these toxic events and mortality phenomenon. For that, we conducted a field work to evaluate the presence of the toxic A. catenella in Thau lagoon during the years 2013 and 2014 in which high mortality of oysters spats were observed in spring. At the same time, we experimentally infected spats with the pathogenic bacterium V. tasmaniensis LGP 32 and kept them unfed or previously fed either with the toxic alga A. catenella or with nontoxic algae, Alexandrium tamarense or Tisochrysis lutea. Results showed that the toxic alga was present in the lagoon when spats' mortalities occurred suggesting A. catenella could be involved in these events. Moreover, our laboratory experiment showed that the exposure to A. catenella increases the susceptibility of spats to one of its pathogens, V. tasmaniensis LGP 32. Those results both together suggest for the first time that, in the environment, toxic algae could be implicated in oysters’ mortality. Further studies should be conducted to determine the main factors of this alga implicated in weakening oysters and their immune system against their pathogen which lead to these large scale mortalitie...|$|E
40|$|Light {{from the}} Sun {{reaching}} the Earth and sea surface contains the entire wavelength band from ultraviolet (180 - 400 nm), visible (400 - 700 nm) and {{far into the}} infrared and radio wave region (> 700 nm). The light penetrates into the sea, and gives energy to phytoplankton and macroalgal photosynthesis. The different wavelengths of the light is selectively absorbed by the sea water itself and by different active optical components in the water such as phytoplankton, coloured dissolved organic matter and total suspended matter. The major goal {{of this study is}} to elucidate, understand and to predict the behaviour of these optically significant components. The thesis describes the development, from the start of the <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>bloom</b> (HAB) monitoring in Norway (1988) from moored buoys with optical instruments and a HAB observation network along the Norwegian coast, until today (2009) using hyperspectral imagers on different platforms as airplanes, balloons or kites. The use of different platforms such as satellite remote sensing combined with ship-borne water sampling and analyses of chlorophyll a, total suspended matter and turbidity (Ferrybox), the Norwegian HAB observation network and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment analysis of water samples as a classification tool are all combined in this study. The combination of these tools is still available because Norway has an active HAB observation network and functional Ferrybox network mounted on ships of opportunity. In the experiment from 2004 the Ferrybox was mounted on the coastal express vessel Trollfjord. Hyperspectral techniques are shown to be useful to monitor and forecast phytoplankton and kelp distribution. Methodology for the use of hyperspectral imaging (HI) from airplane to detect kelp forests and HI combined with a microscope for optical fingerprinting of different pigment-groups of micro- and macro algae are demonstrated. The results also show that HI is a valuable tool for local remote sensing, and an extended tool for identification, calibration and validation of remotely sensed ocean colour.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{targeted}} high frequency monitoring and modern machine learning methods lead to highly predictive models of benthic light flux. A state-of-the-art machine learning technique {{was used in}} conjunction with a high frequency data set to calibrate and test predictive benthic lights models for sites dominated by the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. Datasets of incident light flux, waters depth, wind speed, wind direction and benthic light flux were collected at two sites, Deception Bay and Eastern Banks, in Moreton Bay, Queensland, that are affected by the toxic marine cyanobacteria L majuscula. Random forest models were calibrated and validated using the dataset. The models predict benthic photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) based on wind speed, wind direction, water depth and incident light. The two benthic light models produced have high predictive capacity with R- 2 values of the order 0. 8 for both calibration and validation. Wind speed and/or direction influenced the prediction of benthic PAR in the model at each site, suggesting that wind-driven sediment resuspension is an important process in controlling water clarity and hence benthic PAR at both sites; a result consistent with many previous examples from coastal regions. In particular, wind direction had a marked affect on benthic PAR at the partially sheltered Deception Bay site compared to the fully exposed Eastern Banks site. Consistent with other <b>Harmful</b> <b>Algae</b> <b>Bloom</b> (HAB) species, eutrophication has been identified as a common link between sites affected by L majuscula blooms. However, we show here that at least one major bloom of L majuscula in Deception Bay coincided with light conditions for optimal L majuscula photosynthesis, supporting the hypothesis that toxic blooms are a result of a confluence of causes rather than just one. We argue that at eutrophied sites, variation in parameters such as temperature and light rather than nutrients are more likely to cause blooms. This study demonstrates that collection of high frequency variables related to aquatic light flux combined with state of the art machine learning techniques, such as the random forest algorithm, can produce highly accurate models of light flux at shallow coastal sites. These models provide management with the beginnings of an early warning system and scientists with a practical tool for catching the bloom at the incipient stage rather than after the bloom has already developed.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Researchers have {{observed}} {{a rise in}} <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> (HAB) of cyanobacteria in shallow freshwater lakes in Washington State {{over the past two}} decades. Cyanobacteria comprising these blooms produce a range of toxins, including the hepatotoxin microcystin, that may be harmful to humans and domestic animals. Recreational exposure to microcystin has been associated in other regions with short-term illnesses including gastrointestinal issues and long-term illnesses such as liver damage. Further, acute poisoning following exposure to microcystin may occur in concentrations above 1 mg/L. A primary route of recreational exposure in Washington lakes is incidental ingestion of water while swimming. From 2009 through 2011, algal populations and toxin production were monitored between June and October in 30 lowland lakes. Additionally, a survey evaluating human behaviors and exposure factors was administered to residents living around six of these lakes and five control lakes. Microcystin concentrations in many lakes consistently exceeded the Washington recreational guidance value of 6 µg/L, including values greater than 100 µg/L and reaching as high as 18, 400 µg/L. Results of the behavioral survey suggest the presence of <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> reduces recreational activity, with the majority of swimming days occurring between June and September. A quantitative risk assessment model incorporating algal bloom patterns, observed toxin concentrations, recreational behavior, and dose response relationships of algal toxins was developed to assess whether the production of microcystin in freshwater algal blooms poses a significant risk to public health through acute recreational exposure...|$|R

Un año mas tarde, en marzo de 2002, una segunda proliferación, conformada por la misma especie, se reportó cerca de Cabo Corrientes con una concentración de 1. 6 x 10 (6) céls l - 1. Ambos casos estuvieron relacionados con la presencia de bajas temperaturas en la superficie del mar y no estuvieron asociadas con fenómenos de intoxicación y mortalidad From April 26 th to May 15 th 2001, a large {{algae bloom}} was {{observed}} off Tumaco Bay on the Pacific coast of Colombia. This was the first <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>bloom</b> (HAB) reported in the region, and reached Gorgona Island, about 120 km north. Ayear later, starting March 2002, an offshore HAB developed from Cabo Corrientes North to Solano Bay. The typical abundance during the blooms reached 7. 5 x 10 (6) cells l- 1 for the 2001 event and 1. 6 x 10 (6) cells l- 1 for the 2002 event. During both events, low temperature and high salinity were recorded. Typical measurements {{in the area are}} 27 - 27. 5 °C and 30 - 31. 5 psu. Values observed during the two events were 24 - 24. 6 °C and 33 - 34 psu; 3 °C below normal and more than 2. 5 psu above average values. These conditions are indicative of local upwelling processes {{at the time of the}} events. On both occasions, cells corresponding to the Alexandrium catenella/fundeyense/tamarense complex represented 99 - 100 % of the biomass. It was difficult to differentiate the cells from A. catenella, but the presence of short chains of only 4 cells (single cells represented most of the biomass) was suggestive of A. tamarense. Shape, dimensions, and detailed structure of the apical pore complex, first apical plate, posterior sulcal plate, and position of the ventral pore on plate 1 ’ of cells were consistent with the description of A. tamarense, which has not been reported in the tropical East Pacific. The Control Center of Pacific Contamination of the Maritime General Direction of the Colombian Navy has been monitoring the area since 1994 without finding this species or HABs. This leads us to consider the two events as caused by recently introduced species, where local upwelling processes favor permanent and cyclic HABs. However, during these two events, there were no reports of effects on marine biota or of human poisoning, probably because the blooms occurred some distance offshore and far from exploited shellfish bed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) toxins {{that include}} Okadaic Acid (OA) and its analogues (Dinophysis toxins) are {{produced}} by several marine dinoflagellates of the genera Dinophysis and Prorocentrum (Reguera et al., 2012). These toxins are especially dangerous during <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>bloom</b> because filter-feeders bivalves such as mussels, scallops, oysters, clams and other marine organisms can bio-accumulate them posing a serious threat for the human health regarding shellfish consumption worldwide (Yasumoto and Murata, 1990;FAO, 2004). The main symptoms of DSP usually appear early, between 30 minutes to 12 hours after ingestion and they include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal distress (Yasumoto et al., 1978). They disappear in 2 - 3 days and so far there are no documented reports of human fatalities due to DSPs. OA is a polyether derivative of a C 38 fatty acid that was first isolated from the marine black sponge Halichondria okadai, usually found across the Pacific coast of Japan. OA structure was studied in 1981 by Tachibana et al. (Tachibana et al., 1981). It has been widely accepted since 1990 {{that one of the}} main mechanisms of action of OA and its derivatives is the strong inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatases PP 1 and PP 2 A (Takai et al., 1987;Honkanen et al., 1994;Dawson and Holmes, 1999;Louzao et al., 2005). However, recent papers suggested that it should be re-evaluated (Louzao et al., 2003; Louzao et al., 2005;Vilarino et al., 2008;Espina et al., 2010) especially when focusing on the exact triggering mechanism of the diarrheic effects (Munday, 2013). In this preliminary work, we have studied the possible effects that OA could cause in the intestinal tract when the toxin is ingested. For this purpose, samples of the small intestine of mice treated by gavage with this DSP toxin were examined and compared to control samples using images obtained with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to discern any structural changes induced by OA in such tissue. Material and Methods Animals and Treatments: All animal procedures were conducted according to the principles approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of the Universidad de Santiago de Compostela. A total of 6 CD- 1 female mice (Charles River Inc., Barcelona, Spain), weighing 18 – 23 g were used. Mice were divided in treated specimens (3 mice) and controls (3 mice). The animals were kept in a controlled environment with a stable temperature (23 ± 2 °C) and humidity (60 %– 70 %) for one week before the experiment, as well as fed with a diet for rodents containing 18. 5 % of protein (Harlan®). Twelve hours before the treatment all mice were singly housed and fed with physiological solution supplemented with glucose, in order to have fasted animals. The Okadaic Acid (OA) for the treatments had a purity of 99 % (Laboratorio Cifga S. A., Lugo, Spain) and was initially dissolved in ethanol. The toxin was then dissolved in physiological solution and administered by gavage to all the experimental mice at a concentration of 1000 μg/kg. Control animals were treated with the same physiological solution and vehicle (2. 5 % ethanol). Then all the mice were granted with free access to food and sacrificed after 24 hours in a carbon dioxide chamber. Immediately, samples of the small intestine were collected and stored in a stabilization solution and stored until further use. Preparation of samples for Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) : Intestine samples were treated with TEM fixative for 30 min at 4 °C in an orbital shaker at low speed. Fixative was then removed and the samples were rinsed three times with 0. 2 M cacodylate trihydrate buffer. Postfixation was carried out in 1 % OsO 4. Then the samples were rinsed again in 0. 2 M cacodylate trihydrate that was removed before the dehydration in graded ethanol solutions, including one bath of ethanol 70 % with uranyl acetate, cleared in propylene oxide and finally embedded in Epon 812 (Momentive Specialty Chemicals Inc., Houston TX, USA). Ultrathin sections of the samples were obtained with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome from Leica Microsystems GmbH (Wetzlar, Germany) and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Ultrastructural analysis was performed with a JEOL JEM- 1011 Transmission Electron Microscope (Jeol Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Results and discussion There is some controversy regarding the effects of OA and DSP toxins in the intestinal tract with highly variable results. Some authors found that when OA reaches the small intestine it could causes different degrees of damage to the epithelium including edema, ulceration, separation and destruction of villi of epithelial cells to cite a few (Ito et al., 2002;Le Hegarat et al., 2006). Nevertheless, other authors were unable to discern any significant damage or ultrastructure changes that could be related to the presence of OA (Tubaro et al., 2003;Vieira et al., 2013). In this preliminary work we found no clear effects of OA on small intestine tissue. TEM images of control mice samples presented the normal morphology of intestinal enterocytes, as expected. This is, cells with big and irregular nuclei with well-defined nucleoli, rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae surrounding the numerous mitochondria, some inclusions in the cytoplasm, noticeable indentations between adjacent cells with some desmosomes and tight-junctions visible and the most remarkable attribute, the presence of microvilli in the apical side of the plasma membrane that forms the brush border. However, there were some control samples where all these attributes were not so clear and even some vacuoles appear in certain fields. On the other hand, most samples of OA-treated mice showed a similar aspect to control cells, specially the microvilli in the apical side. Some vacuoles were also found in the cytoplasm of the cells. In Figure 1, representative images of the small intestine of control (A) and 1000 μg/kg OA-treated mice (B). The following structures are indicated: Microvilli/brush border (MV), desmosomes (D), amorphous cytoplasmic inclusions (I), vacuoles (V), mitochondria (M), and nucleus (N). In a recent paper Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2012) reported that a dose of 750 μg/kg OA produced microvilli damage on small intestine cells of ICR mice as early as 3 hours after treatment. However, the cells were able to gradually recover and after 24 hours they presented an apparently normal microvilli again. They also reported that the levels of serine/threonine protein phosphatases were reduced at 3 hours but normal after 24 hours. Nevertheless the expression of other proteins such as Villin 1 and hnRNP F were significant altered by OA suggesting that the diarrheic effects of this toxin were not only related to protein phosphatases as it has been extensively reported. Besides the microvilli alteration they noticed dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum after 3 hours of oral administration, and swelling, ridge disappearance and destroyed structure of the mitochondria after 6 hours. The small OA effect on intestinal cells could be related to the intestinal absorption of the toxin. It was recently reported that this toxin is not well absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract (Ehlers et al., 2011;Fernandez et al., 2014). In accordance with that it was registered a rapid excretion and elimination of OA in other in vivo studies (Matias et al., 1999). Our results support the little morphological effect of OA on intestinal cells. However, more interdisciplinary research is needed to obtain precise and reliable data to clarify the effects of OA in the intestinal epithelium and its relation with the diarrhea...|$|E

In 1990, volunteers began monitoring eight sites {{on a monthly basis}} April through October. Today, this effort has grown to include 21 sites that are sampled monthly for water quality around the Great Bay estuary, and six coastal sites that are monitored weekly for <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms.</b> Volunteers include adults, students, and home schooled families...|$|R
40|$|It is {{recognized}} that life strategies, heteromorphic life cycles and behaviour strategies (i. e. ent-excystement rates, vertical migration) {{play a key}} role in <b>Harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> (HAB) occurrence and dynamics; The interaction between different life history-stages and their relationship with the physical, chemical and biological environment are a very important element for the success of harmful species. In spite of the key role that life history strategies play in bloom dynamics, information on the life history of most European HAB species is fragmentary. LIFEHAB will be a forum of debate between European specialists in life history strategies of micro algal species causing HABs. The main goals are: to find out gaps in current knowledge, to determine the most appropriate methodologies, to identify future HAB research strategies in Europe and to promote the development of co-operative initiatives in that topic. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated {{eutrophication}} {{of marine}} ecosystems {{as a result}} of nutrient enrichment is a widespread problem within European marine margins. Eutrophication has several adverse effects on the marine ecosystem such as the formation of <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> reduced water clarity and reduced oxygen levels. The reliable quantification of the causative nutrients is challenging due to the matrix within which they are held. Here we propose methods for the identification and optimisation of appropriate detection chemistries for phosphate, ammonia, nitrate and nitrite in marine matrices. The work presented is carried out as part of the COMMON SENSE FP 7 European project. COMMON SENSE aims to provide a reliable sensing platform for in-situ measurements on key parameters relating to eutrophication. The nutrient sensor is based on a combination of microfluidic analytical systems, colorimetric reagent chemistry, low-cost LED-based optical detection, and wireless communications...|$|R
40|$|Red tides are <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> off {{the west}} coast of Floridacause by an {{organism}} called Karenia brevis. Karenia brevis is a unicellular dinoflagellate that produces a toxin called brevetoxin. K. brevis is very adept at thriving in hypersaline, high temperature (3 ̆c 30 oC) seawater with limited nutrients. The life cycle of K. brevis is complex and is associated with certain hydrographic, atmospheric, biological, and possible anthropological factors. The brevetoxin kills marine organisms and negatively affects human health. The damage caused by one red tide bloom event is estimated at 20 million affected fisheries, and tourism industries. Scientists, coastal managers, government and non-government agencies and stakeholders have developed possible management strategies. Aspects of these proposed management plans; specifically source of nutrients for initiation and bloom control techniques are hotly debated. This paper is a review of the scientific research and management strategies for mitigating Karenia brevis blooms...|$|R
40|$|As {{highlighted}} in Estuarine Ecohydrology, {{throughout the world}} estuaries have experienced environmental degradation and present proposed remedial measures based on engineering and technological fixes {{have been unable to}} restore the ecological processes of a healthy, robust estuary, and, as such, will not reinstate the full beneficial functions of the estuary ecosystem. This story of degradation is repeated worldwide also for coastal zones. The problem is more insidious, and harder to address, because historically coastal zones were seen as having essentially infinite capacity to dilute waste from human activities and because the fisheries resources were essentially free for all. Yet, just like estuaries, coastal waters are also suffering from increasing eutrophication, increasing turbidity, <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms,</b> fisheries collapse, and an increasing loss of biodiversity. At the same time these waters are increasingly polluted and impacted by hydrocarbons from low-level, chronic oil spills as well as occasional and often catastrophic oil spills. Some of these coastal waters are also showing signs of impacts by climate change...|$|R
40|$|Background: Unicellular {{dinoflagellates}} are {{an important}} group of primary producers within the marine plankton community. Many of these species are capable of forming <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> (HABs) and of producing potent phycotoxins, thereby causing deleterious impacts on their environment and posing a threat to human health. The recently discovered toxigenic dinoflagellate Azadinium spinosum is known to produce azaspiracid toxins. These toxins are most likely produced by polyketide synthases (PKS). Recently, PKS I-like transcripts {{have been identified in}} a number of dinoflagellate species. Despite the global distribution of A. spinosum, little is known about molecular features. In this study, we investigate the genomic and transcriptomic features of A. spinosum with a focus on polyketide synthesis and PKS evolution. Results: We identify orphan and homologous genes by comparing the transcriptome data of A. spinosum with a diverse set of 18 other dinoflagellates, five further species out of the Rhizaria Alveolate Stramelopile (RAS) -group, and one representative from the Plantae. The number of orphan genes in the analysed dinoflagellate species averaged 27...|$|R
40|$|Dinoflagellates are {{the large}} group of marine {{phytoplankton}} with primary studies interest regarding their symbiosis with coral reef and the abilities to form <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> (HABs). Toxin produced by dinoflagellates during events of HABs cause severe negative impact both {{in the economy and}} health sector. However, attempts to understand the dinoflagellates genomic features are hindered by their complex genome organization. Transcriptomics have been employed to understand dinoflagellates genome structure, profile genes and gene expression. RNA-seq is one of the latest methods for transcriptomics study. This method is capable of profiling the dinoflagellates transcriptomes and has several advantages, including highly sensitive, cost effective and deeper sequence coverage. Thus, in this review paper, the current workflow of dinoflagellates RNA-seq starts with the extraction of high quality RNA and is followed by cDNA sequencing using the next-generation sequencing platform, dinoflagellates transcriptome assembly and computational analysis will be discussed. Certain consideration needs will be highlighted such as difficulty in dinoflagellates sequence annotation, post-transcriptional activity and the effect of RNA pooling when using RNA-seq...|$|R
40|$|Members of dinflagellate genus Alexandrium are {{frequently}} linked to toxic incidents (i. e. PSP) and ecological impacts {{and thus are}} among the best characterized organisms of <b>Harmful</b> <b>Algae</b> <b>Blooms</b> widespread throughout many parts of the world. Some species in Alexandrium spp. (e. g. A. tamarense) produce secondary metabolites such as allelopathic substances, independent of PSP toxins, which can inhibit or even lyse other coexisting protists including both photosynthetic and heterotrophic species and could benefit Alexandrium spp. to overcome its relative low growth rate and/or resource uptake capabilities, which generally is believed to be of special importance under stress and tough environmental conditions. In this study, extracellular substances of Alexandrium tamarense were examined by quantification of allelopathic potency based on a bioassay with the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina under N-deficient compared to nutrient-sufficient conditions along various nitrate additions and growth phases in batch cultures, and under different N-limitations in semi-continuous culutres. The results indicate that extracellular compounds produced by Alexandrium tamarense play an allelopathic role, however, the production of exuded allelochemicals of Alexandrium tamarense was not stimulated by N-limitation. In contrast, slight but significant differences between non-limited control and N-limited treatments indicate that nitrate-limitation even decreased the lytic potency...|$|R
40|$|Alexandrium tamarense forms <b>harmful</b> <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> {{associated}} with a phenomenon called Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning in costal, temperate waters („Red Tides“). Reducing mortality caused by grazing to a minimum through active deterrence/defence against the predator increases the possibility of achiving positive growth rates for bloom development. Copepods {{are one of the}} major grazers in costal systems and Alexandrium cells showed a significant higher PSP-toxin content when exposed to different copepods, or their waterborne cues. The effect from grazers and/or their cues on Alexandrium cells using a microarray platform designed from several Alexandrium species EST databanks was further analyzed on a transcriptomic level. On this basis it was possible to identify a common set of genes showing regulation even in cases where no higher PSP-toxin content was measureable. These results indicate that a perception of waterborne cues from different copepods exists, and that it is measureable through global gene expression patterns. Given these facts, a subtracted cDNA-library from diverse induction experiments with different species interacting with Alexandrium was constructed. This is a promising approach to further analyze the genomic cascade behind induced defence and species interaction through waterborne cues in phytoplankton...|$|R
