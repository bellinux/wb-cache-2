5|$|Reubens spent a {{significant}} amount of his childhood in Oneonta, New York. As a child, Reubens frequented the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, whose winter headquarters was in Sarasota. The circus's atmosphere sparked Reubens' interest in entertainment and influenced his later work. Reubens also loved to watch reruns of I Love Lucy, which made <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to make people laugh. At age five, Reubens asked his father to build him a stage, where he and his siblings would put on plays.|$|E
5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E
5|$|When {{this episode}} was being produced, The Bachelorette was a {{bigger and more}} {{prolific}} program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC was not doing very well {{at the time of}} this episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would be doing in the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his buttocks in an aquarium tank in order to embarrass Cleveland and make <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting his naked buttocks on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version.|$|E

Museum silence became a source of torment, a kind of noise; he needed birdsong, breezes, trees.|$|E
25|$|During {{a holiday}} in Killarney, {{he listened to}} the Irish {{broadcaster}} Gerry Ryan on the radio. Evans claims the variety on Ryan's show made <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to return to radio. Evans was then hired by Virgin Radio to host its breakfast show, prompting an immediate upsurge in station listening figures of 1.8million to 2.6million. His first show was on 13 October 1997, the same day as Kevin Greening and Zoë Ball on Radio 1. Starting at 7:00am, Evans' crew presented the show from Monday to Friday, but without Evans participating on a Friday.|$|E

500|$|Ellis {{states in}} American Creations {{foreword}} {{that the book}} was prompted by repeated questions he received on his 2000 book tour for Founding Brothers negatively comparing presidential candidates George W.

He stated {{in an interview that he}} wanted to show that [...] "these folks didn't completely understand what they were doing... They were improvising on the edge of catastrophe." [...] Ellis did the research for the book personally, rather than working with research assistants. He wrote the manuscript by hand with a rollerball pen.|$|E

500|$|Jackson was {{inspired}} to create an album where [...] "every song was a killer" [...] and developed Thriller with that in mind. Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton gave detailed accounts of what occurred for the 2001 reissue of the album. Jones discussed [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and {{why it was so}} personal to Jackson, who struggled to deal with a number of obsessed fans. Jones wanted the long introduction on the song to be shortened; however, Jackson insisted that it remain because it made <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to dance. The ongoing backlash against disco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from the disco-heavy Off the Wall. Jones and Jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song [...] "Beat It". Eventually, they found Steve Lukather of Toto to play the rhythm-guitar parts and Eddie Van Halen of the rock band Van Halen to play the solo.|$|E
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "original" [...] or [...] "unique" [...] and praised its script's range of emotions and humor. IGN's Scott Thompson said the game teetered between solemn and audacious in its dialogue and gameplay, and noted its deviance from RPG tropes in aspects such as choice of attacks in battle. He found the game both [...] "bizarre and memorable". Official Nintendo Magazine Simon Parkin thought the game's script was its best asset, as [...] "one of the medium's strongest and idiosyncratic storylines" [...] that fluctuated [...] "between humorous and poignant". GameZone David Sanchez thought its script was [...] "clever" [...] and [...] "sharp", as it displayed {{a wide range of}} emotions that made <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to talk to all non-player characters. GamesTM wrote that the game designers spoke with their players through the non-playable characters, and noted how Itoi's interests shaped the script, its allusions to popular culture, and its [...] "strangely existential narrative framework".|$|E
500|$|Developers {{have cited}} Braid as an {{influence}} on their game design; The Guardian considered the game as the [...] "Sex, Lies, and Videotape" [...] of indie gaming, a potent symbol for the saleable potential of non-mainstream productions". Japanese video game developer Goichi [...] "Suda51" [...] Suda, developer of killer7 and No More Heroes, stated that playing Braid made <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to try making a 2D title. Tim can be unlocked as a playable character in Super Meat Boy, a game designed by independent game developer Edmund McMillen who had previously created Gish and the original character designs for Braid. Braid has also garnered academic interest and acclaim for its complexity, with narratologists saying [...] "Anyone who thinks... the unique constraints of game play cannot possibly be used to best structure a story has probably not encountered Braid, which marries pure mechanics and story into a philosophical platform." [...] Braids use of narrative elements and puzzle-making {{has been compared to}} similar techniques of [...] "imperative storytelling" [...] in novels such as Life A User's Manual and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E

500|$|Financially affluent, Williamson {{would often}} offer money or odd jobs to his acquaintances in the LGBT community. Among those whom Williamson befriended was Dwight Hayden, a closeted gay {{man in his}} mid-20s {{who had been a}} user of crack cocaine prior to 2002 and who was known locally as [...] "Dog" [...] and [...] "Swong". They met in New Kingston and Williamson helped Hayden out by {{purchasing}} newspapers which he could then sell on the streets. According to one of Williamson's flatmates, Desmond Chambers, [...] "I have seen [...] here about six times (and) anything <b>him</b> <b>want,</b> Brian give him. Brian give him money, Brian give him food and help him to purchase (newspaper) to sell on the road." [...] On 7 June 2004 Hayden arrived at Williamson's flat with another man, with Williamson welcoming them in and offering them bottles of Guinness. Hayden asked for money from Williamson, who agreed he would give it to him later in the evening. At this, Hayden attacked Williamson, stabbing him around seventy times.|$|E
500|$|According to Theron Martin, the OVA series School Rumble: Extra Class {{was made}} mostly for devoted fans; {{claiming}} that {{familiarity with the}} series is almost a necessity before watching it, although he later came {{to the view that}} it may also be useful as a sampler of the series. Chris Beveridge gives the OVA series an overall negative review. He did not highlight a single specific reason, instead observing that although all elements that [...] "make the TV series enjoyable are certainly present here, they just feel weaker". However, it did make <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to watch more of the television series, thus serving its intended purpose in keeping interest in the series alive. Katherine Luther endorsed the view that viewers need to be familiar with the story, but reviewed the OVA positively. While she noted lulls in the action, she believes fans will be able to overlook this. Unlike Martin, Luther did not believe the OVA is a good introduction to School Rumble, due to its short sequences and seemingly random nature.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with multiple}} critics lauding {{the performances of}} actors Anna Torv and John Noble. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote this his [...] "mind was blown not once, but twice" [...] due to the many revelations about two universes; Fringe [...] "has vaulted to {{the upper reaches of}} current television". In a second review, Tucker praised the [...] "beautifully, startlingly executed" [...] special effects when the [...] "hole" [...] in the universe closed. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A, and felt the episode made <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to go back and rewatch season one because the finale had [...] "so many references and back story nods that I wanted to have everything in my head together". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale [...] "leads to a wealth of possibilities... The déjà universe was a bold move. I can’t wait to see what our friends at Fringe do with it". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the [...] "excellent" [...] episode, and complimented [...] "the quietly creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension in the dual Walter/Olivia stories, the way those stories were skillfully woven together, the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia, Peter and Mr. Jones".|$|E

500|$|The {{students}} at South Park Elementary {{are assigned to}} read The Catcher in the Rye, and (especially the four main boys) grow excited when Mr. Garrison tells them that the book has caused so much controversy, it has been banned from {{public schools in the}} past. However, after reading the book, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are disappointed to find the content completely inoffensive, and feel the school has [...] "tricked" [...] them into reading. They decide to write their own offensive novel, The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (which they originally called The Tale of Scrotie McDickinass), with the intention of disgusting as many people as possible. Later, Stan's parents find the first draft and read it. They find it so disgusting that they repeatedly vomit while reading. However, they both absolutely loved the book. In fear that they will get into trouble for the book's content, Stan and the boys trick Butters into thinking that he actually wrote the book. Butters believes them because ever since reading The Catcher in the Rye, he feels as though he has been entering into [...] "altered states of consciousness" [...] that make <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to kill John Lennon, before he finds out (from his father) that Lennon is already dead ("Dangit!"). Later on, after learning that The Catcher in the Rye also inspired someone to shoot Ronald Reagan, Butters at first goes out to kill him too but is told that he is dead as well, much to his dismay.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Phantom Phorce was generally positive with Uncut {{stating that the}} album features an [...] "inspired overhaul" [...] of tracks from Phantom Power, the Western Mail describing the record as a [...] "mind-bending collection that radically re-works each track from the original record to create something entirely different, but equally appealing" [...] and musicOMH calling it [...] "an innovative and thoroughly enjoyable set of remixes". Some reviews {{pointed out that the}} album compares favourably with other remix albums with The Guardian calling Phantom Phorce [...] "stimulating and often rather beautiful, bucking the trend set by most other self-indulgent and pointless remix albums" [...] and the NME stating that [...] "hearing a rock band get the remix treatment is usually a mildly diverting experience rather than a life-changing one. So it's an extremely pleasant surprise to be faced with a whole album of the buggers ... and be thoroughly entertained." [...] Q stated that the commentary by 'Kurt Stern' {{was one of the best}} features of the album and The Times expressed surprise that these [...] "'amusing interludes' between tracks are actually funny", however Pitchfork Media found that 'Stern' [...] "gets in the way more than he helps" [...] and claimed that, by the time the listener had heard the full album he or she would [...] "likely consider redubbing it without [...] contributions". Reviewing Phantom Phorce for DiSCORDER magazine, Jordie Yow called it [...] "good, but not exceptional" [...] and claimed that the remixes simply made <b>him</b> <b>want</b> to listen to the original versions of the tracks while website Angry Ape was scathing, calling the album a [...] "bland & uninspiring package to put you off remixes for life" [...] and suggested that it was merely a [...] "cash-in" [...] by the band.|$|E
