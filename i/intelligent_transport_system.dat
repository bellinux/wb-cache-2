40|$|The main {{objective}} of Slovakia’s transport {{policy is to}} reduce the number of traffic accidents and increase safety on our roads. Implementation of <b>intelligent</b> <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> presents one of the possibilities how to meet this goal. Acceptance of these systems by motor vehicle drivers and other road traffic participants is necessary in order for them to fulfill their purpose. Only if the drivers will accept <b>intelligent</b> <b>transport</b> <b>systems,</b> it is possible to flexibly and effectively manage road traffic flexibly and effectively. From the perspective of a driver it concerns, in particular, the possibility of using alternative routes when traffic accidents or other obstacles occurs on the route that would significantly affect the continuity and safety of road traffic. Thanks to these technologies, it is possible to choose the appropriate route while driving, of course based on the criterion, which the driver considers the most important during the transport from origin to destination (driving time, distance from origin to destination, fuel consumption, quality of infrastructure). Information isare provided to the driver through variable message signs or directly in the vehicle (RDS-TMC). Another advantage of <b>intelligent</b> <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> is a positive impact on psychological well-being of the driver while driving. Additional information about the possible obstacles, weather conditions and dangerous situations that occur on the roads as well as alternative routes are provided to the driver well in advance.
