50|$|During the May 2007 fire in Griffith Park, the <b>helispot</b> {{was used}} to great effect to help fight the fire. At times there were two {{choppers}} on the pad and one waiting to tank up.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Helispots</b> {{are more}} {{temporary}} locations at the incident, where helicopters can safely land and take off. Multiple <b>Helispots</b> may be used.|$|R
50|$|The Mount Tammany Fire Road is an unpaved 4.5 mi road on {{the eastern}} {{ridgeline}} of Kittatinny Mountain from Upper Yards Creek Reservoir to Mount Tammany, the 1527 ft prominence on the New Jersey side of the Delaware Water Gap. The fire road, located within Worthington State Forest, is maintained as a firebreak and access road for wildfire suppression efforts by the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. There are three <b>helispots</b> along the fire road used by the Forest Fire Service.|$|R
5000|$|Staging Area: Can be a {{location}} {{at or near}} an incident scene where tactical response resources are stored while they await assignment. Resources in staging area are under the control status. Staging Areas should be located {{close enough to the}} incident for a timely response, but far enough away {{to be out of the}} immediate impact zone. There may be more than one Staging Area at an incident. Staging Areas can be collocated with the ICP, Bases, Camps, Helibases, or <b>Helispots.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>Helispot</b> is a {{location}} near a fire {{where it is}} safe for helicopters to land and take off. At this designated location, a <b>helispot</b> manager and usually a few helitack crewmembers will be onsite to coordinate landings and take-offs {{as well as the}} manifesting, loading and unloading of equipment and personnel. Helispots are temporarily located as the incident grows and can be found on ridges, meadows, parking lots - in short, any clearing suitable and meeting rotor clearance and hazard (wires, trees, etc.) avoidance requirements. Helispots are found on the incident map by filled in circles with the letters H-# next to it, the # designating what number it is.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{tanks are}} often {{permanently}} or semi-permanently mounted under the helicopter's belly, which {{can either be}} filled at a <b>helispot</b> via a hose from a fire engine, or with a [...] "snorkel", a long hose with a water pump in its end that can suck water out of a lake or small tank set up by fire crews.|$|E
50|$|A Helicopter {{drop point}}, or drop point {{is similar to}} a <b>helispot,</b> but used for depositing, often via longline, and caching supplies. Helicopters and supply {{vehicles}} use the drop point to off-load supplies at the edge of an incident for the ground teams to come by and pick up. Drop points may be located all around the fire. Wildland firefighters will usually pick up sharpened tools, pumps and hoses, water, food, radio batteries, etc. at the drop points. On an incident map, the symbol for a drop point is a filled dot with the letters D-# next to them with the # designating which number is it.|$|E
5000|$|A {{helitack}} helicopter {{will launch}} {{with a crew}} on board, drop them {{in the vicinity of}} the fire (or [...] "incident") where they will begin clearing a firebreak with standard hand tools, while the helicopter can then support the team with water drops, either with a Bambi bucket or airframe-mounted water tanks, or ferry in additional personnel (e.g., hotshot crews). If the fire continues to grow beyond the initial attack phase, the mission of the helitack crew shifts to a support role, locating and operating at <b>helispots</b> and helibases, where the coordination of the support required for other firefighting helicopters.|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} {{that aims to}} synthesize rotorcraft-specific Simultaneous Non-Interfering approach trajectories that minimize the noise impact in communities surrounding an airport. Simultaneous Non-Interfering procedures, which are currently being explored in both Europe and the US, allow rotorcraft to fly terminal area trajectories that do {{not interfere with the}} fixed-wing IFR traffic flows. For the synthesis of the optimized rotorcraft noise abatement procedures use has been made of an adapted version of NOISHHH, a trajectory optimization tool that was originally conceived for fixed-wing aircraft applications. The NOISHHH tool combines a noise model, an emissions inventory model, a geographic information system and a dynamic trajectory optimization algorithm to generate routings and flight-paths to minimize noise exposure in residential communities close to the airport, subject to a variety of operational constraints. To illustrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the rotorcraft-specific version of NOISHHH, a numerical example is given involving a hypothetical instrument approach to a <b>helispot</b> on runway 22 of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands.
