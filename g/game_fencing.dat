During {{the years of}} independence, preserving national traditions and values, special {{attention is paid to}} reach future generations. Examples of this process, forgotten folklore, traditions and taxes all are the recovery of the national games.Action of National Games {{is an integral part of}} the cultural life of our ancestors from the beginning. The majority of the games [...] are very ancient roots. They have centuries of spiritual enrichment of person’s thinking and feelings for religions service. Games, people, lifestyle and work reflected in the achievements. That is why, they are raising a generation of young [...] "School of Life" [...] function. A variety of expressive means rule or based on agreed terms of physical contests, competitions, events and performance requirements which reflect national values.Avicenna's [...] "Canon of Medicine", and the role of enforcement of struggle, about the healing experience properties of the game. Qayqovus (Keykavus), Omar Khayyam, (Beruniy) Biruni were being recovering chess, fencing, horse riding and other such kind of games. The works of Alisher Navai were organized in connection with the games, holidays, celebrations, weddings and there is a lot of information. They are described in the Rules of the executives of the holding of the Games. For the study of the history of National Games were defined in the work of Makhmud Kashgar called [...] "Office Lugotit Turkish" [...] (The character of work). The people mentioned it more than one hundred and fifty games in this case. In particular, [...] "Qoranguni" [...] (a stronghold in the dark), [...] "Band" [...] (the prisoners), [...] "Yutayotgan to’p" [...] (the ball winning), [...] "The fire of employment" [...] (stick <b>game),</b> <b>fencing,</b> “Nayzadorlik” (playing with spear) and other information is included about the games. The dictionary description of a few of the games today is fun for children and training for parents.|$|E
30|$|To {{answer these}} questions, we used data from an {{experiment}} {{conducted in a}} high-fidelity driving simulator. We have previously published results based on this experiment, focusing on investigating different AVC-relevant landscape settings (vegetation cover), with and without <b>game</b> <b>fencing</b> and in combination with encountering moose, and driving behaviour (speed responses) to various countermeasures at relatively short distances (i.e. 500 – 300  m before, 200 – 0  m during and 300 – 500  m after) from the location where the countermeasures were implemented [24, 31]. Here, however, we present data from longer driving distances up to 2  km after the implemented countermeasures, a speed camera, a wildlife warning sign and a radio warning message, and include the drivers view on the countermeasures and, moreover, also discuss the implications for road planning practice.|$|E
40|$|Seminar paper,Save Valley Conservancy in {{south-eastern}} Zimbabwe is {{the largest}} amalgamation of privately owned ranches devoted to wildlife production, in Africa. Its members have converted their properties from cattle operations into components of what is in effect a private game reserve, with internal <b>game</b> <b>fencing</b> having been removed in accordance with a constitution that was adopted m. 991. his land use transition {{has not been a}} smooth process because the policy environment has not been conducive to the ongoing development of the conservancy since 1995. Despite recognition at a technical level of the conservancy as a new model for sustain; bk land use, the attitudes of government authorities towards commercial wildlife production have hardened, mainly because of underlying and intensifying political trends related to land ownership within Zimbabwe. The individuals and agencies that have catalyzed the development of this conservancy have exerted their efforts along three dimensions: ecological sustainability, economic sustainability and sociopolitical sustainability. Although the ecological and economic achievements of the conservancy are already clear, its socio-political sustainability is less certain. The policy environment under which the conservancy has evolved, and the policy environment which it must now adapt to, warrant analysis m view of the applicability of this large-scale conservancy model to other African areas of limited agricultural potential...|$|E

40|$|Savanna {{ecosystems}} are geographically extensive and both ecologically and economically important; they therefore require monitoring over large spatial extents. There are, in particular, large areas within southern Africa savanna ecosystems that lack consistent geospatial data on vegetation morphological properties, {{which is a}} prerequisite for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of ecological resources. Given the challenges involved in distinguishing and mapping savanna vegetation assemblages using remote sensing, the objective {{of this study was to}} develop a vegetation morphology map for the largest protected area in Africa, the central Kalahari. Six vegetation morphology classes were developed and sample training/validation pixels were selected for each class by analyzing extensive in situ data on vegetation structural and functional properties, in combination with existing ancillary data and coarse scale land cover products. The classification feature set consisted of annual and intra annual matrices derived from 14  years of satellite-derived vegetation indices images, and final classification was achieved using an ensemble tree based classifier. All vegetation morphology classes were mapped with high accuracy and the overall classification accuracy was 91. 9 %. Besides filling the geospatial data gap for the central Kalahari area, this vegetation morphology map is expected to serve as a critical input to ecological studies focusing on habitat use by wildlife and the efficacy of <b>game</b> <b>fencing,</b> as well as contributing to sustainable ecosystem management in the central Kalahari...|$|E
40|$|The {{spread of}} game {{ranching}} in southern Africa provides {{opportunities for the}} reestablishment of populations of endangered wild dogs extirpated by livestock ranchers. However, this potential has not been realized, partly because of negative rancher perceptions. Some ranchers believe that wild dogs impart costs by killing wildlife that could be utilized consumptively. Others complain that wild dogs make ungulates 'skittish' and cause local reductions in prey densities while denning. We compared the skittishness and density of prey species {{inside and outside the}} denning home ranges of nine wild dog packs in Zimbabwe. Wild dogs had no impact on prey skittishness, but prey species did occur at lower densities inside denning home ranges. In some scenarios, and particularly on fenced game ranches, wild dogs could cause prey population declines during denning. On small game ranches, the use of fences as a tool by wild dogs during hunting can increase the proportion of large prey species in their diet by up to 11 times, and thus increase the minimum area required to support that diet. In addition, <b>game</b> <b>fencing</b> is typically permeable to wild dogs but not their prey, preventing the recovery of prey populations through the natural influx of prey animals into the denning area following departure of the dogs. Wild dogs could thus impose significant financial costs to game ranchers hosting denning packs. Our findings emphasize the importance of promoting the formation of conservancies, where neighbouring landowners remove boundary fences to create larger contiguous wildlife areas...|$|E
40|$|Changing {{land use}} {{patterns}} in southern Africa have potential to dramatically alter {{the prospects for}} carnivore conservation. Understanding these influences is essential for conservation planning. We interviewed 250 ranchers in Namibia to assess human tolerance towards {{and the distribution of}} large carnivores. Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), leopards (Panthera pardus) and brown hyaenas (Hyaena brunnea) were widely distributed on Namibian farmlands, spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) had a narrower distribution, and wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and lions (Panthera leo) are largely limited to areas near source populations. Farmers were most tolerant of leopards and least tolerant of lions, wild dogs and spotted hyaenas. Several factors relating to land use correlated consistently with carnivore-presence and landowner tolerance. Carnivores were more commonly present and/or tolerated where; wildlife diversity and biomass were higher; income from wildlife was higher; income from livestock was lower; livestock biomass was lower; in conservancies; <b>game</b> <b>fencing</b> was absent; and financial losses from livestock depredation were lower. Efforts to create conditions whereby the costs associated with carnivores are lowest, and which confer financial value to them are likely to be the most effective means of promoting carnivore conservation. Such conditions are achieved where land owners pool land to create conservancies where livestock are replaced with wildlife (or where livestock husbandry is improved) and where wildlife generates a significant proportion of ranch income. Additional measures, such as promoting improved livestock husbandry and educational outreach efforts may also help achieve coexistence with carnivores. Our findings provide insights into conditions more conducive to the persistence of and tolerance towards large carnivores might be increased on private (and even communal) lands in Namibia, elsewhere in southern and East Africa {{and other parts of the}} world where carnivore conservation is being attempted on private lands.

40|$|The Eagle Owl Bubo bubo, which feeds {{mainly on}} rabbits and partridges, has been persecuted widely for causing damage to game interests. Although it is a {{protected}} species throughout Europe, {{there is a}} noteworthy gap in the scientific literature on the causes of mortality in this top predator. Here, we assess the relative importance and the geographical and temporal variation of human-related causes of death by reviewing 1, 576 files of individuals admitted to wildlife rescue centres in Spain, a stronghold for Eagle Owls. The main known {{cause of death was}} interaction with powerlines followed by persecution and collisions with <b>game</b> <b>fences</b> and cars. There were within-year variations in the distribution of persecution, electrocution and collisions with <b>game</b> <b>fences.</b> Some man-induced causes of mortality were seen to depend on both the geographical region and the period of the year; moreover, mortality within each region was also year-dependent. Since there are strong socio-economic and ethical components involved, management guidelines are discussed bearing in mind such points of view...|$|R
