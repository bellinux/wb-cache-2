In this work, common true spiders were surveyed in wheat, cotton and maize <b>fields,</b> and <b>were</b> <b>counted</b> weekly <b>by</b> using the direct method. For evaluating the feeding consumption of true spiders, five feeding cases were tested (as preys). These cases were: eggs of Ephestia kuehniella, eggs of Phthorimaea operculella, one day eggs and larvae of E. kuehniella, larvae of E. kuehniella and P. operculella and larvae of E. kuehniella only. Results obtained revealed that, the highest average daily consumption for each spider was recorded in case of feeding on eggs of P. operculella.

2500|$|The {{number of}} Indian {{casualties}} at the Washita reported by Custer has been controversial. In his first {{report of the}} battle to Gen. Sheridan on November 28, 1868, Custer reported that by [...] "actual and careful examination after the battle," [...] the bodies of 103 warriors were found — a figure echoed by Sheridan when from Camp Supply he relayed news of the Washita fight to Bvt. Maj. Gen. W.A. Nichols the following day. In fact, no battlefield count of the dead was made. According to Lt. Edward S. Godfrey, no estimate of Indian warrior fatalities was made until {{the evening of the}} day following the battle, after the soldiers made camp during their march back to Camp Supply. [...] "On [...] second night ," [...] Godfrey told interviewer Walter M. Camp in 1917, [...] "Custer interrogated the officers as to what Indians they had seen dead in the village, and it was from these reports that the official report of Indians killed was made up.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} random {{balls in}} a D-dimensional Euclidean space whose centers are prescribed by a homogeneous Poisson point process and whose radii are prescribed by a specific power law. A random <b>field</b> <b>is</b> constructed <b>by</b> <b>counting</b> {{the number of}} covering balls at each point.

40|$|In 2006 and 2007, 75 {{strains of}} Ralstonia solanacearum were {{collected}} from wilting tomato, pepper and eggplant in Benin. The distribution and the incidence of tomato bacterial wilt in the <b>field</b> <b>were</b> assessed <b>by</b> <b>counting</b> wilted tomato plants on 3 plots of 50  m 2 per field. The isolated bacterial strains, including the reference strain, were identified using ELISA, pathogenicity test and carbohydrate oxidation. Bacterial wilt is widely distributed in Benin and was found {{in five of the}} eight agro-ecological zones (AEZ) of Benin, which correspond to eight of the 12 districts of Benin. The disease was more severe in ferralitic soil (AEZ V), in valleys and lowlands (AEZ IV) and in highlands (AEZ I). The incidence of tomato bacterial wilt was up to 71 %. No R. solanacearum strains were isolated from AEZ II, AEZ VII and AEZ VIII. Strains identified as R. solanacearum were more widely distributed in the south than the center and the north of Benin. Based on biochemical characteristics, Beninese R. solanacearum strains were grouped into biovar I/race 1 and biovar III/race 1...|$|R
40|$|Harvest and tillage {{operations}} {{are a major}} factor in seed dispersal in agricultural crops. We studied the effect of harvesting and cultivation on seed dispersal in continuous maize. A suite of cultivated plant species were used as model weed species to avoid potential sampling problems. Dispersal on the entire <b>field</b> <b>was</b> assessed <b>by</b> <b>counting</b> emerged seedlings in contiguous quadrats. Species that had seeds on the plant at the time of harvest were spread further in the direction of traffic by harvest and cultivation combined than species whose seeds had been placed on the soil surface, as judged by the 50 th, 90 th and 95 th percentiles of the cumulative dispersal distribution. Harvesting alone did not cause this effect. The use of a cultivator after harvesting significantly increased the distance travelled in the driving direction for three species with ripe seeds during harvest. Dispersal distributions resulting from cultivator operations showed long tails, extending over the whole of the sampled area, and they were quite variable. The headlands accumulated plant debris that had been collected and dragged over the field by the cultivator. This study shows how weed biology and its interaction with machinery can facilitate dispersal of plants at the field scale...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} weeds in spring cereal <b>fields</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} in 16 regions of southern and central Finland in 1997 - 1999. Data {{were collected from}} conventional and organic farms, both of which applied their normal cropping practices. A total of 690 <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> investigated <b>by</b> <b>counting</b> and weighing the weed species from ten sample quadrats 0. 1 m 2 in size in late July - early August. Altogether 160 weed species were found, of which 134 were broad-leaved and 26 grass species. The total number of weed species ranged from 41 to 84 between regions. In organically farmed fields, the average species number was 24 and in conventionally farmed fields 16. The most frequent weed species were Viola arvensis 84 %, Stellaria media 76 % and Galeopsis spp. 70 %. Only 18 species exceeded the frequency level of 33 %. The average density of weeds was 136 m- 2 (median= 91) in sprayed conventional fields, 420 m- 2 (374) in unsprayed conventional fields and 469 m- 2 (395) in organic fields. The average air-dry above-ground biomass of weeds was 163 kg ha- 1 (median= 63), 605 kg ha- 1 (413) and 678 kg ha- 1 (567), respectively. Weed biomass accounted for 3 % of the total biomass of the crop stand in sprayed conventional fields and for 17 % in organic fields. Elymus repens, the most frequent grass species, produced the highest proportion of weed biomass...|$|R
