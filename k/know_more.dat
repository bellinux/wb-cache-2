5|$|Adventurer : This {{advancement}} badge {{introduces the}} Scout to basic pioneering, including whipping, basic lashing, and other advanced knots. The Scout {{is required to}} <b>know</b> <b>more</b> advanced forms of first aid (treatment of shock, sprains, and fainting). The Scout needs to help plan, and be second {{in charge of a}} patrol hike. Other requirements for the badge include knowledge of HIV/AIDS and knowledge of how a Court of Honour functions. The Scout is required to have camped away from their normal Scout meeting place for at least ten nights.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Brad Follmer {{was created in}} season nine to provide a love interest for Reyes, as the writers believed the audience needed to <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about her. However, Follmer's unresolved relationship with Reyes also served to heighten the conflict between Doggett and Follmer, as both men had feelings for her. Portraying actress Annabeth Gish was pleased {{that the relationship between}} her character and Scully was similar to that of two sisters, rather than Reyes serving as an antagonist to Scully.|$|E
5|$|We <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about Lancaster's {{character}} than {{of most of}} {{his contemporaries}} through his memoirs, the Livre de seyntz medicines (Book of the Holy Doctors). This book is a highly personal treatise on matters of religion and piety, but it also contains details of historical interest. It, among other things, revealed that Lancaster, {{at the age of}} 44 when he wrote the book in 1354, suffered from gout. The book is primarily a devotional work though; it is organised around seven wounds which Henry claims to have, representing the seven sins. Lancaster confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.|$|E

5|$|During that period, the Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences, {{whose main}} {{interests}} were in archaeological research and conservation, {{became interested in}} the newly invented albumen print medium. The society felt that the world should <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about Javanese culture as expressed in the old inscriptions, statues, customs and temples. The Society arranged an archaeological tour around Java, headed by J.F.G. Brumund, a priest of the Batavian Evangelic Community and a specialist in Javanese. The Society also commissioned van Kinsbergen to accompany Brumund during his tour in order to illustrate Brumund's publication of Javanese culture and antiquities. The government granted permission for this tour, with the restriction that all wet-prints (cliches) would be government property and that extra printing would only be allowed with permission from the government.|$|E
5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Nealâ€™s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} the Hakka people first drew {{attention}} to Chinese and foreign scholars, missionaries, travellers and writers during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era {{in the middle of}} the nineteen century. Many wanted to <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about the Hakka people who had started the Taiping Rebellion which almost overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Ernest John Eitel, a prominent German missionary, was one of those who took a great interest in this area.|$|E

A second edition was published in 2001, where the author was able to report on related work by Vladimir Arnold on spherical curves. In fact, Porteous had translated Arnold's paper from the Russian.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the optimistic bias is that people <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about themselves than they do about others. While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they still think of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer's {{second major}} {{departure}} from Kant's epistemology concerns the body. Kant's philosophy was formulated {{as a response}} to the radical philosophical skepticism of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically. Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission. There is, in fact, one physical object we <b>know</b> <b>more</b> intimately than we know any object of sense perception: our own body.|$|E
25|$|John is {{the first}} ruler of Trebizond for whom we <b>know</b> <b>more</b> than a few {{incidents}} and hints; there is enough information to compose a connected narrative of {{the first part of}} his reign. The chronicle of Michael Panaretos, which is often terse and even cryptic, is relatively full for John's reign, and external sources add further details to Panaretos' account. Emperor John II faced many challenges to his rule, which partly explains his marriage to the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the following claims, rationalists often adopt similar stances on other aspects of philosophy. Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable a priori. Naturally, when you claim some truths are innately known to us, one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view that we know some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this foundational knowledge to <b>know</b> <b>more</b> truths.|$|E

It has the ability of a magnetic force; pulling the enemies towards it and get disintegrate by the latter.|$|E
25|$|Historically and traditionally, Tanana {{and other}} all Alaskan Athabaskans are {{practice}} animism and shamanism. The animistic belief system {{common to all}} Alaskan Athabaskan groups might be briefly characterized as follows: All creatures, and some inanimate objects, had spirits which were active and powerful components of those creatures. The spirits enabled an animal to <b>know</b> <b>more</b> than was immediately apparent to him. Thus, if human beings did something which displeased the animal's spirit, the animal itself would remain aloof from the people, and the people might starve. There were very definite rules which people had to follow in dealing with animals based on this belief in animal spirits.|$|E
