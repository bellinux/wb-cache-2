40|$|The Farnesoid X {{receptor}} (FXR) exhibits significant backbone {{movement in}} response to the binding of various ligands and can be a challenge for pose prediction algorithms. As part of the D 3 R Grand Challenge 2, we tested Wilma-SIE, a rigid-protein docking method, on a set of 36 FXR ligands for which the crystal structures had originally been blinded. These ligands covered several classes of compounds. To overcome the rigid protein limitations of the method, we used an ensemble of publicly available structures for FXR from the PDB. The use of the ensemble allowed Wilma-SIE to predict poses with average and median RMSDs of 2. 3 and 1. 4 5, respectively. It was quite clear, however, that had we used a single structure for the receptor the success rate would have been much lower. The most successful predictions were obtained on chemical classes for which one or more crystal structures of the receptor bound to a molecule of the same class was available. In the absence of a crystal structure for the class, observing a consensus binding mode for the ligands of the class using one or more receptor structures of other classes seemed to be indicative of a reasonable pose prediction. Affinity prediction proved to be more challenging with generally poor correlation with experimental IC 50 <b>s</b> (<b>Kendall</b> <b>tau</b> 2 ̆ 009 2 ̆ 0090. 3). Even when the 36 crystal structures were used the accuracy of the predicted affinities was not appreciably improved. A possible cause of difficulty is the internal energy strain arising from conformational differences in the receptor across complexes, which may need to be properly estimated and incorporated into the SIE scoring function.

40|$|In {{disorders}} {{known as}} ‘dying-back’ neuropathies, the distal nerves appear to degenerate first and {{this form of}} degeneration has many similarities to Wallerian degeneration. In the slow Wallerian degeneration (Wld s) mouse there is a 85 kb tandem triplication resulting in {{the expression of a}} chimeric protein, consisting of the first 70 amino acids of Ube 4 B and the full sequence of the Nmnat 1 protein. In the Wld s mouse Wallerian degeneration appears to be slowed approximately ten fold. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether the Wld s gene has a protective effect in neurodegeneration caused by tau pathology. In order to visualise in vivo axonal degeneration and a possible protective effect of the Wld s gene, P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> transgenic mice were crossed with TFP-H mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein in a subset of neurons. First it was determined whether the expression of YFP is harmful to axons, and then YFP expression was used to follow the progression of axonal pathology in the P 301 S mouse. The results indicate that expression of the YFP protein leads to an increase in axonal swellings in some brain regions of aged mice, older than the P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> used in this study. YFP expression allows visualisation of abundant broken and abnormal axons in the peripheral and central nervous systems of P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> transgenic, but not control mice. The Wld s gene does not rescue the axonal degeneration observed in P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> transgenic mice. These results indicate that YFP expression can be used for investigation in young mice, but possible pathological effects can be present in aged mice. Furthermore, the apparent lack of protection of the Wld s gene on P 301 S axonal pathology suggests that Wallerian degeneration is not a major player in tau-related neurodegeneration.

It is now clear that the process of tau aggregation is associated with neurodegeneration. Several transgenic tau mouse models have been developed where tau progressively aggregates, causing neuronal death. Previously we have shown that transplantation of astrocytes in P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> transgenic mice rescues cortical neuron death, implying that the endogenous astrocytes are deficient in survival support. We now show that the gliosis markers Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S 100 calcium-binding protein B (S 100 β) are elevated in brains from P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> mice compared to control C 57 Bl/ 6 mice whereas the expression of proteins involved in glutamine/glutamate metabolism are reduced, pointing to a functional deficit. To test whether astrocytes from P 301 S mice are intrinsically deficient, we co-cultured astrocytes and neurons from control and P 301 S mice. Significantly more C 57 -derived and P 301 S-derived neurons survived when cells were cultured with C 57 -derived astrocytes or astrocyte conditioned medium (C 57 ACM) than with P 301 S-derived astrocytes or astrocyte conditioned medium (P 301 SACM), or ACM from P 301 L tau mice, where the transgene is also specifically expressed in neurons. The astrocytic alterations developed in mice during the first postnatal week of life. In addition, P 301 SACM significantly decreased presynaptic (synaptophysin, SNP) and postsynaptic (postsynaptic density protein 95, PSD 95) protein expression in cortical neuron cultures whereas C 57 ACM enhanced these markers. Since thrombospondin 1 (TSP- 1) is a major survival and synaptogenic factor, we examined whether TSP- 1 is deficient in P 301 S mouse brains and ACM. Significantly less TSP- 1 was expressed in the brains of P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> mice or produced by P 301 S-derived astrocytes, whereas supplementation of P 301 SACM with TSP- 1 increased its neurosupportive capacity.

Green fluorescent protein transduction {{was used as a}} control. We assessed spontaneous exploratory activity, anxiety and spatial learning and memory 11 weeks after the transduction and perfused the mice for histology. The transduced tau was mainly found in axon terminals and largely restricted within the hippocampi. In addition, neurons around the injection site showed cytoplasmic staining for human tau in both wild-type and A 30 P mice. Of these tau-positive neurons, 44 % in A 30 P mice but only 3 % in wild-type mice receiving human wild-type tau transduction formed paired helical filament- 1 (PHF- 1) -positive cytoplasmic densities. In contrast, only 1 % of tau-positive neurons were also PHF- 1 positive after transduction with P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> in mice of either genotype. Transduction of P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> reduced swimming speed but otherwise tau transduction had no significant behavioral consequences.

40|$|AbstractAlzheimer's {{disease is}} the most {{prevalent}} tauopathy and cause of dementia. We investigate the hypothesis that reactivation of plasticity can restore function {{in the presence of}} neuronal damage resulting from tauopathy. We investigated two models with tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation and neurodegeneration: a transgenic mouse model in which the mutant P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> is expressed in neurons (Tg P 301 S), and a model in which an adeno-associated virus expressing P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> (AAV-P 301 <b>S)</b> was injected in the perirhinal cortex, a region critical for object recognition (OR) memory. Both models show profound loss of OR memory despite only 15 % neuronal loss in the Tg P 301 S and 26 % in AAV-P 301 S-injected mice. Recordings from perirhinal cortex slices of 3 month-old P 301 S transgenic mice showed a diminution in synaptic transmission following temporal stimulation. Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) can reactivate plasticity and affect memory through actions on perineuronal nets. ChABC was injected into the perirhinal cortex and animals were tested for OR memory 1 week later, demonstrating restoration of OR memory to normal levels. Synaptic transmission indicated by fEPSP amplitude was restored to control levels following ChABC treatment. ChABC did not affect the progression of neurodegenerative tauopathy. These findings suggest that increasing plasticity by manipulation of perineuronal nets offers a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of memory loss in neurodegenerative disorders...|$|R

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of insoluble proteins is a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders. Tauopathies {{are caused by}} the dysfunction and aggregation of tau protein and an impairment of cellular protein degradation pathways may contribute to their pathogenesis. Thus, a deficiency in autophagy can cause neurodegeneration, while activation of autophagy is protective against some proteinopathies. Little {{is known about the}} role of autophagy in animal models of human tauopathy. In the present report, we assessed the effects of autophagy stimulation by trehalose in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, the human mutant P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> mouse, using biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Neuronal survival was evaluated by stereology. Autophagy was activated in the brain, where the number of neurons containing tau inclusions was significantly reduced, as was the amount of insoluble tau protein. This reduction in tau aggregates was associated with improved neuronal survival in the cerebral cortex and the brainstem. We also observed a decrease of p 62 protein, suggesting that it may contribute to the removal of tau inclusions. Trehalose failed to activate autophagy in the spinal cord, where it had no impact on the level of sarkosyl-insoluble tau. Accordingly, trehalose had no effect on the motor impairment of human mutant P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> transgenic mice. Our findings provide direct evidence in favour of the degradation of tau aggregates by autophagy.

Injection of pFTAA into 5 -month-old P 301 <b>S</b> <b>tau</b> mice detected cortical and DRG neurons immunoreactive for AT 100, which identifies solely filamentous tau, or MC 1, which identifies a conformational change in tau that is commensurate with neurofibrillary tangle formation in AD brains. In fixed cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, pFTAA binding, which also identified AT 100 or MC 1 +ve neurons, followed a single, saturable binding curve with a half saturation constant of 0. 14 µM, the first reported measurement of a binding affinity of a beta-sheet reactive dye to primary neurons harbouring filamentous tau. Treatment with formic acid, which solubilises filamentous tau, extracted pFTAA, and prevented the re-binding of pFTAA and MC 1 without perturbing expression of soluble tau, detected using an anti-human tau (HT 7) antibody. In live cultures, pFTAA only identified DRG neurons that, after fixation, were AT 100 /MC 1 +ve, confirming that these forms of tau pre-exist in live neurons. The utility of pFTAA to discriminate between living neurons containing filamentous tau from other neurons is demonstrated by showing that more pFTAA+ve neurons die than pFTAA-ve neurons over 25 days. Since pFTAA identifies fibrillar tau and other misfolded proteins in living neurons in culture, in animal models of several neurodegenerative diseases, and in human brains, it should have considerable application in sorting out disease mechanisms and in identifying disease-modifying drugs that will ultimately help establish the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in human neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R
