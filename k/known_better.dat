While Tarzan could perform stunts like jumping off cliffs, he was <b>known</b> <b>better</b> for his tricks, such as dancing, bowing, nodding his head to answer questions, playing dead, untying ropes, dragging Maynard to safety, or nuzzling him into the arms of the leading lady. Incredibly intelligent, Tarzan performed these stunts in response to word commands from Maynard.|$|E

500|$|... "Black Widow" [...] {{is a song}} {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and 29 seconds and {{has been described as}} a song that [...] "channels more trap music with its beat". The song combines a sparse snap and heavy trap beat with a refrain that follows a slow-building, clapping chorus formula which peaks but deliberately never capitalizes. Instrumentally, [...] "Black Widow" [...] is composed of an ominous steel drum rhythm, and heavy bass, while its dance breakdown is employed with minimalism. Azalea solicits the track's verses with a snarling, bitter technique, consisting of rhyming employed with a spitting delivery. While Ora uses a seething element to sing the track's hook, [...] "I'm gonna love ya, until you hate me / And I'm gonna show ya, what's really crazy / You should've <b>known</b> <b>better,</b> than to mess with me harder / I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you / Gonna love you, gonna love you / Like a black widow baby". Combined, Ora and Azalea's vocals are based on a call and response structure throughout the song.|$|E

500|$|Jackson herself would {{comment on}} the album's legacy on her 2015 album Unbreakable. In the song [...] "Shoulda Known Better", she {{reflects}} on her optimistic wish that Rhythm Nation 1814 could have profoundly changed the world, noting that there are many, deeper issues to fix and that broad strokes aren't enough. The chorus includes the line, [...] "Cause I don't want my face to be / That poster child for being naive"; and Rhythm Nations title {{is referred to as}} [...] "an epiphany", with Jackson mentioning that [...] "next time, I'll know better." [...] Album co-producer Jimmy Jam told the BBC: [...] "When you're young, you feel like: 'I can change the world! I'm going to lead the revolution!' And then you look 25 years later and you go: 'OK, I should have <b>known</b> <b>better.</b> The same problems still exist but there's a different way to go about tackling it. It still involves mobilising people, but I can't do it by myself.' It's just a wiser, more mature look at the reality of trying to make a positive change, a social change." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{continued}} on through Shaffer, Arvizu, and Silveria, who soon added Jonathan Davis as lead singer and Brian Welch as another guitarist. Bassist Reginald Arvizu, (now <b>known</b> <b>better</b> as [...] "Fieldy") released a solo album entitled Rock'n Roll Gangster on January 22, 2002. In 2006, Fieldy formed the band StillWell with Q-Unique and P.O.D. drummer Noah [...] "Wuv" [...] Bernardo. [...] Fear and the Nervous System is currently one of James Shaffer's (now known by band members as [...] "Munky") side projects, formed in 2008. As of 2009, Pete Capra, Richard Morrill, remain {{good friends with}} all of L.A.P.D.'s members. Aside from projects {{by the members of}} L.A.P.D., in 1997 a compilation album was also released. The album featured songs from both their EP, Love and Peace Dude, and their full–length studio album, Who's Laughing Now. In 2010, L.A.P.D. had a short revival, when Morrill began playing with a new line-up that included Derek Campbell (guitar), Jason Torres (drums), Troy Sandoval (bass) & Kevin Guariglia (dj) in Denver, CO. The group recorded a 5 track demo, that was never officially released, but was posted on the band's social media pages. The group split in early 2011.|$|E
500|$|Coldplay {{has also}} cited various other {{influences}} in the album. The German electronic music pioneer Kraftwerk is evident on the song [...] "Talk", which borrows its synthesizer hook from 1981's [...] "Computer Love", with the riff instead being created by electric guitar. [...] As mentioned before, also present is large electronic musical influences, {{from some of}} the likes of English musicians David Bowie and Brian Eno. Eno, who would later produce Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and Mylo Xyloto, also played backing synthesizer on the track [...] "Low". The first single, [...] "Speed of Sound", also takes inspiration from the drumbeat of English singer-songwriter Kate Bush's song [...] "Running Up that Hill". According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, who wrote a controversial article extensively criticizing the album, the band attempts to [...] "carry the beauty of 'Clocks'" [...] across the album, borrowing some of its features to songs like [...] "Speed of Sound". The opening track [...] "Square One" [...] also features the famous motif from Also sprach Zarathustra, <b>known</b> <b>better</b> as the title theme of Stanley Kubrick's 1968 science-fiction film [...] The three-note sequence is used in the song with distorted guitar riffs, with a backing synthesizer added for musical texture. The sequence also transitions well {{as a part of the}} chorus, showcasing Chris Martin's trademark falsetto voice.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Daniel Lambert" [...] entered {{common use}} in English speech and writing, {{to refer to}} any fat man. His name {{continued}} in this use long after {{the details of his}} life had been largely forgotten; in 1852, Charles Dickens remarked that [...] "Lambert's name is <b>known</b> <b>better</b> than his history". Dickens's Nicholas Nickleby compares the obese GeorgeIV to Lambert, and William Makepeace Thackeray used the term in Vanity Fair to refer to the obese Joseph Sedley, and in The Luck of Barry Lyndon to refer to the fat servant Tim. As time progressed, [...] "Daniel Lambert" [...] came to mean anything exceptionally large; Herbert Spencer's The Study of Sociology used the phrase [...] "a Daniel Lambert of learning", while Thomas Carlyle referred sarcastically to Oliver Cromwell as [...] "this big swollen Gambler and gluttonous hapless 'spiritual Daniel Lambert'". In 1874, The Times, in reviewing the newly translated French comedy La Fiammina by Mario Uchard in which a character is named [...] "Daniel Lambert", noted that the name is [...] "always associated in the English mind with the notion of obesity", and in 1907, almost 100 years after Lambert's death, the Château de Chambord was referred to as [...] "the Daniel Lambert among châteaux". Nellie Lambert Ensall, at the time the heaviest woman in Britain, claimed in 1910 to be Daniel Lambert's great-granddaughter, but her claim is likely to be untrue; Lambert was unmarried and is unlikely to have had any children.|$|E

2500|$|Carl Sandburg, then <b>known</b> <b>better</b> as a {{journalist}} than a poet, wrote an angry account accusing regulators of ignoring safety issues and claimed {{that many of the}} workers were there on company orders for a staged picnic. Sandburg also wrote a poem, [...] "The Eastland", that contrasts the disaster with the mistreatment and poor health of the lower classes at the time. After first listing the quick, murderous horrors of the disaster, then surveying the slow, murderous horrors of extreme poverty, Sandburg concludes by comparing the two: [...] "I see a dozen Eastlands/Every morning on my way to work/And a dozen more going home at night." [...] The poem was too harsh for publication when written but was eventually released as part of a collection of poems during 1993.|$|E
2500|$|... "Stars on 45" [...] {{is a song}} {{issued in}} January 1981 by the studio group Stars on 45. In some countries, {{including}} the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, the band was credited as 'Starsound' and the medley itself was named [...] "Stars on 45". Its official title in the US (as on the record and in Billboard) where it was credited to 'Stars on 45' was [...] "Medley: Intro 'Venus' / Sugar Sugar / No Reply / I'll Be Back / Drive My Car / Do You Want to Know a Secret / We Can Work It Out / I Should Have <b>Known</b> <b>Better</b> / Nowhere Man / You're Going to Lose That Girl / Stars on 45".

2500|$|Late in {{the evening}} of June 21, Sheriff Thaxton reluctantly agreed {{to go to the}} mine to ensure the truce was carried out and the strikebreakers were given safe passage. Despite being urged to go immediately, he claimed he needed to rest. Thaxton promised to meet Hunter and Major Davis of the Carbondale National Guard company at the sheriff's office at 6 a.m. the {{following}} morning. That evening, Hugh Willis, the local UMWA leader, spoke to union supporters in Herrin. Willis said of the strikebreakers: [...] "God damn them, they ought to have <b>known</b> <b>better</b> than to come down here; but now that they're here, let them take what's coming to them." [...] Gunfire continued throughout the night, and the mob began destroying equipment to prevent the mine from reopening. They used hammers, shovels, and dynamite to wreck the draglines and bulldozers, while keeping the strikebreakers pinned down inside coal cars and behind barricades.|$|E
2500|$|Vivian Mercier {{described}} Waiting for Godot as a play which [...] "has {{achieved a}} theoretical impossibility—a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, {{since the second}} act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.". Mercier once questioned Beckett on the language used by the pair: [...] "It seemed to me...he made Didi and Gogo sound {{as if they had}} earned PhDs. 'How do you know they hadn't?' was his reply." [...] They clearly have <b>known</b> <b>better</b> times, a visit to the Eiffel Tower and grape-harvesting by the Rhône; it is about all either has to say about their pasts, save for Estragon's claim to have been a poet, an explanation Estragon provides to Vladimir for his destitution.

2500|$|All {{streets and}} avenues in Miami-Dade County follow the [...] "Miami grid," [...] {{with a few}} exceptions, most notably Coral Gables, Hialeah, and Miami Beach. The grid pattern was adopted after World War I as the common naming system proved too confusing, {{particularly}} for mail carriers. The grid pattern is laid out primarily in 1mi x 1mi format based on a survey technique called metes and bounds. Within those larger squares, individual developers and cities platted the lots differently, {{and they do not}} always cross the major roads that create the macro-grid. These major roads usually are [...] able to cross physical boundaries such as canals and highways, while the intermediate streets within them typically do not. [...] One off-grid neighborhood in Miami, The Roads, is thus named because its streets run off the Miami grid in an approximately 45-degree angle, and therefore all streets are known by their number with the suffix [...] "Road" [...] vs Street. Another busy off-grid road is Okeechobee Road (U.S. Route 27), which travels diagonally through the urban area from the northeast corner of Miami International Airport through Hialeah. Additionally, U.S. Route 1, <b>known</b> <b>better</b> locally as South Dixie Highway, Brickell Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard, does not follow grid pattern.|$|E
