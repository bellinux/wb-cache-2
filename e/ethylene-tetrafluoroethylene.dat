40|$|Greenhouse plastic {{films are}} {{subjected}} to degradation due to their exposure to solar radiation and to chemical products used during cultivation. For polyolephinic materials, mainly low density polyethylene, ethylene–butyl acrylate copolymers and ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymers, {{this results in a}} service life which ranges from some months up to 3 – 4 years relative to the thickness of the film and to the degree of stabilisation. <b>Ethylene–tetrafluoroethylene</b> copolymer films show much longer service life, because of the intrinsic UV stability of the polymer without the need of any UV stabilizer and because of the low chemical reactivity vs. the commonly used agrochemicals. A simple model was developed in order to compare <b>ethylene–tetrafluoroethylene</b> copolymer and polyolephinic films in terms of waste generation {{at the end of their}} service life. The quantity of waste generated during a period of 15 years by the replacement of the covering sheets for 1 ha of greenhouses was estimated according to the class of duration of the plastic films, in a climatic situation corresponding to Southern Italy. Field and laboratory tests were carried out on <b>ethylene–tetrafluoroethylene</b> copolymers and ethylene–vinyl acetate films in order to assess the film lifetime in real conditions, evaluating the effects of solar radiation and of the agrochemicals in terms of loss of tensile properties and of quantity of contaminants accumulated by the films. The results suggested that the use of <b>ethylene–tetrafluoroethylene</b> copolymer films as covering sheets of greenhouses can reduce the waste of plastic materials in a range from 5 to 10 times, with the further advantage of a significant recovery value for the used sheets...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} new United Atom Force Field (denoted MSUA) for {{molecular}} dynamics simulation of the fluoro polymers: Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), Poly(vinylidenefluoride) (PVDF), and <b>Ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> (ETFE). The MSUA was obtained from combining quantum chemistry and experimental results. Using the MSUA and periodic boundary conditions, we carried out {{molecular dynamics simulation}}s using a Build-Anneal-Quench procedure. For PTFE, PVDF, and ETFE fluoro polymers, these results predict transition temperatures (Tg) in good agreement with the experimental Tg...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple and {{efficient}} wave function ansatz {{for the treatment of}} excited charge-transfer states in real-space quantum Monte Carlo methods. Using the recently-introduced variation-after-response method [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 081103 (2016) ], this ansatz allows a crucial orbital optimization step to be performed beyond a configuration interaction singles expansion, while only requiring calculation of two Slater determinant objects. We demonstrate this ansatz for the illustrative example of the stretched LiF molecule, for a range of excited states of formaldehyde, and finally for the more challenging <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> molecule.

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} models to accurately predict the electrical performance of photovoltaic modules are essential. Without such models, potential purchasers of photovoltaic systems have insufficient information {{to judge the}} relative merits and cost effectiveness of photovoltaic systems. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to compare the predictions of a simulation model, developed by Sandia National Laboratories, to measurements from photovoltaic modules installed in a vertical wall façade in Gaithersburg, MD. The photovoltaic modules were fabricated using monocrystalline, polycrystalline, tandem-junction amorphous, and copper-indium diselenide cells. Polycrystalline modules were constructed using three different glazing materials – 6 mm low-iron glass, 2 mm <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> copolyme...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{electron}} beam irradiation on <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> copolymer (ETFE) films were studied. Samples were irradiated in air {{at room temperature}} by a universal electron beam accelerator for doses ranging from 100 to 1200 kGy. Irradiated samples were investigated {{with respect to their}} chemical structure, thermal characteristics, crystallinity and mechanical properties using FTIR, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and universal mechanical tester. The interaction of electron irradiation with ETFE films was found to induce dose-dependent changes in all the investigated properties. A mechanism for electron-induced reactions is proposed to explain the structure-property behaviour of irradiated ETFE films. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|E
40|$|Blends of {{alternating}} <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene,</b> copolymer (ETFE) with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) are {{studied with}} dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA), {{differential scanning calorimeter}} (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). DMA and DSC results show that as PMMA content increases, the Tg of ETFE shifts to higher temperatures and the Tg of the PMMA decreases when the ETFE content increase, indicating that the blends are semicompatible. The FTIR spectra of the blends reveal that the absorption peak position of carbonyl group is almost invariant with {{the composition of the}} blend, suggesting the molecular interactions between ETFE and PMMA are very weak. X-ray diffraction patterns imply that no new crystalline form appears...|$|E
40|$|The X-ray {{diffraction}} patterns {{at different}} temperatures of alternating <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> (ETFE) and of alternating ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE) copolymer samples are compared. For ECTFE, a reversible variation with {{temperature of the}} half-width of the diffraction peaks, analogous to but much smaller than that one which corresponds to the topotactic crystal-to-crystal transition of ETFE, was found. A comparison of the dynamic mechanical spectra of the two copolymers seems to confirm the different nature of the two high-temperature relaxation peaks. In particular, the so called alpha and beta relaxations of ECTFE occur in the amorphous phase while the so called alpha and alpha' relaxations of ETFE occur in the amorphous and crystalline phase, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{capillary}} extrusion {{property of}} <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> copolymer (ETFE) is evaluated. It is found that ETFE shows {{several types of}} flow instabilities. The shark-skin failure is observed over the first critical shear stress 7. 9 × 10 ^ 4 Pa. Then, the slip-stick instability is detected at 1. 8 × 10 ^ 5 Pa, which corresponds to the critical stress of the slippage at the die wall, evaluated by the Mooney method. Moreover, gross wavy melt fracture appears at high out-put rate condition. It {{is interesting to note}} that quasi-stable flow region; so-called “super-extrusion” is observed between slip-stick and wavy melt fracture regions. Because of the steady slippage, ETFE can be extruded at a high out-put rate condition without surface roughness and distortion of extrudates...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{evaluation}} of the amount of defects in the comonomer alternation included in the crystalline phase of alternating <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> (ETFE) and ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE) copolymers, is proposed. The method is based on a comparison between X-ray fiber diffraction profiles and calculated Fourier transforms for isolated chain models. The proposed method is not affected by the regioirregularities and stereoirregularities possible for ECTFE. For the considered ECTFE sample, the chains in the crystalline phase present an amount of defects in the comonomer alternation much lower than those evaluated for all the considered ETFE samples. Substantial differences in the melting temperatures between ETFE samples are accounted for by the different amounts of defects in the comonomer alternation included in the crystalline phase.

40|$|Carbon black (CB) -filled {{alternating}} copolymers of <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> (ETFE) composites {{were prepared}} by the melt-mixing method. The effects of strain and temperature on the electrical resistivity of the composites were elucidated in detail. Our {{results indicated that the}} CB content and CB particle size are the two main factors that influence the electrical resistance of the composites when they are subjected to strain. The large particle size CB-filled ETFE composites with a low CB content show a significant increase in electrical resistivity as a function of strain. A linear relationship between the logarithm of the electrical resistivity of the composites and strain was observed, indicating that tunneling conduction plays an important role when the composites are subjected to strain. The tensile testing results indicated that the CB-filled ETFE composites have reasonably good tensile properties...|$|E
40|$|Blends of the {{alternating}} <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> copolymer (ETFE) with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVF 2) {{were prepared}} by melt-mixing. Compatibility, morphology, thermal behavior, and mechanical {{properties of the}} ETFE/PVF 2 blends with various compositions were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), tensile tests, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). DMA studies showed that the blends have separate glass transition temperatures (T-g) close {{to those of the}} pure polymers. ETFE and PVF 2 are incompatible. Marked negative deviations from simple additivity were observed for both the ultimate strength and the elongation at break over the entire composition range. The interfaces between ETFE and PVF 2 are weakly bonded with rather poor interaction. SEM observations revealed that the blends have a two-phase structure and the adhesion between the phases is poor.

40|$|The {{influence}} of constitutional defects (those resulting from {{variations of the}} comonomer molar ratio from 50 / 50 and those due {{to the introduction of}} termonomer units) and thermal history on the polymorphic behaviour of <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> (ETFE) copolymer is investigated. At low temperatures, while well developed orthorhombic structures are obtained for copolymers with a C 2 F 4 content in the range sufficient to favour formation of the so-called pseudo-hexagonal mesophase. At high temperatures, the degree of crystallinity as well as the correlation length of the hexagonal domains remain essentially unaltered by an increase of the C 2 F 4 molar content from 50 to 80 %, while both are strongly reduced by low concentrations (1 - 3 mol%) of the termonomer units (substantially excluded from the crystalline phase). This {{is expected to be a}} determinant factor for the improved ultimate properties typical of commercial terpolymers of ETFE...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (SOFC) {{is a type}} of {{hydrogen}} fuel cell for home use. A problem with SOFC is that carbon dioxide (CO 2) accompanies the hydrogen, when this is generated from natural gas by fuel reforming. In this study, we propose a gas-bubble sensor which is used in a battery-cell to prevent damage. The gas-bubble sensor has two detection electrodes wound around the outside of a cylindrical plastic housing. By measuring the changes in capacitance, the sensor can detect {{the presence or absence of}} gas-bubbles in the water. The water repellency of the plastic housing was improved chemically by using fluoroplastic (<b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> copolymer; ETFE) so that the detection accuracy of the mixed gas-bubbles was maintained. As a result, a detection accuracy of 99 % at an ultralow flow-rate of 50 μL/s was realized. Key words: Solid oxide fuel cell, a capacitive gas-bubble sensor, fluoroplastic, water repellenc...|$|E
40|$|During the {{deformation}} of an unfilled matrix of <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> (ETFE), microcracking was observed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), {{although it does}} not cause significant acoustic emission because the released energy {{is too small to}} be detected (size of microcracks≪size of fibres). Fibres induce local stress maxima and increase the formation of microcracks. Fibre delamination processes were monitored by acoustic emission analysis. The use of coupling agents improves the fibre-matrix adhesion and increases the mechanical yield stress and decreases delamination processes. A simple model for estimating the energy released by fibre delamination processes was suggested. The predicted difference in peak amplitude between the two extreme processes agrees well with the results of the experiments. The characteristic values of the peak amplitude distributions, however, do not show any significant dependence on fibre coating or testing temperature. Further investigations by SAXS and acoustic emission analysis, especially at low strain, will be necessary to obtain more detailed information about the initial formation of microcracks and fibre delamination...|$|E
40|$|Oscillatory {{shear modulus}} in the molten state is {{evaluated}} carefully considering the rheological change during the measurement at high temperature for <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> copolymer (ETFE). The results provide {{the information on}} the molecular weight distribution as well as the degradation behaviors, which is affected by the environmental condition, i. e., the existence of oxygen. Even under a nitrogen atmosphere, ETFE is thermally unstable in the molten state; ETFE shows random chain scission reaction without crosslinking. The steady-state shear compliance J_e^ 0, which depends on the molecular weight distribution greatly, is not changed during the chain scission. It suggests that the chain scission occurs with keeping the molecular weight distribution. Considering the classical theory on the random scission reaction, the experimental result indicates that M_w/M_n of the initial ETFE sample, prior to the exposure to thermal history, is closed to 2. In contrast, under air condition, ETFE shows crosslinking reaction even in the cone-and-plate rheometer. The degree of crosslinking is quantitatively estimated by the plateau modulus G’_ in the low frequency region. The result suggests that the crosslinking occurs as a first order reaction...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{structures}} are increasingly used in modern architecture as a roof and facade construction. Especially ETFE foils (<b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene)</b> are suitable {{as a substitute}} for glass to span large areas due to their high transparency and low weight. Particularly in recent times, due to prestigious buildings, such as the Allianz-Arena in Munich, membranes are increasingly perceived as a separate building material to realize full building facades. Apart from open buildings, such as football stadiums, more and more closed buildings are realized with membrane cushion covers. A well-known example is the so-called "Water Cube" - the National Aquatics Center in Peking, which was built for the 2008 Olympic Games. The increasing market success can be attributed mainly to the novel and visually appealing character and the light weight of such constructions. In spite of all the benefits that such membrane constructions provides, numerous building physical questions remain still unanswered. Especially for a basic and reliable heat-technical assessment adapted design methods and standards are missing, which take the specific characteristics of membrane structures into account. For required proof tests therefore procedures and standards are used from other construction areas, which are often not suitable or not sufficient for it...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the chain sequence structure of an alternating <b>ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene</b> (ETFE) copolymer and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) on {{both positive and negative}} time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) spectra (m/z {{less than or equal to}} 200) was studied. The C- 1, C- 2, C- 3, C- 4 and C- 5 positive ions were found in the ETFE spectrum, while only the C- 1, C- 2 and C- 3 positive ions were found in the PVDF spectrum. These results indicate that ETFE can be distinguished from PVDF by the presence of its characteristic C- 4 and C- 5 positive ions. Even though both ETFE and PVDF produce some of the same C- 3 positive ions, these positive ions come from different sequence structures. The negative ToF SIMS spectra of both ETFE and PVDF are totally dominated by F- (m/z = 19) because F- is very stable, due to its largest electronegative value, and fluorine concentration in ETFE and PVDF is relatively high. These results indicate that the chain sequence structure has a significant effect on the positive ToF-SIMS spectra of ETFE and PVDF, especially in the high-mass range. However, the chain sequence structure does not have much effect on the negative spectra of ETFE and PVDF. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
