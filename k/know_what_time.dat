5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>time</b> it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{vineyards}} of the Mittelmosel {{include the}} sundial (German Sonnenuhr) vineyards; Brauneberg Juffer-Sonnenuhr, Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr. In the 19th century, large sundials {{were built in}} these vineyards so that the workers would <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>time</b> to break for lunch {{or the end of}} the work day. Since these vineyards receive the most exposure to the sun, many of the wines produced from these vineyards are richer and more full-bodied than wine produced from other vineyards. In a similar way to many of Burgundy's Grand Cru vineyards, the Sonnenuhr vineyards are highly parceled with multiple owners of individual plots or rows of vines. The Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard alone has more than 200 owners.|$|E

500|$|Microsoft never {{formally}} {{commented on}} Cubitt's allegations and instead initially stated the iLoo was an April's fool joke. As a result, Cubitt questioned {{whether this was}} [...] "a very calculated ploy to destroy competition in its early stages, or is admitting they don't even <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>time</b> of the month it is less embarrassing and ridding them of a potentially expensive situation!" [...] Cubitt went on to state that [...] "as they have now discredited my idea as a joke, I {{will never be able}} to produce the idea" [...] and as such was [...] "consulting my law books now on defamatory statements". Neither Cubitt, nor Brunel University have taken public legal action against Microsoft pertaining to the i-Loo.|$|E
500|$|Mehldau often plays a {{separate}} melody with each hand, {{and one of}} the central features of his music is the playing of improvised counterpoint. He stated in 2002 that some of the content of his playing is affected by the music that he has recently been listening to: [...] "If I'm digging a Brahms intermezzo that'll find its way in. If it's McCoy Tyner, there'll be more of that." [...] Mehldau's performances often employ unusual rhythmic meters; for example, he plays his arrangement of [...] "All the Things You Are" [...] on Art of the Trio 4 in 7/4 time, and [...] "I Didn't <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>Time</b> It Was" [...] on Art of the Trio 1 in 5/4. He developed this ability over a period of around a year, with the help of Rossy. Mehldau is able to reach tenth and eleventh intervals on the piano.|$|E
500|$|In 1957 Costa {{was again}} leader, {{recording}} Eddie Costa Quintet with Woods, Art Farmer, Teddy Kotick, and Paul Motian. Their repertoire featured interpretations of [...] "I Didn't <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>Time</b> It Was" [...] and Dave Brubeck's recent composition [...] "In Your Own Sweet Way"; the latter focused on Costa's vibes and Farmer's muted trumpet, with Woods switching from his usual alto saxophone to the piano. The Billboard review was positive, calling it [...] "a first rate jazz set" [...] on which [...] "Costa swings as ever on piano". A trio {{appearance at the}} 1957 Newport Jazz Festival also brought Costa greater attention. Some of his playing at the festival – as a trio with Ernie Furtado (bass) and Al Beldini (drums), and as a quintet {{with the addition of}} Rolf Kühn and Dick Johnson – was released later in 1957 as part of a Verve album. Billboard commented that [...] "Costa [...] will attract many new endorsers with the musicianship displayed".|$|E

500|$|Before his {{departure}} from Jive, Big Boi planned {{to release the}} album in 2008. In January 2010, he announced a March 23 release through his Twitter account. In April, its release was pushed back to July 6 in the United States. However, in June, Jive attempted to block its release, claiming that Def Jam could not issue songs featuring both Big Boi and André 3000, as OutKast was represented as a duo by the former label. In a June 7 interview for GQ, Big Boi responded to a question concerning the blocking of his recordings with André 3000 for Sir Lucious Left Foot, stating [...] "Au contraire! They cannot block it. Au contraire. Either they're {{going to do it}} the right way, or they're going to do it my way... The fans' thirst will be quenched. You know, I'm no stranger to that Internet, baby. So you already <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>time</b> it is. The thirst of the fans will be quenched". On June 10, his website released the album's track listing, which excluded tracks featuring André 3000.

2500|$|A longstanding {{desire of}} Parker's was to perform {{with a string}} section. He was a keen student of {{classical}} music, and contemporaries reported he was most interested in the music and formal innovations of Igor Stravinsky and longed {{to engage in a}} project akin to what later became known as Third Stream, a new kind of music, incorporating both jazz and classical elements as opposed to merely incorporating a string section into performance of jazz standards. On November 30, 1949, Norman Granz arranged for Parker to record an album of ballads with a mixed group of jazz and chamber orchestra musicians. Six master takes from this session comprised the album Charlie Parker with Strings: [...] "Just Friends", [...] "Everything Happens to Me", [...] "April in Paris", [...] "Summertime", [...] "I Didn't <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>Time</b> It Was", and [...] "If I Should Lose You".|$|E
