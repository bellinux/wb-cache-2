5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum {{closely resembles}} the other {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E

5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about {{the success of their}} {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who appeared to have been the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata again while Thomaskantor in Leipzig, notably {{at his first}} Easter there on 9 April 1724. He also performed it the following year on 1 April 1725, in his second cycle of Leipzig cantatas, a cycle of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. It followed in the cycle some forty newly composed cantatas. This early work fits the cycle {{in the sense that}} it is based on a chorale, but its style is different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E
5|$|Being the South's {{first line}} of defense against foreign threats, the NSS houses {{technology}} unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies. The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung (Juni) and Hwang Tae-sung (Na Yoon), are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung does not meet the expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence. Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> but her status as the top hacker in Korea has made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E

5|$|Crawford and Knight {{were taken}} to Wingenund's camp on June 7, where they found nine other prisoners. On June 11, Captain Pipe painted {{the faces of the}} prisoners black, the {{traditional}} sign they were to be executed. The prisoners were marched to the Delaware town on Tymochtee Creek, near the present-day village of Crawford, Ohio. Four prisoners were killed with tomahawks and scalped along the way. When the war party stopped, the seven remaining prisoners were made to sit, with Crawford and Knight a short distance away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> Delaware women and boys killed the other five with tomahawks, beheading one of them. The boys scalped the victims and slapped the bloody scalps in the faces of Crawford and Knight.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman and Shields {{published}} Schizophrenia and Genetics {{to document}} their twin-study {{research at the}} Maudsley Hospital in London, the work that in part earned them the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award for psychiatric research from the American Psychiatric Association. The study expanded on an earlier one by Eliot Slater at the same hospital, covering 24 identical and 33 fraternal twins, {{with at least one}} from every pair a schizophrenic being treated at the hospital between 1948 and 1964. This study was one of eleven such in the contemporary literature, and the book detailed the methodology and analytic detail differentiating it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E
5|$|Muthu, Anitha and Lavanya get {{separated}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> They {{reach the}} ruins of a village where they are subjected to black magic and nearly go mad before reaching the secret hideout of the Chola. The three find an ethnic isolated primitive Tamil group, ruled by a Chola king. The king and his people are in hiding, awaiting the arrival of the fabled messenger who will bring glory and prosperity back to their land and lead them back to Thanjavur, their motherland. The king and the priest consult the gods for omens and order Muthu, Anitha and Lavanya to be burnt alive as sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|The eight living pelican {{species were}} {{traditionally}} {{divided into two}} groups, one containing four ground-nesters with mainly white adult plumage (Australian, Dalmatian, great white, and American white pelicans), and one containing four grey or brown plumaged species which nest preferentially either in trees (pink-backed, spot-billed and brown pelicans), or on sea rocks (Peruvian pelican). The largely marine brown and Peruvian pelicans, formerly considered conspecific, are sometimes separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> by placement in the subgenus Leptopelicanus but in fact species with both sorts of appearance and nesting behavior are found in either.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Lara setting {{out on her}} first {{expedition}} aboard the ship Endurance, {{with the intention of}} finding the lost kingdom of Yamatai. By her suggestion and against Whitman's advice, the expedition ventures into the Dragon's Triangle, east of Japan. The ship is struck by a violent storm and shipwrecked, leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. Lara is separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> and captured by a strange, savage man. She manages to escape while her captor is killed as the cave collapses due to her actions.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} and characters of each worlds {{were designed to}} resemble the artwork style of each Disney films. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar in Agrabah. Each world is disconnected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> and exists separately. Most characters in the worlds are unaware of other ones, with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship.|$|E

5|$|The group quickly realizes {{they are}} outnumbered, {{and they all}} attempt to escape to safety. Patricia (Jane McNeill) is killed as walkers {{overtake}} the Greene household, and Rick convinces Hershel to abandon his property {{as it is a}} lost cause. Everyone escapes in groups, except for Andrea (Laurie Holden), who was separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> Unknown to them, she manages to escape the farm, only to run into a mysterious hooded figure who has two armless walker pets and wields a katana.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray has a thick {{pectoral}} fin disc wider {{than it is}} long, with a smoothly rounded outer margin. The eyes are of medium size and are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin between the oval nostrils, with a finely fringed trailing margin. The mouth is wide and curved, with faint furrows at the corners. There is a row of seven papillae on the floor, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> There are 37–46 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 39–45 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small with a deep groove across the crown, and are arranged in a dense quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Three {{different}} early {{versions of}} the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> The play's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.|$|E

5|$|Transformation {{into human}} form {{is said to}} be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not {{disappear}} with the shapeshift.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} many other small {{pharmaceutical}} companies in the United States, Eli Lilly and Company distinguished itself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> by having a permanent research staff, inventing superior techniques for the mass production of medicinal drugs, and its strong focus on quality. At first, Lilly was the company's only researcher, but as the business grew, he established a research laboratory and employed others who were dedicated to creating new drugs. Lilly hired his first full-time research chemist, Ernest G. Eberhards, and botanist, Walter H. Evans, in 1886. The department's methods of research were based on Lilly's. He insisted on quality assurance and instituted mechanisms {{to ensure that the}} drugs being produced would be effective and perform as advertised, had the correct combination of ingredients, and had the correct dosages of medicines in each pill. He was aware of the addictive and dangerous nature of some of his drugs, and pioneered the concept of giving such drugs only to people who had first seen a physician to determine if they needed the medicine.|$|E
5|$|Frank and {{the group}} reach the sub, and they take control of it. After betraying the Man in Black, Widmore's men attack, but they manage to submerge. Jack then discovers the Man in Black planted the C4 in Jack's bag. Sayid sacrifices himself and runs off with the C4 as far away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> as he could until it explodes. The {{explosion}} causes the submarine to sink, and Frank is knocked out after a door hits him. Frank revives and {{makes it to the}} surface of the water. He is found by Richard and Miles as they head for Hydra Island to blow up the Ajira plane. Frank convinces them to steal the plane and let him fly it. After much repair work and picking up Kate, Claire, and Sawyer, the plane takes off and heads for home.|$|E
