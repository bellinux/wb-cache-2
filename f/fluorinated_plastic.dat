2500|$|PTFE was accidentally {{discovered}} in 1938 by Roy Plunkett {{while he was}} working in New Jersey for DuPont. As Plunkett attempted {{to make a new}} chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant, the tetrafluoroethylene gas in its pressure bottle stopped flowing before the bottle's weight had dropped to the point signaling [...] "empty." [...] Since Plunkett was measuring the amount of gas used by weighing the bottle, he became curious as to the source of the weight, and finally resorted to sawing the bottle apart. He found the bottle's interior coated with a waxy white material that was oddly slippery. Analysis showed that it was polymerized perfluoroethylene, with the iron from the inside of the container having acted as a catalyst at high pressure. Kinetic Chemicals patented the new <b>fluorinated</b> <b>plastic</b> (analogous to the already known polyethylene) in 1941, and registered the Teflon trademark in 1945.|$|E
50|$|For non-bottle applications, {{fluorination}} {{of plastic}} can provide compliance {{with state and}} federal regulations. An example would be <b>fluorinated</b> <b>plastic</b> fuel tanks used for lawn and garden equipment, automobiles, etc.|$|E

40|$|The use of fluoroepoxy {{compounds}} as adhesives to bond fluoroplastics was investigated. Fluoroepoxy compounds with a F-content {{higher than}} 46 percent {{were able to}} bond a highly <b>fluorinated</b> <b>plastic</b> such as Teflon PTFE (76 percent F) to give a respectable bond strength without any surface treatment. The advantage of the fluoroepoxy adhesive vanished when applied to a less <b>fluorinated</b> <b>plastic</b> such as Tefzel which contains 55 percent fluorine. Among the curing agents explored, octafluorooctamethylenediamine showed its potential as a cocuring agent for improving both the viscosity of the compound and {{the flexibility of the}} cured product...|$|E
