50|$|In 1999, the Port of Seattle {{authorized}} $142 {{million to}} completely overhaul the entire STS system. The overhaul included {{all aspects of}} the system including trains, controls, power supplies, stations, <b>emergency</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems and maintenance shops. The upgrade and modernization was completed in 2003. The 21, Bombardier Innovia APM 100 vehicles use CITYFLO 650 signaling technology and a radio Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) system for its automated operation.|$|E
5000|$|The Kearny {{air pump}} is an {{expedient}} air pump used to ventilate a shelter. The design {{is such that}} a person with normal mechanical skills can construct and operate one. It is usually human-powered and designed to be employed {{during a time of}} crisis. It was designed to be used in a fallout shelter, but can be used in any situation where <b>emergency</b> <b>ventilation</b> is needed, such as after a hurricane.|$|E
5000|$|In normal use, the {{passenger}} compartments are ventilated by microprocessor controlled ceiling ducts. <b>Emergency</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{can be achieved}} by tilting open the upper parts of some of the side windows. Heating elements are fitted to the sidewalls. Interior lighting is provided by fluorescent lamps, and {{the passenger}} compartments also have visual information systems, with multilingual acoustic stop announcements. All members of the class have been liveried since new in a red, white and grey design.|$|E
5000|$|Assumed {{response}} times exist for initial {{diagnosis of the}} event and for the placement of <b>emergency</b> purge <b>ventilation</b> equipment on the tank top. The former is 10 hours while the latter is 4 hours.|$|R
2500|$|Tunnel <b>{{emergency}}</b> exits (<b>Ventilation</b> {{and escape}} shafts) [...] Tunnel emergency exits are located every 1km along expressway tunnels, such as SMART Tunnel, Penchala Tunnel on Sprint Expressway, Menora Tunnel on North–South Expressway and Genting Sempah Tunnel on Kuala Lumpur–Karak Expressway.|$|R
30|$|<b>Emergency</b> {{non-invasive}} <b>ventilation</b> was commenced in 10 % {{of patients}} post extubation, with 70 % subsequently requiring reintubation. The reasons for extubation failure {{were difficult to}} determine, but upper airway obstruction was documented as a contributing factor in 19 % of failed extubations.|$|R
50|$|There are {{particular}} hazards with tunnels, {{especially from}} vehicle fires when combustion gases can asphyxiate users, as {{happened at the}} Gotthard Road Tunnel in Switzerland in 2001. One of the worst railway disasters ever, the Balvano train disaster, {{was caused by a}} train stalling in the Armi tunnel in Italy in 1944, killing 426 passengers. Designers try to reduce these risks by installing <b>emergency</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems or isolated emergency escape tunnels parallel to the main passage.|$|E
50|$|Inadequate {{emergency}} equipment also worsened the disaster. Daegu subway trains were not equipped with fire extinguishers, and the stations lacked sprinklers and emergency lighting. Many victims became disoriented in the dark, smoke-filled underground station {{and died of}} asphyxiation looking for exits. <b>Emergency</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems also proved inadequate. Over 1,300 fire and emergency personnel responded and the fire itself was extinguished around 1:38 p.m.; however, the toxicity of the smoke prevented them from entering the station for another {{three and a half}} hours.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel has a {{total of}} 16 cross {{passages}} excavated in 2012 and 2013 using the Sequential Excavation Method to connect the two bores at regular intervals for use as emergency exits and maintenance access points. There is one vent for the tunnel, located at a lot adjacent to the Paramount Theatre in Downtown Seattle; a proposed vent in the Montlake neighborhood was removed in 2007 after opposition from nearby residents and a determination that the two stations could handle <b>emergency</b> <b>ventilation</b> on their own.|$|E

The analyses were performed according to THERP (Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction) as describes in NUREG/CR- 1278 -F...|$|R
50|$|An initial task {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} on the off normal procedure and standard operating procedure. This allowed for the operator to align and then initiate the <b>emergency</b> purge <b>ventilation</b> equipment given {{the loss of the}} ventilation system.Thereafter, each individual task was analysed from which it was then possible to assign error probabilities and error factors to events that represented operator responses.|$|R
50|$|Between fifty and fifty-three {{people died}} in the fire. The number of {{fatalities}} was worsened by the failure of power supplies and <b>emergency</b> generators, inadequate <b>ventilation</b> and locked fire doors.|$|R
50|$|The Jubilee line {{extension}} project saw platform screen doors {{installed on}} its new stations that were underground. Contrary to other systems, where PSDs and PEDs are installed primarily for safety reasons, the Jubilee line PSDs were designed primarily {{to reduce the}} movement of air caused by <b>emergency</b> <b>ventilation</b> fans. As a secondary function, they also act as barriers to prevent people from falling onto the tracks. The Jubilee line PSDs were produced by Westinghouse. There are plans to install PEDs (which will not reach to the ceiling) in existing London Underground stations along the Bakerloo, Central, Piccadilly, and Waterloo & City lines as part of New Tube for London.|$|E
5000|$|The {{downtown}} transit tunnel {{closed on}} September 23, 2005, for a two-year, $82.7 million renovation to accommodate light rail vehicles. The renovation included {{the installation of}} new rails, a lowered roadbed at stations for level boarding, new signalling systems and <b>emergency</b> <b>ventilation.</b> As part of the renovation, a short cut-and-cover [...] "stub tunnel" [...] was built under Pine Street between Westlake station and Interstate 5 to form the turnback area for trains {{and part of a}} future northern extension of the light rail system. The tunnel reopened on September 24, 2007, with new signage, lighting, and street improvements; Westlake station was host to a public open house for the planned light rail system, featuring a light rail vehicle on display at the station prior to the re-opening of the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The {{rolling stock}} of the Ampang Line {{currently}} consists of a fleet of 50 new trains, better known as AMY, that are deployed to increase {{the capacity of the}} line and provide a better service. Each of the new trains is six cars long and provided by CSR Zhuzhou of China, similar to on the design for İzmir Metro and Buenos Aires Underground 200 Series. These trains are disabled-friendly and include safety features like closed-circuit TV, emergency breakable window, <b>emergency</b> <b>ventilation</b> fan, fire and smoke detection system and supervised automatic train operation system (SATO), and other elements such as interactive destination display inside the train, non-slipping seats, LCD infotainment, walk-through gangways, and a more spacious wheelchair space for the physically challenged. The first trains for Sri Petaling Line were put into service starting from January 2015, followed by Ampang Line in December 2016.|$|E
5000|$|Students {{are exposed}} {{to a variety of}} {{different}} disciplines in nine different laboratories: roof control, ground control, mine <b>emergencies</b> and rescue, <b>ventilation,</b> electrical systems, machinery, industrial hygiene, computer systems and underground mine simulation.|$|R
50|$|From {{the various}} figures and workings, {{it can be}} {{determined}} that the HEP for establishing air based <b>ventilation</b> using the <b>emergency</b> purge <b>ventilation</b> equipment on In-tank Precipitation processing tanks 48 and 49 after {{a failure of the}} nitrogen purge system following a seismic event is 4.2 E-6. This numerical value is judged to be a median value on the lognormal scale. However, {{it should be noted that}} this result is only valid given that all the previously stated assumptions are implemented.|$|R
50|$|The {{tunneling}} {{process was}} begun at three access points, named Heslacher Wand, Leonberger Strasse, and Magstadter Strasse. At the Heslacher Wand access point, a loading track was operated {{to assist in}} the removal of 180,000 cubic metres of excavation material from the site. In total, 396,000 cubic metres of material were removed in the section between Schwabstrasse and the station at Universität. Once the Verbindungsbahn was put into service, these access points serve as <b>emergency</b> exits, <b>ventilation</b> shafts, and smoke funnels in case of fire.|$|R
