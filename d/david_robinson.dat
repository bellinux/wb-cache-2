5|$|Eleven first picks {{have won}} the NBA Most Valuable Player Award: Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (record six-time winner), Bill Walton, Magic Johnson (three-time winner), Hakeem Olajuwon, <b>David</b> <b>Robinson,</b> Shaquille O'Neal, Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan (two-time winner), LeBron James (four-time winner), and Derrick Rose (youngest winner).|$|E
5|$|Olajuwon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a clutch performer and also {{as one of the top}} centers in history based on his performances in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons. He outplayed centers such as Patrick Ewing, <b>David</b> <b>Robinson,</b> Shaquille O'Neal, and Dikembe Mutombo, and other defensive stalwarts such as Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone. Many of his battles were with his fellow Texas-based rival <b>David</b> <b>Robinson</b> of the San Antonio Spurs. In the 30 head–to–head match-ups during the seven seasons from the 1989 to 1996, when both Olajuwon and Robinson were in their prime, Olajuwon averaged 26.3 points per game, shooting 47.6% from the field, while Robinson averaged 22.1 and 46.8%.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the advent}} of the draft lottery in 1985, seven number one overall picks have won an NBA title. They are <b>David</b> <b>Robinson,</b> Shaquille O'Neal, Glenn Robinson, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Andrew Bogut, and Kyrie Irving.|$|E

5|$|After Robinson's {{retirement}} from baseball, his wife Rachel Robinson pursued {{a career in}} academic nursing. She became {{an assistant professor at}} the Yale School of Nursing and director of nursing at the Connecticut Mental Health Center.

The team {{went on to win}} the gold medal in Atlanta. During the tournament, he shared his minutes with Shaquille O'Neal and <b>David</b> <b>Robinson.</b> He played 7 out of the 8 games and started 2. He averaged 5 points and 3.1 rebounds and had 8 assists and 6 steals in seven games.|$|E
5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With <b>David</b> <b>Robinson</b> guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, {{drove to the}} basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{producer}} Mac Senour {{was responsible}} for the Menacer project and designed the six-game pack. He originally proposed non-shooting minigames based on existing Sega licenses like Joe Montana, <b>David</b> <b>Robinson,</b> and ToeJam & Earl, but most of the prototypes were abandoned due to high cost in favor of more shooting-type games. Sega did not plan another first-party release for the Menacer apart from the included multicart. Compatible games were published through 1995.|$|E

5|$|The {{most recent}} Rookie of the Year winner is Malcolm Brogdon. Twenty-one winners were drafted first overall. Fourteen winners have {{also won the}} NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in their careers; Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld earning both honors the same season. Nineteen of the forty two non-active winners have been elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Three seasons had joint winners—Dave Cowens and Geoff Petrie in the , Grant Hill and Jason Kidd in the , and Elton Brand and Steve Francis in the 1999–2000 season. Five players won the award {{unanimously}} (by capturing all of the first-place votes) – Ralph Sampson, <b>David</b> <b>Robinson,</b> Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard, and Karl-Anthony Towns.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the reins}} of Lillard, the Blazers played well into January 2013, posting a 20–15 record. On January 11, 2013, at home against the Miami Heat, Wesley Matthews made two {{consecutive}} three-pointers late {{in the fourth quarter}} to help the Blazers secure a 92–90 victory. However, despite the Blazers remaining among the playoff contenders for most of the season, injuries to starters Batum, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Matthews, as well as a losing streak of 13 games– the longest in the franchise's history– led to the 11th position in the West, with a 33–49 record. Averaging 19.0 points, 6.5 assists, and 3.1 rebounds, Lillard was unanimously named Rookie of the Year, joining Ralph Sampson, <b>David</b> <b>Robinson,</b> and Blake Griffin as the only unanimous selections in NBA history.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs {{lost their}} {{perennial}} captain <b>David</b> <b>Robinson</b> to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterovič, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Ginóbili and young French point guard Parker. Coming {{off the bench}} were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis. In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant {{to step into the}} void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater for an upset Lakers win. In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as {{one of the reasons for}} the loss.|$|E

5|$|On February 7, 2015, Davis {{injured his}} {{shoulder}} after {{falling off the}} rim when he received an alley-oop. As {{a result of the}} injury, he withdrew from the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, and was replaced on the roster by Dirk Nowitzki and in the starting lineup by LaMarcus Aldridge. Davis missed five games in late February and early March to the shoulder sprain. He returned against the Detroit Pistons with a very dominant game performance of 39 points, 13 rebounds, and 8 blocks, numbers that only Hakeem Olajuwon and Dwight Howard had achieved in a game in the prior 30 years. Davis also reached 437 career blocks, a franchise record. On March 9, Davis tied his career high with 43 points and added 10 rebounds, 2 blocks and a steal in a 114-103 win against the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 15 in a double overtime game against the Denver Nuggets, Davis became the first player in NBA history to tally 36 points, 14 rebounds, 9 blocks and 7 assists in a game since blocks became a statistic in 1973. Only <b>David</b> <b>Robinson</b> has had at least 30 points, 11 rebounds, 8 blocks and 7 assists in a game. On March 16, Davis earned Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, March 9, through Sunday, March 15 and was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month of March. In the final game of the regular season, a must-win game that would send the Pelicans to the 2015 NBA Playoffs, Davis recorded 31 points, 13 rebounds, and 3 blocks in a 108-103 victory over the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs. The playoff berth was Davis' first and the franchise's first since 2011. Davis' season {{was one of the most}} impressive in NBA history, finishing the season averaging 24.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 2.9 blocks, and leading the league in player efficiency rating with 30.89. He was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month again in April.|$|E
