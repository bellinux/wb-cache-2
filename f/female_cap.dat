2500|$|In the United States Navy, midshipmen, chief petty officers, and {{commissioned}} officers wear combination covers, {{but there}} are differences between the three types. Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, United States Merchant Marine Academy or in Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) units wear a combination cap with a gold chinstrap attached by gold buttons, with a gold fouled anchor device. A chief petty officer wears a combination cap with a black chinstrap attached with gold buttons, with a device consisting of a gold fouled anchor with silver block letters [...] "USN" [...] superimposed on the shank of the anchor, with the addition of one, two, or three stars {{at the top of the}} anchor if the wearer is a Senior Chief Petty Officer, a Master Chief Petty Officer, or the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, respectively; while a commissioned officer wears a combination cap with a gold chinstrap attached by gold buttons, with an officer crest device, a silver federal shield over two crossed gold fouled anchors, surmounted by a silver eagle. Chief petty officer and junior commissioned officer visors are shiny black plastic without ornamentation. Officers O-5 (Commander) and above have gold embroidered oak leaves and acorns on a black felt-covered visor, with additional embroidery for flag officers (O-7, or rear admiral lower half, and above), referred to as [...] "scrambled eggs." [...] The crowns come in khaki or in white (the white combination cap is worn with both white and blue uniforms). The black band around the cap includes a black circle extending upward on the front of the crown as a backing behind the device. The gold buttons on the sides of the cover are of a design to match the gold buttons on the service dress jacket and the snaps on officer shoulder boards. For the <b>female</b> <b>cap</b> the brim is folded up on both sides whereas the men's cap has no brim but a visor at the front.|$|E
40|$|Thioredoxin 1 (Trx 1) and {{haptoglobin}} (Hp) {{are known}} to be involved in pathophysiology. This study was conducted to evaluate their diagnostic significance. We employed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine the concentrations of both Trx 1 and Hp in sera from female patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and those with lung cancer. The Trx 1 levels remarkably decreased in cases of female patients with CAP, while the Hp levels increased in both female patients with lung cancer and CAP. In addition, the serum levels of Trx 1 were not significantly changed in patients with lung cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular diseases compared to healthy controls. At the cut-off point of 0. 396 at A 450 nm on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Trx 1 could discriminate between patients with CAP from normal female controls with a sensitivity of 72. 5 %, a specificity of 89. 8 %, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0. 877 ± 0. 040. The serum levels of Trx 1 in <b>female</b> <b>CAP</b> patients were inversely correlated with the levels of Hp (p < 0. 05). The characteristic reduction in serum Trx 1 levels, especially in <b>female</b> <b>CAP</b> patients, indicates that Trx 1 {{could be used as a}} diagnostic marker for CAP. The advantage of serum Trx 1 over Hp in discriminating <b>female</b> <b>CAP</b> patients among female patients who have a positive serum level of Hp suggests the use of Trx 1 as an excellent combination marker with Hp for the specific diagnosis of CAP and lung carcinoma, because serum Hp levels increase in female patients with lung cancer and those with CAP without selectivity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recently, a cryovial {{immersed}} in liquid nitrogen exploded in a Yale laboratory, exposing a researcher to risk of physical injury {{and also to}} a biohazard. Liquid nitrogen that seeps into a closed tube can lead to an explosion upon removal from low temperature storage due to a 690 X volume expansion during conversion to gas from liquid phase. During the investigation, 2 additional reports of exploding cryovials {{within the past year}} were shared by other laboratory members. Laboratory staff noted that the cryovials involved in the explosion were {{immersed in}} liquid nitrogen and also were those containing external threads and female caps. Tubes immersed in liquid nitrogen that were equipped with internal threads and male caps have not been involved in explosions. Images of both vials are shown below. It is important to also note that manufacturers of both tube styles provide an alert that their tubes should NOT BE IMMERSED IN LIQUID NITROGEN DUE TO RISK OF EXPLOSION.

However, {{for those who were}} referred to CAP at 15 and 16  years of age, 50 and 75  % respectively engaged well with therapy. This, however, could be a chance finding due to small numbers referred. We also found that males were regularly referred to CAP, and that they attended for significantly longer periods than <b>females.</b> As <b>CAP</b> has no recommended duration of treatment, we calculated the child’s engagement in therapy can be estimated using the percentage of sessions attended, as well as overall number of sessions attended.|$|R

5000|$|In the Soviet Union, the {{garrison}} cap {{was known as}} pilotka (пилотка, from [...] "pilot" [...] — the original cap {{was a part of}} the air force pilots' uniform in World War I). It was the most common type of cap used by the Red Army during WWII and after until the 1980s. The pilotka was worn during the summer season instead of the winter ushanka. It continues to be worn in modern Russia, although more in the Air Force and the Navy, especially among submarine personnel, where its compactness is inherently practical. In the Ground Forces the pilotka has been more or less displaced by the patrol cap and the beret as an undress headgear, although it remains in the regulations. Navy tropical uniform also features the peculiar vizored pilotka, to protect its wearers from the sun. The garrison cap was also the standard dress headgear for women in all of the Russian armed services (except for those units authorised to wear berets, such as airborne troops and marines), until replaced in March 2017 by the world-standard <b>female</b> peaked <b>cap.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{is a small}} green-and-yellow finch. According to some sources, it is the {{smallest}} species of finch on average, although others give this title to the lesser goldfinch. The total length can range from 9.5 to 11 cm. A weight of 11.5 g {{may be at the}} high end. Few standard measurements are known, although the bill has been recorded at 1.1 cm and the wing chord length is reportedly around 6.4 cm. The Andean siskin has deep green upperparts with black and yellow coloration on the wings and tail. The adult male has a distinctive black <b>cap.</b> <b>Female</b> lacks this <b>cap</b> and is generally a duller olive color, with white from the belly to the undertail-coverts. The female differs from female yellow-bellied siskin in being paler and brighter, also by lacking the olive throat and yellow undertail-coverts of that species. Female hooded siskins are also similar but the Andean has distinctive white undertail-coverts and more olive-green rather than gray color. The Andean siskin race S. s. nigricauda is generally duller or darker green on upperparts than the nominate, in this subspecies the underparts are dull green and lacking any trace of yellow. The tail is all black and the wings lack greenish-yellow tips to the coverts but the race does retain bright yellow bases to the inner primaries and secondaries. The race S. s. capitanea is similar but the underparts are generally paler olive without any of the dark olive centers to the feathers, it also has yellow on sides of the base of the tail and on the tips of the median and greater coverts.|$|R

25|$|The Service Dress Blue (SDB) uniform {{consists}} of a navy blue suit coat and trousers (or the optional skirt for women) that are nearly black in color, a white shirt, and a four-in-hand necktie for men or a neck tab for women. The material is generally wool or a wool blend, depending on the vendor. The men's jacket is double breasted with six gold-colored buttons, and the women's jacket has a single row of four gold-colored buttons. Rank insignia is the gold sleeve stripes for commissioned officers, while rating badges and service stripes are worn on the left sleeve by Chief Petty Officers (CPOs). The prescribed headgear is the white combination cap, although a navy blue garrison cap is optional, unless stated otherwise by the prescribing authority in some situations when the jacket is not worn. Beginning in 2016, the Navy began phasing out the <b>female</b> combination <b>cap</b> and now prescribes a cover similar to the male version for female officers and CPOs. Commissioned and warrant officers wear a cap badge of the American shield and eagle in silver upon gold crossed anchors; CPOs wear a single fouled anchor. The combination cover's chinstrap is gold for commissioned and warrant officers, narrower gold for midshipmen, and black for CPOs. Female officers and chief petty officers wear beltless slacks with the SDB, although since January 2017, belted slacks can be worn as an alternative.|$|R
