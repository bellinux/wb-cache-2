5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. <b>Filler</b> <b>rods</b> composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle.

The test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the IIW Recommendations and Eurocode 3, Part 1. 8.

40|$|Tungsten Inert Gas welding {{is a very}} {{effective}} welding process widely used in many industries for joining of sheets, stainless steel pipes, automobile parts and many other manufacturing processes. This welding process has an additional advantage of protecting the weld bead {{with the help of}} shielding gas or inert gas which avoids the oxidation of the bead, making the joint wear resistant and slag free. This has increased the demand of TIG welding extensively. Generally, it is done manually by holding <b>filler</b> <b>rod</b> in one hand and the TIG torch with other. Thus, the process requires a high amount of skill and human labor. Automation of TIG welding will not only reduce human labor but also improve accuracy. The project aims to develop and design an automated <b>filler</b> <b>rod</b> feeding system for TIG welding. To fulfil this purpose, a number of mechanisms are considered namely rack-pinion mechanism, slider-crank mechanism and screw-nut mechanism.

25|$|The flame {{is applied}} to the base metal and held until a small puddle of molten metal is formed. The puddle is moved along the path where the weld bead is desired. Usually, more metal is added to the puddle as it is moved along by dipping metal from a welding <b>rod</b> or <b>filler</b> <b>rod</b> into the molten metal puddle.

50|$|These {{limitations}} {{are the reasons}} why large high crown panels such as wings and fenders are often made in many pieces. The pieces are then welded together usually with one of two processes. TIG welding (Tungsten Inert Gas) produces less heat distortion, but produces a harder, more brittle weld that may cause problems when planishing/smoothing by hand, or in the wheeling machine. Oxy-acetylene welding joints don't have this drawback, provided {{they are allowed to}} cool to room temperature in air, but do produce more heat distortion. Panel joints may be achieved using autogenous welding - that is welding without <b>filler</b> <b>rod</b> (Oxy-acetylene or TIG processes), this is useful when finally smoothing the welding joints as it reduces the amount filing/grinding/linishing needed or almost eliminates it altogether. It also, more importantly, reduces heat distortion of the surface contour, which must be corrected on the wheel or with hammer and dolly.|$|R
5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A <b>filler</b> <b>rod</b> may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|R

In fabrication industries, for both low alloy and plain carbon steel plates of odd shapes excessive residual magnetism is a bottleneck in the welding process.

Even though in theory lot of methods were told about demagnetization, in practical due to odd shapes like curved and arch shape plates, the behavior of magnetic field is very peculiar. Gradually removing the plate from magnetic field of a magnetizing source is a common method, but this will not work out because of the odd shape. The other method of slowly reducing the magnetic field and changing the polarity will also fail due to shifting of polarity {{from one end to the}} other end of the plate. In the absence of any standard procedure to meet this demagnetization process, separate effective and easy process method is required to be established.

It has also been shown that (Mg,A 1) serpentine-like phases react with KC 1 to form dioctahedral micas and Mg-rich serpentine phases, but the latter do not react o trioctahedral micas (Kotel'nikova et al., 1976). Consequently, it was desirable to look for mechanisms for obtaining trioctahedral micas from serpentine-like phases. Experimental Experiments were performed in unsealed (capped) Pt capsules in cold-seal bombs (Kotov & Kopeikin, 1972) at PH 20 = 100 (2 " 5) MPa, and T between 500 (5) and 550 (5) ~ (Fig. 1).

5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a <b>filler</b> <b>rod</b> may be used, but usually not.|$|R

Tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding was done on SS 304 2 B plate with thick-ness of 1. 2 mm in Coraza Systems Malaysia Sdn. Bhd using a KADEYOU machine. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to develop mathematical relation-ships between the welding process parameters (i. e, welding current, filler size and flow rate of the shielding gas) and the output variable of the weld joint (ultimate tensile strength) to determine the welding input parameters {{that led to the}} desired weld quality. Comparison between measured and calculated results was in good agreement indicating that the developed models can predict the responses adequately within the limits of welding pa-rameters being used. High welding current (50 A) cause microstructure become finer and increase in tensile strength while low current (30 A) caused root of the metal plate not weld completely which weakened the joint (724. 84 MPa and 718. 33 MPa, correspond-ingly). The smallest filler (1. 6 mm) was good for tensile strength (745. 96 MPA) com-pared to the largest filler (2. 4 mm and 720. 90 MPa strength) because high heat energy used to melt the large filler also overheated the metal base that cause crack formation.

40|$|TIG welding is {{a popular}} joining method for {{stainless}} steel (SS) which contains 16 - 18 % of Cr and is responsible for its corrosion resistance and good mechanical properties.
