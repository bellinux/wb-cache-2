It is presently authorised for use with chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at a minimum dose of 1 x 107 CFU/kg of complete feedingstuffs. The applicant is now seeking authorisation for use with chickens reared for laying, ducks <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and ostriches. B. subtilis is a species that is considered by EFSA to be suitable for Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment. The sensitivity to antibiotics {{and the absence of}} toxigenic potential qualified the strain for QPS status. On this basis the product can be presumed safe for chickens reared for laying, ducks <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> and ostriches, <b>for</b> consumers of products derived from thes...|$|R

It is authorised for use in feeds for chickens, turkeys and pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> piglets, sows, calves and cats and dogs. The applicant is now seeking re-evaluation when used with calves and a new authorisation for use in feed for goat kids and lambs for rearing and <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at 1. 0 x 109 - 6. 6 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe <b>for</b> calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and <b>for</b> rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and rearing. However, lambs <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> are not considered a minor species and require a separate demonstration of safety which was not provided. No additional concerns would arise for consumers, users and the environment from the proposed extension of use. Seven trials made with calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> or rearing were considered. Use of the additive with calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> significantly increased final body weight and/or daily gain in four of five trials when used at a dose of 1 x 109 CFU/kg complete feed.

On this occasion, four groups of chickens were formed, with 100 chickens being treated in each group, as follows: K (classic mixture <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> broilers) and O-I (mixtures with triticale variety Kg 20), O-II (mixtures with triticale Favorit) and O-III group (mixtures with triticale Trijumf). The highest average body mass in the groups of chickens (male, female and chicks of both sexes), was scored by broiler chickens of O-II-group. The minimum food consumption for 42 -day-old chicks was achieved by group O-I (4. 275 kg), and the most by O-II group (4. 359 kg). Chickens of O-II- and III-O-group had the best feed conversion, while the chickens of O-I-group had a slightly poorer feed conversion. The mortality of the groups of chickens for the entire period of the study was the lowest in O-II-group, at 2. 0 %, and the highest mortality was found in O-III-group (6. 0 %). The production index was the highest in O-II-group (202. 726) and the lowest in O-I-group.
