2500|$|Swift {{explained}} to Billboard. [...] "I {{think the reason}} I said that was because I made the record {{exactly the same way}} I made the last three. I knew I hadn't jumped out of my comfort zone, which at the time was writing alone and working with Nathan. [...] the song was a real turning point for Red the album. When I wrote that song my mind started wandering to all the places we could go. If I were to think outside the box enough, go in with different people, I could learn from and <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do rub off on me as well as have what I do rub off on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Ammi {{read the}} words of [...] “And they let them <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> asked,” to teach that the Egyptians let the Israelites have their goods against their will.

2500|$|Many reformers – Galbraith is {{not alone}} in this – have as their basic {{objection}} to a free market that it frustrates them in achieving their reforms, because it enables people to <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want, not what the reformers want. Hence every reformer has a strong tendency to be averse to a free market.Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, in a review of The New Industrial State, points at Galbraith's lack for empiricism and selectiveness in the his use of evidence. He points out that [...] "It may be unjust and pointless to consider the degree of literal truth of each of the assertions that make up this argument. One would hardly discuss Gulliver's Travels by debating whether there really are any little people, or criticize the Grande Jatte because objects aren't made up of tiny dots. Nevertheless, it may help to judge the truth of Galbraith's." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{is enough}} for us to know, that the apostles <b>had</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> needed. God called and sent them to do a great work: and therefore, being just and merciful, he gave them the power which was wanted for that great work.|$|R

5000|$|All {{the people}} of this world find nothing in the end of this life, and they find {{themselves}} in nothingness, rather in hells. Why is it like that?
