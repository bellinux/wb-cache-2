5|$|While the NHL {{returned}} to action in 2005–06, {{he missed the}} first month of the season after suffering a knee injury in a pre-season game. Doctors considered Regehr fortunate, believing that a <b>knee</b> <b>brace</b> he had been wearing prevented a more severe injury that would have seen him miss up to six months. Despite missing 14 games, he set career highs in goals (6), assists (20) and points (26). He continued to quietly lead the Flames defence and earned a spot on the Canadian Olympic team in 2006. Regehr briefly played with his brother, Richie, who made his NHL debut with the Flames on December 29, 2005. He played the full season in 2006–07, including his 500th career game on March 15, 2007, against the Dallas Stars and scored his 100th career point on March 31 against the Vancouver Canucks. However, he was again forced out of the lineup due to a knee injury after only one game in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs.|$|E

40|$|Prophylactic <b>knee</b> <b>braces</b> are {{designed}} to prevent and reduce the severity of ligamentous injuries to the knee. Conflicting evidence is reported concerning their efficacy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of prophylactic <b>knee</b> <b>bracing</b> on the proprioceptive parameters of balance and joint position sense. Active and passive joint position sense were assessed using the Cybex II + Isokinetic Dynamometer (Cybex Division of Lumex, Inc, Ronkonkoma, NY). Sway index and center of balance were assessed using the Chattecx Dynamic Balance System (Chattanooga Group, Hixson, TN). Thirty-six male subjects were measured with and without prophylactic <b>knee</b> <b>braces.</b> Joint position sense was measured in degrees of error from four preselected target angles. Sway index and center of balance measures were recorded in centimeters under the following platform conditions: stable, plantar flexion/dorsiflexion, and inversion/eversion. Separate repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to determine if there were differences between the braced and unbraced conditions for center of balance, sway index, and joint position sense. Center of balance with the platform moving in a dorsi/plantar flexion direction was improved while wearing the <b>knee</b> <b>braces.</b> In addition, differences in both center of balance and sway were recorded across the three platform conditions with and without <b>knee</b> <b>bracing.</b> Bracing did not affect joint position sense. The results of this study suggest that prophylactic <b>knee</b> <b>braces</b> have very little impact on proprioceptive feedback mechanisms...|$|R

He ran for two touchdowns {{to put him in}} 2nd place on the all-time SEC touchdown list and he also threw for a touchdown. Late in the third quarter, he was hit in the chest by Kentucky defensive end Taylor Wyndham, fell backwards, and hit {{the back of his head}} on the knee of Florida tackle Marcus Gilbert, who was wearing a hard <b>knee</b> <b>brace.</b> Upon impact, Tebow briefly displayed a prominent fencing response with his left arm, indicating that a concussion had taken place. He lay motionless for several minutes before being helped to the sidelines, where he vomited. He was taken by ambulance to the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center. A CT scan showed no bleeding in the brain, with the injury described as a mild concussion. Coach Urban Meyer stayed the night in the hospital with Tebow, who was discharged in the morning. Coincidentally, Florida did not have a game scheduled for the following Saturday, and Tebow was cleared to play in the Gators' next contest at LSU on October 10, two weeks after the incident.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 1922 season, Goebel [...] "threw out his knee" [...] and {{was fitted}} with a steel hinge – {{an early version of}} a <b>knee</b> <b>brace.</b> However, the steel contraption {{required}} oiling and overheated when the oil dried, thus limiting Goebel's ability to play a complete game in 1922. One 1922 newspaper article described Goebel's <b>knee</b> <b>brace</b> this way: [...] "To enable Goebel to play, the Michigan trainers devised a steel brace – a hinge. This apparatus attached above and below the knee gave Goebel fairly good leg action because of the hinge. Before each game, Goebel liberally oiled the hinge to get free action because of the hinge." [...] Goebel's playing time was limited because [...] "the constant action would dry the oil and then the steel would become so hot that Goebel could not continue playing." [...] During the 1922 game against Illinois, Goebel's skin was burned by the steel.|$|E

Michigan shut out the Buckeyes, 19–0, with Goebel and Kipke scoring all the points. In the first period, Goebel blocked a punt and then kicked a long field goal from the 30-yard line for the game's first points. He also penetrated into the Ohio State backfield in the second quarter to recover a fumble. As the game wore on, the Buckeyes [...] "seemed to realize (Goebel's) importance in the Michigan lineup because he was forced to take plenty of punishment." [...] Football writer Billy Evans described Goebel's performance against Ohio State this way: [...] "No end in recent years has played a greater game (than) that which Goebel put up against Ohio State. For three periods Goebel was the mainspring of the Michigan eleven. He seemed to be in every play. It was always Goebel who was gumming things up for State.

40|$|The use {{of steel}} bracing systems for {{upgrading}} seismically insufficient structures is a feasible solution by enhancing the global stiffness {{and strength of}} such structures. Moreover, steel bracing systems have relatively low cost and easy construction phases. For this purpose, several configurations of steel bracing systems can be applied for upgrading the seismic behavior of the structures. The most frequently utilized systems comprise concentrically-braced frames, eccentrically-braced frames, and knee-brace frames [1]. In the last few decades, the seismic behavior and design of new steel structures with <b>knee</b> <b>bracing</b> systems has been studied extensively due to its efficiency as an earthquake resisting system [2 - 8]. Indeed, the structures with <b>knee</b> <b>bracing</b> can be designed to be stiff enough to control structural and nonstructural damage, and ductile enough to prevent sudden collapse. In order to achieve these purposes, the lateral stiffness {{is provided by the}} brace elements and ductility by the knee elements through the formation of plastic behavior for dissipation of the energy under earthquakes. In the current study, apart from the studies in the literature, the effectiveness of using different types of <b>knee</b> <b>bracing</b> systems, such as chevron, cross and diagonal <b>knee</b> <b>bracing</b> systems for enhancing the seismic response of the existing steel moment resisting frame systems were comparatively examined through nonlinear time history analysis...|$|R
