5|$|Most of India's early talkies {{were shot}} in Bombay, which remains the leading {{production}} center, but sound filmmaking soon {{spread across the}} multilingual nation. Within {{just a few weeks}} of Alam Aras March 1931 premiere, the Calcutta-based Madan Pictures had released both the Hindi Shirin Farhad and the Bengali Jamai Sasthi. The Hindustani Heer Ranjha was produced in Lahore, Punjab, the following year. In 1934, Sati Sulochana, the first Kannada talking picture to be released, was shot in Kolhapur, Maharashtra; Srinivasa Kalyanam became the first Tamil talkie actually shot in Tamil Nadu. Once the first talkie features appeared, the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India {{as it did in the}} United States. Already by 1932, the majority of feature productions were in sound; two years later, 164 of the 172 Indian feature films were talking pictures. Since 1934, with the sole exception of 1952, India <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>among</b> the top three movie-producing countries in the world every single year.|$|E

25|$|A {{complete}} ring {{has much}} simpler structure than a commutative ring. This owns to the Cohen structure theorem, which says, roughly, that a complete local ring tends {{to look like}} a formal power series ring or a quotient of it. On the other hand, the interaction between the integral closure and completion <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>among</b> the most important aspects that distinguish modern commutative ring theory from the classical one developed by the likes of Noether. Pathological examples found by Nagata led to the reexamination of the roles of Noetherian rings and motivated, among other things, the definition of excellent ring.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of this country, there were {{distinctive}} socioeconomic stratification among women as there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>among</b> men for centuries. This deepened the inequality between the upper/middle and lower/working classes. Prior to the feminist movement, the socioeconomic status of a family was based almost solely on the husband/father's occupation. Women who were now attaining high status jobs were attractive partners to men with high status jobs, so the high earners married the high earners and the low earners married the low earners. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same, and have had increased difficulty competing in the economy.|$|E
