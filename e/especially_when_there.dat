5|$|Before the 1999 {{season the}} Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins {{had been the}} first-ever draft choice of the {{expansion}} Carolina Panthers and {{in his second season}} led the Panthers to the NFC Championship game. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Mike Ditka, coach of the New Orleans Saints signed him after his release; however the experiment failed and Collins was released again. Although many people, including Sports Illustrated football beat writer Peter King questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a US$16.9 million contract, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was little interest for Collins's services league-wide, Accorsi was confident that Collins was a wise investment.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian State Railways regained {{interest}} in the line during the 1950s and resumed construction. The line was officially opened on 1 June 1957 and revenue traffic started the following day. The line was originally only used for freight trains, although it was occasionally used by passenger trains, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was maintenance work on bridges. The line received CTC on 11 January 1976. Lerkendal Station was opened on 1 December 1988, and {{with the establishment of}} the Trøndelag Commuter Rail in 1993, the station started being used for scheduled commuter rail services. Ownership of the line passed to the Norwegian National Rail Administration from 1 December 1996. Marienborg Station opened in 1999, and from 2001, all commuter trains operating to and from Steinkjer had Lerkendal Station as their southern terminus.|$|E
5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E

5|$|Special {{considerations}} {{have been}} given for contestants who were unable to return as champion because of circumstances beyond their control, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is a considerable time between taping of episodes. This occurred {{for the first time}} in season 25, when Priscilla Ball, who won on January 16, 2009, was unable to attend the taping of the next episode because of illness; as a result, three new contestants appeared on the next episode. Ball returned as a co-champion to play on the episode airing April 9, 2009. On the episode aired December 21, 2015, the returning champion, Claudia Corriere, could not return as champion because of a job offered in the weeks between tapings, so three new contestants played that day as well. Corriere returned as a co-champion on the January 18, 2016, episode, but was eliminated in a three-way loss.|$|E

Ownership of the tunnel passed to the Norwegian National Rail Administration from 1 December 1996. NSB launched a now abandoned proposal in 2002 to establish an urban train service in Trondheim, which would have included passenger trains running in a loop through the tunnel. It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone, including a connection for trains {{to be able to}} run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} U.S. {{medical school}} curriculum is four years long. Traditionally, {{the first two}} years are composed mainly of classroom basic science education, while the final two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. Today, clinical education is spread across all four years with the final year containing the most clinical rotation time. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published mandatory rules, obliging on all inpatient and outpatient teaching settings, laying down the guidelines for what medical students in the United States may do, if they have not completed a clerkship or sub-internship. These rules apply to when they are in the clinical setting in school, not when they are, for example, helping staff events or in other non-formal educational settings, even if they are helping provide certain clinical services along with nurses and the supervising physicians- for example, certain basic screening procedures. In the formal clinical setting in school, they can only assist with certain patient evaluation and management tasks, after the vital signs, chief complaint and the history of present illness have been discerned, but prior to the physical examination: reviewing the patient's signs and symptoms in each body system, and then reviewing the patient's personal medical, genetic, family, educational/occupational, and psychosocial history. The student's supervising physician (or another physician with supervisory privileges if the original doctor is no longer available, for some reason) must be in the room during the student's work, and must conduct this same assessment of the patient before performing the actual physical examination, and after finishing and conferring with the student, will review his or her notes and opinion, editing or correcting them if necessary, and will also have his or her own professional notes; both must then sign and date and I.D. the student's notes and the medical record. They may observe, but not perform, physical examinations, surgeries, endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, radiological or nuclear medicine procedures, oncology sessions, and obstetrics. The patient must give consent for their presence and participation in his or her care, even at a teaching facility. Depending on the time they have completed in school, their familiarity with the area of medicine and the procedure, and the presence of their supervisor, and any others needed, in the room or nearby, they may be allowed to conduct certain very minor tests associated with the physical examination, such as simple venipuncture blood draws, and electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms, for learning and experience purposes, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is no intern or resident available.|$|E
500|$|Restrictions {{on smoking}} were also {{introduced}} in the Wehrmacht. Cigarette rations in the military were limited to six per soldier per day. Extra cigarettes were often sold to the soldiers, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was no military advance or retreat in the battleground, however these were restricted to 50 for each person per month. Teenaged soldiers serving in the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, composed of [...] Hitler Youth members, were given confectionery instead of tobacco products. Access to cigarettes was not allowed for the Wehrmacht's female auxiliary personnel. Medical lectures were arranged to persuade military personnel to quit smoking. An ordinance enacted on 3 November 1941 raised tobacco taxes by approximately 80–95% of the retail price. It would be the highest rise in tobacco taxes in Germany until more than 25 years {{after the collapse of}} the Nazi regime.|$|E

500|$|Like other rails, {{this species}} {{has a wide}} range of vocalisations. The male's {{territorial}} and advertising call is a series of rapid grating krrr notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second for several minutes. It is given most often in the breeding season, usually early or late in the day, but sometimes continues after dark or starts before dawn. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, but will also call when chasing intruders on the ground or in flight. Both sexes give a sharp, loud kip call as an alarm or during territorial interactions, adapting a similar pose as for the advertising call. Once breeding starts, the birds become much quieter, but territorial birds commence the kip call again during the non-breeding season, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is a high density of African crakes in the area.
