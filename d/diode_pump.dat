5000|$|Neodymium-doped {{solid state}} lasers {{continue}} to be the laser source of choice for industrial applications. Direct pumping of the upper Nd laser level at 885-nm (rather than at the more traditional broad 808-nm band) offers the potential of improved performance through a reduction in the lasing quantum defect, thereby improving system efficiency, reducing cooling requirements, and enabling further TEM00 power scaling. Because of the narrow 885-nm absorption feature in Nd:YAG, certain systems may benefit from the use of wavelength-locked <b>diode</b> <b>pump</b> sources, which serve to narrow and stabilize the pump emission spectrum to keep it closely aligned to this absorption feature. To date, high power diode laser locking schemes such as internal distributed feedback Bragg gratings and externally aligned volume holographic grating optics, VHG’s, have not been widely implemented due to the increased cost and assumed performance penalty of the technology. However, recent advancements in the manufacture of stabilized <b>diode</b> <b>pump</b> sources which utilize external wavelength locking now offer improved spectral properties with little-to-no impact on power and efficiency. [...] Benefits of this approach include improvements in laser efficiency, spectral linewidth, and pumping efficiency.|$|E

40|$|We {{have shown}} that pump light {{intensity}} stabilisation of a single-mode laser <b>diode</b> <b>pumped</b> Nd:YAG non-planar ring oscillator (NPRO) results in significant intensity noise reduction of the NPRO, as well as frequency noise suppression {{in the same order}} of magnitude. This effect does not occur in conventional laser <b>diode</b> array <b>pumped</b> NPROs due to mode beating effects originating in the multi-mode pump.

50|$|A noble <b>diode</b> <b>pump</b> {{is a type}} of ion pump used in {{high-vacuum}} {{applications that}} employs both a chemically reactive cathode, such as titanium, and an additional cathode composed of tantalum. The tantalum cathode serves as a high-inertia crystal lattice structure for the reflection and burial of neutrals, increasing pumping effectiveness of inert gas ions. Pumping intermittently high quantities of hydrogen with noble diodes should be done with great care, as hydrogen might over months get re-emitted out of the tantalum.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} gain {{tailoring}} upon the optical extraction and OPD in a CW edge–pumped disk amplifier is examined using a two–dimensional model of diode pumping {{coupled with a}} two–dimensional, geometric model of optical extraction by a Gaussian profile beam from a Yb:YAG medium 1. The gain medium is described by the well–known quasi–three level model of Beach 2, 3. Gain tailoring is accomplished by focusing the <b>diode</b> <b>pump</b> beam using cylindrical lenses. The <b>diode</b> <b>pump</b> beam, optical extraction, and gain medium models are described after which the pump absorption efficiency, en-ergy deposition uniformity, output energy, and maximum peak–to–valley (PV) OPD are examined {{as a function of}} the pump lens focal length and output aperture radius as well as amplifier input seed energy, number of roundtrip amplifier passes, and <b>diode</b> <b>pump</b> power. It is shown that using pump beam focusing to tailor the gain radially deposits more en-ergy in the central region of the disk and thus results in improved optical extraction because a Gaussian input optical beam preferentially accesses the central region of the disk. With gain tailoring one can achieve the same amplifier output energies as without gain tailoring but using less pump power and/or amplifier seed energy, resulting in reduced disk heating and diode–pump waste heat. Although the maximum PV OPD is larger, the central region of the thermally–in-duced OPD remains relatively uniform, allowing one to increase the output energy with only modest increases in the ef-fective OPD...|$|E
