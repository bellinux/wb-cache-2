Individual <b>depressions</b> vary in their size (amplitude) and shape (time profile). Examination of ground-based neutron monitor cosmic ray intensity data has led us to classify them into symmetric and asymmetric <b>depressions,</b> depending on symmetric/asymmetric decrease and recovery phases of individual <b>depressions.</b> Symmetric <b>depressions</b> were observed to have (i) V-shape and (ii) bowl or U-shape. Asymmetric <b>depressions</b> have been categorized into (i) Forbush-like, (ii) composite, and (iii) wavy <b>depressions.</b> Looking at the solar data, and analyzing the solar wind plasma/field data we have searched for the solar and interplanetary causes of these <b>depressions.</b> Examinations and analysis of simultaneous variations in solar plasma speed, its density and temperature, along with interplanetary magnetic field, its magnitude and fluctuations in it, has led us to identify possible structure(s) such as ICMEs, shock/sheath regions (formed due to compression of ambient magnetic field by high speed CMEs), interaction regions (formed by interaction between slow and high speed solar wind) and compression regions (formed by interaction between slow CMEs and high speed streams from coronal holes).

40|$|Abstract and Keywords also in Spanish Spanish title: Avtomatska zaznava in omejitev kraških kotanj in njena uporaba v geomorfološkem kartiranju in morfomertrični analiziDigital {{elevation}} models (DEM) are digital {{representations of}} topography that are especially suitable for numerical terrain analysis in earth sciences and engineering. One {{of the main}} quantitative uses of DEM is the automatic delineation of flow networks and watersheds in hydrology and geomorphology. In these applications (using both low-resolution and precision DEM) <b>depressions</b> hinder the inference of pathways {{and a lot of}} work has been done in designing algorithms that remove them so as to generate depression-free digital elevation models with no interruptions to flow. There are, however, geomorphological environments, such as karst terrains, in which <b>depressions</b> are singular elements, on scales ranging from centimetres to kilometres, which are of intrinsic interest. The detection of these <b>depressions</b> is of significant interest in geomorphologic mapping because the development of large <b>depressions</b> is normal in karst terrains: potholes, blind valleys, dolines, uvalas and poljes. The smallest <b>depressions</b> that can be detected depend on the spatial resolution (pixel size) of the DEM. For example, <b>depressions</b> from centimetres to a few metres, such as some types of karren, cannot be detected if the raster digital elevation model has a spatial resolution greater than, say, 5 m (i. e., square 5 m pixel). In this work we describe a method for the automatic detection and delineation of terrain <b>depressions.</b> First, we apply a very efficient algorithm to remove pits from the DEM. The terrain <b>depressions</b> are then obtained by subtracting the depression-free DEM from the original DEM. The final product is a digital map of <b>depressions</b> that facilitates the calculation of morphometric features such as the geometry of the <b>depressions,</b> the mean depth of the <b>depressions,</b> the density of <b>depressions</b> across the study area and the relationship between <b>depressions</b> and other variables such as altitude. The method is illustrated by applying it to data from the Sierra de las Nieves karst massif in the province of Málaga in Southern Spain. This is a carbonate aquifer that is drained by three main springs and in which the <b>depressions</b> {{play an important role in}} the recharge of the aquifer. A doline density map, produced from a map of 324 detected dolines/uvalas, identifies three main recharge areas of the three springs. Other morphometric results related to the size and direction of the dolines are also presented. Finally the dolines can be incorporated into a geomorphology map. E. Pardo-Igúzquiza, J. J.

40|$|International audienceThe {{actions of}} four mGluR antagonists, (+) -MCPG, MAP 4, MCCG and (S) - 4 CPG, were {{evaluated}} against agonist-induced <b>depressions</b> of synaptic transmission at the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway in rat hippocampal slices. (+) -MCPG (1 mM) reversed very effectively <b>depressions</b> of field EPSPs induced by (1 S, 3 R) -ACPD and (1 S, 3 S) -ACPD but had weak and variable effects on <b>depressions</b> induced by L-AP 4. It {{had no effect}} on <b>depressions</b> induced by either (-) -baclofen or carbachol. In contrast, MAP 4 (500 microM) reversed very effectively <b>depressions</b> induced by L-AP 4 without affecting <b>depressions</b> induced by (1 S, 3 S) -ACPD. MCCG (1 mM) had the opposite activity; it antagonized <b>depressions</b> induced by (1 S, 3 S) -ACPD but not those induced by L-AP 4. Finally, (S) - 4 CPG (1 mM) reversed small <b>depressions</b> of field EPSPs induced by high concentrations (50 - 100 microM) of (1 S, 3 R) - and (1 S, 3 S) -ACPD, but not L-AP 4, whilst having no effect on large <b>depressions</b> induced by 10 microM (1 S, 3 S) -ACPD in voltage-clamped cells. These results confirm and extend the effectiveness and selectivity of (+) -MCPG as an mGluR antagonist. The divergent effects of the group I antagonist, (S) - 4 CPG, can be explained by an indirect action on postsynaptic receptors which is manifest when high agonist concentrations are used in non-voltage-clamp experiments. The action of MCCG and MAP 4 indicates that two pharmacologically-distinct mGluRs, belonging to classes II and III, can regulate synaptic transmission in the CA 1 region via presynaptic mechanisms...|$|R
