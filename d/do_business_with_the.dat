Emphasising the overall purpose of the TPA, the judges reasoned that the purpose would not be fulfilled if Baxter could claim derivative immunity. In response to the concern that one party to a transaction (the government) would be immune from the TPA while the other party would be bound by it, the joint judgment reasoned there was [...] "nothing unusual" [...] about such an outcome.|$|E

500|$|The first Danish farmer-owned {{co-operative}} bacon factory {{was established}} in 1887. [...] There were soon more, and by 1897 there were dozens. [...] By 1900 the co-operatives outnumbered private enterprises. [...] By this time the export of live pigs had almost ceased, being replaced by export of pork and bacon. [...] There followed intense competition between the co-operatives and private producers, with the co-operatives eventually winning out. [...] The co-operatives had competition from foreign investors as well as indigenous enterprises. [...] The first of these was I. D. Koopmann of Hamburg, who bought and opened new bacon factories {{in order to get}} around the German ban on live pigs. [...] Koopmann refused to <b>do</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> co-operatives, calling the movement [...] "a sick idea". [...] They worked closely with Denny & Co. of London—the Denny family were a major bacon manufacturer in Ireland and between them they controlled {{a large portion of the}} UK market. [...] Denny's took over Koopmann's when the latter got into debt in 1894. [...] Denny's never managed to get on top of the co-operatives, but they held on in Denmark until 1968 when they finally sold what was left of the Danish operation to the Federation of Danish Co-operatives. [...] Another major foreign player, ironically, was the English Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS). [...] The CWS had depots in Denmark from 1881, taking advantage of the refusal of London dealers to buy from the co-operatives. [...] From 1899, however, they started setting up their own manufacturing in Denmark. [...] Production grew until 1930 but then slowly declined and CWS started selling up in 1971.|$|E
