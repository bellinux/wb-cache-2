5|$|Apomorphine, a non-orally {{administered}} dopamine agonist, {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and <b>dyskinesia</b> in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal <b>dyskinesia</b> may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive <b>dyskinesia.</b> Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E

40|$|Both {{increased}} and decreased <b>dyskinesias</b> {{have been reported}} from open label clinical trials of transplantation of human embryonic dopamine rich tissue in Parkinson's disease patients. In the first double-blind clinical transplantation trial, 15 % of the grafted patients developed severe postoperative <b>dyskinesias</b> in the “off” phase. Since then, postoperative off-medication <b>dyskinesias</b> have been reported from two additional series of grafted patients. However, such <b>dyskinesias</b> are probably not a novel phenomenon. These <b>dyskinesias</b> have shown a different temporal development postoperatively compared to the antiparkinsonian graft effects, and no significant relationship with the magnitude of graft-derived dopaminergic reinnervation or symptomatic relief. However, positron emission tomography {{studies have indicated that}} an unbalanced putaminal dopaminergic function may contribute to this postoperative complication. While {{there is little doubt that}} intrastriatal grafts can induce <b>dyskinesias,</b> these appear to differ from common drug-induced <b>dyskinesias.</b> The term graft-induced <b>dyskinesias</b> (GID) is therefore suggested to more clearly identify this complication.

5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive <b>dyskinesia,</b> a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} {{reportedly}} {{associated with the}} various atypical antipsychotics vary and are medication-specific. Generally speaking, atypical antipsychotics are widely believed to have a lower likelihood {{for the development of}} tardive <b>dyskinesia</b> than the typical antipsychotics. However, tardive <b>dyskinesia</b> typically develops after long-term (possibly decades) use of antipsychotics. It is not clear, then, if atypical antipsychotics, having been in use for a relatively short time, produce a lower incidence of tardive <b>dyskinesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|All of the {{atypical}} antipsychotics warn {{about the}} possibility of tardive <b>dyskinesia</b> in their package inserts and in the PDR. It is not possible to truly know the risks of tardive <b>dyskinesia</b> when taking atypicals, because tardive <b>dyskinesia</b> can take many decades to develop and the atypical antipsychotics are not old enough to have been tested over a long enough period of time to determine all of the long-term risks. One hypothesis as to why atypicals have a lower risk of tardive <b>dyskinesia</b> is because they are much less fat-soluble than the typical antipsychotics and because they are readily released from D2 receptor and brain tissue. The typical antipsychotics remain attached to the D2 receptors and accumulate in the brain tissue which may lead to TD.|$|E

Using in vivo brain imaging, we show excessive serotonergic innervation in the grafted striatum of two patients with Parkinson's disease, who had exhibited major motor recovery after transplantation with dopamine-rich fetal mesencephalic tissue but had later developed off-medication <b>dyskinesias.</b> The <b>dyskinesias</b> were markedly attenuated by systemic administration of a serotonin [5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) ] receptor (5 -HT 1 A) agonist, which dampens transmitter release from serotonergic neurons, indicating that the <b>dyskinesias</b> were caused by the serotonergic hyperinnervation.

30|$|Furthermore, an {{increase}} in the incidence of <b>dyskinesias</b> has been observed in dopamine-depleted rats that received a transplant containing relatively many serotonin and few dopamine cells, whereas the <b>dyskinesias</b> decreased when rats received a transplant consisting predominantly of dopaminergic neurons [16]. An increase of <b>dyskinesias</b> was also observed in two PD patients who received a graft with a high striatal serotonin/dopamine transporter ratio.

25|$|Studies {{have also}} been {{conducted}} which show that long-term prescription of hydroxyzine can lead to tardive <b>dyskinesia</b> after years of use, but effects related to <b>dyskinesia</b> have also anecdotally been reported after periods of 7.5 months, such as continual head rolling, lip licking {{and other forms of}} athetoid movement. In certain cases, elderly patients' previous interactions with phenothiazine derivatives or pre-existing neuroleptic treatment may have had some contribution towards <b>dyskinesia</b> at the administration of hydroxyzine due to hypersensitivity caused due to the prolonged treatment, and therefore some contraindication is given to the short-term administration of hydroxyzine to those with previous phenothiazine use.|$|E

40|$|Background: Although the {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease (PD) is very effective, {{in the course of}} the disease, 40 % to 60 % of patients develop <b>dyskinesias.</b> The pathophysiology of <b>dyskinesias</b> is still unclear. Results of preclinical research suggest that uptake and uncontrolled release of dopamine by serotonergic neurons is an important factor. Based on this model, we hypothesized that <b>dyskinesias</b> will develop predominantly in PD patients with a relatively preserved serotonergic system. Methods: Between 1995 and 1998, 50 patients with early-stage untreated PD, diagnosed according to clinical criteria, and reduced striatal [I- 123]beta-carboxymethyoxy- 3 -beta-(4 -iodophenyl) tropane (CIT) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) binding were recruited. To test our hypothesis, we retrospectively assessed baseline [123 I]beta-CIT SPECT scans for striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and midbrain serotonin transporter (SERT) availability as well as the SERT-to-DAT ratios. We compared these data between patients that developed <b>dyskinesias</b> and patients that did not develop <b>dyskinesias</b> during a mean follow-up of 14. 2 years. Results: Approximately half of the PD patients developed <b>dyskinesias.</b> No differences in baseline [I- 123]beta-CIT DAT availability, SERT availability, or SERT-to-DAT ratios were found between the dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic group. The development of <b>dyskinesias</b> was most strongly associated with the age of onset (P = 0. 002). Conclusions: SERT-to-DAT ratios in early-stage untreated PD do not correlate with the future development of <b>dyskinesias.</b> However, our study does not exclude the possibility that SERT-to-DAT ratios increase with disease progression in patients that develop <b>dyskinesias</b> because of a slower rate of degeneration of the serotonergic syste...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} dopaminergic therapy on balance in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains unclear, {{including}} previous studies that excluded {{the effect of}} <b>dyskinesias</b> or other involuntary movements on postural sway. Additionally, medication’s effects may differ between fallers and non-fallers. In this study, the authors quantify the effect of dopaminergic medication on postural balance (sway) in advanced PD, with and without <b>dyskinesias,</b> and consider the patient’s history of falls. Methods: In 24 patients with advanced idiopathic PD, postural balance was measured using a strain-gauge force platform. Before and after taking dopaminergic medication, the patient’s postural sway was measured at 30 -second intervals to determine sway length (SL) and sway area (SA). Data analysis included the presence of <b>dyskinesias</b> during "ON" medication condition and history of previous falls. Results: No significant changes occurred in SL or SA with dopaminergic treatment for fallers without <b>dyskinesias</b> or non-fallers with <b>dyskinesias.</b> However, after dopaminergic treatment, SL and SA were 37. 8 % and 45 % lower, respectively, in non-fallers without <b>dyskinesias</b> (indicating better balance) and were 87. 4 % and 162. 8 % higher, respectively, in fallers with <b>dyskinesias</b> (indicating poorer balance). In the ON medication condition, SL and SA were larger in patients with <b>dyskinesias</b> when compared with patients without dyskinesias; SL was larger in fallers than non-fallers in both groups with or without <b>dyskinesias.</b> Conclusions: Dopaminergic medication effects on postural sway could be a predictive factor for fall risk in PD patients with and without dyskinesias: specifically, decreased sway could indicate minimal fall risk whereas no change or increased postural sway could indicate a high risk...|$|R

40|$|OFF-l-dopa <b>dyskinesias</b> {{have been}} a {{surprising}} side-effect of intrastriatal foetal ventral mesencephalic transplantation in patients with Parkinson's disease. It has been proposed that excessive and unregulated dopaminergic stimulation of host post-synaptic striatal neurons by the grafts could be responsible for these <b>dyskinesias.</b> To address this issue we transplanted foetal dopaminergic neurons from mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DATKO) or from wild-type mice, into a rat model of Parkinson's disease and l-dopa-induced <b>dyskinesias.</b> Both wild-type and DATKO grafts reinnervated the host striatum to a similar extent, but DATKO grafts produced a greater and more diffuse increase in extra-cellular striatal dopamine levels.

In summary, DATKO grafts causing high and diffuse extra-cellular dompamine levels do not per se alter graft-induced recovery or produce OFF-l-dopa <b>dyskinesias.</b> Wild-type dopaminergic neurons {{appear to be the}} most effective neuronal type to restore function and reduce l-dopa-induced <b>dyskinesias...</b>|$|R

25|$|The mode {{of action}} of olanzapine's {{antipsychotic}} activity is unknown. It may involve antagonism of dopamine and serotonin receptors.

However, the dose-response curves showed a marked (three- to fourfold) shift to the left in lesioned animals, indicating behavioural supersensitivity. In contrast, L-DOPA-induced <b>dyskinesias</b> were only observed in MPTP-treated monkeys. Doses required for induction of <b>dyskinesias</b> were lower than those required to induce climbing.

30|$|All in all, {{particularly}} {{the results of}} the preclinical studies suggest that <b>dyskinesias</b> may predominantly develop in PD patients with a relative spared serotonergic system. This study aims to determine whether an imbalance between the loss of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons precedes the development of <b>dyskinesias</b> in PD. Therefore, we retrospectively assessed striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and midbrain serotonin transporter (SERT) availability as well as the SERT-to-DAT ratios, as measured with [123 I]β-carboxymethyoxy- 3 -beta-(4 -iodophenyl) tropane (CIT) (a radiotracer that binds to both the DAT and SERT [18]) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in drug-naïve early stage PD patients. We compared these data between patients who had developed <b>dyskinesias</b> and patients who had not developed <b>dyskinesias</b> during a minimum of 5 -year follow-up.

40|$|Background: In late stage Parkinson {{patients}} {{there is}} an unmet need for new treatments to adequately control motor complications, especially <b>dyskinesias.</b> In several preliminary studies, {{it has been suggested}} that applying unilateral low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF rTMS), delivered at the primary motor cortex (MC) or the supplementary motor area (SMA), may reduce levodopa-induced <b>dyskinesias</b> (LID), either in a single or a multiple session stimulation protocol. In our current clinical research, we examined whether single or multiple (accelerated) sham-controlled bilateral LF rTMS session(s) applied to the primary motor cortices are able to reduce levodopa-induced <b>dyskinesias</b> in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Methods: During a levodopa challenge test, we first investigated the effect of a single sham-controlled session of LF rTMS (1 Hz) to both left and right primary motor cortical areas on <b>dyskinesias</b> and motor function in nine late-stage Parkinson patients. In a second study, patients were assigned to a five day sham-controlled bilateral motor cortex cross-over accelerated LF rTMS protocol and effects on <b>dyskinesias,</b> motor and executive function and emotional status were assessed. Results: We found no significant clinical change in levodopa-induced <b>dyskinesias</b> and motor function with either stimulation protocol. Conclusions: One or multiple bilateral LF rTMS session(s) applied to the primary motor cortex were unable to reduce levodopa-induced <b>dyskinesias</b> in late-stage Parkinson patients.
