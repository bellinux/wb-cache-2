5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a <b>hymn</b> <b>book.</b> Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E

5000|$|At {{its first}} appearance, the hymn was in four stanzas of eight lines (8.7.8.7.D), and this four-stanza version remains in common and current {{use to the}} present day, being taken up as early as 1760 in Anglican {{collections}} such as those by Madan (1760 and 1767), Conyers (1772), and Toplady (1776); in <b>hymn</b> <b>books</b> associated withWhitefield (1767, 1800) and the Countess of Huntingdon's Connection (1780, and 1800); and in Methodist <b>hymn</b> <b>books</b> slightly outside the mainstream (the Select Hymns of 1783; Spence's Pocket <b>Hymn</b> <b>Books</b> of the early 19th century; and the American [...] "Wesleyan" [...] Methodist <b>hymn</b> <b>books).</b>|$|R

25|$|Cash's early {{memories}} {{were dominated by}} gospel music and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs {{at the age of}} twelve. When young, Cash had a high tenor voice, before becoming a bass-baritone after his voice changed. In high school, he sang on a local radio station. Decades later he released an album of traditional gospel songs, called My Mother's <b>Hymn</b> <b>Book.</b> He was also significantly influenced by traditional Irish music, which he heard performed weekly by Dennis Day on the Jack Benny radio program.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, {{the ecumenical}} {{movement}} reached its height as a joint commission the United and Anglican Churches and the Disciples of Christ approved a Plan of Union, and The <b>Hymn</b> <b>Book,</b> a joint {{publication of the}} United and Anglican Churches was published. The tide quickly turned though, and in 1975, the Anglican House of Bishops and National Executive Council declared that the Plan of Union was unacceptable. However, the Anglican, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Catholic, and United churches did agree to recognize the validity of Christian baptisms performed {{in any of these}} denominations.|$|E

25|$|Hymnody is an {{important}} aspect of worship in Anglicanism, and the ACC is no different. There is no one hymnal required to be used, although the ACC has produced four successive authorized versions since 1908. The most recent, Common Praise, was published in 1998. Anglican plainsong is represented in the new hymnal, {{as well as in the}} older Canadian Psalter, published in 1963. Notable Canadian Anglican hymnists include Derek Holman, Gordon Light, Herbert O'Driscoll, and Healey Willan. For a time, beginning in the early 1970s, many Anglican congregations experimented with The <b>Hymn</b> <b>Book</b> produced jointly with the United Church of Canada under the direction of Canadian composer F. R. C. Clarke, but both churches have since abandoned the common hymnal.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} German cities {{published}} Protestant songbooks before Martin Luther's Geystliche gesangk Buchleyn, including Nuremberg and Erfurt. The reformed Church in Strasbourg, {{under the leadership}} of Martin Bucer, {{was one of the first}} to institute congregational singing to replace choral singing, and produced many psalms and hymns for this purpose, including some (such as 'Gott sei gelobt') by Luther. Although the first Strasbourg liturgies didn't include music, publishers soon began including musical notation. Early on, the biblical Psalms were used almost exclusively by the Strasbougers. Successive editions of the Strasbourg Psalter contained increasing numbers of psalms. In Constance, where Johannes Zwick and the Blarer brothers led, hymns as well as psalms were used, with the Constance <b>Hymn</b> <b>Book</b> of 1540 being divided evenly between hymns and psalms. In 1537, the Strasbourgers also began to include original hymns in their Psalter.|$|E
25|$|The Church of Scotland has no {{compulsory}} prayer book, {{although it}} does have a <b>hymn</b> <b>book</b> (the 4th edition was published in 2005). Its Book of Common Order contains recommendations for public worship, which are usually followed fairly closely in the case of sacraments and ordinances. Preaching is the central focus of most services. Traditionally, Scots worship centred on the singing of metrical psalms and paraphrases, but for generations these have been supplemented with Christian music of all types. The typical Church of Scotland service lasts about an hour, and has been characterised jokingly as a hymn-prayer sandwich, in which everything leads up to a climax in a 15-minute sermon near the end. There is normally no sung or responsive liturgy, but worship {{is the responsibility of the}} minister in each parish, and the style of worship can vary and be quite experimental. In recent years, a variety of modern song books have been widely used to appeal more to contemporary trends in music, and elements from alternative liturgies including those of the Iona Community are incorporated in some congregations. Although traditionally worship is conducted by the parish minister, participation and leadership by members who are not ministers in services is becoming more frequent, especially in the Highlands and the Borders.|$|E
5000|$|A second, {{abridged}} version (with the second stanza omitted), appeared {{as early as}} 1778 in Hymns and Psalms for the Service of Fitz-Roy Chapel (London, 1778), then in the Wesleyan [...] "Large Hymn Book" [...] of 1780, and thence in many others, chiefly British and predominantly Anglican, but including also many later official Methodist <b>hymn</b> <b>books.</b> A sample collation of 85 <b>hymn</b> <b>books</b> containing some version of this hymn suggests that the {{abridged version}} appears in roughly 25% of Protestant hymn books; the full four-stanza version {{in most of the}} remainder.|$|R
40|$|My {{hypothesis}} is that the Westernization of modern music in the Asia-Pacific region-namely Polynesia, Hawaii, China, Micronesia, Japan and Korea-from the late 18 th century to 19 th century was largely influenced by the hymns introduced by the Christian missionaries. In {{order to determine the}} commonalities and differences in the process of westernization in modern music in these regions, I compared the hymn tunes appearing in the <b>hymn</b> <b>books</b> published in these regions from late 18 th century to the early 19 th century. As the first case study of this nature, I focus on the relationship between Japanese hymns tunes and Korean hymn tunes. Then I compare this relationship to the hymn tunes in other Pacific regions. The conclusion is that Hawaiian and Micronesian <b>hymn</b> <b>books</b> share many tunes in common with Japanese and Korean <b>hymn</b> <b>books.</b> Hymnals from other Polynesian islands, however, contain many tunes that differ from those in Japanese and Korean books...|$|R

The hymn was later published in 374 hymnals worldwide, though it was censored and altered in the United States by slaveholders for evangelising to slaves.

500|$|The {{bachelor}} auction {{was created}} solely {{to provide more}} evidence that Apu was the best bachelor in Springfield. Appel found that the scene [...] "wrote itself", as every other man in Springfield is essentially a loser compared to Apu. The scene acted as the episode's opening set piece, a concept that Scully liked to use in every episode. The montage of Apu getting several different hair styles originally included three more, but they ended up being cut for time. The shot in which Apu's mother falls to the ground, a joke that the staff love, was inspired by an incident when Moore saw a man fall {{in much the same}} way. The joke was only inserted to buy Apu and Homer more time {{to come up with a}} lie.
