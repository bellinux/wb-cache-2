2500|$|Tolkien {{wrote of}} Saruman {{crossbreeding}} Orcs and Men, producing Men-orcs and Orc-men in [...] "Myths Revisited" [...] in Morgoth's Ring. The half-orcs and goblin-men, mentioned by Gamling at Helm's Deep, {{seem likely to}} have been crossbreeds, and they are not described much beyond being [...] "creatures of Isengard", [...] "that the foul craft of Saruman has bred", and that [...] "they will not quail at the sun". The first encounter with one of these half-goblins occurs in The Fellowship of the Ring when the Hobbits encounter a suspicious character they refer to as the Southerner who is in cahoots with Bill Ferny (the Southerner {{turns out to be a}} spy of Saruman and possibly Sauron, and possibly a <b>double</b> <b>spy</b> for both as Aragorn suggests). Half-orcs are described later on by Meriadoc Brandybuck, who saw them marching out of Isengard, as [...] "horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, leering, squint-eyed." [...] The hobbits occasionally encounter unusual-looking Men such as the [...] "ruffians" [...] in the Shire, implying some of these might be half-orcs. During the scouring of the Shire it is stated that the ruffians that have invaded include half-orcs and more of the sallow-skinned, slant/squinty eyed folks like the Southerner spy.|$|E
60|$|The Master of Gray wrote from Chillingham, on the English {{side of the}} Border, {{where he}} was playing the spy for Cecil. Often he played the <b>double</b> <b>spy,</b> for England and for Rome. Lennox {{may well have been}} puzzled, he may have said so, but the report rests on the {{evidence}} of one who did not hear his words, who wished to flatter the scepticism of James’s English enemies, and whose character (though on one point he is unjustly accused) reeks with infamy.|$|E
60|$|The {{point for}} us to mark is that all these conspirators and violent men, Bothwell (in exile or {{secretly}} in Scotland), Colville (in 1600 an exile in Paris), the Laird of Spot, the Cranstouns, the infamous Archibald Douglas, with Richard Douglas his nephew, and Logan of Restalrig, were united, if not by real friendship, at least, as Thucydides says, by ‘partnership in desperate enterprises’ and by 1600 were active in a subterranean way. If {{it is fair to}} say, noscitur a sociis, ‘a man is known by the company he keeps,’ Logan of Restalrig bears the mark of the secret conspirator. He had relations with persons more distinguished than his Chirnsides and Whittingham Douglases, though they were of near kin to the Earl of Morton. His mother, a daughter of Lord Gray, married Lord Home, after the death of Logan’s father. The Laird of Restalrig was thus a half-brother of the new Lord Home, a Warden of the Border, and also was first cousin of the beautiful, accomplished, and infamous Master of Gray, the <b>double</b> <b>spy</b> of England and of Rome.|$|E

King's interest in Cold War novels, Russian spies and espionage themes, particularly that of <b>double</b> <b>spies</b> living in a double life, {{became the basis for}} her new album, Junior. Ranging lyrically [...] "from exuberance and anger to heartbreaking melancholy, and sonically from experimental pieces to accessible pop," [...] Junior showcases her further maturation as a well-rounded artist that continues to defy categorization and expectations.|$|R

6000|$|July found Knox and {{his family}} at St. Andrews, in the New Hospice, a pre- Reformation ecclesiastical building, west of the Cathedral, and {{adjoining}} the gardens of St. Leonard's College. At this time James Melville, brother of the more celebrated scholar and divine, Andrew Melville, was a golf-playing young student of St. Leonard's College. He tells us how Knox would walk about the College gardens, exhorting the St. Leonard's lads to be staunch Protestants; for St. Salvator's and St. Mary's were not devoted to the Reformer and his party. The smitten preacher (he had suffered a touch of apoplexy) walked slowly, a fur tippet round his neck in summer, leaning on his staff, and {{on the shoulder of}} his secretary, Bannatyne. He returned, at St. Andrews, in his sermons, to the Book of Daniel with which, nearly {{a quarter of a century}} ago, he began his pulpit career. In preaching he was moderate--for half-an-hour; and then, warming to his work, he made young Melville shudder and tremble, till he could not hold his pen to write. No doubt the prophet was denouncing [...] "that last Beast," [...] the Pope, and his allies in Scotland, as he had done these many years ago. Ere he had finished his sermon [...] "he was like to ding the pulpit to blads and fly out of it." [...] He attended a play, written by Davidson, later a famous preacher, on the siege and fall of the Castle, exhibiting the hanging of his old ally, Kirkcaldy, [...] "according to Mr. Knox's doctrine," [...] says Melville. This cheerful entertainment was presented at the marriage of John Colville, destined to be a traitor, a <b>double</b> <b>spy,</b> and a renegade from the Kirk to [...] "the Synagogue of Satan."

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the use of}} Social Networks for Surveillance and Security {{in relation to the}} deployment of intelligence resources in the UK. The chapter documents the rise of Military Intelligence agencies during both World Wars (such as GCHQ and MI 5), and the subsequent use of these institutions to maintain order during peacetime. In addition {{to the way in which}} military organisations have used clandestine techniques such as <b>double</b> agents, <b>spies,</b> and various programmes designed for conducting Signals Intelligence, the Chapter offers an in-sight into how contemporary modes of communication (via mobile devices and the internet), shape the way in which intelligence agencies now gather information. The chapter also considers how the UK’s intelligence community responds to National Security issues such as international terror attacks, and how additional threats such as political subversion are framed in National Security dis-course as being the legitimising factors behind mass surveillance. Thereafter, the chapter examines how online techniques are used by Britain’s intelligence agencies to maintain National Security, and how counter-intelligence strategies are being turned against the population to encourage political compliance. The chapter examines how online espionage techniques for entrapment, coercion, and misdirection, are being used to make something happen in the real or digital world...|$|R
6000|$|To speak precisely, {{those were}} seven lugubrious hours; since Flora {{would not be}} due before eight o'clock, if, indeed, I might count on her eluding her <b>double</b> cordon of <b>spies.</b> The {{question}} was, whither to turn in the meantime? Certainly not back to the town. In the near neighbourhood I knew of no roof but [...] "The Hunters' Tryst," [...] by Alexander Hendry. Suppose that I found it (and the chances in that fog were perhaps against me), would Alexander Hendry; aroused from his bed, be likely to extend his hospitality to a traveller with no more luggage than a Paisley shawl? He might think I had stolen it. I had borne it down the staircase under {{the eyes of the}} runners, and the pattern was bitten upon my brain. It was doubtless unique in the district and familiar: an oriflamme of battle over the barter of dairy produce and malt liquors. Alexander Hendry must recognise it, and with an instinct of antagonism. Patently it formed no part of my proper wardrobe: hardly could it be explained as a gage d'amour. Eccentric hunters trysted under Hendry's roof; the Six-Foot Club, for instance. But a hunter in a frilled shirt and waistcoat sprigged with forget-me-nots! And the house would be watched, perhaps. Every house around would be watched.|$|R
50|$|The 18th voyage for Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, stormy-petrel protagonists of O'Brian's utterly {{addictive}} {{series on}} {{life in the}} service of His Britannic Majesty's navy during the Napoleonic Wars (The Commodore, 1995, etc.). Having returned from a distasteful mission in West African waters, where he commanded a squadron with orders to suppress the slave trade, Aubrey is fending off a welter of lawsuits filed by aggrieved ship-owners whose vessels he seized. Abandoned by his superiors, the aging ex-captain fears he may be passed over for promotion or, worse yet, yellowed (elevated and then retired on half pay). Obliged to play country squire, the cash-strapped Aubrey (a Tory MP) makes new enemies when (as lord of the manor) he opposes enclosure of a common abutting his Dorset estate. Finally sent back to sea with his steadfast shipmate Maturin, the polymath physician who <b>doubles</b> as a <b>spy</b> for the Admiralty, the embattled mariner encounters even tougher going. Assigned to wearisome blockade duty off of Brest, he captures a French privateer laden with treasure but is charged with leaving his assigned station. Aubrey is further dispirited by a letter from his usually complaisant wife who accuses him of adultery with a Canadian lass whose billets doux he has unwisely left about the house. Meantime, the Corsican usurper suffers a crushing defeat at Leipzig, and in anticipation of peace the Royal Navy launches the Georgian era's equivalent of a downsizing campaign. Back in England after a successful intelligence-gathering sojourn on the Continent, Maturin arranges for his old friend to assume a training command in rebellious Chile's fledgling navy. As the two sail off for South America, however, word reaches them that Napoleon has escaped from Elba and Aubrey is to head a task force patrolling the Straits of Gibraltar. Another excellent adventure, complete with period-piece arcana, for oceanic literature's oddest and arguably most appealing couple.|$|R
50|$|In episode 3, game on. The {{first task}} was ‘date in the dark’, where they set in pairs in the dark. At last, the 8 men failed {{to impress the}} ladies since they had showed their {{weaknesses}} in the dark. In episode 4, due to the unattractive men, 3 ladies quit the show (Carol, Mona and Evelyn). In order to regain the ladies’ interests, the 8 men underwent training to be the ‘Alpha Man’. For instance, training themselves to be more humorous. At last, Thomas won in this episode. Thomas was {{given a chance to}} have dinner with the team coach. In episode 5, after the trainings, the 8 men entered a ball with the ladies. Through the ball, they had to show the results of training to impress the ladies, to make their confessions successful. At last, Chris was revealed to be a <b>double</b> agent who <b>spied</b> on men’s attitudes from the very beginning, and he would leave the show with Winter, who failed in this challenge with no successful reply from his confessions. Episode 6 focused on the training of Rocky and Cyrus. Rocky underwent cosmetic treatment on his pimples in order to look more attractive. While Cyrus sought advice from experts so that he could avoid being ‘friend-zoned’. Episode 7 focused on Thomas, Justin and Guy. Thomas tried to boost his confidence in speaking with girls through speed dating. Justin was given a day to spend time with a typical ‘Kong girl’, while Guy sought consultation to change his attitude. In episode 8 and 9, the six pairs needed to go dating in a budget of $200 {{to find out if the}} men were creative and caring enough. Vincent took Alice to a nature park in mainland. Thomas and Jasmine went on painting. Rocky took Sharon to work for hawker stores to earn food. Guy simply took Whitey for a dinner while Justin and Vivien dined beside the river. Lastly Cyrus invited Sharon to film a video with him. In episode 10, after having a talent show and a cooking class with the ladies, 4 men remained. Thomas and Vincent couldn’t impress the ladies and they were eliminated. In episode 11-15, the remaining contestants embarked on a journey to Lombok in Indonesia and engaged in different tasks, to win opportunities to spend time with their targets. During the trip, Vivian and Sharon stood out from the girls due to their mean personality. As a result, none of the men wanted them. Moreover, Carol returned to the show and became a contestant in episode 11 again. After all the tasks and difficulties, the confessions of the 4 men wrapped up the show. Justin chose Carol but failed, Rocky and Guy chose Whitney. However Whitey chose Rocky. Surprisingly, Cyrus chose Queenie, one of the judges and instructors of the show.|$|R
