5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
5|$|Beecher {{enjoyed the}} company of women, and rumors of extramarital affairs {{circulated}} as early as his Indiana days, when he was believed to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> affair with a young member of his congregation. In 1858, the Brooklyn Eagle wrote a story accusing him of an affair with another young church member who had later become a prostitute. The wife of Beecher's patron and editor, Henry Bowen, confessed on her deathbed to her husband of an affair with Beecher; Bowen concealed the incident during his lifetime.|$|E

He was knighted in 1920. The middle brother, Julian Francis (b. 1869) studied at Selwyn College, Cambridge, but {{does not appear to}} <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> active public career. Their one sister, Helen, married a German economist, Dr. Moritz Julius Bonn, in 1903.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages, clocks {{primarily}} served religious purposes; {{the first}} employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In Dublin, the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood {{on top of}} the Tholsel (the city court and council chamber). It was {{the first of its kind}} to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> hour hand. The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks. A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its face is decorated with the images of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate {{introductions}} <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> observable {{effect on}} Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been {{adversely affected by}} introduced species. Currently, the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania (Tarebia granifera), an introduced species. Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee. This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other introductions include 18 species of ant, {{one of the most}} abundant taxa in leaf litter habitats.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{some social}} scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one less {{dramatic}} than its Hungarian counterpart but one which may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> even more {{profound impact on}} the Eastern Bloc. Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iv√°n T. Berend claims that while {{the effects of the}} Polish October on the Eastern Bloc may be disputed, it set the course for the eventual fall of communism in the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Polish October, {{also known}} as October 1956, Polish thaw, or Gomu≈Çka's thaw, marked {{a change in the}} {{politics}} of Poland {{in the second half of}} 1956. Some social scientists term it the Polish October Revolution, which, while less dramatic than the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> even deeper impact on the Eastern Bloc and on the Soviet Union's relationship to its satellite states in Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|The German {{aircraft}} carrier I was a planned {{conversion of the}} transport ship Europa during World War II. The loss of the battleship Bismarck and near torpedoing of her sistership Tirpitz in May 1941 and March 1942, respectively, spurred the Kriegsmarine to acquire {{aircraft carrier}}s. Europa {{was one of several}} vessels selected for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers. As designed, the ship would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> air complement of 24 Bf 109T fighters and 18 Ju 87C Stuka dive-bombers.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{supplies}} and reinforcements carried on Th√©tis to reach the Caribbean may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> effect {{on the outcome of}} the subsequent invasion of Martinique in January 1809. Except for one reinforcement frigate, Amphitrite, none of the subsequent French efforts to transport supplies or soldiers to Martinique were successful, and a large British expeditionary force was able to overwhelm the island's poorly-supplied defenders in a brief campaign. The tightening blockade also affected other French colonies, preventing the despatch of food and military supplies and contributing to the captures of both √éle de France and Guadeloupe in 1810.|$|E

However, looking at the flows between specific labour market states revealed that the Act <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> statistically significant impact on the probability of moving out from employment but not on the probability of moving into employment. The analysis also showed that the Act <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> statistically significant impact on the probability of moving from unemployment to inactivity. In addition, it appeared that the Act <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> negative impact on the probability of job-to-job mobility.|$|R
