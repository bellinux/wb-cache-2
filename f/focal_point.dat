One key task in this research is to determine <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> in the speech sig-nal by analyzing its acoustic-prosodic features. This task requires processing and analysis of an immense amount of data. In order to make the task efficient and less time consuming, algorithms for speech processing are developed to perform automatic feature extraction, parametric rep-resentation, and detection of <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> that are usually painstakingly marked by hand. In this paper a method for detecting the <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> in speech prosody is presented and the results are compared with <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> hand-marked by experts.
