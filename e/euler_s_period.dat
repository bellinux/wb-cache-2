Euler attributes the Theorem to Goldbach. The proof {{is one of those}} examples of misuse of divergent series to obtain correct results so frequent during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We examine this proof closely and, with the help of some insight provided by a modern (and completely dierent) proof of the Goldbach-Euler Theorem, we present a rational reconstruction in terms which could be considered rigorous by modern Weierstrassian standards. At the same time, with a few ideas borrowed from nonstandard analysis we see how the same reconstruction can be also be considered rigorous by modern Robinsonian standards. This last approach, though, is completely in tune with Goldbach and <b>Euler</b> <b>s</b> proof. We hope to convince the reader then how, a few simple ideas from nonstandard analysis, vindicate Euler's work...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of coordination between DNA repl, cation and cell division was studied in Tetrahymena pyriformis GL-C by {{manipulation of the}} timing of these events with heat shocks and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Preliminary experiments showed that the inhibitor combination methotrexate and uridine (M + U) was an effective inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Inhibition of the progression of DNA synthesis with M + U in exponentially growing cells, in which one <b>S</b> <b>period</b> usually occurs between two successive divisions, or in heat-shocked cells, when successive <b>S</b> <b>periods</b> are known to occur between divisions, resulted in the complete suppression of the following division. In further experiments in which the division activities were reassociated with the DNA synthetic cycle by premature termination of the heat-shock treatment, it was shown that (a) the completion of one <b>S</b> <b>period</b> during the treatment was sufficient for cell division, (b) the beginning of division events suppressed the initiation of further <b>S</b> <b>periods,</b> and (c) if further <b>S</b> <b>periods</b> were initiated while the heat-shock treatment was continued, division preparations could not begin until the necessary portion of the <b>S</b> <b>period</b> was completed, even though DNA had previously been duplicated.

Two years of ambient noise data are used from March 2003 through February 2005 observed at 203 broadband seismic {{stations in the}} US, southern Canada, and northern Mexico. Cross-correlations are computed between all station-pairs to produce empirical Green functions. At most azimuths across the US, coherent Rayleigh wave signals exist in the empirical Green functions implying that ambient noise in the frequency band of this study (5 – 100 <b>s</b> <b>period)</b> is sufficiently isotropically distributed in azimuth to yield largely unbiased dispersion measurements. Rayleigh and Love wave group and phase velocity curves are measured together with associated uncertainties determined from the temporal variability of the measurements. A sufficient number of measurements (> 2000) is obtained between 8 and 25 <b>s</b> <b>period</b> for Love waves and 8 and 70 <b>s</b> <b>period</b> for Rayleigh waves to produce tomographic dispersion maps. Both phase and group velocity maps are presented in these period bands. Resolution {{is estimated to be}} better than 100 km across much of the US from 8 – 40 <b>s</b> <b>period</b> for Rayleigh waves and 8 – 20 <b>s</b> <b>period</b> for Love waves, which is unprecedented in a study at this spatial scale.

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{schedule of}} DNA replication in heat-synchronized Tetrahymena was studied by autoradiographic and cytofluorometric methods. It was shown that some cells, which were synchronized by selection of individual dividing cells or by temporary thymidine starvation, incorporated [3 H]thymidine into macronuclei in a periodic fashion during the heat-shock treatment. It {{was concluded that}} supernumerary <b>S</b> <b>periods</b> occurred while cell division was blocked by high temperature. The proportion of cells which initiated supernumerary <b>S</b> <b>periods</b> {{was found to be}} dependent on the duration of the heat-shock treatment and on the cell cycle stage when the first heat shock was applied. Cytofluorometric measurements of Feulgen-stained macronuclei during the heat-shock treatment indicated that the DNA complement of these cells was substantially increased and probably duplicated during the course of each <b>S</b> <b>period.</b> Estimates of DNA content also suggested that the rate of DNA synthesis progressively declined during long heat-shock treatments. These results indicate that the mechanism which brings about heat-induced division synchrony is not an interruption of the process of DNA replication. Further experiments were concerned with the regulation of DNA synthesis during the first synchronized division cycle. It was shown that participation in DNA synthesis at this time increased as more cells were able to conclude the terminal <b>S</b> <b>period</b> during the preceding heat-shock treatment.

We apply the method to data from Iceland's ICEMELT and HOTSPOT arrays. Checkerboard tests show that the joint inversion improves phase velocity model recovery over methods that use the data sets independently, particularly at 18 ?<b>s</b> <b>period.</b> The addition of ambient noise data also extends resolution to shallower depths and shorter periods in comparison to previous teleseismic results beneath Iceland. We show there are {{significant differences in the}} phase velocity maps from the joint approach in comparison to other approaches, for instance, using only teleseismic data, only ambient noise data, or the mean of the two. The difference in phase velocities in turn affects the resulting shear velocity models. The advantage of the joint inversion is that it produces a single phase velocity map that satisfies both data sets simultaneously. Our phase velocity maps show a transition from low velocities centered beneath the main volcanic centers in Iceland at 18 – 25 ?<b>s</b> <b>period,</b> primarily crustal depths, to a low-velocity region that traces the rift zones from the Reykjanes Ridge in the south to the Kolbeinsey Ridge in the north at 29 – 50 ?<b>s</b> <b>period,</b> greater depths.

These observations are compared with those of full waveform synthetic seismograms for the same events, calculated in a 3 -D Earth and also compared with those of seismograms obtained by ambient noise correlation. The arrival angle anomalies for individual events are complex, and have significant variations with period. On average, the mean absolute deviation decreases from ∼ 9 ° at 20 <b>s</b> <b>period</b> to ∼ 3 ° at 100 <b>s</b> <b>period.</b> The synthetic seismograms show the same evolution, albeit with somewhat smaller deviations.

This observation is confirmed by the comparison with seismic noise correlation records, that is where the surface waves correspond to those emitted by a point source at the surface, as the two types of observations are remarkably similar in the cases where earthquakes are located close to seismic stations.

The model is then evaluated up against a hydro power simulation tool called LVTrans, a program coded in LabVIEW based on the method of characteristics. The scilab model shows good performance for simulations around its operating point. Simulation in island mode shows a frequency deviation between the models during a 10 % load drop of 0. 25 Hz, or 0. 5...|$|R

Since the length of this period (with a range of 6 /~ to 8 hours) appears to be independent of the species of the cell, the chromosome number, the c...|$|R
40|$|Ocean {{activity}} produces {{continuous and}} ubiquitous seismic energy {{mostly in the}} 2 ¿ 20 <b>s</b> <b>period</b> band, known as microseismic noise. Between 2 and 10 <b>s</b> <b>period,</b> secondary microseisms (SM) are generated by swell reflections close to the shores and/or by opposing swells in the deep ocean. However, unique conditions are required in order for surface waves generated by deep-ocean microseisms to be observed on land. By comparing short-duration power spectral densities at both Atlantic shoreline and inland seismic stations, we show that ocean tides strongly modulate the seismic energy in a wide period band except between 2. 5 and 5 s. This tidal proxy reveals {{the existence of an}} ex situ short-period contribution of the SM peak. Comparison with swell spectra at surrounding buoys suggests that the largest part of this extra energy comes from deep ocean-generated microseisms. The energy modulation might be also used in numerical models of microseismic generation to constrain coastal reflection coefficients. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
