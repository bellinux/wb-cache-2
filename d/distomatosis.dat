25|$|Fasciolosis (also {{known as}} fascioliasis, fasciolasis, <b>distomatosis</b> and liver rot) is a {{parasitic}} worm infection {{caused by the}} common liver fluke Fasciola hepatica {{as well as by}} Fasciola gigantica. The disease is a plant-borne trematode zoonosis, and is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD). It affects humans, but its main host is ruminants such as cattle and sheep. The disease progresses through four distinct phases; an initial incubation phase of between a few days up to three months with little or no symptoms; an invasive or acute phase which may manifest with: fever, malaise, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, urticaria, anemia, jaundice, and respiratory symptoms. The disease later progresses to a latent phase with less symptoms and ultimately into a chronic or obstructive phase months to years later. In the chronic state the disease causes inflammation of the bile ducts, gall bladder and may cause gall stones as well as fibrosis. While chronic inflammation is connected to increased cancer rates, it is unclear whether fasciolosis is associated with increased cancer risk.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{mathematical}} model has been formulated to assess the losses due to a disease in goats in India. The losses due to important diseases in goats have been computed for a 15 -year period (1991 - 2005) based on published reports. The rank analysis has revealed that number of incidence was maximum for PPR, followed by FMD and sheep and goat pox. These three diseases have accounted for 54 per cent of the total incidences. The maximum deaths on per year average basis for the period 1991 - 2005 {{have been due to}} PPR, followed by sheep and goat pox, enterotoxaemia and CCP. These four diseases have accounted for about 74 per cent of deaths. The overall order with respect to the number of incidences has been found as: PPR > FMD > sheep and goat pox > CCP > fascioliasis / <b>distomatosis</b> > enterotoxaemia > anthrax. The corresponding ranking order with respect to number of deaths was: PPR > sheep and goat pox > enterotoxaemia > CCP > anthrax > fascioliasis / <b>distomatosis</b> > FMD. The total annual average loss due to all diseases in goats has been found of Rs 264. 8 lakh. The PPR disease has accounted for the maximum (34. 5 %) loss, followed by FMD (14. 3 %), sheep and goat pox (14. 1 %), CCP (6. 4 %), enterotoxaemia (6. 1 %), facioliasis / <b>distomatosis</b> (5. 0 %) and anthrax (2. 0 %). Thus, PPR, foot and mouth disease and sheep and goat pox diseases harm goat population on a largescale. Therefore, necessary preventive measures are required to control these diseases of goats.

40|$|Liver flukes-induced {{pathological}} {{changes in}} liver parenchyma and biliary passages are so severe that, in some cases, may cause total physiologic dysfunction. The human disease is endemic to {{some parts of}} the country, and there were two vast epidemics of the human fascioliasis in Gilan province, northern most part of the country. According to WHO reports, the human disease is prevalent in Gilan, Mazandaran, and Isfahan. However, the aim {{of the present study was}} to collect more information about the naturally- infected animal hosts, and to extend the Knowledge to prognosticate the pathologic effects occurring in human cases of liver flukes in endemic parts of the human disease. The present study was carried out in slauther houses of Gilan and Khuzestan province, two most endemic areas of human and animal <b>Distomatosis,</b> respectively, from spring 2002 to summer 2003. A total of 30 infected livers were collected, and were examined both for visible gross and microscopic changes. The results of the present study showed that the pathologic changes varied from mild effects to total biliary bstruction. Most of the present knowledge on pathology of the human disease is based on studies in animal models. To have precise and comprehensive information about the tissue changes in naturally â€“infected animal may help to describe some unanswered concepts about the pathology of the human <b>distomatosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{review of}} the {{immunological}} diagnosis of parasitic diseases defines the various indications, the means of collection and preparation, the various levels of specificity and the choice of parasitic antigen which {{should be used for}} immuno-diagnosis. The detection and assay of circulating antibodies relies on the techniques of immuno-precipitation (immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, electrosyneresis), indirect agglutination (latex and haemagglutination) or the use of labelled compounds (immunofluorescence, enzymo-immunoassay, radio-immunoassay). Their respective advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The detection and assay of circulating antigens involve the use of agglutination techniques (mycoses), radio-immunoassay or enzymo-immunoassay (protozooses and helminthiases). The authors review the applications of immunological diagnosis for the helminthiases (Trichinosis, Toxocarosis, Filariasis, Anguillosis, Ascaridiasis, Echinococcosis, Taeniasis and Cysticercosis, <b>Distomatosis</b> and Schistosomiasis), the protozoan infections (malaria, Toxoplasmosis, Amebiasis, Trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis) and the mycoses (Aspergillosis, Candidiasis, Cryptococcosis). They also discuss the prospects for the development of immunological diagnosis by identification, purification and standardization of parasitic antigens and the study of circulating antigens and idiotypic anti-parasitic antibodies. Finally, they outline the respective responsibilities of the biologist and the prescribing doctor for the proper use of immunological diagnosis of parasitic diseases.

40|$|Introducci&oacute;n. La paragonimosis, o <b>distomatosis</b> pulmonar, es una enfermedad con sintomatolog&iacute;a similar a la observada en la tuberculosis. Es causada por par&aacute;sitos del g&eacute;nero Paragonimus (Digenea: Troglotrematidae). Las personas se infectan al consumir cangrejos crudos o mal cocidos, con metacercarias del par&aacute;sito. El primer foco de paragonimosis humana en Colombia se registr&oacute; durante 1995 en Urrao, Antioquia, donde se hallaron dos especies de cangrejos que hospedaban el par&aacute;sito. En el 2005 se capturaron cangrejos con metacercarias de Paragonimus en Medell&iacute;n, lo que motiv&oacute; la b&uacute;squeda del par&aacute;sito en otras localidades, mediante su presencia en estos crust&aacute;ceos. Objetivo. Establecer la distribuci&oacute;n de Paragonimus en Antioquia, evaluando la presencia de metacercarias en macrocrust&aacute;ceos braquiuros, dulciacu&iacute;colas. Materiales y m&eacute;todos. Desde 2005 hasta 2007 se capturaron cangrejos en 13 municipios antioque&ntilde;os. Se relajaron y sacrificaron para la b&uacute;squeda del digeneo y la identificaci&oacute;n taxon&oacute;mica. Resultados. En nueve municipios se capturaron 52 cangrejos, 42 (80, 76 %) con metacercarias de Paragonimus. Todos los crust&aacute;ceos se determinaron como Pseudothelphusidae, de los g&eacute;neros Hypolobocera y Strengeriana, y se asignaron a cuatro especies. Tres se registran por primera vez como hu&eacute;spedes del par&aacute;sito. Conclusi&oacute;n. Se inicia la construcci&oacute;n de un mapa con la distribuci&oacute;n de Paragonimus en Antioquia que incluye por primera vez zonas urbanizadas. Se ratifican el consumo y la manipulaci&oacute;n de los cangrejos crudos y mal cocidos como factores de riesgo para la infecci&oacute;n humana. Se propone a los cangrejos como agentes focalizadores de paragonimosis por ser asequibles y de f&aacute;cil diagn&oacute;stico. Introduction. Paragonimosis or lung fluke disease {{courses with}} signs {{similar to those}} seen in tuberculosis. The causative agent is a {{parasite}} of the genus Paragonimus (Digenea: Troglotrematidae). People become infected by ingesting raw or partially cooked crabs containing metacercariae. The first focus of human paragonimosis in Colombia was recorded in the county of Urrao, where two species of crabs infected with Paragonimus were found. In 2005, crabs with Paragonimus&rsquo; metacercariae were captured near Medell&iacute;n, western Colombia. This prompted {{a search for the}} parasite in other locations through its presence in the crabs. Objective. To establish the distribution of Paragonimus in Antioquia, we evaluated the presence of metacercaria in freshwater brachyuran crabs. Materials and methods. From 2005 to 2007, crabs were captured in 13 counties of Antioquia. The crabs were relaxed and dissected to determine presence of trematodes and then to make the taxonomic identifications. Results. From 52 crabs captured in 9 counties, 42 (80. 8 %) were found with Paragonimus metacercariae. The crabs were identified as Pseudothelphusidae in 2 genera&mdash;Hypolobocera and Strengeriana&mdash; and were assigned to four species. Three of the species were recorded {{for the first time as}} hosts of Paragonimus. Conclusions. A Paragonimus&rsquo; distribution map was constructed for Antioquia; for the first time urban zones were included. Because of the high rate of infection, the handling and consumption of raw and poorly cooked crabs pose risk factors for human infection. Because crabs are affordable and provide means of easy diagnosis, crabs are targeted as primary agents of and diagnostic tools for paragonmosis. ...|$|E
