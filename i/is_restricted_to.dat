5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of live (rose Bengal-stained) and dead infaunal foraminifera have been document-ed in short cores taken at four locations representing {{a narrow range}} of salinity settings in the mangrove swamps of the Setiu wetland, Terengganu, peninsular Malaysia. Cores were taken at mud-rich sites, two in the mid-swamp and two in the high swamp, from mainland-fringing mangrove swamps charac-terized by generally sandy substrates. Twenty-four taxa were recorded as live. Of these, two <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the mid-swamp, eight <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the high swamp, seven <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> shallow-infaunal depths (0 – 16 cm), and three <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> deep-infaunal depths (. 16 cm). Thirteen taxa occurred both shallow and deep infaunally and 13 occurred at both high- and mid-swamp sites. Only six taxa...|$|R
