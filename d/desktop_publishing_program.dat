25|$|Later <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs</b> were {{specifically}} designed with elaborate pre-formatted layouts for publication, offering only limited options {{for changing the}} layout, while allowing users to import text that was written using a text editor or word processor, or type the text in themselves.|$|R
50|$|A {{style sheet}} is a feature in <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs</b> that store and apply {{formatting}} to text. Style sheets are {{a form of}} separation of presentation and content: it creates a separate abstraction to keep the presentation isolated from the text data.|$|R

50|$|Word {{processing}} and <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs</b> for personal computers such as—Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, QuarkXPress, Adobe InDesign, Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop—use differing methods of adjusting letter-spacing. What {{is common to}} most systems is that the default letter-spacing is zero, using the character widths and kerning information built into the font itself.|$|R
50|$|Paste up {{refers to}} a method of {{creating}} or laying out publication pages that predates {{the use of the}} now-standard computerized page design <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs.</b> Completed, or camera-ready, pages are known as mechanicals or mechanical art. In the offset lithography process, the mechanicals would be photographed with a stat camera to create a same-size film negative for each printing plate required.|$|R
50|$|Bessen {{developed}} the first WYSIWYG <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program</b> {{at a community}} newspaper in Philadelphia in 1983. He established and ran a company, Bestinfo, to sell that program commercially. In 1993, Bestinfo was sold to Intergraph.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to end user terminology, {{the notion of}} reflow is sometimes used to discuss <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program</b> features for print publication page layout such as automatically balancing the amount of text {{in a number of}} columns.|$|E
50|$|MacPublisher was {{the first}} <b>Desktop</b> <b>Publishing</b> <b>program</b> for the Apple Macintosh, {{introduced}} in 1984, {{the same year that}} Apple introduced the Macintosh. DTP competitors Ready,Set,Go! and Aldus PageMaker were introduced in 1985 when Apple delivered the 512K Macintosh.|$|E
50|$|PageMaker {{was one of}} {{the first}} <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs,</b> {{introduced}} in 1985 by Aldus, initially for the Apple Macintosh and, in 1987, for PCs running Windows 1.0. As an application relying on a graphical user interface, PageMaker helped to popularize the Macintosh platform and the Windows environment. PageMaker relies on Adobe Systems' PostScript page description language. In 1994, Adobe Systems acquired Aldus and PageMaker.|$|R
50|$|In computing, caret {{navigation}} {{is a kind}} of keyboard navigation where a caret (also {{known as}} a ‘text cursor’, ‘text insertion cursor’, or ‘text selection cursor’) is used to navigate within a text document. It is a fundamental feature for applications that deal with text, for example text editors (e.g., Notepad, Emacs and Vim), word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word, WordPerfect and WordStar), <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs</b> (e.g., PageMaker, Microsoft Publisher), and spreadsheets (e.g., Excel, Lotus 123).|$|R
50|$|Comic Life is a comic <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> {{computer}} <b>program</b> {{developed by}} plasq for Mac OS X, Windows, and iOS. The app {{is designed to}} create comic pages using digital photos.|$|R
5000|$|Fleet Street Publisher was a <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program</b> {{produced}} by Mirrorsoft in the United Kingdom. It was produced for the Atari ST, and first released in November 1986. A PC version was {{produced by}} Rowan Software but never released.|$|E
50|$|After the {{purchase}} of the <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program</b> Ventura, Corel enhanced the WordPerfect styles editor and styles behavior with the majority of Ventura's capabilities. This improved the usability and performance of graphic elements like text boxes, document styles, footer and header styles.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of the ordinary lorem ipsum text {{has been used in}} typesetting since the 1960s or earlier, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. It was introduced to the Information Age in the mid-1980s by Aldus Corporation, which employed it in graphics and word-processing templates for its <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program</b> PageMaker.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 2000, the British market arrested {{its long}} decline. However, {{there is no}} sign of any great growth in {{circulation}} for the few remaining titles, and no sign of any new launches from mainstream publishers into the comics arena. An ever-increasing number of small press and fanzine titles are being produced, such as Solar Wind or FutureQuake, aided by the cheapness and increasingly professional appearance of <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs.</b> It is from this scene that the UKs new talents now tend to emerge (e.g. Al Ewing, Henry Flint or Simon Spurrier).|$|R
5000|$|Graphic {{designers}} and typesetters using desktop systems {{also have the}} option, though rarely used, to adjust word and letter spacing, or [...] "tracking", on a manual line-by-line basis to achieve more even overall spacing. Some modern <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs,</b> such as Adobe InDesign, evaluate the effects of all the different possible line-break choices on the entire paragraph, to choose the one that creates the least variance from the ideal spacing while justifying the lines (so as to reduce rivers); this also gives the least uneven edge when set with a ragged margin.|$|R
50|$|Byline was {{an early}} <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program</b> {{developed}} by the company SkiSoft and distributed and marketed by Ashton-Tate. When it was introduced sometime around 1987, it was both fairly inexpensive and easy to use, and gained a small but devoted following. Users designed a page by filling out an onscreen form that described page characteristics: margins, columns, font and size, and so on. The program created the page and an onscreen preview. This method of working was {{in contrast to the}} more directly interactive WYSIWYG approach taken by Aldus PageMaker and Ventura Publisher, which became more popular as windowing systems and GUIs became more common. Also, as time went on more and more so-called desktop publishing features were added to popular word processing software, probably reducing the market for such a low-end <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program.</b> Oddly, Byline was written in the Forth programming language.|$|E
50|$|The OPEN LOOK {{version of}} the FrameMaker <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program,</b> {{developed}} by Frame Technology Corp with funding mainly from Sun Microsystems and NSA, {{was one of the}} few commercial products that ran on NeWS. HyperLook, developed by Arthur van Hoff at The Turing Institute, was an interactive application design system. Don Hopkins developed a NeWS version of SimCity that was built with HyperLook.|$|E
50|$|Lee Lorenzen left {{soon after}} the release of GEM/1, {{when it became clear that}} DRI had no strong {{interest}} in applications development. He then joined with two other former DRI employees, Don Heiskell and John Meyer, to start Ventura Software. They developed Ventura Publisher (which was later marketed by Xerox and eventually by Corel), which would go on to be a very popular <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program</b> for some time.|$|E
25|$|While {{many homes}} have word {{processors}} on their computers, word processing {{in the home}} tends to be educational, planning or business related, dealing with school assignments or work being completed at home. Occasionally word processors are used for recreational purposes, e.g. writing short stories, poems or personal correspondence. Some use word processors to create résumés and greeting cards, {{but many of these}} home publishing processes have been taken over by web apps or <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs</b> specifically oriented toward home uses. The rise of email and social networks has also reduced the home role of the word processor as uses that formerly required printed output can now be done entirely online.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, some fanzines - {{especially}} sercon (serious and constructive) zines {{devoted to}} sf and fantasy criticism, and newszines such as Locus - became more professional journals, produced by <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs</b> and offset printing. These new magazines were labeled [...] "semiprozines", and were eventually sold rather than traded, and paid their contributors. Some semiprozines publish original fiction. The Hugo Awards recognized semiprozines {{as a separate}} category from fanzines in 1984 after Locus won the award for best fanzine several years running. (See Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine). Well-known semiprozines include Locus, Ansible, The New York Review of Science Fiction, and Interzone.|$|R
25|$|This policy {{began to}} {{backfire}} {{in the last}} years of the decade as new <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs</b> appeared on PC clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market, and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history that saw declining sales, and led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price. Gassée's objections were overruled, and he was forced from the company in 1990. Later that year, Apple introduced three lower cost models, the Macintosh Classic, Macintosh LC and Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand.|$|R
50|$|In the past, most yearbooks {{were laid}} out by hand, with {{photographs}} physically cropped and placed on layout boards. The work was tedious, and required multiple deadlines and contact with a yearbook publisher. Today, virtually all yearbooks are published using computers, which allows for shorter deadlines and easier editing. Students typically design pages using a <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program,</b> usually Adobe InDesign. Some schools use a proprietary web-based design program belonging to the company that prints the book.|$|E
50|$|The {{first product}} to be {{released}} was called PageStara simple low cost display advertisement layout program for Windows 2.0which was the forerunner to PagePlus. The first release of PagePlus was launched in 1990 {{and was the first}} sub £100 <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program</b> for Windows 3.0. Three years later, in spring 1993, PagePlus 2 was released and provided full colour printing support. Since then, {{a new version of the}} product has been released more or less annually.|$|E
5000|$|SCORE runs {{under the}} DOS {{operating}} system. Music is entered using an ASCII input code. Optionally a MIDI keyboard {{can be used}} to enter pitches. Less common is entering music from a so-called menu staff using a one-click copy-and-paste method. Music notation can be saved in SCORE's proprietary format. These files in most cases have the extensions [...] ".mus" [...] or [...] ".pag" [...] (note that Finale also uses the extension [...] ".mus" [...] while the file format is different). SCORE outputs PostScript graphics that can either be sent to a PostScript printer directly or can be saved as an Encapsulated PostScript file. For creating publications some users import the EPS-graphics into a <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
50|$|Serif PagePlus is a <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> (page layout) <b>program</b> {{developed}} by Serif.

40|$|Having edited {{scientific}} {{papers and}} theses for over 20 years, I {{have seen the}} development from relatively simple typewritten manuscripts with photographic line drawings, to modern publications containing digital images and with sophisticated layouts akin to those achieved by professional publishers. As the authors of papers and theses became more aware of layout and more adventurous {{in their use of}} <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>programs,</b> I noticed that not only was I making grammatical and linguistic corrections, but also comments and suggestions regarding the style of headings, the layout of paragraphs and tables, and the use of symbols and signs. The aim of this publication is not to provide a complete guide to literary style; others have done this far more competently. The factual content and methods of scientific writing are also outside the scope of this guide. My intention is to give examples of the kind of things I frequently correc...|$|R
