5|$|In November 1940 Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop and Adolf Hitler. In January 1941, the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden visited Turkey in {{an attempt}} to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allies' side. Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a series of conversations with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo-Turkish {{invasion}} of the Crimea. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.|$|E
5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E

25|$|Nachmanides' {{position}} here is untenable if {{he maintains}} that the Three Oaths are Halachically binding. Accordingly, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> Nachmanides implicitly rejects the Three Oaths as Halachically binding, and that to treat it as such would be to effectively nullify a biblical commandment.|$|E
25|$|Even for humans, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> skin-to-skin contact has {{a better}} {{scientific}} rationale than the incubator. All other supportive technology can be provided as part of care to extremely low birth weight babies during skin-to-skin contact, and appears to produce a better effect.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> then <b>that</b> {{there are}} at least two {{extensions}} to the church, one ~ 1818, and a later more significant one ~ 1845. However, the lack of clarity in the documents available and those referenced by the authors is a puzzle.|$|R

25|$|The {{church was}} later rebuilt in the {{perpendicular}} gothic style, and although ostensibly Norman, {{some of the}} architectural furniture, for example the font, were of the Anglo-Saxon style (or at latest, early Norman), thus <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the church was rebuilt upon {{the site of the}} earlier building.|$|E
25|$|There are two orthographic {{systems in}} use for Pahawh Hmong, the second reduced stage from 1965 {{and the third}} reduced stage from 1970 (see history, below). Some Hmong {{communities}} consider second stage to be more authentic, while others prefer third stage as more regular. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> stage two is more widespread.|$|E
25|$|Between 1792 and 1805, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> Fraser {{spent most}} of his time working in the company's Athabasca Department.

25|$|In {{the above}} {{conceptual}} examples <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> {{a large number}} of extra digits would need to be provided by the adder to ensure correct rounding; however, for binary addition or subtraction using careful implementation techniques only two extra guard bits and one extra sticky bit need to be carried beyond the precision of the operands.|$|E
25|$|NET (0.5 to 3mg/day) {{has been}} found to dose-dependently {{decrease}} circulating SHBG levels, which is a common property of androgens and is due to AR-mediated suppression of hepatic SHBG production. The drug also has estrogenic activity, and estrogens are known to increase SHBG hepatic production and circulating levels, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the androgenic activity of NET overpowers its estrogenic activity in this regard.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1857 the Ellan Vannin's regular sailings were {{augmented}} by summer cruises from Douglas via Castletown {{and on to the}} Calf of Mann. Also further pleasure cruises were added via Peel and onwards to the north of Ireland. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the vessel was being utilised to her maximum. Sailings to Whitehaven and Liverpool were maintained whilst sailings to Glasgow and from Liverpool to Dundrum via the Isle of Man were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} of {{a number}} of sites, later identified as Canaanite, show that prosperity of the region reached its apogee during this Middle Bronze Age period, under leadership of the city of Hazor, at least nominally tributary to Egypt for much of the period. In the north, the cities of Yamkhad and Qatna were hegemons of important confederacies, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> biblical Hazor was the chief city of another important coalition in the south.|$|E

25|$|The {{constraints}} {{in their}} primitive form are rather singular, {{this was the}} reason for integrating them over test functions to obtain smeared constraints. However, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the equation for the master constraint, given above, is even more singular involving the product of two primitive constraints (although integrated over space). Squaring the constraint is dangerous as it could lead to worsened ultraviolent behaviour of the corresponding operator and hence the master constraint programme must be approached with due care.|$|E
25|$|The Kingship of Archenland is {{not broken}} {{by either the}} White Witch or the Telmarines, so the line from King Frank I and Queen Helen remains unbroken, and Archenland still exists {{at the end of}} the world. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the witch's powers of {{repression}} and climate control; even use of her wand, did not extend beyond the bounds of Narnia itself. Hence the royal line and more general presence of humans in a nearby location did not directly threaten the witch.|$|E
25|$|Historian Lawrence E. Babits has {{demonstrated}} that Morgan's official report of 73 casualties appears to have only included his Continental troops.

He also presents an entry in the North Carolina State Records that shows 68 Continental and 80 Militia casualties. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> both the number of Morgan's casualties and the total strength of his force were about double what he officially reported.|$|E
