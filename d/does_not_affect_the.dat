The flowers had pistils that protruded beyond their anthers, a similar phenotype to CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1-silenced plants which lack a jasmonate receptor. Measurement of jasmonate levels in the flowers revealed that they were lower than in normal plants. The authors suggested that HypSys peptides in N. attenuata have diversified from their function as defence related peptides to being involved in controlling flower morphology. The signalling processes remain similar however, being mediated through jasmonates.|$|E

5|$|The species' genetic {{diversity}} {{is similar to}} that of other pocket gophers occupying a larger geographic range and diversity of habitat.

Study of the effects of genetic change over time revealed a pattern affected by a cataclysmic event across the species' entire geographic area about 13,000 years ago. Such an event would cause a population bottleneck, leading to scattered, isolated populations.|$|E
5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E
5|$|According to Lucas and Sobus, {{the type}} species P. bugtiense {{from the late}} Oligocene of Pakistan {{includes}} junior synonyms such as B. osborni and P. zhajremensis. P. transouralicum, formerly Indricotherium, from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and northern China includes B. grangeri and I. minus. P. orgosensis, formerly Dzungariotherium, from the middle and late Oligocene of northwest China includes D. turfanensis and P. lipidus. P. orgosensis may be distinct enough to warrant its original genus name, but its exact position requires evaluation. P. prohorovi from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan may be too incomplete for its position to be resolved {{in relation to the}} other species; the same applies to proposed species such as I. intermedium and P. tienshanensis, as well as genera like Benaratherium and Caucasotherium. Though the genus name Indricotherium is now a junior synonym of Paraceratherium, the subfamily name Indricotheriinae is still in use because genus name synonymy <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> names of higher level taxa that are derived from these. Members of the subfamily are therefore still commonly referred to as indricotheres.|$|E

5|$|The colour of the L.volemus {{mushroom}} {{varies from}} apricot to tawny, and the cap may {{be up to}} 11cm (in) wide. The pale golden yellow gills {{on the underside of}} the cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the large amount of latex ("milk") that it exudes when the gills are damaged, leading to the common names weeping milk cap and voluminous-latex milky. It also has a distinctive fishy smell, which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> taste. The fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several sterols related to ergosterol, some of which are unique to this species. The mushroom also contains a natural rubber that has been chemically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Lactifluus volemus represents several species or subspecies, rather than a single taxon.|$|E
5|$|The flaw in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> volume that it occupies). Avogadro's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made {{a clear distinction between}} molecules and atoms.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the NHC {{expanded}} the windspeed range for Category 4 by 1mph in both directions, to 130–156mph, with corresponding {{changes in the}} other units (113–136 kn, 209–251km/h), instead of 131–155mph (114–135 kn, 210–249km/h). The NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments, and then convert to mph and km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So an intensity of 115 knots is rated Category 4, but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3mph) would round down to 130mph, making it {{appear to be a}} Category 3 storm. Likewise, an intensity of 135 knots (~155mph, and thus Category 4) is 250.02km/h, which according to the definition used before the change would be Category 5. To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135mph, and 135 kn as 245km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250km/h, and still qualify as Category 4. Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in Category 4 in each unit of measure, the change <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> classification of storms from previous years. The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.|$|E
