5|$|In {{boiler room}} No.4, at around 01:20, water began {{flooding}} in from below, possibly {{indicating that the}} bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators {{in order to keep the}} ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that Titanics electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived. Neither <b>did</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the Titanics five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. They were caught by the rising water somewhere on D deck.|$|E

25|$|One of the Europeans, a Mr Tross, {{encouraged}} the young Baloo to bowl {{to him in}} the nets. His skill at slow left-arm bowling was enough to encourage other members to bat against him for practice, in particular the fine batsman Captain J.G.Greig. In time, he was bowling to them regularly, his bowling important practice for the club members. Despite bowling for hundreds of hours, Baloo later lamented that not once <b>did</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the club members offer to allow him to bat—a role then considered the preserve of the aristocratic classes.(Guha 2002:90). An undocumented story states that he was paid 8 annas by JG Greig every time he dismissed him. Baloo thus perfected his bowling, spending hours in the nets bowling to the Europeans.|$|E

25|$|Archduke Franz Ferdinand became heir {{presumptive}} (Thronfolger) {{to the throne}} of Austria-Hungary in 1896, after the deaths of his cousin Rudolf (in 1889) and his father Karl Ludwig. The relationship between him and Franz Joseph {{had always been a}} fairly contentious one, which was further exacerbated when Franz Ferdinand announced his desire to marry Countess Sophie Chotek, a match that {{was out of the question}} in the mind of the emperor, as Sophie was merely of nobility as opposed to being of dynastic rank. Although the emperor was receiving letters from members of the imperial family throughout the fall and winter of 1899 importuning him to relent, Franz Joseph stood his ground. He finally gave his consent in 1900; however, the marriage was to be morganatic and any children of the marriage would be ineligible to succeed to the throne. The couple were married on 1 July 1900 at Reichstadt. The emperor did not attend the wedding, nor <b>did</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the archdukes. After that, the two men disliked and distrusted each other.|$|E

2500|$|After Muhammad's {{death in}} 632 CE, his Medinan companions debated {{which of them}} should succeed him in running {{the affairs of the}} Muslims while Muhammad's {{household}} was busy with his burial. Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah pledged their loyalty to Abu Bakr, with the Ansar and the Quraysh soon following suit. Abu Bakr thus became the first Khalīfaṫu Rasūli l-Lāh ( [...] , [...] "Successor of the Messenger of God"), or Caliph, and embarked on campaigns to propagate Islam. First he would have to subdue the Arabian tribes which had claimed that although they pledged allegiance to Muhammad and accepted Islam, they owed nothing to Abu Bakr. As a caliph, Abu Bakr was not a monarch and never claimed such a title; nor <b>did</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his three successors. Rather, their election and leadership were based upon merit.|$|E
2500|$|A strong, {{noxious odour}} {{coming from the}} rear of the plane was first {{reported}} to the cabin crew around 19:00. Flight attendant Judi Davidson, 33, traced the odour to the lavatory. She attempted to look into the lavatory but was forced back by thick grey smoke rapidly filling the small room; she then ordered the third ranking crew member to find Sergio Benetti, 37, the chief cabin crew officer, and ask him to investigate. As Benetti sprayed the interior of the affected lavatory with a CO2 extinguisher, Davidson reported the fire to the captain while 28-year-old flight attendant Laura Kayama began urging the passengers on the sparsely-populated flight to come away from the front and rear of the plane and sit close together near the over-wing exits. At no time <b>did</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the cabin crew mention to either Cameron or Ouimet that they had not yet seen flames. [...] Benetti, the one person who had managed to get a good look at the scene, had not reported seeing anything resembling the traditional causes of airline fires in pre-smoking-ban days: flames from a trash bin fire or the paper towel dispenser, both of which were commonly set ablaze by passengers smoking in the lavatories on long flights. First officer Ouimet went to investigate personally at 19:03, but was driven back by the thick smoke. At 19:04, Benetti reported that he thought the fire was probably out because he had completely doused the lavatory with fire retardant.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{than six}} years after his spoof {{obituary}} for English cricket was published, Brooks himself had died in London at the early age of 33. Like his father before him, he was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. He had been suffering from tuberculosis and rheumatism, which had latterly prevented him from working. Obituaries said that his byline on the Sporting Times of Peter Blobbs was known all over the world, {{and in spite of}} his having led a Bohemian lifestyle, [...] "Few men could get through more work in less time, and its quality was invariably good." [...] An obituary in the society magazine Vanity Fair (reprinted in the Sheffield Evening Telegraph) wrote that he had inherited [...] "much of the literary ability of his father" [...] and was [...] "endowed with a keen and very original sense of humour that was entirely his own". Simon Briggs summed him up less charitably as [...] "a stereotypical boozy hack who chased actresses, gambled recklessly and drank himself to an early grave". According to a colleague on the Sporting Times: [...] "Shirley had a sweet and gentle disposition that caused him to be beloved by everybody, nor <b>did</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the petty ironies of life disturb him in the least." [...] Ten years after his death, his former room when visiting the country residence that belonged to John Corlett, the paper's proprietor and editor, was still preserved as he had left it, with his photographs, pictures and sketches adorning the walls.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{himself was}} honest and incorruptible, {{but he was}} almost alone in {{possessing}} these qualities, and the venal and corrupt Egyptian bureaucrats usually ignored his orders when they conflicted with {{the chance to make}} money. The Europeans whom the Egyptians had hired to work as civil servants in the Sudan were no better and proved to be just as corrupt as the Egyptians. The bribes that the slave traders offered for bureaucrats to {{turn a blind eye to}} the slave trade had far more effect on the bureaucrats than <b>did</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> Gordon's orders to suppress the slave trade, which were simply ignored. Licurgo Santoni, an Italian hired by the Egyptian state to run the Sudanese post office wrote about Gordon's time as Governor-General that: as his exertions were not supported by his subordinates his efforts remained fruitless. This man's activity with the scientific knowledge which he possesses is doubtless able to achieve much, but unfortunately no one backs him up and his orders are badly carried out or altered in such a way as to render them without effect. All the Europeans, with some rare exceptions, whom he has honoured with his confidence have cheated him. Reflecting these realities, Gordon had to undertake much of the administrative work himself, travelling ceaselessly and constantly all over the Sudan via camel in attempts to make the bureaucracy actually obey his orders. Something that occurred when he was present, but stopped as soon as he left. Gordon's reforming zeal made him popular with the ordinary people of the Sudan. As one observer noted that whenever he left and entered the Governor's Palace in Khartoum: [...] "Government officials, consular agents and native people awaited him in large numbers. They celebrated H.E's [...] arrival with an indescribable uproar".|$|E
2500|$|In 1851, Truth joined George Thompson, an {{abolitionist}} and speaker, on {{a lecture}} tour through central and western New York State. In May, she attended the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, where she delivered her famous extemporaneous speech on women's rights, later known as [...] "Ain't I a Woman." [...] Her speech demanded equal human rights {{for all women}} as well as for all blacks. Advocating for women and African Americans was dangerous and challenging enough, but being one and doing so was far more difficult. The pressures and severity of her speech did not get to Truth, however. Truth took to the stage with a demanding and composed presence. Audience members were baffled by the way she carried herself and were hesitant to believe [...] that she was even a woman, prompting the name of her speech"Ain't I a Woman?" [...] The convention was organized by Hannah Tracy and Frances Dana Barker Gage, who both were present when Truth spoke. Different versions of Truth's words have been recorded, with the first one published a month later in the Anti-Slavery Bugle by Rev. Marius Robinson, the newspaper owner and editor who was in the audience. Robinson's recounting of the speech included no instance of the question [...] "Ain't I a Woman?" [...] Nor <b>did</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the other newspapers reporting of her speech at the time. Twelve years later, in May 1863, Gage published another, very different, version. In it, Truth's speech pattern had characteristics of Southern slaves, and the speech was vastly different then the one Robinson had reported. Gage's version of the speech became the historic standard version, and is known as [...] "Ain't I a Woman?" [...] because that question was repeated four times. It is highly unlikely that Truth's own speech pattern was Southern in nature, as she {{was born and raised in}} New York, and she spoke only upper New York State low-Dutch until she was nine years old.|$|E
