5|$|In {{order to}} further enhance the appeal of its new {{flagship}} product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed {{to tap into the}} commercial market. The firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. in preparation for the services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its <b>Fax</b> <b>Broadcast</b> service. The <b>Fax</b> <b>Broadcast</b> service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.|$|E

50|$|Junk faxes are {{a form of}} {{telemarketing}} where unsolicited advertisements {{are sent}} via fax transmission. Junk faxes are the faxed equivalent of spam or junk mail. Proponents of this advertising medium often use the terms <b>broadcast</b> <b>fax</b> or fax advertising to avoid the negative connotation of the term junk fax.|$|R
50|$|<b>Broadcast</b> <b>faxing,</b> {{in which}} faxes {{are sent to}} {{multiple}} recipients, is now less common than in the past. This {{is partly due to}} laws in the United States and elsewhere which regulate its use for consumer marketing. In 2005, President Bush signed into law S.714, the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 (JFPA), which allows marketers to send commercial faxes to those with whom they have an established business relationship (EBR), but imposes some new requirements. These requirements include providing an opt-out notice on the first page of faxes and establishing a system to accept opt-outs at any time of the day. Roughly 2% of direct marketers use fax, mostly for business-to-business marketing campaigns.|$|R
40|$|ReportThe goal of {{this project}} is to {{identify}} the key aspects of a timely, responsive, pest management information service {{as a means of}} improving pest management and reducing pesticide use through the promotion of non-chemical and biological strategies. The Cornell Turfgrass Hotline involves a weekly conference call during the growing season, among meteorologists, turfgrass specialists on campus, extension (field staff) educators, and national experts (including USGA Agronomists). During the call, the weather is reviewed with forecast provided, then a “roll call” of updates from field staff is delivered, with questions being addressed across regions. Specialists discuss timely topics based on prevailing environmental conditions and finally a national expert discusses a particular topic more in-depth (such as root diseases or Annual Bluegrass Weevil). Following the call, the notes are transcribed, edited and written in bullet-format, amenable for use as a decision-making tool that is delivered via eMail or <b>broadcast</b> <b>FAX</b> to every county office in New York State and selected industry leaders...|$|R
