5000|$|Because it {{involves}} a moving balanced surface, a stabilator can allow the pilot to generate a given pitching moment with a lower control force. Due to the high forces involved in tail balancing loads, stabilators are designed to pivot about their aerodynamic center (near the tail's mean quarter-chord). This is {{the point at which}} the pitching moment is constant regardless of the angle of attack, and thus any movement of the stabilator can be made without added pilot effort. However, to be certified by the appropriate regulatory agency [...] an airplane must show an increasing resistance to an increasing pilot <b>input</b> (<b>movement).</b> To provide this resistance, stabilators on small aircraft contain an anti-servo tab (usually acting also as a trim tab) that deflects in the same direction as the stabilator, thus providing an aerodynamic force resisting the pilot's input. General aviation aircraft with stabilators include the Piper Cherokee and the Cessna 177.|$|E

It is a $14 billion fund that is hoped to be allocated over 50 years in around 77 restoration projects {{with the aim of}} creating a sustainable ecosystem of coastal Louisiana. While the plan focuses on all of Louisiana, restoration of the Barataria Basin was the first priority and Grand Isle is at the mouth of Barataria Bay. On February 18, 2000, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources signed an agreement to initiate a restoration plan to this basin. The loss of wetland in Barataria Bay is estimated at about 11 square miles per year from 1978-1990 (Fuller et al. 1995). Most strategies in the Barataria Basin region depend on the overall <b>input,</b> <b>movement,</b> and circulation of water, sediment, and nutrients in the basin. Other strategies can be implemented independently of these considerations. These include barrier shoreline restoration, marsh creation in the southwestern basin, and a delta-building diversion from the lower Mississippi. The completion of Coast 2050 was to restore and protect 450,000 acres of wetland. Congress had not approved the Coast 2050 plan, and when Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita hit, Congress was studying a less costly, scaled down proposal which could be initiated in the span of a decade.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There is some {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} on whether large plant gains are a problem or not when it comes to input-output controllability. In this paper, the effect of input errors is studied and controllability requirements are derived. The input disturbances can be attenuated by the use of high gain feedback at frequencies where the gain is large, but this may not be possible. The nonlinear effect of limited input resolution causes limit cycle behavior similar to that found with relay feedback. The magnitude of these limit cycles depends on the high-frequency process gain, but is independent of the controller tuning and it can be reduced by pulse modulating the input signal, but this may cause excessive <b>input</b> <b>movement.</b> Thus, large gains at frequencies corresponding to the closed-loop bandwidth may cause control problems, but large steady-state gains are not by themselves a problem...|$|E

The developed model {{takes advantage of the}} availability of basic hydraulic components which can be parameterized based on real ones, including most of the hydraulic losses. With the aim of optimizing the extraction of wave energy, this PTO is able to modify its restraining torque through the independent activation of the hydraulic cylinders located in the primary transmission and modifying some geometrical parameters related to their fixation points respecting to the axis torque. The ultimate objective of this PTO is to provide a wide range of torques that can be modulated by modifying the operating high pressure of the HP accumulator, the combination of the available areas of the double-acting hydraulic cylinder and the location of their fixation points with respect to the applied movement. This factor can help to improve the control of WEC based on activated bodies with the aim to optimize the extraction of wave energy.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} visual fixation, the oculomotor muscles are controlled by reflexes arising from the complex interaction between the vestibular apparatus, the perception of slippage of the target image on the retina and, significantly, by the proprioceptive mechanisms of the cervical spine; the cervico-ocular reflex (COR). Chronic neck dysfunction, particularly in whiplash patients, {{has been associated with}} modifications in eye movement behaviour. The nature of this association is poorly defined, although previous studies on individuals with post-whiplash syndrome have noted such things as delayed high speed eye movements following immobilisation in a cervical spine collar; altered capabilities of pursuit when following a target; increased gain (amplitude of movement with reference to <b>input</b> <b>movement)</b> of the COR and alterations in the ability to accurately fixate on target positions. Much of the previous literature has reported qualitative changes in passing, sometimes hampered by the limits of technology employed in the experimentation, and often by repeated measures on a few individuals; accordingly, the precise nature of the COR in the presence of cervical dysfunction requires further description.

40|$|Post-desktop user interfaces, such as smartphones, tablets, {{interactive}} tabletops, public {{displays and}} mid-air interfaces, already are a ubiquitous {{part of everyday}} human life, or {{have the potential to}} be. One of the key features of these interfaces is the reduced number or even absence of <b>input</b> <b>movement</b> constraints imposed by a device form-factor. This freedom is advantageous for users, allowing them to interact with computers using more natural limb movements; however, it is a source of 4 issues for research and design of post-desktop interfaces which make traditional analysis methods inefficient: the new movement space is orders of magnitude larger than the one analyzed for traditional desktops; the existing knowledge on post-desktop input methods is sparse and sporadic; the movement space is non-uniform with respect to performance; and traditional methods are ineffective or inefficient in tackling physical ergonomics pitfalls in post-desktop interfaces. These issues lead to the research problem of efficient assessment, analysis and design methods for high-throughput ergonomic post-desktop interfaces. To solve this research problem and support researchers and designers, this thesis proposes efficient experiment- and model-based assessment methods for post-desktop user interfaces. We achieve this through the following contributions: - adopt optical motion capture and biomechanical simulation for HCI experiments as a versatile source of both performance and ergonomics data describing an input method; - identify applicability limits of the method for a range of HCI tasks; - validate the method outputs against ground truth recordings in typical HCI setting; - demonstrate the added value of the method in analysis of performance and ergonomics of touchscreen devices; and - summarize performance and ergonomics of a movement space through a clustering of physiological data. The proposed method successfully deals with the 4 above-mentioned issues of post-desktop input. The efficiency of the methods makes it possible to effectively tackle the issue of large post-desktop movement spaces both at early design stages (through a generic model of a movement space) as well as at later design stages (through user studies). The method provides rich data on physical ergonomics (joint angles and moments, muscle forces and activations, energy expenditure and fatigue), making it possible to solve the issue of ergonomics pitfalls. Additionally, the method provides performance data (speed, accuracy and throughput) which can be related to the physiological data to solve the issue of non-uniformity of movement space. In our adaptation the method does not require experimenters to have specialized expertise, thus making it accessible {{to a wide range of}} researchers and designers and contributing towards the solution of the issue of post-desktop knowledge sparsity...|$|E

Infants between 91 / 2 and 18 months participated in a search task in which they searched for a toy hidden in 1 of 2 containers. Prior to beginning search, either the infants or the containers were rotated 180 °; these rotations occurred in a lit or dark environment. These experiments were distinguished by the environmental cues for object location; Experiment 1 used a position cue, Experiment 2 a color cue, and Experiment 3 both position and color cues. Accuracy was better in Experiments 2 and 3 than in Experiment 1. All studies found that search was best after infant movement in the light; all other conditions led to equivalently worse performance.

40|$|Background: The {{nature of}} a woman’s orgasm {{has been a source}} of scientific, political, and {{cultural}} debate for over a century. Since the Victorian era, the pendulum has swung from the vagina to the clitoris, and to some extent back again, with the current debate stuck over whether internal sensory structures exist in the vagina that could account for orgasms based largely on their stimulation, or whether stimulation of the external glans clitoris is always necessary for orgasm. Method: We review the history of the clitoral versus vaginal orgasm debate as it has evolved with conflicting ideas and data from psychiatry and psychoanalysis, epidemiology, evolutionary theory, feminist political theory, physiology, and finally neuroscience. Results: A new synthesis is presented that acknowledges the enormous potential women have to experience orgasms from one or more sources of sensory input, including the external clitoral glans, internal region around the “G-spot” that corresponds to the internal clitoral bulbs, the cervix, as well as sensory stimulation of non-genital areas such as the nipples.

40|$|Understanding {{the causal}} {{relation}} between neural <b>inputs</b> and <b>movements</b> {{is very important}} for the success of brain machine interfaces (BMIs). In this study, we analyze 104 neurons’ firings using statistical, information theoretic, and fractal analysis. The latter include Fano factor analysis, multifractal adaptive fractal analysis (MF-AFA), and wavelet multifractal analysis. We find neuronal firings are highly nonstationary, and Fano factor analysis always indicates long-range correlations in neuronal firings, irrespective of whether those firings are correlated with movement trajectory or not, and thus does not reveal any actual correlations between neural <b>inputs</b> and <b>movements.</b> On the other hand, MF-AFA and wavelet multifractal analysis clearly indicate that when neuronal firings are not well correlated with movement trajectory, they do not have or only have weak temporal correlations. When neuronal firings are well correlated with movements, they are characterized by very strong temporal correlations, up to a time scale comparable to the average time between two successive reaching tasks. This suggests that neurons well correlated with hand trajectory experienced a re-setting effect at the start of each reaching task, in the sense that within the movement correlated neurons the spike trains’ long range dependences persisted about the length of time the monkey used to switch between task executions. A new task execution re-sets their activity, making them only weakly correlated with their prior activities on longer time scales.
