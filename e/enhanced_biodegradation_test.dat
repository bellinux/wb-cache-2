40|$|The {{effects of}} five {{consecutive}} applications, every 4 months, of Counter, Furadan, Mocap, Nemacur, Rugby, and Vydate on functional root percentage, production parameters, and on enhanced biodegradation were compared {{in a commercial}} banana plantation in Costa Rica. To quantify nematode numbers and estimate functional root percentage, root samples were taken monthly from the field experiment. The <b>enhanced</b> <b>biodegradation</b> <b>test</b> {{was carried out in}} the laboratory. Samples taken from the field after five consecutive applications of each nematicide were treated in the following way: (1) not sterilized and no nematicide applied; (2) not sterilized but nematicide applied; and (3) nematicide applied after sterilization. The number of Radopholus similis which had penetrated the maize plantlets was used as a parameter to determine the degradation of the applied nematicide. Degradation was measured 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after inoculation of pregerminated maize plantlets with 500 nematodes in soil under laboratory conditions. At harvest, 20 months after starting the field experiment, the lowest percentage of functional roots (P = 0. 024) and bunch weight (P = 0. 0001) were found in the non-treated control, followed by the Furadan treatment. On average, nematicides increased the bunch weight by 38 %. In general, higher bunch weights coincided with higher percentages of functional roots. Furadan showed a high level of enhanced biodegradation while for Counter and Rugby this phenomenon was not detected. In the case of Mocap and Nemacur, a relatively high level of enhanced biodegradation in the soil biotest coincided with a high number of nematodes per 100 g roots in the field experiment. A high correlation between mean nematode numbers per 100 g roots and mean percentage of functional roots was observed (R (2) = 0. 81, P = 0. 006) for all treatments together. Data show that a rotation of different nematicidal molecules is the best option for long-term nematode management in commercial banana plantations. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{limited number}} of {{pesticides}} are available for the control of soil pests in potato. This, together with the monoculture nature of potato cultivation, does not favour chemical rotation, increasing the risk of reduced biological efficacy due to microbial adaptation. The dissipation of three major organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, ethoprophos and fosthiazate) was studied in comparison with fipronil, an insecticide recently introduced in potato cultivation, in 17 soils from potato monoculture areas in Greece to explore the extent of <b>enhanced</b> <b>biodegradation</b> development. RESULTS: The dissipation time of the four pesticides varied in the different soils, with DT 50 values of 1. 7 - 30. 8 days, 2. 7 - 56 days, 7. 0 - 31. 0 days and 24. 5 - 116. 5 days for fosthiazate, chlorpyrifos, ethoprophos and fipronil, respectively. A rapid dissipation of ethoprophos and fosthiazate in two soils with previous exposure to these nematicides provided first evidence {{for the development of}} <b>enhanced</b> <b>biodegradation.</b> Sterilisation of the given soils inhibited the dissipation of fosthiazate. Additionally, fosthiazate dissipation in the soils increased upon repeated applications. CONCLUSION: The development of <b>enhanced</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of fosthiazate in soils from potato monoculture regions was verified. This is the first report of <b>enhanced</b> <b>biodegradation</b> for this chemical.

All three supports were compared by; scanning electron microscopy, cell loading capacity, absorption of oil, their abilities to <b>enhance</b> oil <b>biodegradation</b> and the effect of drying and storage on the immobilized cells. Biodegradation of hydrocarbons by immobilized cells was dependent on the biocarrier, with polyurethane immobilized cells failing to <b>enhance</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of Ekofisk crude oil. Drizit was the most effective biocarrier tested and the most suitable immobilization substratum for use as a bioremediation agent.

In parallel experiments, only small variations in the biodegradation pattern occurred. When comparing the new online CO 2 method with existing CO 2 evolution tests, growth rates and lag periods were similar and only the final degree of biodegradation of aniline was slightly lower. A further test development was the unification and parallel measurement of all three important summary parameters for biodegradation—i. e., CO 2 evolution, determination of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) —in a multicomponent <b>biodegradation</b> <b>test</b> system (MCBTS).

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of high strength and functional natural fiber reinforced composite materials which are fabricated using starch-based biodegradable resin and Manila hemp fiber. Hemp fiber reinforced cross-ply composites were prepared by a conventional hot-pressing method. Their mechanical characterization {{was carried out by}} evaluating tensile strength as a function of fiber content. It can be seen that the tensile strength of the cross-ply composites was saturated over 50 wt % due to the interaction between warp and weft during the hot-pressing. However in the case of flexible weft; such as cotton thread or resin fiber, the tensile strength of the cross-ply composites almost linearly increased with increasing fiber content. The biodegradation behavior of the hemp fiber reinforced unidirectional composites was also examined by burying them into compost media. The changes in surface morphology of the specimen and in specimen weight loss were monitored for 30 days. It is apparent that the natural fiber reinforced composites showed an <b>enhanced</b> <b>biodegradation</b> speed. This <b>enhanced</b> <b>biodegradation</b> behavior seems to be derived from increased apparent surface area of the composite specimen due to the preferential biodegradation at interface between hemp fiber and biodegradable resin as well as the preferential water transportation through internal cavity in hemp fiber...|$|R
