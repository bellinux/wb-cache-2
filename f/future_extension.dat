5|$|During 2005–06, a Bakerloo {{extension}} {{was proposed}} with three route options. The options were extensions to Hayes via Peckham Rye, Beckenham Junction via Camberwell, or Hayes via New Cross. In July 2011, Network Rail recommended {{an extension of}} the Bakerloo line from Elephant & Castle to Lewisham, where it would take over the line to Hayes. In September 2014, Transport for London ran a consultation on the Bakerloo extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction with options via Lewisham and Camberwell or Old Kent Road, taking over Network Rail's Hayes line. The cost of the extension is estimated at around £2–3 billion with construction expected to take place between the mid-2020s and early 2030s. A February 2017 consultation indicates that the line could extend to Lewisham via Old Kent Road with <b>future</b> <b>extension</b> options later on.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} {{extensively}} reconstructed {{in the early}} 2000s, undergoing a $50 million overhaul to connect the subway station to the new AirTrain JFK. The project was designed by STV Group and financed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. During {{the reconstruction of the}} station, the original subway platforms were demolished and temporary platforms were erected in the center trackways while the new platforms and mezzanine were built. During off-peak hours, trains utilized a single track. The AirTrain structure around the station was completed in 2001, and the AirTrain station opened on December 17, 2003, at which time the shuttle bus was discontinued. The transfer was popular, with 4 million people transferring between the subway and the AirTrain from 2003 to 2007. The AirTrain was designed with the same track height and track gauge as those of the subway, to facilitate a <b>future</b> <b>extension</b> of the subway over the AirTrain system.|$|E
5|$|Lynn is {{intended}} to be the terminus of a <b>future</b> <b>extension</b> of the MBTA Blue Line, which would bring the line 4.5 additional miles from Wonderland in Revere to Lynn. This extension has been proposed in various forms for over 80 years. The 1926 Report on Improved Transportation Facilities and 1945–47 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line, which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924, be extended to Lynn via the Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn right-of-way. Ever since the 1954 Revere extension was cut short to Wonderland, a further extension to Lynn has been planned. Following on the 1926 and 1945-47 studies, the 1966 Program for Mass Transportation recommended that the Blue Line be extended to Lynn, while the 1969 Recommended Highway and Transit Plan proposed that the extension run as far as Salem. An extension was not present in the 1972 Final Report of the Boston Transportation Planning Review, but the 1974 Transportation Plan revived the project with possible termini of Lynn, Salem, or even Route 128 in Peabody. The 1978 Program for Mass Transportation report and 1983 Transportation Plan both continued support for an extension to Lynn. Despite the continued recommendations, however, other projects like extensions of the Red and Orange lines were given funding instead of the Blue Line.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{completion}} of three-car station extensions in winter 2010, Metro Transit operates one-, two- and three-car trains on the Blue Line, depending {{on the time of}} day and ridership needs. Many stations on the line were initially built to be capable of serving only one- or two-car trains, as a cost-saving measure; all of the shorter platforms were designed and built with <b>future</b> <b>extension</b> in mind and currently all stations are capable of serving three-car trains. The Green Line was built with three-car platforms at all stations.|$|E

A <b>future</b> <b>extension</b> is projected down St. Claude Avenue past Press Street to Poland Avenue, next to the Industrial Canal.

The Willibaldplatz station is to have three platforms with third track {{set aside for the}} possible <b>future</b> <b>extension</b> into the western and southwestern area.

25|$|With {{the entire}} {{existing}} track in use since service to Wassaic was restored in 2000, {{there is little}} talk of expansion or branching. However, Metro-North will revisit a <b>future</b> <b>extension</b> northward if circumstances change. When plans were drawn up for extending the line northward from Dover Plains, the goal for Metro-North was to extend the line {{as far north as}} possible for a new yard, and to attract the most new passengers. Wassaic was the best site, and service was not extended to Millerton as the Harlem Valley Rail Trail was using the right-of-way. This is directly contrasts one of the main purposes of rail trails: to preserve the right-of-way to allow for rail service to be restored in the future. For now, Metro-North and the MTA have focused on improving existing facilities on the line, particularly stations such as Brewster where increasing usage has caused parking shortages.|$|E
