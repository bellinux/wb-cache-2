2500|$|As shown before, {{throttling}} keeps h constant. E.g. throttling from 200 bar and 300 K (point a in fig. 2) {{follows the}} <b>isenthalp</b> (line of constant specific enthalpy) of 430 kJ/kg. At 1 bar {{it results in}} point b which has a temperature of 270 K. So throttling from 200 bar to 1 bar gives a cooling from room temperature to below the freezing point of water. Throttling from 200 bar and an initial temperature of 133 K (point c in fig. 2) to 1 bar results in point d, {{which is in the}} two-phase region of nitrogen at a temperature of 77.2 K. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter the enthalpy in d (hd) is equal to the enthalpy in e (he) multiplied with the mass fraction of the liquid in d (xd) plus the enthalpy in f (hf) multiplied with the mass fraction of the gas in d (1 [...] xd).

40|$|Campi Flegrei (CF) {{is a large}} {{volcanic}} complex located west of {{the city}} of Naples, Italy. Repeated episodes of bradyseism (slow vertical ground movement) near the town of Pozzuoli have been documented since Roman times. Bradyseismic events are interpreted as the consequence of aqueous fluid exsolution during magma solidification on a slow timescale (10 (3) - 10 (4) yr) superimposed upon a shorter (1 - 10 yr) timescale for the episodic expulsion of fluid from a deep (similar to 3 - 5 km) lithostatically-pressured low-permeability reservoir to an overlying hydrostatic reservoir. Cycles of inflation and deflation occur during short duration transient events when connectivity is established between deep and shallow hydrothermal reservoirs. The total seismic energy released (4 x 10 (13) J) during the 1983 - 1984 bradyseismic crisis is consistent with the observed volume change (uplift) and consistent with the notion that seismic failure occurs in response to the shear stress release induced by volume change. Fluid transport and concomitant propagation of hydrofractures as fluid expands from lithostatic to hydrostatic pressure during decompression leads to ground surface displacement. Fluid decompression occurs along the fluid <b>isenthalp</b> (Joule-Thompson expansion) during transient periods of reservoir connectivity and leads to mineral precipitation. Each kilogram of fluid precipitates about 3 x 10 (- 3) kg of silica along a typical decompression path along the <b>isenthalp.</b> Mineral precipitation modifies the permeability and acts to reseal connection paths thereby isolating lithostatic and hydrostatic reservoirs ending one bradyseism phase and beginning another. Crystallization and exsolution of the magmatic fluid generates approximate to 7 x 10 (15) J of mechanical (P Delta V) energy, and this is sufficient to accomplish the observed uplift at CF. Although magma emplacement is the ultimate origin of bradyseism, fresh recharge of magma is not a prerequisite. Instead, short to intermediate timescale phenomena associated with fluid decompression and expansion in the crust with large variations in permeability, including permeability anisotropy, are the key elements at CF...|$|E

Practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form. There are many types of diagrams, such as h-T diagrams, which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures, and h-p diagrams, which give h as function of p for various T. One {{of the most common}} diagrams is the temperature-specific entropy diagram (T-s-diagram).

Point c is at 200 bar and room temperature (300 K). A Joule-Thomson expansion from 200 bar to 1 bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425 kJ/kg (not shown in the diagram) lying between the 400 and 450 kJ/kg <b>isenthalps</b> and ends in point d, which is at a temperature of about 270 K. Hence the expansion from 200 bar to 1 bar cools nitrogen from 300 K to 270 K.
