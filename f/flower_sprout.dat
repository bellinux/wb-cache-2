5000|$|Unlike other fantasy novels, dragons in {{this world}} are a plant-like species that {{propagate}} with spores. When environment is favorable for the dragon to grow, leaves and <b>flower</b> <b>sprout</b> from the spore, while its root develops into a Yonggeun (Dragon root). Then, the root grows into a Dragon. Like plants, {{the growth of a}} dragon reflects the environment that it is raised in; if it grows with horses, the dragon may become a flying horse. If it grows in the sea, dragon can develop webbed feet. If necessary, a dragon can become nearly humanoid. It was hunted to extinction by the naga, because dragon can get fire to the forest.|$|E
50|$|Flowers are borne from November through January; {{they come}} in groups of 20 or more stalks, each bearing two <b>flowers,</b> <b>sprouting</b> {{from the base of}} leaf stalks.|$|R
50|$|Leaves and <b>flowers</b> <b>sprout</b> {{from growing}} {{points on the}} top of the tuber. Growing points that have {{lengthened}} and become like woody stems are known as floral trunks.|$|R
50|$|The flower blooms {{early in}} spring, {{which leads to}} the common name Pasque flower, since Pasque refers to Easter (Passover). In South Dakota in the center of North America, the <b>flower</b> <b>sprouts</b> from late March through early June.|$|R
50|$|Senna acclinis {{is known}} to be a {{pollination}} plant for several insect species, including native bees and the jack-jumper ant Myrmecia nigrocincta, which has been recorded several times visiting the flowers of S. acclinis. <b>Flowers</b> <b>sprout</b> during springs and summer.|$|R
50|$|This species also {{lives at}} {{subordinate}} altitudes in agricultural regions and peripheral forests {{all the way}} to the northwest and northeast coasts. The Jacos primarily eat <b>flowers,</b> <b>sprouts,</b> seeds and fruits of the rainforest trees and plants, citrus and pastoral crops.|$|R
50|$|In {{the reserve}} grows some {{particular}} plants as the Summer Snowflake (Leucojum aestivum), the 'Four Leaf Clover' (Marsilea quadrifolia). The rarest {{one is the}} Utricularia vulgaris, a rootless aquatic carnivorous plant who capture small insects and in summer shows beautiful yellow <b>flowers</b> <b>sprouting</b> from water.|$|R
5000|$|... 5.0.5. (voiced by YouTuber Markiplier) is the organization's failed experiment. Intended {{to be an}} evil creature, he instead {{became very}} loving and enjoys hugging his friends. He is a big blue bear-creature with a single <b>flower</b> <b>sprouting</b> from his head that wilts and grows based on his emotions. He {{seems to be the}} organization's house keeper.|$|R
5000|$|Kalettes are {{a hybrid}} plant brand name for kale sprouts, {{derived from a}} cross between kale and Brussels sprouts. The plant is touted as being a highly nutritious {{vegetable}} that may be eaten as raw or cooked. [...] "Kalette" [...] is actually a brand name for the vegetable [...] "kale sprouts," [...] which was formerly known as <b>flower</b> <b>sprouts</b> in the U.K.|$|R
25|$|Potatoes contain toxic {{compounds}} {{known as}} glycoalkaloids, {{of which the}} most prevalent are solanine and chaconine. Solanine {{is also found in}} other plants in the family Solanaceae, which includes such plants as the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) and tobacco (Nicotiana), as well as eggplant and tomato. These compounds, which protect the plant from its predators, are, in general, concentrated in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the roots). In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in <b>flowers</b> and <b>sprouts</b> and lowest in the tuber flesh (in order from highest to lowest content, generally: <b>flowers,</b> <b>sprouts,</b> leaves, skin, roots, berries, peel , stems, and tuber flesh).|$|R
50|$|Bloodroot grows from 20 to 50 cm tall. It has {{one large}} basal leaf, up to 12 cm across, with five to nine lobes. The leaves and <b>flowers</b> <b>sprout</b> from a reddish rhizome with bright orange sap that grows at or {{slightly}} below the soil surface. The rhizomes grow longer each year, and branch to form colonies. Plants start to bloom before the foliage unfolds in early spring. After blooming the leaves expand to their full size and go summer dormant in {{mid to late}} summer.|$|R
25|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{narcissi}} are depicted {{in three different}} contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association, for instance those of François Lemoyne, John William Waterhouse, and that of Poussin depicting <b>flowers</b> <b>sprouting</b> around the dying Narcissus, or Salvador Dalí's Metamorphosis of Narcissus. The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his Narcissus, the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh's Undergrowth.|$|R
50|$|Cleistocactus hyalacanthus <b>flowers</b> <b>sprout</b> {{from the}} center of needle clusters. They first appear as small dark spots, which {{gradually}} enlarge over a week or ten days into long red flowers, each of which is only open, and only slightly, for one day. They are food for hummingbirds, which are attracted by the vivid red color. Those flowers that have been fertilized will develop a fruit which is 1 cm in diameter. The fruits eventually turn yellow when they are ripe. They are food for larger birds, which disperse the small black seeds in their droppings.|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} {{appears in}} the Historia Caroli Magni, sometimes known as the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle, a 12th-century Latin forged chronicle of legendary material about Charlemagne's alleged conquest of Spain. In this text, Agolant, briefly, reconquers Spain from Charlemagne. In the subsequent war, several miracles occur, including <b>flowers</b> <b>sprouting</b> from the lances of the knights. Another war has Agolant invading south-western France and sieging the city of Agen, but he is forced to retreat to Pamplona. In a last war, Charlemagne's great army sieges Pampeluna. After the death of Agolant, Charlemagne's troops pursue the Saracens through Spain.|$|R

5000|$|Kuksi’s {{influences}} {{include the}} Baroque and Rococo periods. He has described {{how he feels}} more in belonging to the ‘Old World’ and that his artwork {{is very much a}} reaction to “the corrupt and demoralized fall of modern-day society - a place where new beginnings, new wars, new philosophies, and new endings exist.” In an interview, Kuksi named Bernini, Bosch and Bruegel as some of the artists he admired and was influenced by saying, “Nothing beats landscapes of hell, twisted contorted figures, hedonism, and <b>flowers</b> <b>sprouting</b> from anuses.” ...|$|R

50|$|At {{the request}} of Saint James who appears to him in dream, Charlemagne embarks on four wars to wrest Spain from the Saracens. In the first war, he takes his army to Santiago de Compostela and conquers all of Spain. A second war is brought on to battle the African king Agolant who, briefly, reconquers the country. (During this war, several miracles occur, {{including}} <b>flowers</b> <b>sprouting</b> from the lances of the knights.) A third war has Agolant invading south-western France and besieging the city of Agen, but he is forced to retreat to Pamplona. In the fourth war, Charlemagne's great army besieges Pamplona. After the death of Agolant, Charlemagne's troops pursue the Saracens through Spain.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{herbaceous}} perennial plant {{often found}} at elevations of 2,100 to 3,700 m (6,900 to 12,100 ft). This beautiful plant can grow to 20-60 cm (8-24 in) tall, with <b>flowers</b> <b>sprouting</b> in inflorescences produced from the shoot apical meristem. The flowers are very variable in color, from pale blue (as in the species name coerulea) to white, pale yellow and pinkish; very commonly {{the flowers are}} bicolored, with the sepals a different shade to the petals. They consist of five petals, five sepals and an ovary surrounded by 50 to 130 stamens. Five long spurs hang below the calyx and contain nectar at their tips, accessible only to hawkmoths. In addition to hawkmoths, pollinators for this flower include bumble-bees, solitary bees and syphrid flies.|$|R
5000|$|Neokochia californica (syn. Bassia californica, Kochia californica) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the subfamily Camphorosmoideae of the amaranth family known by the common name rusty molly. It is native to the valleys and deserts of southeastern California and adjacent parts of Nevada, where it grows in dry, alkaline soils such as alkali flats and desert washes. This is a perennial herb or small shrub growing one or more sprawling, branching stems to a maximum height near 60 centimeters. The stems are lined with narrow, elongated, somewhat flattened fleshy leaves up to about a centimeter long. The leaves and stem are coated in grayish or brownish hairs. The inflorescence {{is made up of}} one or more tiny hairy <b>flowers</b> <b>sprouting</b> from the axils of the leaves.|$|R

50|$|These compounds, which {{protect the}} plant from its predators, are, in general, {{concentrated}} in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits. In {{a summary of}} several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in <b>flowers</b> and <b>sprouts</b> and lowest in the tuber flesh (in order from highest to lowest content, generally: <b>flowers,</b> <b>sprouts,</b> leaves, skin, roots, berries, peel plus outer cortex of tuber flesh, stems, and tuber flesh). Exposure to light, physical damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber. Cooking at high temperatures—over —partly destroys these. The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloids may cause headaches, diarrhea, cramps, and in severe cases coma and death; however, poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely. Light exposure causes greening from chlorophyll synthesis, thus giving a visual clue as to areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this {{does not provide a}} definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids. The Lenape variety was released in 1967 but was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids. Since then breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising cultivar.|$|R

There, they see that {{beautiful}} <b>flowers</b> have <b>sprouted</b> where Pradhan once scattered some of Ajay's ashes. Pradhan then tells Parvati that the real beauty of life is that we all are mortal, but life goes on.|$|R
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new <b>flowers</b> <b>sprouting</b> for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second part}} of Beethoven's song sets the extravagant death fantasy of the final stanza, in which <b>flowers</b> <b>sprout</b> from poet's grave to express his undying love. Strikingly, Beethoven sets this stanza in tones not of despair but of ecstasy; the tempo marking is allegro molto. In an essay on this song, Carla Ramsey offers an almost lurid account of the final section:"A {{culmination}} of the yearnings expressed in the earlier part of the song, the Allegro molto might {{be viewed as a}} kind of triumphal march in which the young lover exults in a death and a transfiguration whereby he is symbolically united with his beloved... The march crescendos and culminates on F above middle C with an impassioned outcry of the beloved's name. The final eleven measures, marked calando, musically portray an almost post-coital relaxation of the exhausted lover into his lover's arms with a dying, prayer-like exhalation: [...] "Adelaide." ...|$|R
50|$|Corsia exist largely underground; {{only the}} seldom-formed flower stems develop above ground. The fine, thread-like and hairless root system is weakly {{branched}} and whitish, spreading widely {{just beneath the}} surface. Several hairless, unbranched and upright <b>flowering</b> stems <b>sprout</b> from a rhizome and are visible above ground. They are usually reddish in color and are 10 to 28 cm high. The xylem is woody and not perforated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason why}} Aristolochia macrophylla is often {{referred}} to as [...] "Dutchman’s pipe" [...] is because of the 2 in yellowish-green flowers they produce. Each <b>flower</b> also <b>sprouts</b> from the calyx mouth to further produce 3 brownish-purple lobes. It is this complex of the flowers and lobes that gives the species a close resemblance to Dutch smoking pipes. The flowers may be hidden by the thick vegetation of the pipevine.|$|R
50|$|Spring rains {{wash away}} the {{radioactive}} particles {{from the surface}} and carry it further into the ground, cleaning plants and objects. Meanwhile, new plants and trees remove the artificial CO2 from the atmosphere as the new plants and <b>flowers</b> <b>sprout</b> in ruined cities and clean up greenhouses faster than in the human time. Without hunting seasons, animals breed undisturbed. Some species in areas with no natural predators, like the white tail deer, see population booms and expand their distribution to new areas, including former cities. Moss starts to grow over roads.Large carnivores are human shy, but without the lights or noise made by humans they would penetrate urban areas from the nearby hills or reserves and hunt the domesticated animals. Also the houses may make wonderful dens, which means that animals like the puma and the tiger would have population explosions. Depending on the area many common species, such as the White tailed deer would have population decreases due to loss of maintained food supply (e.g. lawns, golf courses, gardens) and increased predation.|$|R
5000|$|There are twenty {{songs in}} the cycle, around half in simple strophic form, and they move from cheerful {{optimism}} to despair and tragedy.At {{the beginning of the}} cycle, a young journeyman miller wanders happily through the countryside. He comes upon a brook, which he follows to a mill. He falls in love with the miller's beautiful daughter (the [...] "Müllerin" [...] of the title). She is out of his reach as he is only a journeyman. He tries to impress her, but her response seems tentative. The young man is soon supplanted in her affections by a hunter clad in green, the color of a ribbon he gave the girl. In his anguish, he experiences an obsession with the color green, then an extravagant death fantasy in which <b>flowers</b> <b>sprout</b> from his grave to express his undying love. (See Beethoven's Adelaide for a similar fantasy.) In the end, the young man despairs and presumably drowns himself in the brook. The last number is a lullaby sung by the brook.|$|R
