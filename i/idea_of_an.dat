5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, America {{produced}} diverse composers such as Anthony Heinrich, who composed in an idiosyncratic, intentionally American style {{and was the}} first American composer to write for a symphony orchestra. Many other composers, most famously William Henry Fry and George Frederick Bristow, supported the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American classical style, though their works were very European in orientation. It was John Knowles Paine, however, who became the first American composer to be accepted in Europe. Paine's example inspired the composers of the Second New England School, which included such figures as Amy Beach, Edward MacDowell, and Horatio Parker.|$|E
5|$|McNeile {{continued}} writing {{after he}} left the army in 1919, although he stopped writing war stories and began to publish thrillers. In 1920 he published Bulldog Drummond, whose eponymous hero became his best-known creation.

McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels, as well as three plays and a screenplay.|$|E

5|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American unified special {{operations}} command had {{its origins in}} the aftermath of Operation Eagle Claw, the disastrous attempted rescue of hostages at the American embassy in Iran in 1980. The ensuing investigation, chaired by Admiral James L. Holloway III, the retired Chief of Naval Operations, cited lack of command and control and inter-service coordination as significant factors in the failure of the mission. Since its activation on 16 April 1987, U.S. Special Operations Command has participated in many operations, from the 1989 invasion of Panama to the ongoing Global War on Terrorism.|$|E
5|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Anschluss (union between Austria and Germany {{to form a}} Greater Germany), {{was one of the}} {{principle}} ideas of the Austrian branch of the National Socialist (Nazi) Party. Nazism can be seen as descended from the radical branches of the pan-Germanist movement. In 1933, the Nazis and the Greater German People's Party formed a joint working-group, and eventually merged. During the period while the Nazi Party and its symbols were banned in Austria, from 1933 to 1938, Austrian Nazis resumed the earlier pan-Germanist tradition of wearing a blue cornflower in their buttonhole.|$|E

40|$|This thesis: "A Study <b>of</b> the <b>Idea</b> <b>of</b> Gentlewoman as Seen {{through the}} Main Character in Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders", is <b>an</b> {{analysis}} <b>of</b> the author's use <b>of</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman in his Moll Flanders. It {{is intended to}} show that Moll's life reveal the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman and {{to prove that the}} <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman that Moll wants to reach ironically reflects the different <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman, since a gentlewoman may mean either an aristocratic woman or a prostitute woman. In relevant to this, the thesis writer pictures how Moll tries hard to achieve her own concept <b>of</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman, that is having high class woman and having a luxurious life. She uses any ways such as persuading or tempting man, and stealing. Ironically, in her attitude and thinking, Moll does not portray the quality of the denotative meaning of the word gentlewoman that is an aristocratic woman. On the other hand, she portrays the quality of the connotative meaning of the word gentlewoman, that is prostitute, because instead of having the quality <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aristocratic woman, she becomes a prostitute. Through the three different meanings <b>of</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman, this thesis proves that although Moll achieves her concept <b>of</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman, that is becoming a high class woman and having a luxurious life, she still can be said that she does not achieve the denotative meaning of the word gentlewoman. On the other hand, she achieves the connotative meaning of the word gentlewo-man...|$|R

5|$|Abaqa died in 1282 and {{was briefly}} {{replaced}} {{by his brother}} Tekuder, who had converted to Islam. Tekuder reversed Abaqa's policy of seeking an alliance with the Franks, offering instead an alliance to the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun, who continued his own advance, capturing the Hospitaller fortress of Margat in 1285, Lattakia in 1287, and the County of Tripoli in 1289. However, Tekuder's pro-Muslim stance was not popular, and in 1284, Abaqa's Buddhist son Arghun, {{with the support of}} the Great Khan Kublai, led a revolt and had Tekuder executed. Arghun then revived the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alliance with the West, and sent multiple envoys to Europe.|$|E
5|$|After his recovery, d'Hautpoul {{was given}} {{command of the}} heavy cavalry of the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse under General Paul Grenier. After Neuwied, he was {{transferred}} to the Army of England under command of Lazare Hoche. When the French Directory abandoned the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion of England, he was again deployed on the German front, this time as part of the Army of the Danube. After the French loss at the Battle of Ostrach, his Cavalry reserve protected the French retreat from Pfullendorf. A few days later, after failing to lead a timely charge at the Battle of Stockach, he was suspended on orders of the Army commander, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, who blamed d'Hautpoul for the defeat. Acquitted by a court-martial in Strasbourg, d'Hautpoul resumed his duties at the end of July 1799, having missed the critical actions at the First Battle of Zurich.|$|E

5|$|As Isma'il al-Azhari {{began to}} assert his power, both Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani and Sayyid Abd al-Rahman became {{concerned}} that they would lose their political influence. From October 1955 Sayyid Ali began to seek ways to oust Isma'il al-Azhari from power. A key issue was whether a plebiscite should be held to determine if Sudan was to be independent of Egypt, which Sayyid Ali supported and Isma'il al-Azhari opposed. To strengthen his position in parliament, Isma'il al-Azhari started making overtures to associates of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman to explore the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> NUP-Umma coalition. Sudan formally became independent on 1 January 1956. On 2 February 1956 Isma'il al-Azhari announced a new cabinet that included representatives of all political parties and factions.|$|E
5|$|As prosperous as {{the region}} was, {{it was not}} unharmed by the {{constant}} Ottoman–Habsburg wars and was often the target of Turkish, Tatar and Hungarian rebel raids. By the 1630s, the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> organized anti-Ottoman revolt had reached the town of Chiprovtsi. In his 1650 account to the senate of the Republic of Venice Petar Parchevich described the long preparations for an armed struggle and the support-seeking visits of his fellow townsmen to the kings of Poland and Austria. Since then, the inhabitants of Chiprovtsi waited for the suitable moment when {{they would be able}} to instigate an effective uprising and continued to co-operate with the leaders of the European realms.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, {{such as the use of}} foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) to provoke a general revolt. Levski's <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it.
