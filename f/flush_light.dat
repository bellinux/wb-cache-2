Additional results are presented on the consequences for eutrophication, showing that changes in residence time may interact with species-specific nutrient uptake rates to cause shifts in species composition, potentially leading to effects such as harmful algal blooms.

One evening, during the late summer of this wettest season, when the rain was beginning to cease, I went out this way for my stroll, the pleasantest if not the only [...] "walk" [...] there is in Salisbury. It is true, there are two others: one to Wilton by its long, shady avenue; the other to Old Sarum; but these are now motor-roads, and until the loathed hooting and dusting engines are thrust away into roads of their own there is little pleasure in them for the man on foot. The rain ceased, but the sky was still stormy, with a great blackness beyond the cathedral and still other black clouds {{coming up from the}} west behind me. Then the sun, near its setting, broke out, sending a flame of orange colour through the dark masses around it, {{and at the same time}} flinging a magnificent rainbow on that black cloud against which the immense spire stood wet with rain and <b>flushed</b> with <b>light,</b> so that it looked like a spire built of a stone impregnated with silver.

How lucky, then, was Constable to have seen it, when he set himself to paint his famous picture! And how brave he was and even wise to have attempted such a subject, one which, I am informed by artists with the brush, only a madman would undertake, however great a genius he might be. It was impossible, we know, even to a Constable, but we admire his failure nevertheless, even as we admire Turner's many failures; but when we go back to Nature we are only too glad to forget all about the picture.|$|R

Cytoplasmic dynein 1 is a multiprotein complex made up of six different subunit families. The many different combinations of subunits that could be used to make up a cytoplasmic dynein 1 holocomplex provides the variety of different binding sites for cargoes that can be individually regulated. The following chapters <b>flush</b> out how <b>light</b> intermediate chain 1 (LIC 1), a subunit of cytoplasmic dynein 1, is involved with multiple dynein functions involving the binding of different cargoes to the cytoplasmic dynein 1 holocomplex, and how the binding of these cargoes can be regulated. First, LIC 1 is found to be involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint. LIC 1 appears to facilitate the removal of Mad 1 -Mad 2, a complex important in producing a wait anaphase signal, from kinetochores. Second, the involvement of LIC 1 in the spindle assembly checkpoint requires the phosphorylation of LIC 1 at a putative Cdk 1 phosphorylation site. This site is located in a domain of LIC 1 that binds various proteins suggesting that this phosphorylation could also regulate these interactions. Third, LIC 1 is involved in the centrosomal assembly of pericentrin, an important centrosomal protein.

Products such as milk chilling machines and solar home systems can {{have a significant impact}} on lives and livelihoods of people living in poverty in developing countries.  Hardware pioneersinventors and entrepreneurs creating breakthrough products tailored to the needs of these populationsare pushing the frontiers of technology and business to create and scale innovative hardware technologies. Numerous case studies within the report illustrate how these pioneers face many of the same challenges of any entrepreneur but with the added complexity of developing hardware and scaling in remote areas with scarce resources. There is a significant opportunity for actors across sectors to strategically leverage their resources in order to support the journeys of these hardware pioneers, from initial inspiration to ultimate impact at scale. Top Takeaways Hardware pioneers lack the right supports in the critical Pioneer Gap stages when they are blueprinting, validating, and preparing their models. In the early stages, these needs range from patient capital to prototyping facilities. Later on, issues such as distribution, financing, servicing, and quality standards become more important. Critically, because the success of hardware pioneers depends on the successful blending of both business and technology skills, those working closely with pioneer teams also need to bring the right combination of these skills, and this unfortunately is rare in the impact enterprise ecosystem. There is need to not just support hardware pioneers directly but also to assemble the other needed parts of the ecosystem, from last-mile specialist companies that help pioneers reach and serve their target markets to the programs and institutions that are helping to spark the initial impulse that gets pioneers started on their journey in the right way. New ideas can have an ultimate impact that is much greater than that of the original pioneer alone through a transfer of the idea to a more scale-ready partner or just through adoption and adaptation of the idea by follower entrepreneurs. We believe that there is great impact potential in supporting these more networked pathways for scaling...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} in different types of reactors were performed with TiO 2 supported cobalt catalyst {{to gain a better}} understanding of the phenomena related to Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) reaction. The performance of FTS was investigated during unsteady state and steady state. The experiments were conducted firstly to investigate the effect of external mass transfer on the performance of FTS, and the results suggested that it has effects only in short term but not long term. During the beginning period of the experiment conducted in the CSTR, two steady stages in terms of reaction rate and product selectivity could be observed and large changes were found in-between them. In order to reveal the precise reason(s) for causing these observed phenomena, flushing experiments were designed after the reactor system reached the secondary steady stage by means of changing the feed from synthesis gas to inert gas, argon. By comparing the results in the reactions before and after flushing, we can conclude that those observed large changes were mainly caused by the deposit of liquid phase products on the catalyst. The information of the materials in the stream out of reactor during flushing was also collected. The dynamic concentration of C 1 -C 8 in the flushed out gas suggested that reaction among the light products might take place under a moderate FT reaction condition. To present another way to look at the reaction behaviour of FTS, a number of experiments were conducted in a batch reactor with different reaction durations. An unusual behaviour of the product distribution when compared to the typical ASF model was observed. The pressure in the reactor during the reaction was monitored, and the comparison of the pressure readings of the reactor system at different reaction durations with the pressure derived from the mass balance suggested that a considerable proportion of the water produced was in the liquid phase under reaction conditions. The study of FTS under steady state was carried out in a tubular fixed bed reactor. The olefin to paraffin ratios for different carbon numbers and the relationship of C 2 and C 3 both in olefins and total amount under various reaction conditions were mainly investigated. A detailed explanation was presented to describe the behaviour of olefin to paraffin ratios with the change of the space velocity. The relationships of C 3 H 6 /C 2 H 4 and C 3 /C 2 were also summarised respectively. On the analysis of the experimental data both from CSTR and PFR, we found that the ratios of neighbouring light olefins kept constant although there were large alterations on the ratio of olefin to paraffin. Based on the implication from <b>flushing</b> experiments that <b>light</b> hydrocarbons may react with each other, an equilibrium was proposed for the olefin product distribution of FTS...|$|R

They shared all occupations; and it was by the merest shade that Ebbo excelled with the weapon, and Friedel with the book or tool. For the artist nature was in them, not intentionally excited by their mother, but far too strong to be easily discouraged. They had long daily gazed at Ulm in the distance, hoping to behold the spire completed; and the illustrations in their mother's books excited a strong desire to imitate them. The floor had often been covered with charcoal outlines even before Christina was persuaded to impart the rules she had learnt from her uncle; and her carving-tools were soon seized upon. At first they were used only upon knobs of sticks; but one day when the boys, roaming on the mountain, had lost their way, and coming to the convent had been there hospitably welcomed by Father Norbert, they came home wild to make carvings like what they had seen in the chapel. Jobst the Kohler was continually importuned for soft wood; the fair was ransacked for knives; and even the old Baroness could not find great fault with the occupation, base and mechanical though it were, which disposed of the two restless spirits during the many hours when winter storms confined them to the castle. Rude as was their work, the constant observation and choice of subjects were an unsuspected training and softening.

[...] And, when the snow melted and the buds returned, the ivy spray, the smiling saxifrage, the purple gentian bell, the feathery rowan leaf, the symmetrical lady's mantle, were hailed and loved first as models, then for themselves.|$|R
