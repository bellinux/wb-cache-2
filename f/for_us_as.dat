500|$|Throughout his career, James {{has taken}} stances on {{controversial}} issues. On several occasions, he mentioned {{a feeling of}} obligation to effect change using his status. Those include the War in Darfur, the Trayvon Martin case, the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014, the Michael Brown verdict, {{and the death of}} Eric Garner. Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James stated, [...] "being black in America is tough. We {{got a long way to}} go <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> a society and <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> African Americans until we feel equal in America." [...] Later on that same year, in the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, James questioned President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan by stating [...] "It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? He said that" [...] and [...] "Our youth deserve better!!" ...|$|E

You knew exactly that something like that was going to happen." [...] In the Manufacturers' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179. The race took three hours, ten minutes and twenty-three seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E
500|$|Antestor {{are one of}} the few {{bands in}} the Christian metal scene who use corpse paint in their {{appearances}} and on photos. One example is the booklet photos in the album The Return of the Black Death, depicting Antestor in Norsemen outfits and black and white face paints at a snowy Norwegian mountain location. Sometimes the group uses art blood, as known for the session bassist Ravn Furfjord's (Frosthardr) appearance at the Bobfest 2004 concert. The band explains that corpse paint [...] "is the same <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> masking is for actors or mimes; One way to express certain feelings in the battle we are in. The main purpose is to concentrate on God and not to break a lance in side issues like these." ...|$|E

Noble noted that [...] "Worlds Apart' {{and the rest of the}} fourth season brought back a number of characters from the series' [...] "rich history", including Sally, Nick, and David Robert Jones. [...] "This episode," [...] he commented, [...] "is bringing those things back together <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> we face the decision of what to do. Do we keep the worlds together?

500|$|We {{wanted the}} video {{to show her}} without artifice, {{in a way that}} her videos may not have done in the past. There is a {{simplicity}} in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. We didn't want it to be a posed still or a [...] "fashion image", we wanted it to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the Bronco herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in the way she drove! <b>For</b> <b>us,</b> <b>as</b> directors, it was scary and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|E

He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough time <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> people.

Michigan's athletic director, Dave Brandon, felt a rematch would be {{an excellent way to}} gain attention for Michigan football and said [...] "The networks were fighting over who gets to televise that game." [...] Jerry Moore said that [...] "To have the University of Michigan invite us back is the ultimate compliment <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> a program and a university. We're grateful for the opportunity to have a new generation of players experience a gameday at the Big House and to test themselves against college football's all-time winningest program." [...] Appalachian State played their first year of football in the FBS in 2014 and joined the Sun Belt Conference as full members. The rematch was much different this time around, with Michigan beating Appalachian State 52–14; Appalachian State never held a lead in the game.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, BBC {{producer}} Rodney Wilson asked Stockhausen {{to collaborate}} with Stephen and Timothy Quay on a film for the fourth series of Sound on Film International. Although Stockhausen's music had been used for films previously (most notably, parts of Hymnen in Nicolas Roeg's Walkabout in 1971), {{this was the first}} time he had been asked to provide music specially for the purpose. He adapted 21 minutes of material taken from his electronic music for Freitag aus Licht, calling the result Zwei Paare (Two Couples), and the Brothers Quay created their animated film, which they titled In Absentia, based only on their reactions to the music and the simple suggestion that a window might be an idea to use [...] When, at a preview screening, Stockhausen saw the film, which shows a madwoman writing letters from a bleak asylum cell, he was moved to tears. The Brothers Quay were astonished to learn that his mother had been [...] "imprisoned by the Nazis in an asylum, where she later died. … This was a very moving moment <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> well, especially because we had made the film without knowing any of this" [...]|$|E
500|$|Catt, Stone and Blackwell went {{together}} to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the [...] "triumvirate" [...] of women's suffrage, were called {{away from the}} convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen [...] "I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in {{what we try to}} do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> if we had votes..." [...] Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as [...] "Solitude of Self". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hidden Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs, but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine. The video consists of close-up shots panning around Björk's face, as fluids flow {{in and out of}} her facial orifices. M/M (Paris) explained the concept behind the video:We always wanted to get as close to her as we could, as we all felt she had never been portrayed as the [...] "real" [...] and beautiful woman she is. This is somehow taboo, to observe a pop star with no makeup from a distance of half an inch. Then the idea of the liquid works as a visualization of all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain. The loop idea was a main point <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> well, trying to extend the usual time frame of pop video super-fast editing, to make it hypnotising, mesmerising and irritating, like an eternally burning fireplace.|$|E
500|$|... "Call My Name" [...] is a {{song that}} lasts for four minutes and two seconds.

Mac Powell's vocal range spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The lyrics to the song {{have been described as}} being from the perspective of God, although the members of Third Day have described them differently; David Carr, the drummer for Third Day, described the lyrics as [...] "crying out to God and calling out his name", while Mac Powell described them as [...] "kind of a prayer. It's about when people are going through hard times and going through struggles that we've gotta call out to someone, and <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> people of faith it's calling out to God and hearing his voice... and for someone else it could be a friend or a family member that you've gotta reach out to kind of help share those burdens you go through". Carr also described the drum part on [...] "Call My Name" [...] as [...] "basic", and the song itself has been described as [...] "pop rock", [...] "AC-friendly", and [...] "pop".|$|E
500|$|To {{match the}} themes Draiman had in mind, {{he told his}} bandmates, [...] "give me your darkest, nastiest, [...] {{aggressive}} tribal rhythmic shit you can throw at me".

[...] Dan Marsicano of 411mania commented on the song [...] "Perfect Insanity", claiming it has [...] "...a short but sweet shredding solo, double bass drum work, and fast picked riffing...". He goes on to propose the same for the song [...] "Divide", saying it [...] "follows the same pattern , with aggressive guitar work followed through by Draiman's vocals..." [...] Marsicano also proposes that [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] has [...] "...a memorable solo and a dark theme surrounding it," [...] and says that [...] "The Night" [...] is an [...] "epic-sounding track that has one of the best solos that Donegan has ever done and a catchy chorus." [...] Chris Akin of Metaleater proposes that the album is full of hooks, and that guitarist Donegan takes a [...] "much more 80s approach", due to his guitar solos. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone proposes that the album contains [...] "meticulously constructed guitar skronk, serrated verses and cathartic refrains".|$|E
