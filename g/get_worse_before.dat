While indicating The Dark Knight would continue the themes of Batman Begins, including justice vs. revenge and Bruce Wayne's issues with his father, Nolan emphasized the sequel would also portray Wayne more as a detective, an aspect of his character not fully developed in Batman Begins. Nolan described the friendly rivalry between Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent as the [...] "backbone" [...] of the film. He also chose to compress the overall storyline, allowing Dent to become Two-Face in The Dark Knight, thus giving the film an emotional arc the unsympathetic Joker could not offer.

Never {{mind that the}} National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the arbiter of recessions, declared that the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009 officially ended in June 2009. An unrelenting pessimism constrains the recovery as consumers spend reluctantly while paying down debt, gripped by persistent fears of unemployment. The economy grew at a 2. 5 percent annualized pace in the third quarter, according to the second estimate of real gross domestic product (GDP), a moderate improvement after two quarters of decelerating growth during the recovery.

The paper attempts to assess the impacts of SMCRA in six major surface coal producing states. Although i t is not possible to make an unqualified overall national assessment, the evidence presented in the paper indicates that in many (but by no means all) cases, surface coal mining is now carried out in environmentally less destructive ways then before the Act. However, the accomplishments have fallen far short of expectations. The situation in some states has <b>gotten</b> <b>worse</b> than <b>before</b> the Act.

50|$|The {{intent was}} to have a {{universal}} storable and interchangeable document structure that would not go out of date and could be used by any word processor or desktop publisher. The rapid adoption of personal computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s by consumers and small businesses and the relative ease of writing applications for the primitive early PCs had resulted in a huge number of new word processing applications that were then duking it out around the world for market dominance. At the same time, large corporations who had purchased dedicated word processor devices in the 1970s were switching over to the new PCs that could run word processing software and much more. The result was a profusion of constantly evolving proprietary file formats. It was already clear by 1985 that this confusing and often frustrating situation would <b>get</b> much <b>worse</b> <b>before</b> it got better, as desktop publishing and multimedia computing were already on the horizon.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, {{members of the}} Sea Around Us {{uncovered}} that China was overestimating its catches and showed that, when such distortions were removed from overall fisheries catches, global fisheries were actually declining since the late 1980s. The Sea Around Us also showed that the biomass of large fish in the North Atlantic is one-tenth {{of what it was}} only a century ago. Aquaculture, according to another study with members from the Project, cannot be expected to compensate for overfishing but is instead likely to exacerbate the problem due to the reliance on wild fish for fishmeal.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in Culture and Conflict Review (Spring 2010), v. 4 no. 1 "With the recent decision to send an additional 30, 000 troops to Afghanistan, {{there is little doubt}} that the stakes are increasing as America enters its ninth year of war. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the additional troops and associated increase in funding will produce decisive results. Indeed, if the last eight years in Afghanistan are an indicator, the situation is likely to <b>get</b> much <b>worse</b> <b>before</b> it improves. Therefore, it is critical that the additional assets being allocated to continue the fight in Afghanistan be employed in a manner that produces optimal results in creating stability. This paper will show that the key to determining the most optimal employment of assets is to first ensure that the problem is well defined and understood. There are three fundamental topics that are important to understanding the current problem in Afghanistan. First, it is clear that despite a gradual increase in funding for the war in Afghanistan over the last eight years, overall stability in the country is <b>getting</b> <b>worse.</b> A second aspect of the problem is that resources have not been managed in an effective manner: a problem further compounded by rampant corruption. Finally, there have been many costly individual programs initiated by the U. S. in Afghanistan that contributed very little to stability, and in some cases, fostered instability. This has resulted in a poor cost-benefit ratio for U. S. taxpayers. ...|$|R
