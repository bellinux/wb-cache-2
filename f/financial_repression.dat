These programs sought to remove government distortions and lessen the <b>financial</b> <b>repression.</b> Policies made use of the McKinnon-Shaw hypothesis, which stated that removing distortions augments efficiency in the credit market and increases competition. The policies therefore involved banks providing loans on a commercial basis, enhancing bank efficiency and limiting government control to monetary policy only. FSRP forced banks to have a minimum capital adequacy, to systematically classify loans and to implement modern computerised systems, including those that handle accounting. It forced the central bank to free up interest rates, revise financial laws and increase supervision in the credit market. The government also developed the capital market, which was also performing poorly.|$|E

Using India as a case study, the results indicate that interest rate controls, statutory liquidity requirements and directed credit programs positively affect the level of financial development. A rise in cash reserve requirements appears to have an adverse effect on development of the financial system. The results lend some support to the argument that some form of financial restraints may help promote financial development. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper assesses long-run causal {{relationship}} between financial development {{and economic growth}} for South Asian countries - India, Pakistan and Bangladesh for the period 1976 - 2008. Financial development emanates from financial systems that encourage financial stability and foster a framework {{for the implementation of}} successful economic polices. Financial Systems can be divided into ‘bank-based'' and ‘capital-market-based'' categories. Bank-based financial systems are the close involvement of their banks with industrial firms; banks are the most important source of finance for industry. Capital-market-based financial systems are characterized by highly developed capital markets and banks. Bank-based financial systems may be in a good position to implement successfully expansionary monetary policy and industrial strategy. <b>Financial</b> liberalisation and <b>repression</b> may show a positive association between financial development and economic growth. We conduct cointegrated vector autoregressive model to assess long-run relationship between financial development and economic growth. Empirical results imply a stable relationship between financial development and economic growth for these countries. Results of error correction models indicate Granger causality between financial development and economic growth running from financial development to economic growth.

50|$|The {{integration}} of bank regulation {{has long been}} sought by EU policymakers, as a complement to the internal market for capital and, from the 1990s on, of the single currency.

During the 2000s, the emergence of pan-European banking groups through cross-border mergers and acquisitions (such as the purchases of Abbey National by Santander Group, HypoVereinsbank by UniCredit and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by BNP Paribas) led to renewed calls for banking policy integration, not least by the International Monetary Fund, but with limited policy action beyond the creation of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors in 2004.|$|E
50|$|The third {{issue is}} about the agency structure. Where should the law, that is enacted by Parliament, place the {{functions}} of rule-making and supervision for capital controls? At present, capital controls {{in the field of}} FDI (e.g. liberalisation of FDI in multi-brand retail) are determined by the government. In addition, there are tight connections between the liberalisa- tion of outward flows and a fiscal question: the extent of domestic <b>financial</b> <b>repression</b> (the forced lending by households through banks to the government). Further, capital account restrictions are analogous to protectionism in the financial sector. As with liberalisation of trade, capital account decontrol involves analysing the political ramifications of gainers and losers from liberalisation. This raises questions about whether the rule-making function (i.e. the drafting of subordinated legislation under the capital controls law) should be placed with the Ministry of Finance or the RBI. Similarly, supervisory functions (i.e. the enforcement of the subordinated legislation) could potentially be placed at RBI or at the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which watches India's cross-border flows from the viewpoint of restraining the financing of terrorism. Each of these alternatives has strengths and weaknesses.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} <b>financial</b> <b>repression</b> and structural change. We present a simple theoretical model of structural transformation in which the impact of <b>financial</b> <b>repression</b> on unbalanced growth is studied. Governments may choose to repress the financial sector {{to allow for the}} development of the industry sector while inhibiting growth in the domestic service sector. When investigating the predictions of our model using data for a panel of countries, we find that <b>financial</b> <b>repression</b> have a significant negative effect on structural transformation. In countries with higher levels of <b>financial</b> <b>repression,</b> the industry sector is developed rapidly while the service sector is held back. The results are robust to different country sample compositions, alternative measures of sectoral structure, and different measures of <b>financial</b> <b>repression.</b> The analysis suggests that <b>financial</b> <b>repression</b> is an important driver of structural imbalances, especially in countries with heavy state intervention and where the government strongly favors industrial expansion.
