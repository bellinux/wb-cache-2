5|$|After {{being open}} for {{little more than}} a year, the school failed in February 1737, gaining Johnson a {{reputation}} as a failed schoolmaster. He slowly abandoned his desire to teach to focus more on writing his first major work, the historical tragedy Irene. The play did not earn <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> he had hoped for, though, until Garrick produced it in 1749.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} CPGB, the Braddocks {{continued}} their socialist activism in Liverpool. Jack's {{role in the}} Merseyside Council of Action (an impromptu militant action group) during the 1926 General Strike made employers even less willing to engage him. He was rescued {{by the action of}} Sir Benjamin Johnson, a liberal-minded industrialist, who lent <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to purchase a Co-operative Insurance Society agency. Jack and Bessie were now determined to pursue their political aims by democratic methods, and in 1926 they joined the Fairfield ward of the Liverpool Labour Party. In the 1929 Liverpool council elections, Jack was returned unopposed as the Labour councillor for the Fairfield ward. A year later Bessie joined him, elected in the St Anne's ward.|$|E

As a last resort, Homer asks the two if they will lend <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> and they agree {{on the condition that}} he become their loyal servant.

5|$|As {{the pairs}} go their {{separate}} ways, an enforcer for the loan shark {{catches up with}} the duplicated pair {{to get the money}} back and they discover they have no cash. The enforcer orders Brian to decide whether he kills him or Stewie. Brian initially refuses to choose but when he panics, he tells the enforcer to shoot Stewie in the head, killing him, then the enforcer tells Brian to give <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> he and Stewie borrowed and leaves the room. Meanwhile, the real pair worry about getting caught Stewie suggest that they make a run for it and head home, but Brian fears it will endanger the family.

They prepare to throw themselves off the top balcony of the hotel but Stewie chickens out at the last second, leaving Brian to fall to his death. A panic-stricken Stewie trips over his backpack and finds the money the other pair had won.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{graduation}} in 1968, Kikai worked {{for two years}} as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard. Meanwhile, he stayed {{in touch with his}} philosophy professor from his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Shōji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made a great impact on Kikai. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At that time (when somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¥40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥320,000 and mentioned this to Fukuda, who immediately lent <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80mm lens, is what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since.|$|E
5|$|Between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. CT on March 3, {{the morning}} Fischer was killed, Olivarez {{confirmed}} with Garza {{at the motel}} that the murder was successful. He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the job had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez and picked up the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

25|$|There was $120,000 {{capital for}} the project, {{all of which}} came from Pratt. He left the tannery to Gould, which {{expanded}} rapidly, and the surrounding settlement was called Gouldsboro (also spelled Gouldsborough). However, Pratt became dissatisfied with the returns on his investment, and was concerned that Gould was embezzling. Gould had become acquainted with Charles M. Leupp, a rich merchant from New York City, and had convinced Leupp to loan <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to buy out Pratt's share. Gould offered Pratt $60,000 for {{his share of the}} tannery, which Pratt accepted, transferring Pratt's stake to Leupp.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, Nerman was conscripted for {{military}} service. By his own request, he got medical training. Nerman had already developed an anti-militarist standpoint and in 1908 {{he was caught}} by the secret police handing out illegal anti-militarist leaflets. He was first convicted to jail, but the penalty was altered to a 300 kronor fine. His father sent <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> but the rebellious son used it to finance a trip to Paris, where he stayed a couple of weeks. Upon returning to Sweden he was once again sent money by his father {{to pay off the}} fine to avoid going to jail.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked about}} his religion, Armstrong would answer that he was raised a Baptist, always wore a Star of David, and was friends with the Pope.

Louis Armstrong was, in fact, baptized as a Catholic at the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in New Orleans, and he met popes Pius XII and Paul VI, though there is no {{evidence}} that he considered himself Catholic. Armstrong seems to have been tolerant towards various religions, but also found humor in them.|$|E

25|$|From Marseilles, {{short of}} money, Acharya {{proceeded}} to Paris where {{he hoped to}} find Indian expatriates {{who might have been}} able to help him both financially and with jobs. He had, while editing Anglo-Tamil newspaper and journals in India, been in touch with Indians living in France and in Paris. In Paris, he established contact with Professor Moniers Vinson and a few Indian expatriates. He was able to support himself with help from this circle for some time.

25|$|For a {{long time}} Sundar Singh had wanted to visit Britain, and the {{opportunity}} came when his father, Sher Singh, who was converted too gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for his fare to Britain. He visited the West twice, travelling to Britain, the United States and Australia in 1920, and to Europe again in 1922. He was welcomed by Christians of many traditions, and his words searched the hearts of people who now faced the aftermath of World War I and who seemed to evidence a shallow attitude to life. Singh was appalled {{by what he saw}} as the materialism, emptiness and irreligion he found everywhere, contrasting it with Asia's awareness of God, no matter how limited that might be. Once back in India he continued his Gospel-proclamation work, though {{it was clear that he}} was getting more physically frail.|$|E
