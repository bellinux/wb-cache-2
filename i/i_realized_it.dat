500|$|When Ambrosius {{first met}} Jackson, {{it took a}} few minutes to calm down. She {{recalled}} to the same publication Stewart was interviewed by, [...] "To begin with, I was kinda shook. Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're put in that situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But as I got into it, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend." [...] Harris commented on the single, [...] "He's showing you, I'm still the Michael Jackson that did 'Billie Jean' and 'Rock With You' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{were also}} charges of racism, {{due to his}} portrayals of blacks and Hispanics. Baker denied those charges, and {{pointed out that the}} protagonist later {{realized}} that the blacks were also gay and the Latina [...] "was just a sweet old woman putting {{up with a lot of}} (stuff) that I couldn't even imagine." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I just wanted to explore the conflicts between gays and Latinos and gays and blacks ... the real feelings [...] misapprehensions of each other. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> wouldn't all be nice and politically correct. If blacks (and Latinos) want my respect, they have to deal with their own homophobia. I'm not playing guilty liberal anymore".|$|E
500|$|... "We had {{the song}} pitched {{to us and}} {{originally}} it wasn’t a duet. The more I {{was listening to the}} thing and learning the song, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> set itself up to be a duet if we wanted to go that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E

500|$|Danny Elfman {{had great}} enthusiasm for {{returning}} because [...] "I didn't {{have to prove}} myself from the first film. I remember Jon Peters was very skeptical at first to hire me." [...] Elfman's work schedule was 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. [...] "When completing this movie <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> {{was something of a}} film score and an opera. It was 95 minutes long, twice the amount of the average film score." [...] Burton allowed Elfman to be more artistic with the sequel score, such as the [...] "scraping" [...] on violins for the cat themes. Under the pressure of finishing the score, however, {{the relationship between the two}} strained, which — along with further [...] "creative differences" [...] on The Nightmare Before Christmas — led Burton to use Howard Shore to score his next film Ed Wood. The musician co-orchestrated [...] "Face to Face", which was written and performed by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The song can be heard in one scene during the film and during the end credits.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter {{had just}} made Dark Star but {{no one wanted to}} hire him as a director, so he assumed that he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the {{intention}} of making Escape later. After the success of Halloween, Avco-Embassy signed him and producer Debra Hill to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was The Fog. Initially, the second film {{that he was going to}} make to finish the contract was The Philadelphia Experiment, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt that something was missing and recalls, [...] "This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see." [...] He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film school days at University of Southern California who played [...] "The Shape" [...] in Halloween. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized I was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{business}} matters {{have been}} too much for me-- <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> now," [...] sighed Anderson Rover. [...] "I must take a rest-- a good, long rest. They would not have gotten the best of me if I had been stronger." ...|$|R

5000|$|The song {{is written}} as a religiously themed ballad, with the singer expressing her love and devotion to God, and {{explaining}} that this faith serves {{to comfort her}} in troubled times. Stone & Stone also recorded an English-language version of the song, bearing the title [...] "(Oh Lord) <b>I</b> <b>Realized</b> <b>It's</b> You".|$|R
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the year, Friedgen had {{challenged}} {{his players}} {{with the phrase}} [...] "Are you in or are you out?" [...] After the dramatic first-year turnaround, he was a high-profile candidate for an NFL position, and his players repeated his question.

2500|$|May {{spoke about}} this {{incident}} years later, saying, [...] "the first thing I knew I was being fired {{on from the}} rear ... all I could do was try to dodge my attacker. I noticed it was a red tri-plane, but if <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was Richthofen, I would have probably {{passed out on the}} spot. I kept on dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until I ran out of sky and had to hedge hop over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [...] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn't know what I was doing myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure out what I was going to do".|$|E
2500|$|Project leader Colonel S. and {{his team}} in the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure (Maf'at) had very little spare time, and only on the {{weekends}} could they think of an appropriate name for the system. According to Colonel S., [...] "The first name I thought of was 'Anti-Qassam', but when the project started to move forward <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was problematic... I sat down with my wife, and together we thought of suitable names. She suggested the name 'Tamir' (Hebrew acronym for טיל מיירט, Til Meyaret, 'interceptor missile') for the missile, and for the system itself we thought of 'Golden Dome'. The following Sunday, 'Tamir' was immediately approved, {{but there was a}} problem with 'Golden Dome'—it could be perceived as ostentatious. So it was changed to 'Iron Dome'." ...|$|E
