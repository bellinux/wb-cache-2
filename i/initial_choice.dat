5|$|Hard Target was Woo's first American {{film and}} {{was also the first}} major Hollywood film made by a Chinese {{director}}. Universal Pictures was nervous about having Woo direct a feature, and sent in director Sam Raimi to look over the film's production and to take Woo's place as director if he were to fail. Woo went through several scripts finding mostly martial arts films with which he was not interested. After deciding on Chuck Pfarrer's script for Hard Target, Woo wanted to have actor Kurt Russell in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. Woo then went with Universal's <b>initial</b> <b>choice</b> of having Jean-Claude Van Damme star. Woo got along with Van Damme during filming and raised the amount of action in the film as he knew that Van Damme was up for it.|$|E

25|$|When the First World War {{started in}} July 1914 Murray was not {{appointed}} QuarterMaster-General of the British Expeditionary Force as was originally intended.

It is sometimes claimed that Murray was given the position largely because French's <b>initial</b> <b>choice</b> for the post, Wilson, was vetoed because of {{his role in the}} Curragh Affair. Although this claim was made after the war by Edmonds, Kirke (in his memoir of Macdonogh) and Murray, there is no contemporary evidence, even in Wilson’s diary, to confirm it (unlike January 1915, when Wilson was certainly blocked from succeeding Murray for political reasons).|$|E

They instead chose a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, Benjamin Cluff, Jr.. Cluff's methods as president have been described as nearly opposite those of Maeser. Maeser was insular and conservative in his teaching methods. He kept his teachings well within the LDS world, and adhered to classical education standards. Cluff was more open to new ideas and methods. He also believed that the world outside Mormonism had a lot to offer the school.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} {{class of}} heuristics for constraint satisfaction problems works by sampling information during search {{in order to}} inform subsequent decisions. One of these strategies, called the “weighted degree heuristic”, is based on weighting constraints according to their involvement in failure during search. Recently, {{a new approach to}} sampling based on weighted degree was introduced, that uses a form of “random probing ” to gain information that is less subject to sampling bias. This approach also involves restarting in order to enhance the <b>initial</b> <b>choices</b> made during search. The present research analyses the characteristics of the sampling process {{and the manner in which}} information is used, to better understand strategies based on constraint weights. Using a framework based on two performance principles, the well-known Fail-First and a “Contention Principle”, we study the properties of both the sampling and variable selection components. We show that the critical factor in search enhancement is improved fail-firstness (rather than <b>initial</b> <b>choices),</b> that the important concept wrt sampling is contention rather than failure, that probing effectiveness depends on the quality of the sample, and that random probing seems to balance two basic forms of heuristic action to improve overall search efficiency. ...|$|R

Therefore, small events are modeled by randomizing the expectancy Ej, meaning that there are different estimates about the expectancies across actors, which are not initially correlated, for example because of high uncertainties or strong arguments for both institutions.|$|R

40|$|We {{are remarkably}} adept at {{inferring}} {{the consequences of}} our actions, yet the neuronal mechanisms {{that allow us to}} plan a sequence of novel choices remain unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how the human brain plans the shortest path to a goal in novel mazes with one (shallow maze) or two (deep maze) choice points. We observed two distinct anterior prefrontal responses to demanding choices at the second choice point: one in rostrodorsal medial prefrontal cortex (rd-mPFC) /superior frontal gyrus (SFG) that was also sensitive to (deactivated by) demanding <b>initial</b> <b>choices</b> and another in lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), which was only engaged by demanding choices at the second choice point. Furthermore, we identified hippocampal responses during planning that correlated with subsequent choice accuracy and response time, particularly in mazes affording sequential choices. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses showed that coupling between the hippocampus and rd-mPFC increases during sequential (deep versus shallow) planning and is higher before correct versus incorrect choices. In short, using a naturalistic spatial planning paradigm, we reveal how the human brain represents sequential choices during planning without extensive training. Our data highlight a network centred on the cortical midline and hippocampus that allows us to make prospective <b>choices</b> while maintaining <b>initial</b> <b>choices</b> during planning in novel environments...|$|R

Burton had {{previously}} worked with Nicholson on Batman (1989) and Mars Attacks! (1996). In order to depict Nicholson as the young Bloom, Burton intended to {{use a combination of}} computer-generated imagery and prosthetic makeup. The director then decided to cast around for the two actors in question. Jinks and Cohen, who were then working with Ewan McGregor on Down with Love (2003), suggested that Burton cast both McGregor and Albert Finney for Edward. Burton later compared McGregor's acting style to regular colleague Johnny Depp. Viewing Finney's performance in Tom Jones (1963), Burton found him similar to McGregor, and coincidentally found a People magazine article comparing the two. McGregor, being Scottish, found it easier performing with a Southern American English accent. [...] "It's a much easier accent to do than a standard American accent because you can really hear it. You can get your teeth into it. Standard American is much harder because it's more lyrical." [...] The same dual casting applied to {{the role of}} Bloom's wife, Sandra, who would be played by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman. Burton commented that he was impressed with Lohman's performance in White Oleander (2002). Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, was also cast in two roles. Her prosthetic makeup for The Witch took five hours to apply. [...] "I was pregnant throughout filming, so it was weird being a pregnant witch," [...] the actress reflected.
