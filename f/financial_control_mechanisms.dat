40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Education)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2006. Management of a school's {{finances}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important areas of school management and procedures of financial control should be established by the school to ensure that transactions are recorded accurately and that its financial position is correctly presented at appropriate intervals. If <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are properly designed, it should enable the role players to discover just where deviations from a specific budget occur and thus facilitates investigation. A large number of schools in the historically 'disadvantaged' areas in South Africa are not familiar with the process of budgeting, which naturally creates problems in the management of finances in these schools. These schools are not likely to operate within the allocated and adopted school budget and tend to overspend, purchase items that have not been included in the budget and they attempt to borrow from one budget account to supplement another budget account. Almost all township school budgets were negatively affected by poverty and unemployment of parents. Fund-raising projects pose a threat to schools if they are sustained for long periods and are too extensive, because it might be time-consuming to educators and learners. The Government should, however, ensure that especially the township schools do not have to rely on fund-raising to supplement the funds allocated by the Government. The school budget is the translation of educational needs into a financial plan which is interpreted to the public in such a way that when formally adopted, it expresses the kind of educational programme the community is willing to support both financially and morally. Translating those needs into a budget can follow the pattern of identifying needs, establishing goals, organizing objectives, building a programme in meeting those objectives, and providing a budget to fund those programmes. There is no comprehensive budgetary system that can be used by all educational schools in South Africa. The budgetary systems differ from school to school due to differences in needs, traditions and goals. A school has to select and develop a budgetary process that will satisfy the needs of that specific school. However, it remains important to ensure that the budgetary process is flexible, based on sound data as well as comprehensive inputs from all the stakeholders and integrated into the long term planning process of the school. Budgeting becomes the process of allocating finite resources to the prioritized needs of a school. In most cases, for a governmental entity such as a school, the budget represents the legal authority to spend money. As such, the budget is a product of the planning process. The budget also provides an important tool for the control, evaluation and the use of resources. Thus, the budget is implicitly linked to financial accountability and relates directly to the financial reporting objectives. It is essential for the financial leadership of a school to realize their accountability and responsibility in the management of school funds. In order to implement this issue, it is necessary for the financial managers to have the necessary knowledge of all the procedures involved in financial management, such as budgeting and fund-raising procedures. Finally, it should be kept in mind that leadership in financial management involves four aspects, namely, sound relationships, motivation of all the people concerned with school finances, communication with all the school stakeholders, internal as well as external, and consistent financial control which is discussed in detail in this study as well as in the financial model included as appendix.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the {{process through which}} country-level corporate governance facilitates firm-level investment {{in research and development}} (R&D). Taking cash flow as one of the main determinants of R&D, we derive an econometric model that introduces a number of corporate governance factors (legal protection, <b>financial</b> system, and <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms)</b> to analyze their impact on R&D-cash flow sensitivity. Using data from nine European Union countries, Japan, and the United States, we show that R&D at the firm level is less sensitive to internal cash flow in countries with effective investor protection, developed financial systems, and strong corporate <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Specifically, our analysis suggests that the characteristics of the corporate governance system that facilitate R&D are a common law legal environment, minority shareholder protection, strong law enforcement, a bank-based financial system, effective board control, and a strong market for corporate control. This evidence points to corporate governance as a key element in R&D investment, and contributes to the debate on whether country-level corporate governance systems can facilitate R&D projects and, indirectly, promote economic growth...|$|R
5000|$|As Reufli and Sarrazin observed, the {{key issue}} with {{strategic}} <b>control</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{is the need to}} deal with uncertainty and ambiguity. A landmark study by Michael Goold and Andrew Campbell identified that a variety of control methods are used across a continuum ranging from purely <b>financial</b> <b>controls</b> at one extreme, through to detailed strategic planning systems at the other. [...] They observed a series of trade-offs between these extremes - <b>financial</b> <b>controls</b> being simpler and therefore cheaper and more flexible to operate, but providing less scope for co-ordination between components of an organisation, strategic planning being time-consuming and expensive to operate, but providing the greatest scope to push for maximum strategic advantage. In the middle of this range, Goold and Campbell described strategic control as allowing firms to [...] "balance competitive and financial ambitions". This idea of a spectrum of control has since been widely adopted.|$|R
30|$|Since the 16 th CPC National Congress, {{the global}} economy has {{gradually}} recovered and the Chinese government began a policy of actively stimulating the economy. After successfully coping {{with the impact of}} the SARS epidemic in 2003, China’s economy started to step out from the shadows of deflation and low levels of effective demand and entered a new period of prosperity. However, the problems of excessive investment and redundant construction began to pop up in some industries and regions. That was an indication that it would no longer be appropriate to continue to implement proactive fiscal policies that had been in place since 1998. The Central Committee looked into current economic conditions and began to study the idea of revamping fiscal policy in 2004. In 2005, the Committee began to implement prudent fiscal policy characterized by controlling deficits, adjusting structures, promoting reform, increasing revenues, and reducing expenditures. In the past few years, due to enhanced coordination of financial policies, monetary policies, and industrial policies, China’s economy has experienced rapid growth, structural optimization, increased efficiency, and improved people’s livelihoods. China’s GDP maintained a growth rate higher than 10  % without large fluctuations or severe inflation for five consecutive years between 2003 and 2007, resulting in gains to both the quality and efficiency of economic growth. Since the Reform and Opening Up, the Chinese government has adopted a variety of policy instruments to exert macro-control over economic operations and has gradually established a <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> <b>mechanism</b> characterized by coordinated budgets, taxes, subsidies on interest payments, government bonds, transfer payments, tax rebates on exporters, and other actions aimed to promote structural optimization and healthy, rapid economic development. In the fourth quarter of 2008, {{in the face of the}} global financial crisis triggered by the American subprime crisis, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to change macro-policy. They again established a proactive, expansionary financial policy and pushed out a government stimulus package of four trillion yuan. These measures coupled with new monetary policies and other methods helped the national economy stabilize and recover after the second quarter of 2009. Moreover, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council make decisions discretionarily in complicated situations. They do so to strengthen and optimize pre-emptive adjustments and fine-tuning to policy, thus making progress while maintaining stability, all in order to promote the healthy, rapid development of the national economy. Since the 16 th CPC National Congress, macro-control achieved through management of public finance has brought about four significant shifts: the shift from passive to active regulation, the shift from direct to indirect regulation, the shift from regulation by a single means to regulation by a combination of means, and the shift from regulating businesses and individuals toward regulating market variables. These shifts indicate that China has established a financial macro-control system that includes many elements, such as target selection, combined means, timing, organization, and implementation. This system basically meets the needs of different economic operation patterns under the market economy.|$|R

So, first, the notion of "a unified system of state financial control" is not regulated by any domestic law, and therefore the activity of many regulatory bodies remains uncoordinated properly, resulting in duplication of functions, remains high (and sometimes excessive) "control" load by controlled entities. Secondly, there is no basic law of Ukraine on the state <b>financial</b> <b>control,</b> which would define the essence of state <b>financial</b> <b>control,</b> its functional purpose, principles of organization, objects and subjects, and the object types, forms, techniques and methods of its implementation. Thirdly, the status of Supreme Audit Institution is not legally secured. Fourthly, applicable laws and regulations in the area of public <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> sometimes are not consistent. Finally, the legislation virtually governs the organization of state <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> at the regional and municipal levels, which causes lack of a unified system of <b>financial</b> <b>control</b> at the level of business and local government.
