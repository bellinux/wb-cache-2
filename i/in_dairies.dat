Among these rich grounds stand some market towns, though not of very considerable note; such as Framlingham, where was once a royal castle, to which Queen Mary retired when the Northumberland faction, in behalf of the Lady Jane, endeavoured to supplant her. And it was this part of Suffolk where the Gospellers, as they were then called, preferred their loyalty to their religion, and complimented the Popish line at expense of their share of the Reformation. But they paid dear for it, and their successors have learned better politics since.|$|E

50|$|There is a 'fast food' culture {{similar to}} that in the United States, Australia and Britain. Many American fast food chains have a {{presence}} in New Zealand, and local variants based on quality local produce (such as Burger Fuel and Hell Pizza for example) have arisen. The pie is possibly the nearest thing New Zealand has to street food, though its popularity has waned. Pies are actually still the most common take away lunch and are sold everywhere, <b>in</b> <b>dairies,</b> bakeries, supermarkets, petrol stations, school lunch tuck-shops. Pies can be made with beef, lamb, chicken, pork, apple, berries, rhubarb or custard. Traditionally pies are a savory food as opposed to sweet pies. A fast food chain based on pies, Georgie Pie, was founded in 1977, but went out of business in the mid-1990s. Currently another fast food chain selling pies exists: Australian-based Jester's produces pies throughout New Zealand's North Island, predominantly Auckland.|$|E

As dairy Technology is developing day by day, therefore reproductive performance of dairy animals is major concern <b>in</b> <b>dairy</b> industry. This Reproductive performance of dairy animals requires accurate and regular Estrus detection. Estrus {{is nothing but a}} behavioural symptom in mammals which indicate that female is mated close to the ovulation. That’s why Timely detection of estrus is the only solution to increase the fertility rate <b>in</b> <b>dairy</b> animals. Failure to detect animal in estrus and breeding animals which are not in estrus result in economic loss for the owner because of extended calving interval and additional semen expenses. Accurate Estrus detection gives idea about proper timing of Artificial Insemination. So Estrus detection is the key solution for effective growth <b>in</b> <b>dairy</b> technology...|$|R
