5|$|Aristagoras {{had brought}} all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently {{realised}} that the Greeks would need other allies {{in order to}} successfully fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he first sailed to Sparta, the pre-eminent Greek state in matters of war. However, despite Aristagoras's entreaties, the Spartan king Cleomenes <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> down the offer to lead the Greeks against the Persians. Aristagoras therefore turned instead to Athens.|$|E
5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Scottish independence, Robert <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> his attention to building up a Scottish naval capacity. This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards {{the end of his}} reign he supervised the building of at least one royal man-of-war near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde. In the late 14th century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers. James I took a greater interest in naval power. After his return to Scotland in 1424 he established a shipbuilding yard at Leith, a house for marine stores, and a workshop. King's ships, one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429, were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war, and the office of Lord High Admiral was probably founded in this period. In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III received assistance from his two warships the Flower and the King's Carvel also known as the Yellow Carvel.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} demonstrated, however, that resultatives exist {{independently}} of the perfect in sentences like <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> this offer down, creating the need to reexamine the role of resultatives. To address this, it has been claimed that the resultative expresses both a state and the preceding action it has resulted from. This emphasizes that the resultative describes how a state was acted upon. Therefore, it must use the passive form. However, this analysis {{does not account for}} phrases such as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> this offer down, which uses the active rather than the passive voice.|$|E
25|$|This {{result was}} a {{diplomatic}} failure and de Montmorency fell out of royal favor.

In 1817, Russian forces under Yermolov's command embarked upon the conquest of the Caucasus. Yermolov's brutal tactics, which included economic warfare, collective punishment and forcible deportations, were initially successful, but have been described as counterproductive since they effectively ended Russian influence on Chechen society and culture and ensured the Chechens' enduring enmity. Yermolov was not relieved of command until 1827.|$|E

25|$|In March 1888, after {{prolonged}} political infighting, Carol <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> {{his back}} on both the Conservatives and the National Liberals. The Junimists experienced a moment of triumph, with Theodor Rosetti as Premier and Maiorescu as Education Minister. For a while, Melik himself was Secretary General of the Education Ministry, his position at University filled in by I. D. Rallet. The Junimist loyalist was assigned by Maiorescu to inspect the Moldavian schools. Their common goal was to purge from the schooling system a new political threat: socialist activists. Melik was ordered to work only with the known anti-socialists, and to sack all those suspected of having affiliated with the socialist clubs. In one such letter, the Minister instructs his subordinate to inquire about whether the known Marxist Ioan Nădejde still had relatives working on a state salary.|$|E

I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E

25|$|Just as I {{was pushing}} {{one of our}} men back into the ranks I saw him fall at my feet from a sabre slash. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to Walter and said, “This {{movie is}} {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
