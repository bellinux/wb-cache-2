25|$|Estrogens {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer. The estrogens that {{have been used}} include diethylstilbestrol, <b>fosfestrol</b> (diethylstilbestrol diphosphate), ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol undecylate, as well as the combined estrogenic and nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent estramustine phosphate. Newer estrogens with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens. They both suppress testosterone concentrations to castrate levels via their antigonadotropic activity and they reduce the percentage of free and bioavailable testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin production and levels. Estrogens {{have been found to be}} equivalent in effectiveness to androgen deprivation therapy with castration and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. However, they significantly increase cardiovascular mortality, and for this reason, are now little used in prostate cancer. Although the most commonly employed estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, it is notable that certain estrogens, namely polyestradiol phosphate, have been found not to do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the various estrogens on hepatic protein synthesis.|$|E

Needle biopsy of the prostate was done and microscopic examination revealed adenocarcinoma. Bone scintigram showed multiple bone metastasis and he was diagnosed as having prostatic carcinoma stage D 2. Intravenous pyelography revealed multiple out-pouching lesion of mid left ureter and left mild hydronephrosis. <b>Fosfestrol</b> was given for prostatic carcinoma and no treatment was given for multiple ureteral diverticula.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} Estrogens (Honvan) in the secondary hormonal manipulation of patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRCP). Methods: Twelve patients diagnosed as hormone refractory prostate cancer received intravenous estrogens for six days (<b>Fosfestrol,</b> a synthetic phosphorylated estrogen derivative), followed by a maintenance oral dose of 120 mg thrice daily as second line hormonal treatment. During the treatment they were given deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Their stage at initial presentation, primary treatment, mode of androgen ablation, prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, duration of remission prior of HRPC status, PSA doubling time before and after estrogen treatment were recorded. The morbidity and mortality of the treatment was also recorded. A drop in PSA of 3 Ì†e 50...|$|E
40|$|We report {{one case}} of Paneth cell-like change of {{prostate}} cancer. An 81 -year-old male reported to our hospital {{with the chief}} complaint of urinary retention. The serum concentration of prostate specific antigen, 168 ng/ml, was high, and digital examination was performed. Because we suspected prostate cancer, needle biopsy of the prostate was performed. Histological examination revealed moderately-poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography revealed no invasion to the prostatic wall and no metastasis to the lymph node. 99 mTc-HMDP revealed no bone metastasis. We chose intravenous hormonotherapy (<b>fosfestrol</b> 500 mg/day, 20 days), but urinary retention did not improve. Therefore, we performed transurethral prostatectomy to improve the symptoms. Histological examination of the removed specimen revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with Paneth cell-like change. Immunochemical and histochemical stains were positive for Grimelius, serotonin and prostatic acid phosphatase and negative for periodic acid-Schiff reaction, lysozyme, neuron specific enolase, prostate specific antigen, alpha- 1 -antitrypsin and IgA...|$|E
40|$|Reversible {{inhibition}} of four important human liver cytochrome P 450 enzymes by diethylstilbestrolDiethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic estrogen clinically {{used to treat}} threatened abortion between the 1940 s and the 1970 s, has been restricted to treat certain cases of prostatic and breast cancer due to its adverse drug responses such as teratogenicity and carcinogenicity. Some reports have demonstrated that the addition of DES to docetaxel could modify tubulin composition and improve response of prostate cancer to chemotherapy. Given that DES might be co-administered with other drugs such as docetaxel, the present study focused on CYP-based drug-drug interaction (DDI). In vitro inhibitory effects of DES on CYP isoforms were investigated, and {{the results showed that}} DES could competitively inhibit CYP 3 A 4, CYP 2 C 8, CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 2 E 1. The inhibition constants (K(i)) were calculated to be 4. 4 mu M, 3. 0 mu M, 5. 0 mu M and 8. 0 mu M for CYP 3 A 4, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 E 1 and CYP 2 C 8, respectively. Based on peak serum DES level after drip influsion of 500 mg of <b>fosfestrol</b> (DES diphosphate) in patients, [I]/K(i) was calculated to be 4. 3, 6. 2, 3. 7 and 2. 3 for CYP 3 A 4, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 E 1 and CYP 2 C 8, which suggested that DES was likely to induce in vivo DDI through {{inhibition of}} these four major CYP isoforms. These results collectively demonstrate that adverse drug responses might exist when DES is co-administered with other drugs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation causes thrombotic tendency {{leading to}} multiple organ failure and {{occurs in a}} wide variety of diseases including malignancy. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a latent complication in people with prostate cancer. Case presentation A 51 -year-old Japanese man with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer was admitted to our hospital because of extensive purpura and severe anemia. Prolonged plasma coagulation time, hypofibrinogenemia and normal platelet count suggested that a decrease in fibrinogen induced a bleeding tendency causing purpura. However, elevated plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrin and/or fibrinogen degradation products and D-dimers, with positive fibrin monomer test, manifested disseminated intravascular coagulation and subsequent fibrinolysis. Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrin and/or fibrinogen degradation products and D-dimers decreased after administration of low-molecular-weight heparin. However, low fibrinogen and Î± 2 -antiplasmin levels were not improved and plasmin-antiplasmin complex did not decrease, which revealed excessive fibrinolysis complicated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. We suspected that prostate cancer cell-derived urokinase-type plasminogen activator caused excessive fibrinolysis. Administration of tranexamic acid for fibrinogenolysis was added together with high-dose anti-androgen therapy (<b>fosfestrol)</b> for prostate cancer. Thereafter, prostate-specific antigen and plasmin-antiplasmin complex decreased, followed by normalized fibrinogen and Î± 2 -antiplasmin levels, and the patient eventually recovered from the bleeding tendency. Immunohistochemical staining of the biopsied prostate tissue exhibited that the prostate cancer cells produced tissue factor, the coagulation initiator, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Conclusion This patient with rare complications of disseminated intravascular coagulation and excessive fibrinolysis is a warning case of potential coagulation disorder onset in patients with prostate cancer. We propose that combined administration of tranexamic acid and low-molecular-weight heparin together with high-dose anti-androgen therapy is a useful therapeutic option for patients with this complicated coagulation disorder. </p...|$|E
