2500|$|A <b>frameset</b> {{consists}} of the frame and front fork of a bicycle and sometimes includes the headset and seat post. [...] Frame builders will often produce the frame and fork together as a paired set.|$|E
2500|$|American Bicycle Manufacturing of St. Cloud, Minnesota, briefly {{offered a}} <b>frameset</b> made of {{beryllium}} tubes (bonded to aluminum lugs). [...] Given the toxic {{nature of the}} material and the pricing ($26,000 for frame and fork), they never caught on. [...] Reports were that the ride was very harsh, but the frame was also very laterally flexible.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, {{the use of}} <b>framesets</b> has {{increasingly}} been considered obsolete due to usability and accessibility concerns, and the feature {{has been removed from}} the HTML5 standard.|$|R
5000|$|XHTML 1.0 <b>Frameset</b> is the XML {{equivalent}} of HTML 4.01 <b>Frameset,</b> {{and allows for}} the definition of <b>frameset</b> documents—a common Web feature in the late 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Not all of {{problems}} identified with <b>framesets</b> are eliminated by using these alternative approaches; for instance issues with Back/Forward navigation, bookmarking, and indexing remain on many sites which make heavy use of DHTML / AJAX navigation.|$|R

5000|$|The later HTML5 standard, {{which took}} a {{different}} approach to succession from HTML 4, also removes <b>framesets.</b> The [...] element, however, remains, with a number of [...] "sandboxing" [...] options intended for sharing content between sites.|$|R
50|$|The top-end {{models were}} built with double-butted Columbus tubing and Campagnolo Record and Nuovo Record components.

50|$|Single-piece {{carbon fiber}} bicycle frames are {{sometimes}} described as monocoques however as most use the components {{to form a}} frame structure (even if molded in a single piece), these are frames and not monocoques, and the bike industry continues to {{refer to them as}} <b>framesets.</b>|$|R

50|$|Like HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 {{has three}} sub-specifications: strict, {{transitional}} and <b>frameset.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In addition, HTML 4.01 {{provides}} Transitional and <b>Frameset</b> DTDs, {{as explained}} below. Transitional type {{is the most}} inclusive, incorporating current tags as well as older or [...] "deprecated" [...] tags, with the Strict DTD excluding deprecated tags. <b>Frameset</b> has all tags necessary to make frames on a page along with the tags included in transitional type.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} design {{was used to}} test the “framesetting” effects of different news formats, and to provide a quantitative test of the influence of civic journalism on audience attitudes. <b>Framesetting</b> is posited as a new theory bridging agenda setting and framing research. It occurs when audiences not only ascribe importance to an issue covered prominently in the press, but simultaneously adopt the media frame of that issue. In this study, 199 adults from the general population were randomly assigned to five conditions: two conventional journalism conditions employing an “objectivist” frame, two civic journalism conditions employing an “advocacy frame”, and a control condition. Participants read stories about crime for a week and then filled out a questionnaire. Results show that advocacy-framed stories had a greater <b>framesetting</b> effect than did objectivist-framed stories, which had a minimal <b>framesetting</b> effect. Those in the advocacy conditions were statistically more likely to rank crime as the most important topic facing the country and their community, constructed fewer arguments when asked to name causes and solutions for crime, and were more likely to volunteer solutions consistent with the stories they read. Those in the objectivist conditions were more likely than control participants—but less likely than advocacy participants—to rate crime the most important problem. They were not different from control {{in terms of the number}} of causes and solutions offered, or in terms of the types of causes and solutions they recommended. In addition, those who read advocacy-framed stories were more likely to offer favorable opinions of the city they read about and its crime problem than were those who read objectivist and control stories. Minimal effects were found in terms of increasing civic capital in advocacy audiences. A cognitive-based model for explaining the <b>framesetting</b> effect is proposed. ...|$|R
50|$|Pocket Internet Explorer 2.0, {{released}} in September 1997 with Windows CE 2.0, added many new features: offline browsing, resizing images {{to fit to}} screen, and richer HTML support, including <b>framesets</b> and tables. PIE 3.0, introduced in July 1998 with Windows CE 2.10, added support for JScript and various secure protocols.|$|R
50|$|Some WebCT criticisms {{which were}} {{apparent}} include problems {{using it in}} multiple tabs or browser windows, heavy reliance on Java for its user experience, usage of too many browser <b>framesets,</b> issues with some features requiring pop-up blockers to be turned off, and problems using standard browser navigation tools (i.e. the Back and Forward commands).|$|R

5000|$|External links on {{web pages}} which use frames may cause other pages {{to appear in}} the <b>frameset,</b> since the default {{behaviour}} for a link is to load in the current frame if the author does not specify otherwise.

50|$|Columbus tubing was {{the main}} {{competitor}} to TI Reynolds 531 in the bicycle tube set market {{with many of the}} big name Italian manufacturers of bicycles and <b>framesets</b> utilising their products. Famous name builders such as Bianchi, Centurion Bicycles (after 1981), De Rosa, Ciocc, Pinarello and Colnago all specified the Columbus tubesets as part of their range.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Peugeot {{opened a}} custom bicycle frame shop (the Atelier Prestige) which {{specialized}} {{in the production}} of custom Reynolds-tubed <b>framesets</b> using thin-gauge butted steel tubing. These custom frames were designated PY-10. Similar to a PX-10 in design and styling, a PY-10 could be ordered to customers' individual specifications. Options included, but were not limited to, geometry and frame size, color, components, and braze-ons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} like-for-like {{replacements}} for 531 are Reynolds 520 and 525 - a Chrome-Molybdenum tubing with very similar characteristics, {{but in addition}} to brazing, can also be welded. The 520 tubing can often be seen on modern [...] "fixie" [...] bikes (urban [...] "track" [...] type bike frames), while the 525 with its thicker-walled seat stays is more for cyclo-cross and touring <b>framesets.</b>|$|R
50|$|HTML 4 defined three {{different}} versions of the language: Strict, Transitional (once called Loose) and <b>Frameset.</b> The Strict version is intended for new documents and is considered best practice, while the Transitional and <b>Frameset</b> versions were developed {{to make it easier to}} transition documents that conformed to older HTML specification or didn't conform to any specification to a version of HTML 4. The Transitional and <b>Frameset</b> versions allow for presentational markup, which is omitted in the Strict version. Instead, cascading style sheets are encouraged to improve the presentation of HTML documents. Because XHTML 1 only defines an XML syntax for the language defined by HTML 4, the same differences apply to XHTML 1 as well.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an automatic Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system that disambiguates verb senses using syntactic and semantic features that encode information about predicate arguments and semantic classes. Our system performs {{at the best}} published accuracy on the English verbs of Senseval- 2. We also experiment with using the gold-standard predicate-argument labels from PropBank for disambiguating fine-grained WordNet senses and course-grained PropBank <b>framesets,</b> and show that disambiguation of verb senses can be further improved with better extraction of semantic roles...|$|R
50|$|Kestrel pioneered {{carbon fiber}} frame design with the world's very first all-carbon bicycle frame in 1986, based {{again on the}} first-ever Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of bicycle frame {{structure}} conducted in 1986. Kestrel set new standards again in 1989, with {{the launch of the}} first carbon fork and the debut of the KM40 Airfoil, the first true aero triathlon frame.Carbon <b>framesets</b> by better-known, mainstream manufacturers such as Giant and, most notably, Trek (with its OCLV frames), have been directly influenced by Kestrel design principles.|$|R
50|$|While Kogswell did {{not produce}} custom bicycle frames to the {{specific}} requirements of individual customers, Grimm and Kogswell Cycles actively solicited design input {{from members of the}} Kogswell Owners Group, an interactive community of people who own one or more Kogswells or are considering purchasing one. Design decisions regarding available frame sizes, wheel sizes, and other specifications were often discussed extensively within this forum prior to corporate decisions being made. As of 2016, the group was still active and Kogswell <b>framesets</b> and complete bicycles were still being bought and sold among enthusiasts.|$|R
