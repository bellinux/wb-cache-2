40|$|Abstract Background Africa {{continues}} {{to bear a}} disproportionate share of the global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria burden. The development and distribution of safe, effective and affordable vaccines is critical to reduce these epidemics. However, conducting HIV/AIDS, TB, and/or malaria vaccine trials simultaneously in developing countries, or in populations affected by all three diseases, is likely to result in numerous ethical challenges. Methods In order to explore convergent ethical issues in HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria vaccine trials in Africa, the Ethics, Law and Human Rights Collaborating Centre of the WHO/UNAIDS African AIDS Vaccine Programme hosted a consultation on the Convergent Ethical Issues in HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria Vaccine Trials in Africa in Durban, South Africa on the 10 - 11 February 2009. Results <b>Key</b> <b>cross</b> cutting ethical issues were prioritized during the consultation as community engagement; ancillary care obligations; care and treatment; informed consent; and resource sharing. Conclusion The consultation revealed that while there have been few attempts to find convergence on ethical issues between HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria vaccine trial fields to date, there is much common ground and scope for convergence work between stakeholders in the three fields. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} convergence, defined either narrowly, through {{productivity}} or income per capita, or broadly, across {{a range of}} economic variables, has become fundamental to the way we assess, analyse and project economic growth in developing economies. To the extent that economic growth projections are designed to reflect empirical behaviour, {{there is a need to}} identify relationships between and within key projection variables. To date the empirical analysis of convergence has been controversial. There is a strong argument that economic growth should be projection at a detailed sectoral level (see McKibbin et al (2009)). In practice, data limitations mean that industry level relationships are difficult to uncover and macroeconomic aggregate behaviours are often imposed on disaggregated data. The analysis in this paper attempts to uncover the <b>key</b> <b>cross</b> country trends in sectoral level productivity data. Whilst productivity convergence is evident in some sectors, generally service sectors, it is not evident in others. In part, aggregate convergence trends across developed economies appear to be driven by structural change. We generalise this result and argue that a combination of convergence and structural development assumptions could improve the empirical relevance of economic growth projection models. ...|$|E

However, the impact of culture, positive and negative, on management development programmes is often recognised, but not formally addressed. The cultural diversity of students undertaking management development programmes, such as an MBA, presents great opportunities to business school educators to facilitate the development of vital cross cultural management skills. Management development programmes traditionally address interpersonal skills development. However, based on our experience presented here, providing training to develop cross cultural skills specifically will be of growing importance to students, business schools and multinational companies, as they consider the effectiveness of management development programmes. This article sets out several of the <b>key</b> <b>cross</b> cultural issues which we have identified as relevant to management development programmes {{in an attempt to}} highlight the important impact of culture on students and teaching practice. These issues include teaching methods, tutor/student and peer group feedback, working in groups and cultural approaches to learning.

40|$|AbstractThe {{internal}} flow patterns of a volute-type discharge passage were investigated in a mixed-flow pumping {{system based on}} CFD by using the RNGturbulence model to close the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. According to the numerical analysis of the {{internal flow}}, the hydraulic characteristics of the volute-type discharge passage and the velocity distribution features in several <b>key</b> <b>cross</b> sections were analyzed and quantitatively calculated in terms of velocity distribution uniformity and bias angle. The computed {{results show that the}} internal flow field is very complicated involving flow separation and vortex in some regions and the velocity distribution is uneven. The uniformity curves of axial velocities in the outlet cross-section of the volute and the outlet cross-section of the passage are protruding ones while the bias angle curves in the same cross-sections are concave ones, both of them reaching their maximum or minimum value respectively at the flow rate corresponding to the best efficiency point of the pumping system. The hydraulic loss of the volute-type discharge passage varies with the discharge and reaches its minimum when the pumping system efficiency approaches its highest. When the pumping system operates under off-design condition on the large flow rate side, the hydraulic loss of the passage tends to increase rapidly causing the pumping system efficiency to drop sharply. Therefore, appropriate regulation methods should be adopted to adjust the pump operating condition to ensure the pumping system working within high efficiency zone...|$|E

Methods: EGF {{was used as a}} ligand of EGFR to stimulate the gastric adenocarcinoma cell, SGC 7901. Signal molecules downstream of the integrin, FAK(Y 397) and p 130 cas(Y 410) phosphorylation, were measured by immunoprecipitation and western blot. Fibronectin (Fn) was used as a ligand of integrin to stimulate the same cell line. Signal molecules downstream of EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) general phosphorylation were also measured. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) small-interfering RNA was designed and transfected into SGC 7901 cells to decrease the expression of FAK. Modified Boyden chambers and MTT assay were used to examine the effect of FAK inhibition on the invasiveness and proliferation of SGC 7901. Results: EGF activated FAK(Y 397) and p 130 cas(Y 410) phosphorylation, while Fn activated ERK general phosphorylation. Inhibition of FAK expression decreased p 130 cas(Y 410) phosphorylation activated by EGF and ERK general phosphorylation activated by Fn, also decreased the invasiveness and proliferation of SGC 7901 cells activated by EGF or Fn.

40|$|Stress-controlled {{swelling}} {{tests are}} normally {{conducted in the}} laboratory to characterize the evolution of coal permeability {{under the influence of}} gas sorption. Typically reductions in permeability are observed from gas-sorption-induced swelling even where effective stresses remain constant. This behavior remains enigmatic as the permeability of the porous coal is determined by the effective stress only. When these observations were interpreted, a matchstick or cubic coal model was assumed. Under this assumption, matrix swelling would not affect coal permeability because of the complete separation between matrix blocks caused by through-going fractures. This is why current coal permeability models have little success in explaining this inconsistency. It is generally believed that the reason for the failure is the inconsistency between the experimental conditions and the model assumptions. However, in this paper, it is considered that the reason may be the internal actions between coal fractures and matrixes have not been taken into consideration. In this study, a model capable of replicating this apparently anomalous behavior is developed. We consider the interactions of the fractured coal mass where cleats do not create a full separation between adjacent matrix blocks but where solid rock bridges are present. We accommodate the role of swelling strains both over contact bridges that hold cleat faces apart but also over the non-contacting span between these bridges. The effects of swelling act competitively over these two components: increasing porosity and permeability due to swelling of the bridging contacts but reducing porosity and permeability due to the swelling of the intervening free-faces. Under these conditions, a new permeability model is formulated. The new model is the <b>key</b> <b>cross</b> link that couples the multiphysics of coal-gas interactions. The formulation and incorporation of this permeability model into the multiphysics simulation of coal-gas interactions are presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A human centric approach {{to the design of}} products and workplaces is essential to ensure the appropriate accommodation of the people who interact with such designs. Digital human models (DHM) in ergonomic simulation are commonly used within design and development to ensure product suitability. DHM for ergonomic simulation has improved in terms of its reliability and appearance in recent years. However, {{there appears to be a}} need to improve how the flesh of the DHM deformsaround the joint to support improved ergonomics simulations. Supported by data acquired through the use of a 3 D body scanner, this PhD research aimed to address this need by developing a methodology to simulate body deformation due to joint movements that suited the needs of ergonomics simulation. To anticipate the large scope of the research, this research focused on modelling a single joint: the elbow. To ensure the suitability of the proposed flesh deformation method a literature review and user study was performed to derive a set of DHM specifications. Six DHM specifications were proposed i. e. accuracy, realism, minimum user intervention, accommodating different body types and sizes, real time, and whole body modelling. An existing flesh deformation method (FDM) which had the potential to conform to the DHM specifications was determined and chosen to be developed further so that it matched the requirements of DHM for ergonomics simulation. The development resulted in a new FDM which required the provision of several elements to create a surface flesh deformation at the elbow. These were: five cross sections and their locations from four key postures (full extension, 135 ᵒ flexion, 90 ᵒ flexion and maximum flexion); the carrying angle; and perpendicular profiles from all of the four key postures. To avoid having to obtain these elements for every person for whom the elbow was to be modelled, a supporting data framework was developed. The framework utilised a database and a limited number of inputs (race, gender, BMI and a 3 D scan data of a fully extended arm) to predict the FDM s elements from which flesh deformation at the elbow was created. The database stored five <b>key</b> <b>cross</b> sections, profiles, a parameter for the carrying angle and a parameter of the locations of UAF, UAM, LAM for two race groups i. e., Caucasian and Asian. A total of 23 subjects (11 males and 12 females) were carefully chosen to represent a variety of height and body type for each race and gender. The algorithm for the new FDM and the framework is supplied in the accompanying CD. DHM specifications were utilised to review the suitability of the new FDM for ergonomics simulation. The review results showed that the new FDM had a level of error < 3 mm and was able to recreate flesh deformation around the elbow joint with a representative level of surface realism when compared to the 3 D scan data. The review result also showed that the new FDM was able to accommodate different body types and sizes with a slightly larger error, < 4 mm. The new FDM also demonstrated that it could be used to create flesh deformation with limited user intervention. A retrospective analysis for real time modelling and whole body modelling showed that the new FDM had a potential to conform to these two specifications. The overall result of the review demonstrated that the new FDM and framework had the potential to suit ergonomics simulation. The thesis has made a contribution to the field of DHM research for ergonomics simulation by proposing a flesh deformation approach for the elbow that allows the integration of carrying angle; and was built based on specification for the use of DHM s in ergonomics simulation and the utilisation of 3 D scan data...|$|E
