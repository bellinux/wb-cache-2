40|$|Localized {{magnetic}} {{moments with}} crystal-field doublet or pseudo-spin 1 / 2 may arise in correlated insulators with even number of electrons and strong spin-orbit coupling. Such a non-Kramers pseudo-spin 1 / 2 is {{the consequence of}} crystalline symmetries {{as opposed to the}} Kramers doublet arising from time-reversal invariance, and is necessarily a composite of spin and orbital degrees of freedom. We investigate possible spin-orbital liquids with fermionic spinons for such non-Kramers pseudo-spin 1 / 2 systems on the Kagome lattice. Using the projective symmetry group analysis, we find ten new phases that are not allowed in the corresponding <b>Kramers</b> <b>systems.</b> These new phases are allowed due to unusual action of the time reversal operation on non-Kramers pseudo-spins. We compute the spin-spin dynamic structure factor that shows characteristic features of these non-Kramers spin-orbital liquids arising from their unusual coupling to neutrons, which is therefore relevant for neutron scattering experiments. We also point out possible anomalous broadening of Raman scattering intensity that may serve as a signature experimental feature for gapless non-Kramers spin-orbital liquids.

40|$|We {{study the}} spin-phonon {{relaxation}} rate of both Kramers and non-Kramers molecular magnets in strongly diluted samples at low temperature. Using the "rotational" {{contribution to the}} spin-phonon Hamiltonian, universal formulae for the relaxation rate are obtained. Intriguingly, these formulae are all entirely expressed via measurable or ab initio computable physical quantities. Moreover, they are also independent of the energy gaps to excited states involved in the relaxation process. These obtained expressions for direct and Raman processes offer {{an easy way to}} determine the lowest limit of the spin-phonon relaxation of any spin system based on magnetic properties of the ground doublet only. In addition, some intriguing properties of Raman process are also found. Particularly, Raman process in <b>Kramers</b> <b>system</b> is found dependent on the magnetic field's orientation but independent of its magnitude, meanwhile the same process in non-Kramers system is significantly reduced out of resonance, i. e. for an applied external field. Interestingly, Raman process is demonstrated to vary as T^ 9 for both systems. Application of the theory to a recently investigated cobalt(II) complex shows that it can provide a reasonably good description for the relaxation. Based on these findings, a strategy in developing efficient single-molecule magnets by enhancing the mechanical rigidity of the molecular unit is proposed. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{two different}} techniques for efficient control of slip energy in a slip-ring induction machine. The static <b>Kramer</b> <b>system</b> merely recovers slip power and returns {{it to the}} a. c. supply. As a result only sub-synchronous motoring or super-synchronous generating is possible. In the static Scherbius system, however, the slip power can be controlled both {{into and out of}} the secondary circuit. This allows the machine to operate as a motor and generator at both sub- and super-synchronous speeds. For wide speed range operation a current source inverter was used as this can inherently provide reversal of power flow. The operating requirements for the current source inverter operating in the secondary circuit of an induction machine have been determined. These considerations show that the current source inverter control signal must be synchronised to the secondary e. m. f. of the machine. The machine can then operate in a stable manner over a very wide speed range. The conventional analysis of the current source inverter has been developed to include the effect of the secondary slip e. m. f. which is shown to have a major effect on the commutation behaviour of the inverter. The action of the commutation circuit is affected by the phase angle between the secondary current and the slip e. m. f. This angle can be controlled electronically and the effect of this has been predicted and observed. A detailed study of the <b>Kramer</b> <b>system</b> has included analysis of the d. c. link current waveform including Fourier harmonic prediction in terms of the circuit parameters and the operating slip. The operation of the Kramer and Scherbius systems has been studied for both motoring and generating modes of the induction machine and their relative merits have been compared. In particular the novel idea of using the Scherbius system for variable speed wind energy recovery has been considered and reported in a published paper. Finally suggestions have been made for further work particularly for application to wind energy recovery...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} verification of a novel sensorless control scheme for a super synchronous slip ring induction machine (SRIM). The novel scheme overcomes {{the limitations of the}} encoder-based system, with a reduced cost.;This research re-utilised a LUED slip power facility, previously funded by SERC in the 80 s.;The SRIM uses a conventional current source inverter (CSI) connected between the supply and the rotor windings. Two techniques of slip power recovery, the Kramer and the Scherbius system, are discussed. The <b>Kramer</b> <b>system</b> recovers slip power to the supply. The Scherbius system is capable of four-quadrant operation, with the main advantage of twice the rated shaft output power when operating at twice the rated speed.;The CSI is investigated and its commutation problems studied. For stable operation the commutation sequence in the CSI is synchronised electrically with the varying rotor e. m. f. 's. When motoring sub-synchronously, or generating super-synchronously, the rotor e. m. f. 's are in the direction to aid the commutation process. However, when motoring super-synchronously or generating sub-synchronously, the rotor e. m. f. 's oppose commutation. These limit the performance of the CSI.;Provided the rotor terminal voltages are isolated from the mains, the rotor speed and phase information can be derived from the measured and filtered rotor terminal voltages. The derived signals can synchronise the CSI to the secondary e. m. f., thereby eliminating the need of an encoder. This novel scheme is different to the techniques known for cage type machines, and is not affected by the inherent machine parameter variations.;The SRIM harmonics are analysed. From which, a novel adaptive filter was developed to remove the rotor speed dependent harmonics and to track the varying e. m. f. with negligible phase delay. The filter and the scheme were verified using an analogue method, although a DSP system may provide better flexibility...|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{response of}} a Kramers doublet is analyzed {{in a general}} case taking into account only the formal properties derived from time reversal operation. It leads to a definition of a matrix G (gyromagnetic matrix) whose expression depends on the chosen reference frame and on the Kramers conjugate basis {{used to describe the}} physical system. It is shown that there exists a reference frame and a suitable Kramers conjugate basis that gives a diagonal form for the G-matrix with all non-null elements having the same sign. A detailed procedure for obtaining this canonical expression of G is presented when the electronic structure of the KD is known regardless the level of the used theory. This procedure provides a univocal way to compare the theoretical predictions with the experimental results obtained from a complete set of magnetic experiments. In this way the problems arising from ambiguities in the g-tensor definition are overcome. This procedure is extended to find a spin-Hamiltonian suitable for describing the magnetic behavior of a pair of weakly coupled <b>Kramers</b> <b>systems</b> in the multispin scheme when the interaction between the two moieties as well as the individual Zeeman interaction are small enough as compared with ligand field splitting. Explicit relations between the physical interaction and the parameters of such a spin-Hamiltonian are also obtained.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the quantum-mechanical geometric phase {{with a view}} toward time reversal symmetry considerations. The idea of time reversal in quantum mechanics is investigated, disagreements and inconsistencies in the literature are examined, and {{the action of the}} time reversal operator is extended to time-dependent Hamiltonians. With this background, and using a definition of time reversal symmetry based on the evolution operator, I demonstrate that the existence of a non-zero geometric phase can in all cases be attributed to a breakdown of time reversal symmetry in some form. This result holds for both adiabatic and nonadiabatic evolutions, and for arbitrary dimensional parameter spaces. I explore the role of the geometric phase in a two-level <b>Kramers</b> <b>system</b> described by a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian such that the two levels can become degenerate for some value of the parameters, and discuss, from a mathematical point of view, the monopole geometric potential that results. I then extend this analysis by considering a pair of Kramers doublets, each doublet degenerate due to time reversal symmetry, where the parameters can be chosen so that each of the pair of doublets becomes degenerate with the other. I find the explicit functional forms for the two resulting nonabelian geometric gauge potentials and show that they can be identified exactly with the only two gauge-inequivalent SU(2) monopole potentials of Yang. Furthermore, following a conformal transformation these potentials can be mapped to those of the SU(2) instanton/anti-instanton pair. Finally I examine the relevance of the geometric phase to the molecular physics of time-odd systems. Time-odd coupling in molecular physics is a much under-studied area, with many potentially interesting results. Specifically I study time-odd coupling in Jahn-Teller systems under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the electronic position states are coupled to the lattice momentum rather than the usual time-even lattice position. As an example I solve the E ⊗ (b₁ ⊕ b₂ ⊕ a₂) Jahn-Teller system exactly, showing that once again monopole-like geometric potentials arise, and comment on how this affects the angular momentum of the lattice subsystem...|$|R

For the non-Kramers doublets such as Pr^ 3 + and Tb^ 3 +, we {{point out that}} the inelastic neutron scattering not only detects the low-energy gauge photon, but also contains the continuum of the "magnetic monopole" excitations. Unlike the spinons, these "magnetic monopoles" are purely of quantum origin and have no classical analogue. We further {{point out that the}} "magnetic monopole" experiences a background dual "π" flux due to the spin- 1 / 2 nature of the local moment when the "monopole" hops on the dual diamond lattice. We then predict that the "monopole" continuum has an enhanced spectral periodicity. This prediction can be examined among the existing data on the non-Kramers doublet spin liquid candidate materials like Pr_ 2 TM_ 2 O_ 7 and Tb_ 2 TM_ 2 O_ 7 (with TM = "transition metal").

40|$|Harmonic {{analysis}} in power systems {{is a challenge}} that is always evolving due to a constantly changing power grid. Advances in power electronics {{have led to the}} installation of many new non-linear power loads, such as power converters, arc furnaces and motor drive systems, which in turn change the existing infrastructure and inject new types of harmonics. This study analyzes a static <b>Kramer</b> drive <b>system</b> for its harmonic behavior. The system is broken down component-by-component and analyzed. The {{analysis in}}cludes classical harmonics of integer multiple of the fundamental frequency as well as sub-harmonics and interharmonics. This paper shows that there are significant harmonic issues in a static Kramer drive that are likely to be present in similar drive systems. Due to the unknown frequencies at which interharmonics and sub-harmonics arise it is difficult to estimate the magnitude and phase of these harmonics. It is proposed that state estimation techniques such as digital filtering coupled with windowing techniques can be used to properly pinpoint the frequency components, magnitudes and phases of harmonics, interharmonics and sub-harmonics in the motor drive systems. Once identified, the harmonics, interharmonics and sub-harmonics can be eliminated by means of passive filtering or self-tuning active filtering. The optimal methods of estimation of harmonics, interharmonics and sub-harmonics will be both developed analytically and through the means of simulation with the use of CAD tools such as PSCAD and MATLAB. The development of the optimal techniques for estimation of harmonics, interharmonics and sub-harmonics for that static Kramer drive will aid in estimation of harmonics, interharmonics and sub-harmonics in similar motor drive systems...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn modern {{societies}} {{the process}} of communication is greatly influenced by information technology and computer systems. Social interactions in both real-life and cyber communities are frequently being shaped by two main features of social computing tools: (1) sharing {{great deal of information}} with whole groups of consumers, and (2) deriving collective intelligence by collaborative information evaluation, discussion, annotation, etc. The latter is further supported by reasoning mechanisms implemented in software to derive more pertinent and synthesized information for its consumers, e. g. recommendations. In consequence, communities are empowered to make more than ever informed conclusions and decisions. In our work we consider situations that people find themselves in, as pieces of information frequently driving decision making in classical human relations.

40|$|Photochemical {{control of}} {{neuronal}} activity: methods and clinical applicationby Ivan TochitskyDoctor of Philosophy in Molecular and Cell BiologyUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Richard <b>Kramer,</b> ChairMammalian nervous <b>systems</b> are incredibly complex, with almost 100 billion neurons {{making up the}} human brain. Neurons in the brain primarily {{communicate with one another}} {{in one of two ways}} - electrically, via the flow of ions across the cell membrane, or chemically by releasing and detecting a variety of signaling molecules. In order to understand the function of the nervous system, we need to be able to manipulate it with high spatial and temporal precision. Conventional electrical or chemical stimuli do not allow for such precise control. Thus, a new and orthogonal stimulus modality had to be utilized in order to facilitate the study of the nervous system. The emerging field of optogenetics uses light as such a stimulus since light can be delivered only to a small part of the nervous system, or even a single neuron, and the illumination can be controlled with millisecond time resolution. Optogenetic techniques involve the expression of light-sensitive proteins from microbes in genetically targeted populations of neurons, rendering those neurons sensitive to light. Recent advances in optogenetics have greatly advanced our understanding of the function of the nervous system both in healthy organisms, and in the context of disease. Optogenetics is a powerful technique for investigating neural networks, but this approach primarily studies the function of the nervous system at a system rather than molecular level. The vast complexity of the human brain is created not only by the large number of individual neurons and the intricate connections between them, but also by the dizzying variety of proteins found in the cell membranes of these neurons. These proteins sense and respond to the release of chemical signaling molecules from neighboring cells, or changes in ion concentrations that alter the cell's membrane potential, allowing for the generation and propagation of electrical signals. We have combined the powers of synthetic chemistry and genetics to develop novel optopharmacological or optochemical genetic methods which enable precise optical control of neuronal function at the molecular level. These strategies involves the generation of light-sensitive "photoswitch" molecules that selectively target a population of either genetically engineered or endogenous membrane proteins - including receptors sensing chemical stimuli, or ion channels responding to electrical potential changes in the cell. The addition of a photoswitch compound to a neuron expressing the target protein makes that protein, and, by extension, the neuron, sensitive to light. We first applied this strategy to generate light regulated neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are a group of proteins that respond to the chemical neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These receptors modulate the activity of other neurons in different parts of the brain and are also sensitive to nicotine, an addictive chemical found in tobacco products. The function of acetylcholine receptors in the brain and their role in nicotine addiction, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders is not fully understood, in large part because it quite difficult to chemically manipulate individual receptors without affecting others. Making light-sensitive, genetically targeted acetylcholine receptors should thus greatly advance our understanding of those receptors' function. The main rationale for making proteins or neurons light-sensitive is to facilitate the study of the healthy nervous system as well as its malfunction in disease. There are, however, several human diseases where optical methods for controlling neuronal activity could directly provide a clinical benefit. Degenerative blinding diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa or age-related macular degeneration leave the retinas of affected patients either partly or completely insensitive to light by causing the death of light-detecting photoreceptor cells in the eye. Light responses can be restored to a blind retina by making some or all of the remaining retinal neurons sensitive to light. This can be achieved via the expression of light sensitive microbial opsins or engineered receptors in retinal neurons that are not normally light sensitive. Both of these approaches have restored some visual perception to blind mice suffering from retinitis pigmentosa. However, in order to use either optogenetic or optochemical genetic tools in the clinic, the mutant proteins must be artificially expressed in the patient's retina, which requires the use of viral gene therapy. Gene therapy has potential health risks, so we decided to develop a treatment for blinding diseases that would only involve a light-sensitive chemical, without the need for gene therapy or invasive surgery. To that end, we have developed an optopharmacological therapy for vision restoration by creating photoswitch molecules that block and unblock endogenous voltage-gated ion channels in a light-dependent manner, allowing us to control almost any neuron with light. The first photoswitch tested, called AAQ, restored electrical retinal light responses, the pupillary light reflex, as well as other simple visual behaviors in blind mice. In order to optimize this treatment for clinical use, we generated a compound called DENAQ with improved light sensitivity and persistence in the eye, which responds to broad spectrum white light, similar to what people encounter in natural visual scenes. Furthermore, DENAQ acts selectively on retinas suffering from photoreceptor cell death, but leaves healthy retinas unaffected. This selectivity raises the possibility that we may be able to treat not only patients who are completely blind, but also those suffering from partial vision loss, by restoring light sensitivity only to the parts of the retina experiencing photoreceptor degeneration. The promising preliminary results from animal studies suggest that our optopharmacological strategy for vision restoration may eventually be used in the clinic, in addition to helping researchers understand the function of the nervous system in its normal state and in disease...|$|R
