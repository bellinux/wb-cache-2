40|$|This {{research}} {{was focused on}} investigating the fire performance of LSF wall systems by using 3 -D heat transfer <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> of existing LSF wall system configurations. The analysis results were validated by using the available fire test results of five different LSF wall configurations. The validated <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> were then used to conduct a parametric study {{on a range of}} non-load bearing and load bearing LSF wall configurations to predict their fire resistance levels (FRLs) for varying load ratios.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> of lung motion can aid in {{understanding}} mechanically driven lung deformation. Current <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> consider each lung half as a continuum, lacking {{the ability to}} capture the displacement discontinuity at fissures caused by lobe sliding. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop and evaluate <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> for simulating lung motion that incorporate the role of sliding at the lobe boundaries. METHODS: <b>Finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> were developed from 4 DCT of tidal breathing from five cancer subjects. To allow sliding, the lobes were modeled as independent bodies within a pleural cavity shell. Pleural cavity deformation was obtained from deformable image registration of the lung segmentations. Contact between the pleural cavity and lobes prevented penetration and allowed sliding at all interfaces. Lung parenchyma was modeled as a homogeneous, 2 -parameter, Neo-Hookean finite elastic model. The parameters of the Neo-Hookean model, C 1 and D 1, were optimized by perturbation within realistic reported ranges; defined by the equivalent infinitesimal elasticity parameters: Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus (from 0. 7 kPa to 70 kPa) and ν (from 0. 2 to 0. 49). The frictional coefficient at fissures was perturbed between 0 (free sliding) and 1. 5 (no sliding). 1, 960 <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> analyses were performed across the five subjects. The optimal parameter ranges were evaluated by average landmark error and percentage of converged solutions. The developed <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> method, using optimized material and friction parameters, was further evaluated in a data set of six healthy subjects with image pairs spanning functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (TLC). The <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> predicted displacement field for lobe sliding <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> and continuum-based <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> were compared using average landmark error and correlation with the lobe-by-lobe deformable image registration results. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The optimal parameters for Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus were 49 kPa to 70 kPa and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio were 0. 2 to 0. 4. Variation of inter-lobar frictional coefficients did change displacement field accuracy assessed by landmark error or correlation to lobe-by-lobe deformable image registration. Characteristics of sliding predicted by the lobe sliding <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> were consistent with characteristics in sliding observed in deformable image registration results. Also, variations in regional ventilation, quantified at the lobe level, were predicted by the <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> and were shown {{to be influenced by}} the amount of lobe sliding allowed by the models...|$|R
