2500|$|Every quasigroup <b>is</b> isotopic to <b>a</b> loop. If <b>a</b> loop <b>is</b> isotopic to <b>a</b> <b>group,</b> then it <b>is</b> {{isomorphic}} to {{that group}} and thus <b>is</b> itself <b>a</b> <b>group.</b> However, <b>a</b> quasigroup which <b>is</b> isotopic to <b>a</b> <b>group</b> need not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>group.</b> For example, the quasigroup on R with multiplication given by [...] is isotopic to the additive group , but <b>is</b> not itself <b>a</b> <b>group.</b> Every medial quasigroup <b>is</b> isotopic to <b>an</b> abelian <b>group</b> by the Bruck–Toyoda theorem.|$|R

5|$|A {{haplotype}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> {{of genes}} {{found in an}} organism that is inherited from one of its parents. A haplogroup <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. The mDNA haplotypes of the golden jackal form two haplogroups: the oldest haplogroup is formed by golden jackals from India, and the other, younger, haplogroup diverging from this includes golden jackals {{from all of the}} other regions. Indian golden jackals exhibit the highest genetic diversity, and those from northern and western India are the most basal, which indicates that India was the center from which golden jackals spread. The extant golden jackal lineage commenced expanding its population in India 37,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, the warmer regions of India and Southeast Asia provided a refuge when compared with the surrounding areas. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum {{and the beginning of the}} warming cycles, the golden jackal lineage expanded out of India and into Eurasia to reach the Middle East and Europe.|$|E
