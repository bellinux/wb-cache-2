According to Stauffer, [...] "the disarming deflation of the passage {{goes a long way}} toward redeeming it, and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrator's style". Tom Pocock in Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire has also highlighted the [...] "literary framework" [...] that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare, and Classical literature to imbue the story with a [...] "Gothic sensibility". Yet as Stauffer notes, [...] "Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.|$|E

2500|$|Affected {{people often}} report {{that while they}} do not <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> until the early morning, they do fall asleep {{around the same time}} every day. Unless they have another sleep {{disorder}} such as sleep apnea in addition to DSPD, patients can sleep well and have a normal need for sleep. However, they find it very difficult to wake up in time for a typical school or work day. If they are allowed to follow their own schedules, e.g. sleeping from 3:00am to 12:00 noon, their sleep is improved and they may not experience excessive daytime sleepiness. Attempting to force oneself onto daytime society's schedule with DSPD has been compared to constantly living with jet lag; DSPD has, in fact, been referred to as [...] "social jet lag".|$|E

Guillaume de Fondaumière called her a [...] "strong character", also defending the striptease due to intending on making the player feel uncomfortable.

5000|$|Sara {{has been}} {{pioneering}} empirical {{research on the}} sociology of sleep since 2001. Recent research was done through SomnIA (Sleep in Ageing), a four-year collaborative research project including researchers from sociology, psychology, neuroendocrinology, engineering, nursing and medicine. The SomnIA research covered various aspects of quality of sleep including amongst older people in care homes. Professor Arber has analysed survey data on the sleeping habits of 14,000 households finding that one in 10 people are using medication <b>to</b> assist in <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and women have more problems <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> than men.She has also researched [...] "The biomedical and sociological effects of sleep restriction" [...] for an EU Marie Curie research project focused {{on the effects of}} lack of sleep on health and wellbeing.|$|R

In his 31 December 2010 interview for The Sun, Ant also discussed the side effects of medication for his bipolar condition: [...] "In the past I've been a robot. It's been an out-of-body experience. Bipolar means up and down and that's me... Music has always been the best medication. I was on sodium valproate for seven years.... I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and I didn't make love for seven years. My hair fell out and I couldn't pick up a book as I couldn't concentrate. I didn't write a song or pick up a guitar in that time – and piled on the weight. I {{might as well have been}} dead. I work very closely with my GP and any decisions I make are made with him".

[...] Her first book at age 7 was a collection of drawings and stories about [...] "lucky girls...who got to go west in covered wagons." [...] Her favorite book as a child was The Little House by Virginia Lee Burton. [...] Tyler acknowledges that this book, which she read many times {{during this period of}} limited access to books, had a profound influence on her, showing [...] "how the years flowed by, people altered, and nothing could ever stay the same." [...] This early perception of changes over time is a theme that reappears in many of her novels decades later, just as The Little House itself appears in her novel Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant. [...] Tyler also describes reading Little Women 22 times as a child. When the Tyler family left Celo after four years to move to Raleigh, NC, 11-year-old Anne had never attended public school and never used a telephone. [...] This unorthodox upbringing enabled her to view [...] "the normal world {{with a certain amount of}} distance and surprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|As percussionist, vocalist, and writer, Conti {{performed}} with a then virtually unknown {{artist in the}} United States {{by the name of}} Donna Summer. This journey began in 1977 with an audition and an introduction to Donna by her musical director and Conti's close friend Michael Warren. Donna Summer {{went on to become the}} number one act in the world. Through his association with Donna, Conti met famed producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. After hearing Conti's percussion work (live and in the studio), Conti was asked to play on the soon to be double platinum Bad Girls album. He composed a song with Donna Summer on that album: [...] "Can't <b>Get</b> <b>To</b> <b>Sleep</b> at Night".
