5|$|After the war, Magoffin {{returned}} to his legal practice and engaged in agricultural pursuits in Harrodsburg. A series of land speculation ventures near Chicago, Illinois made him very wealthy.

5|$|Newspapers {{in major}} {{international}} cities and Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and socialist publications reported outrage about the verdict and strong criticism of American society. Southern newspapers, particularly in Mississippi, {{wrote that the}} court system had done its job. Till's story continued to make the news for weeks following the trial, especially sparking debate among Southern, Northern, and black newspapers, the NAACP and various high-profile segregationists about justice <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> the propriety of Jim Crow society.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican in {{a heavily}} Democratic state, Bradley found little success {{early in his}} {{political}} career. He was defeated for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate twice each. After rising to national prominence with his speech seconding the presidential nomination of Ulysses S. Grant at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he was nominated for governor in 1887. Although he lost the contest to Simon Bolivar Buckner, he reduced the usual Democratic majority substantially. He was again nominated for governor in 1895. Capitalizing on divisions in the Democratic Party over the issue of free silver, he defeated Parker Watkins Hardin in the general election. His term was marked by political struggles and violence. He was an advocate <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> did much to advance their status in the state, but was unable to enact much of his reform agenda because of a hostile Democratic majority in the state legislature.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{constitution}} of 1988 {{called for a}} general vote on {{the restoration of the}} monarchy, which was held in 1993. The royalists went to the polls divided, with the press indicating there were actually two princes aspiring to the Brazilian throne (Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragança and Dom João Henrique); this created some confusion among the voters. Voting tickets further divided the electorate by placing one box for a presidential republic on the ballot and four for a monarchy. Additional anti-monarchial sentiment was generated by several aggressive television commercials claiming that a vote for monarchy would be a vote for the return of slavery <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> a loss of Brazil's recent return to democracy after decades of military dictatorship. This result was a loss for the monarchists at the polls.|$|E
5|$|The later 19th {{century was}} a high point {{in the history of}} civil rights for African Americans. Reconstruction for a time limited the power of former slaveholders in Texas. Leaders, such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, worked to {{establish}} educational and employment opportunities <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> organize black voters to support the Republican Party, then the main party supporting black rights in the South. Cuney's efforts led to higher employment and higher wages for blacks in the city, especially on the wharves, and eventually led to combined black and white trade unions during the 1890s and early 1900s. Cuney himself rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party, the most powerful position held by any black American in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Meridian {{is served}} by the Meridian-Lauderdale County Public Library, located {{at the corner of}} 7th Street and 26th Avenue. The city {{originally}} had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African-American library was demolished on May 28, 2008.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent study}} {{indicated}} that black wages in the US have fluctuated between 70% and 80% of white wages for the entire period from 1954–1999, and that wage increases for {{that period of time}} <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> white women increased at half the rate of that of white males.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the National Park Service began {{planning}} the park facilities and envisioned separate provisions <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites.

In its transfer of the parkland to the federal government, Virginia initially attempted to ban African Americans entirely from the park, but settled for enforcing its segregation laws in the park's facilities.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by the {{founding}} of William Lloyd Garrison's newspaper, The Liberator, Nell decided to challenge race-based discrimination and segregation, as his father had done. Nell was particularly interested in encouraging the intellectual and social well-being of young African Americans. He was dedicated to integration and opposed the separate abolitionist organizations <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites. In his devotion to integration, he dismantled the abolitionist Massachusetts General Colored Association, which had been organized by his father.|$|E
25|$|The {{split between}} the Northern and Southern Baptist {{organizations}} arose over doctrinal issues pertaining to slavery and the education of slaves. At {{the time of the}} split, the Southern Baptist group used the curse of Cain as a justification for slavery. Some 19th- and 20th-century Baptist ministers in the Southern United States taught the belief that there were two separate heavens; one <b>for</b> <b>blacks,</b> <b>and</b> one for whites. Southern Baptists have either taught or practiced various forms of racial segregation well into the mid-to-late-20th century, though members of all races were accepted at worship services.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the former Confederate states had adopted new constitutions and electoral laws that {{effectively}} disenfranchised black voters and, in Alabama, many poor white voters as well. Under the white-established Jim Crow laws, passed after Democrats regained control of southern legislatures, racial segregation was imposed in public facilities and retail stores in the South, including public transportation. Bus and train companies enforced seating policies with separate sections <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites. School bus transportation was unavailable in any form for black schoolchildren in the South, and black education was always underfunded.|$|E
25|$|Under the Military Reconstruction Act, Congress {{declared}} Arkansas {{restored to}} the Union in June 1868, after the Legislature accepted the 14th Amendment. The Republican-controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though temporarily disfranchising former Confederate Army officers, who were all Democrats), a public education system <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites, and passed general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The State soon came under control of the Radical Republicans and Unionists, and led by Governor Powell Clayton, they presided over {{a time of great}} upheaval as Confederate sympathizers and the Ku Klux Klan fought the new developments, particularly voting rights for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, most Cuban {{children}} were not in school. 87 percent of urban homes had electricity, but only 10 percent of rural homes did. Only 15 percent of rural homes had running water. Nearly half the rural population was illiterate as was about 25 {{percent of the total}} population. Poverty and unemployment in rural areas triggered migration to Havana despite high levels of crime and prostitution in Cuba. More than 40 percent of the Cuban workforce in 1958 were either underemployed or unemployed. Schools <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> mulattoes were inferior to those for whites. Afro-Cubans had the worst living conditions and held the lowest paid jobs.|$|E

Anthony and Lucretia Mott, who also worked for the right to vote <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> women, against slavery, and for safe passage of refugee slaves. Harriet and her sister Margaretta were key {{organizers}} of the Fifth National Women's Rights Convention in Philadelphia in 1854. Harriet's daughter, Hattie became the first African American vice president of the organization. Harriet's sisters and Charlotte were also first generation suffragists. Other black women who worked for women's right to vote included Sojourner Truth, Amelia Shadd, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Nancy Prince, and Francis Ellen Watkins Harper.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} decades after Reconstruction, when white Democrats regained power in the state legislatures, they began to make voter {{registration}} more complicated, to reduce black voting. With a combination of intimidation, fraud and violence by paramilitary groups, they suppressed black voting and turned Republicans out of office. From 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised most black voters and many poor white voters. This disfranchisement persisted for six decades into the 20th century, depriving blacks and poor whites of all political representation. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries. They {{had no one to}} represent their interests, resulting in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services, such as schools, <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> poor whites.|$|E
25|$|The Rhodesian economy {{experienced}} a modest {{boom in the}} early 1970s. Real per capita earnings <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites reached record highs, although the disparity in incomes {{between blacks and whites}} remained, with blacks earning only about one-tenth as much as whites. After 1975, however, Rhodesia's economy was undermined by the cumulative effects of sanctions, declining earnings from commodity exports, worsening guerilla conflict, and increasing white emigration. When Mozambique severed economic ties, the Ian Smith regime was forced to depend on South Africa for access to the outside world. Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined between 1974 and 1979, before full independence in 1980. An increasing proportion of the national budget, an estimated 30%–40% per year, was allocated to defence, and a large budget deficit raised the public debt burden substantially.|$|E
