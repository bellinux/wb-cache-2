5|$|It {{has been}} held in the UK that when a public {{authority}} exercises a statutory power {{for a number of}} purposes, some of which are unlawful, the applicable test for <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> the authority acted illegally is whether the unlawful purpose is incidental to the exercise of the power or if the dominant purpose is itself unlawful.

5|$|O'Connor {{made two}} {{arguments}} for the dissenting justices: that predisposition was proven {{by the fact}} that Jacobson had ordered materials both times he was actually solicited, and that the Court had usurped the jury's rightful role in <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> he was entrapped.

The building allows single departments to stay together on the same floor, while in a Center City skyscraper departments would likely have to be spread out over several floors.|$|E
5|$|In United States federal courts, {{a circuit}} split occurs when {{two or more}} {{different}} circuit courts of appeals provide conflicting rulings on the same legal issue. The existence of a circuit split {{is one of the}} factors that the Supreme Court of the United States considers when <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> to grant review of a case.

While Jack is <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> or not he will stand up to his new bosses, Karen (Megan Mullally) desires a baby of her own.

5|$|Wang tiles are squares {{coloured}} on each edge, {{and placed}} so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles {{have the same}} colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be represented {{as a set of}} Wang dominoes that tile the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.|$|E

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} in <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> {{to prescribe}} an antibiotic {{to a person}} with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
5|$|At the time, 404 {{would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach their target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing carefully at first before <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped the ball in the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes, Australia had only made 0/10.|$|E
5|$|During the 1992 campaign, it was {{revealed}} that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.|$|E

5|$|Internally, {{his policy}} was {{enforced}} through Ministry control of TV and radio and through censorship of newspapers. From 31 December 1965, the Ministry of Information expanded its brief and was renamed the Ministry of Information, Immigration and Tourism, {{which meant that}} it was also responsible for <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> to grant or revoke permits to visit Rhodesia. Several foreign journalists were expelled: John Worrall, correspondent for The Guardian, went in January 1969. The Rhodesia Herald, then in opposition to both the Rhodesian Front and UDI, frequently appeared with large white spaces on its news pages where censored stories had been placed. Stories and editorials personally critical of Van der Byl were immediately removed.|$|E
5|$|King Henry's Articles, {{signed by}} each king since 1573, {{required}} the king {{to call a}} general sejm (lasting six weeks) every two years, and provisions for an extraordinary sejm (Polish: sejm ekstraordynaryjny, nadzwyczajny) that was to last two weeks were also set down in this act. Extraordinary sejms could be called in times of national emergency, for example a sejm <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> to call pospolite ruszenie (a general call to arms) {{in response to an}} invasion.
