The HERC2 variation for blue eyes first appears around 13,000 to 14,000 years ago in Italy and the Caucasus.|$|E

25|$|Neu-Isenburg {{was one of}} {{the planned}} towns of the 17th and 18th centuries. The {{settlers}} at first worked at farming, but later turned back to the handicraft trades that they had learnt, such as the stocking knitter’s craft, thereby laying the groundwork for Neu-Isenburg’s economic development. The surrounding communities <b>eyed</b> <b>the</b> French settlers with great mistrust and called the town welsches Dorf (the German word welsch refers to peoples who speak Romance languages, especially French; it is cognate with the English word Welsh, but does not have the same meaning).|$|E
25|$|Previously aired {{episodes of}} Monk began airing on NBC Universal sibling network NBC April 6, 2008.

Ratings for the broadcast debut were well below NBC averages for the time period. The show came in third behind Big Brother 9 on CBS and Oprah's Big Give on ABC.|$|E

The rule of King Mekuti of the House of Mone had been resisted by King Setthathirath of Lan Xang, grandson of King Ketklao of Lan Na. When Bayinnaung and his armies showed up at the gates of Chiang Mai on 31 March 1558, Mekuti surrendered without a fight on 2 April 1558. The Burmese king allowed Mekuti to remain ruler of Lan Na, and brought several artisans, many of whom were notable lacquerware workers, back to Pegu. He left a small garrison of 1000 men commanded by Binnya Dala and Binnya Set at Chiang Mai.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Italian naval strategists <b>eyed</b> <b>the</b> port of Vlorë (Valona in Italian) and {{the island}} of Sazan (Saseno) at the {{entrance}} to the Bay of Vlorë. The port would give Italy control of the entrance to the Adriatic Sea. Also, Albania could provide Italy with a beachhead in the Balkans. Before World War I Italy and Austria-Hungary had been instrumental in the creation of an independent Albanian state. At the outbreak of war in 1915, Italy seized the chance to occupy the southern half of Albania, to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from capturing. That success did not last long, as post-war domestic problems, defeat in the Vlora War, and pressure from US President Woodrow Wilson, forced Italy to pull out in 1920. But Italy retained the island of Saseno, in front of Valona, that was annexed to the Province of Zara in Italian Dalmatia.|$|E

When Ferrara asked about the robbery, Donati said he [...] "buried the stuff" [...] and would find a way to negotiate his release. Donati was murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars.|$|E

2500|$|In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{there was}} a [...] "gentlemen's agreement" [...] not to build any {{structure}} in Center City higher than the statue of William Penn on top of Philadelphia City Hall. The tradition lasted until the 1980s when developer Willard G. Rouse III of Rouse & Associates announced {{plans to build a}}n office building complex that included two towers taller than City Hall. Prior to any development plans, Rouse wanted to acquire prime real estate in Philadelphia and he eyed a block in Center City occupied by parking lots and several small buildings. The Oliver Tyrone Pulver Corp. also <b>eyed</b> <b>the</b> land for development and the company and Rouse both vied for the block of land by buying small lots throughout the site. Neither developer was able to acquire enough contiguous space to build a large office building, so after a lawsuit and failed negotiations, the two developers agreed to an organized bidding war for each other's properties. Under the rules agreed upon, the highest bidder would get the option to buy the other's property. Rouse won the auction in 1983 for an undisclosed amount. Originally, Rouse envisioned a $US150 million 38-story skyscraper but on April 5, 1984 Rouse officially announced his plans to build a complex that would include two office towers, one 65 stories the other 55 stories, a hotel, and retail space. Rumors and local lore speculate Rouse spent so much money buying the land that he had to build something that justified the expense.|$|E
