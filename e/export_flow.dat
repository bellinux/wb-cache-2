50|$|Spent {{batteries}} that Americans turn in to {{be recycled}} are increasingly being sent to Mexico, where the lead inside them is extracted by crude methods that are illegal in the United States. This increased <b>export</b> <b>flow</b> {{is a result of}} strict new Environmental Protection Agency standards on lead pollution, which make domestic recycling more difficult and expensive in the United States, but do not prohibit companies from exporting the work and danger to countries where environmental standards are low and enforcement is lax. In this sense, Mexico is becoming a pollution haven for the United States battery industry because Mexican environmental officials acknowledge that they lack the money, manpower, and technical capacity to police the flow. According to the New York Times, 20% of spent American vehicle and industrial batteries are now exported to Mexico, up from 6% in 2007, meaning that approximately 20 million batteries will cross the border this year. A significant proportion of this flow is smuggled in after being mislabeled as metal scrap.|$|E

The study sought to estimate the coefficients of the gravity equation. The estimated coefficients were used to estimate merchandise export potentials and technical efficiency of each country in the sample and these were also aggregated to measure impact of country groups. Result of the estimated coefficients of the gravity equation shows that merchandise export flows of the Philippines to trading partners is significantly positively affected by income and market size of the importing partner. The income elasticity of merchandise exports is 0. 69 %. A 1 % increase in market size increases <b>export</b> <b>flow</b> by 0. 24 %. Distance was estimated to reduce <b>export</b> <b>flow</b> by 1. 22 % in every 1 % increase in distance. The technical efficiency for all sample countries is not so high; it ranged from 38 to 42 % with standard deviation of 30. The most efficient countries in the sample which recorded more than 80 % efficiency were Singapore (100 %), New Zealand (97 %), HongKong (97 %), USA (96 %), Australia (96 %), Canada (96 %), UK (93 %), Denmark (93 %), Japan (87 %), Malaysia (85 %) and S. Korea (81 %). Countries with larger markets emerge as high export potentials such as USA, China and Japan with potential ranging from 10 to 30 Trillion US dollars. These potential has been changing within the period. Result of technical inefficiency model reveals that these potential is increased by membership of the Philippines to ASEAN, APEC and WTO. Reduction of corruption and freer labor market in the importing country enhances export potential of Philippine merchandise exports. Commonality of language also enhances these potential. ...|$|E
40|$|Pakistan {{is facing}} a chronic trade deficit since its {{inception}} which has significantly increased in a recent decade due to globalization and trade liberalization. The post-WTO, trade liberalization significantly distorted trade balance and economic growth due to relatively lower specialization level. The post liberalization trade performance may result in catastrophic consequences if not addressed properly on time. This study investigates external trade of Pakistan for the correction of persistently unfavorable trade balance and economic growth. The exports of Pakistan are highly dependent on lower value-added agriculture and manufacturing sectors. These labor-intensive sectors account more than 80 percent of total merchandise exports. The fundamental trade theories argue achievement of the higher specialization level and economies of scale in production sectors with relatively higher comparative advantage. Chapter three investigates competitiveness of Pakistan in 14 major industries of agriculture and manufacturing sectors {{with respect to the}} world's aggregate specialization level using revealed comparative advantage index proposed by Balassa, (1965). The result shows that Pakistan has a comparative advantage in labor intensive lower value-added agriculture and manufacturing sector, whereas comparative disadvantage is observed in other manufacturing sectors. The trend analysis shows that the specialization level of agriculture is showing satisfactory performance, whereas that of labor-intensive manufacturing sectors is significantly distorting. It urges Pakistan to develop these important industries to achieve competitive specialization. The highly concentrated nature of <b>export</b> <b>flow</b> toward few trading partners is another major constraint on export growth. Chapter four investigates macroeconomic determinants of <b>export</b> <b>flow</b> and export potential of Pakistan with its 40 bilateral trading partners, using an augmented version of Gravity model. The result shows that the domestic supply constraints and economic conditions of trading partners emerged as a major determinant of <b>export</b> <b>flow.</b> The result of export potential shows that Pakistan has exhausted its potential with traditional trading partners, whereas high potential is observed in European, Asian, and American trading partners. Pakistan should develop its important industries and diversify exports towards potential economies. The macroeconomic policies {{play an important role in}} the domestic productivity growth and trade performance. Chapter 5 constructed a trade based macroeconomic model of Pakistan, comprising 24 endogenous variables. The macroeconomic framework is modeled following Keynesian tradition and model is solved using Gauss-Seidel technique. The simulation model is then used to investigate the impact of various policy shocks on economic growth. The result of policy simulation of increase in exchange rate shows the significant positive effect on the trade balance, with negligible positive impact on economic growth, whereas an increase in fiscal deficit distorts trade balance and economic growth. The increase in the export price of foods and textile articles shows significant positive, whereas the import price of petroleum product shows the significant negative impact on trade balances and economic growth performance.

We argue that barter, countertrade and foreign direct investment {{can be seen as}} efficient institutions that mitigate contractual hazards which arise in technology trade, marketing and imperfect capital markets. Paying an import with export goods rather than cash (barter) helps to overcome incentive problems that arise in debt repayment of highly indebted countries. Payment in export goods removes the anonymity of the medium of exchange and thus allows to create a collateral for the creditor.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence on}} the effect of credit supply shocks on exports. Capital flow reversals in Peru during the 2008 financial crisis induced a decline in the supply of credit by domestic banks with high share of foreign-currency denominated liabilities. We use this variation to estimate the elasticity of exports to bank credit. We use matched customs and firm-level bank credit data to control for additional factors that may also affect the level of exports: we compare changes in exports of the same product and to the same destination by firms borrowing from different banks. Exports react strongly to changes in the supply of credit in the intensive margin, irrespectively of the firms ’ export volume. In the extensive margin, the negative credit supply shock increases the probability of exiting a product-destination export market, but does not significantly affect the number of firms entering an export market. The magnitude of the respective elasticities, as well as their heterogeneity across firm and <b>export</b> <b>flow</b> observable characteristics, are estimated. ∗We are grateful to Saki Bigio, Paul Castillo, Roberto Chang, and Manuel Luy Molinie for helpful advic...|$|E

More specifically, this study focuses {{on the impact of}} knowledge on the structure of regional <b>export</b> <b>flows,</b> in terms of horizontal and vertical product differentiation, as well as the geographical distribution of <b>export</b> <b>flows.</b> The thesis consists of four separate papers, which contribute to the overall analysis of knowledge, product differentiation and international trade in different ways. The second chapter presents a study of the effects of regional accessibility to R&D on the diversity of <b>export</b> <b>flows</b> with regard to goods, firms and destination markets. Chapter 3 provides an empirical analysis of vertical product differentiation, i. e. differentiation in terms of product quality, and examines the impact of educated labor and R&D on regional comparative advantages in goods of relatively high product quality. Chapter 4 contains a study of how the regional endowment of highly educated workers affects the structure of <b>export</b> <b>flows,</b> i. e. how the endowment of educated workers impacts on the number of product varieties exported, the average price per variety and the average quantity shipped out. The final chapter presents a micro-level analysis of firms’ propensity to participate in international markets and their propensity to expand export activities by introducing new export products or establishing export links with new destination countries. In summary, the empirical results of this thesis convey the message that regional accessibility to knowledge, embodied in highly educated labor and/or developed through R&D activities, plays a fundamental role in shaping the content and structure of regional <b>export</b> <b>flows.</b> More specifically, the present empirical observations suggest that the regional endowment of knowledge stimulates the size of the export base in terms of exporting firms and number of product varieties. The recurring significance of the accessibility variables in explaining spatial export patterns show that the knowledge endowment of a region must be defined in such ways that it captures sources of potential knowledge spillovers from inside as well as outside its own regional boundaries. This outcome shows that regional variations in knowledge endowments originate both in the actual spatial distribution of a nation’s knowledge labor across regions, and in regional differences in the geographical accessibility to internal and external knowledge labor...|$|R
