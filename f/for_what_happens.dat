500|$|The intuition <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> {{above is}} that the Codd tables {{representing}} the projections in the subqueries lose track {{of the fact that}} [...] the Nulls in the columns F12.F2 and F23.F2 are actually copies of the originals in the table J. This observation suggests that a relatively simple improvement of Codd tables (which works correctly for this example) would be to use Skolem constants (meaning Skolem functions which are also constant functions), say ω12 and ω22 instead of a single NULL symbol. Such an approach, called v-tables or Naive tables, is computationally less expensive that the c-tables discussed above. However it is still not a complete solution for incomplete information in the sense that v-tables are only a weak representation for queries not using any negations in selection (and not using any set difference either). The first example considered in this section is using a negative selection clause, WHERE Age <> 22, so it is also an example where v-tables queries would not report sure information.|$|E
500|$|The kiss between Mulder and Scully {{caused a}} furor of opinions. The Complete X-Files noted that many fans were [...] "ecstatic" [...] about Mulder and Scully's [...] "long-awaited" [...] kiss. David Blar from DVD Talk called the episode [...] "shocking" [...] because of Mulder and Scully's kiss, asking, [...] "why they didn't lock lips sooner"? Paula Vitaris {{noted that the}} kiss [...] "seems stuck on to the episode by a tack in its {{complete}} irrelevance to the storyline or Mulder and Scully in general." [...] Allan Johnson from the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "in a way, it's too bad Sunday's episode of Fox's The X-Files is getting more attention <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> near the end than it does for its plot." [...] Kessenich praised the way the show worked in Mulder and Scully's kiss, noting that its lack of a [...] "steamy, rip your clothes off" [...] atmosphere made the sequence work [...] "so well". Handlen wrote that the scene, coupled with Black getting his daughter back, was [...] "the only scene which comes close to justifying the episode’s existence". Furthermore, he enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the kiss, noting {{that it could be}} [...] "just a one time thing, or maybe it’s the start of something, or maybe it’s just a continuation of something that’s {{been going on for a}} long time now, right under our noses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Survival is {{the term}} used <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to a person after he/she has already {{developed}} or contracted a serious illness. [...] Although happiness {{has been shown to}} increase health, with survival, {{this may not be the}} case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener & Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that happy people fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that happy people tend to be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener & Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments.|$|E

2500|$|The Reepalu {{controversy}} {{was addressed}} by a signed editorial, [...] "The Hunt for Reepalu", {{that was published}} in the independent social democratic tabloid Aftonbladet. The editorial was written by Kennet Andreasson, who is an editor of Aftonbladet. Andreasson stated that he [...] "had {{no reason to believe that}} Reepalu is a Jew-hater --- ignorant, perhaps, unaware of the historical chains of thought-figures that lead to antisemitism, possibly --- but mostly naive and honest---and stressed." [...] The characterization the reporter at Skånska Dagbladet made, portraying Reepalu as more interested in talking about Israel's aggressive politics then the problems at hand was unfair he continued. [...] "Anyone who listens to the questions and answers get a more nuanced picture. More than anything, Reepalu talks about fighting racism wherever it appears and whomever it is directed at. He emphasizes, more than one time, that international politics should not be drawn into local politics." [...] It could have ended with the Reepalu's op-ed for Sydsvenska Dagbladet on January 30 where Reepalu called it [...] "totally unacceptable" [...] to make Malmö's Jews responsible <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in Israel, Andreassson observed. [...] "When this did not happen, Reepalu should put an end to it now by swallowing the condemnations. Then he is entitled to his own condemnation of the Israeli atrocities in Gaza. Those who have stood for the blame, in the main driven by zeal for sanitation of antisemitism, at times self-righteousness have been scent, are likely to agree. For it must be possible to express this criticism without being automatically accused of Jew-hating, something that often occurs. To make a hard criticism against the war effort, against the government-conducted murders, against the wall, against the settlements --- these criticism are very much justifiable --- and legitimate and morally and politically respectable." ...|$|E

60|$|I am perplexed {{to picture}} to myself {{the state of}} mind which accepts these verbal juggleries. It is intelligible that the Creator should operate {{according}} to such rules as he might think fit to lay down for himself (and therefore according to law); but that would leave the operation of his will just as much a direct personal act {{as it would be}} under any other circumstances. I can also understand that (as in Leibnitz's caricature of Newton's views) the Creator might have made the cosmical machine, and, after setting it going, have left it to itself till it needed repair. But then, by the supposition, his personal responsibility would have been involved in all that it did; just as much as a dynamiter is responsible <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens,</b> when he has set his machine going and left it to explode.|$|E
60|$|But, indeed, an {{even worse}} fate, {{practically}} considered, {{follows from the}} denim of the original intellectual formula. Not only does the individual become narrow, but he spreads narrowness across {{the world like a}} cloud; he causes narrowness to increase and multiply like a weed. <b>For</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> is this: that all the shortsighted people come together and build a city called Myopia, where they take short-sightedness for granted and paint short-sighted pictures and pursue very short-sighted policies. Meanwhile all the men who can stare at the sun get together on Salisbury Plain and do nothing but stare at the sun; and all the men who see a blue moon band themselves together and assert the blue moon, not once in a blue moon, but incessantly. So that instead of a small and varied group, you have enormous monotonous groups. Instead of the liberty of dogma, you have the tyranny of taste.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens,</b> by God's eternal and {{unchangeable}} laws of retribution, {{to a whole}} nation, or a whole family, {{may happen}} to you--to each individual man. They fall by sin; they rise again by repentance and amendment. They may rise punished by their sins, and punished for a long time, heavily weighted by {{the consequences of their}} own folly, and heavily weighted for a long time. But they rise--they enter into their new life weak and wounded, from their own fault. But they enter in. And from that day things begin to mend--the weather begins to clear, the soil begins to yield again--punishment gradually ceases when it has done its work, the weight lightens, the wounds heal, the weakness strengthens, and by God's grace within them, and by God's providence outside them, they are made men of again, and saved. So you will surely find it in the experience of life.|$|E
