5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise {{on the eastern}} <b>horizon</b> and set on the western <b>horizon.</b> North latitude is fairly easy to determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above the <b>horizon</b> indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he North Pole. When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is Polaris directly overhead at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels south toward the equator, Polaris appears to descend toward the northern <b>horizon.</b> At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris is 45 degrees above the northern <b>horizon.</b> Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below the northern <b>horizon.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle <b>horizon</b> expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle <b>horizon.</b> The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss some}} of the {{drawbacks}} of using event <b>horizons</b> to define black holes. The reasons are both practical, physical and theoretical. We argue that locally defined trapping <b>horizons</b> can remedy many of these drawbacks. We examine {{of the question of}} whether black hole thermodynamics should be associated with event <b>horizons</b> or trapping <b>horizons.</b> To this end we discuss what role trapping <b>horizons</b> may play in black hole thermodynamics. In addition, we show how trapping <b>horizons</b> may give rise to Hawking radiation and discuss the issue of gravitational entropy.

40|$|The {{efficient}} market hypothesis (EMH) fails as a valid model of financial markets. The fractal market hypothesis (FMH) {{is a more}} general alternative way to the EMH. The FMH is formed on the following parameter space: agents' investment <b>horizons.</b> A financial market is more stable when a fractal character in the structures of agent's investment <b>horizons</b> is adopted. For computer simulations, the classical model is modified. This adjusted model shows that various frequency distributions on agents' investment <b>horizons</b> lead to different returns behaviour. The FMH focuses on matching of demand and supply of agents' investment <b>horizons</b> in the financial market. The FMH asserts that investors have different information based on temporal attributes. Since all investors in the market have different time investment <b>horizons,</b> the market remains stable. Our simulations of probability distributions of agents' investment <b>horizons</b> demonstrate that many investment <b>horizons</b> guarantee stability on the financial market. fractal market hypothesis, {{efficient market}} hypothesis, agents' trading strategies, agents' investment <b>horizons...</b>|$|R
