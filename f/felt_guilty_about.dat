25|$|Hughes Communications {{immediately}} {{noticed the}} jamming, {{and threatened to}} shut down HBO's satellite signal or alter the satellite's course, with executives believing the hacker was a domestic terrorist. HBO's technician, working at the company's communication center in Hauppauge, Long Island, telephoned Hughes Communications, but officials there could not offer an explanation to the jamming, and so he attempted to regain control by increasing the uplink transmission power from 125 watts to 2,000 watts. This was unsuccessful, as MacDougall increased his power in a control battle that lasted about 90 seconds, during which it was feared that a further power increase would damage the satellite. MacDougall got scared, abandoned his control of the satellite, and went home. The following day, he <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> his actions, but hoped the jamming would not be noticed by anyone not working for HBO. MacDougall was later surprised to see his actions being reported on network television. Thus, {{when he returned to}} work that night he pretended to have no knowledge about the intrusion, and asked questions about what had happened. MacDougall only told close friends, and had visions about federal agents visiting his home.|$|E

500|$|Tintin in the Congo shows Tintin {{taking part}} in what Michael Farr {{described}} as [...] "the wholesale and gratuitous slaughter" [...] of animals; {{over the course of}} the Adventure, Tintin shoots several antelope, kills an ape to wear its skin, rams a rifle vertically into a crocodile's open mouth, injures an elephant for ivory, stones a buffalo, and (in earlier editions) drills a hole into a rhinoceros before planting dynamite in its body, blowing it up from the inside. Such scenes reflect the popularity of big-game hunting among whites and affluent visitors in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1930s. Herg√© later <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> his portrayal of animals in Tintin in the Congo and became an opponent of blood sports; when he wrote Cigars of the Pharaoh (1934), he had Tintin befriend a herd of elephants living in the Indian jungle.|$|E

He wrote a sermon in her honour, to be read at her funeral, but Taylor refused to read it, for reasons which are unknown. This only exacerbated Johnson's feelings of loss and despair {{after the death of his}} wife. Consequently, John Hawkesworth had to organise the funeral. Johnson <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> the poverty in which he believed he had forced Tetty to live, and blamed himself for neglecting her. He became outwardly discontent, and his diary was filled with prayers and laments over her death which continued until his own.

Metcalfe believed that this behaviour was typical of Mercedes. Malachy had died and rather than [...] "moping" [...] about she chooses {{to get on with}} her life. Riley filled the role of giving Mercedes some attention [...] "when she needs it most". The serial introduced complications with Riley and Mercedes' relationship with the introduction of Riley's father Carl (Paul Opacic). Carl's disapproval of Mercedes created tension between them and she [...] "hits a nerve" [...] by jibing Carl. Metcalfe explained that Mercedes asked Carl what he would do if she stayed with Riley. In an effort to [...] "wind him up", Mercedes suggested that she and Carl sleep together; Metcalfe stated that it was [...] "obvious he's tempted", and Mercedes and Carl start an affair. Opacic told a reporter from Inside Soap that Mercedes and Carl <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> their tryst, but suggested that viewers keep watching to see if the two could [...] "stay away from each other". He added that while Riley believed Mercedes was [...] "the girl of his dreams", Carl believed that Mercedes was not [...] "good enough" [...] for his son.|$|E

With the population thus prepared, Hactar, disintegrated but still functional, built and crashed a model spaceship onto Krikkit in order to introduce its inhabitants to the concept of the Universe. Secretly guided by Hactar, the Krikkiters built their first spaceship, Krikkit One, penetrated the dust cloud, and surveyed the Universe before them. Unbeknownst to the Krikkiters, Hactar had been subliminally conditioning their minds {{to the point where they}} could not accept a Universe into their world view with the intention of putting them into a similar mindset to that of the Silastic Armorfiends. Sooner or later, they would require an Ultimate Weapon, and this would allow Hactar to finally complete his purpose, something he had <b>felt</b> considerably <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> not doing before. Upon first witnessing the glory and splendor of the Universe, they casually, whimsically, decided to destroy it, remarking, [...] "It'll have to go." [...] Aided again by the mind of Hactar, the Krikkiters built an incredible battlefleet and waged a massive war against the entire Universe.

Sarker then continued, claiming that Zoe was [...] "layered in a lot of selfishness, a lot of righteousness, a lot of pigheadedness". Later on, having given up Sharice, Zoe then embarks on a relationship with department head Nick Jordan.

Zoe's the first female to meet Jordan's professional standards. She's no pussycat and Jordan knows that. He's got a certain amount of respect for her, as she has for him. Characterising the relationship, Sarker explained: [...] "They've both been single {{for a very long time}} through their own choices and neither of them feel any pressure or expectations, which is a good combination for something to happen. I think this is the grown-up version of a flirtation. It's a bit more factual with these two; there isn't much softness or gooeyness to them. They are more like steel on steel!" ...|$|R

Dragons captain Norm Provan was knocked out by Wests Jim Cody five minutes before half time. Cody escaped any {{official}} punishment but Provan was carried {{from the field and}} didn't return again until well into the second half. Wilson came out as captain after the break and after having told his players to keep things calm he apparently squared things up in the first seconds after kick-off before the first tackle was even made. The order of proceedings was unclear, but Cody went down and referee Jack Bradley sent Wilson off. With no replacements allowed in those days, St George were reduced to 11 men until Provan returned to the field 15 minutes later.From an interview with Wilson's wife Norma conducted in 1994, Larry Writer [...] reports that Wilson <b>felt</b> enormously <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> putting the team in this position and promptly retired after the match. Larry Writer himself suggests that the send-off may have soured Wilson's relationship with club officials in spite of the victory. These views aside, at 35 years of age, the end of Wilson's playing career was looming from the club's perspective and his contract was not renewed. As of the 2007 NRL season no forward since Wilson has been sent off in a Grand Final and in that game Wilson became the only man to have been sent off in two grand finals following his dismissal in 1953.|$|R

In the current study we investigate interventions to attenuate these negative effects; the two interventions include a media literacy TED talk (lead by Jean Kilbourne) and a self-compassion meditation (lead by Kristin Neff). 450 college women participated in this study. Two-thirds of them were exposed to an intervention; the rest were used as a control group. Half of each group was exposed to a set of advertisements considered to highlight a thin-ideal and the others were exposed to neutral advertisements. After advertisement exposure, participants were asked a variety of questions which included, but were not limited to, body satisfaction, self-esteem, and current self-compassion levels. Results of this study did not find clear support for either intervention. This may be due, however, to a fault in the thin-ideal media manipulation...|$|R
