25|$|After {{making the}} <b>frequency</b> <b>change</b> in 1995, the FCC {{solicited}} interest from parties intent on building {{a radio station}} on 93.1 FM in Yazoo City. Although two parties expressed interest in the station during the <b>frequency</b> <b>change</b> stage (individual Clifton Thomas of Jackson and Dain Schult Radioactivity, Inc. of East Point, Georgia), a local third contender, Gordon ("Jerry") J. Lousteau, Jr., of WMGO 1370 AM in Canton {{was the only person}} that responded to the FCC's public notice, and therefore his WMGO Broadcasting Corporation was granted the license. He placed the station on the air in 1997 and it was known as WMGO-FM. The original studio was located at 1307 East Broadway Street in Yazoo City.|$|E
25|$|In the {{cardiovascular}} system, the pulsation frequency decreases as {{the blood is}} distanced from the origin of pulsation, the heart. However, the Womersley number, like many characteristic numbers, defines a system by order of magnitude (OoM). The pulsation frequency maintains a single OoM throughout the body (<1 s^-1) and is square rooted in the Womersley equation, reducing the OoM further. Therefore, the <b>frequency</b> <b>change</b> in blood flow {{does not affect the}} characteristics defined by the Womersley number.|$|E
25|$|For a {{production}} system, the team {{began working with}} a system using a circular J-scope display for improved accuracy. The more common A-scope represents distances {{across the face of}} the tube, while the J-scope presents as the angle around the cathode ray tube's face. This increases the amount of room on the scale by a factor of π for any given display size, improving accuracy. In spite of using the J-scope, and adopting the <b>frequency</b> <b>change</b> for more stability, the team found accurate measurements of range quite difficult. At the time, the procedure for generating sharp pulses of signals was in its infancy, and their signals were considerably spread out in time, making measurements difficult.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Online mining {{changes over}} data streams has been {{recognized}} {{to be an important}} task in data mining. Mining changes over data streams is both compelling and challenging. In this paper, we propose a new, single-pass algorithm, called MFC-append (Mining <b>Frequency</b> <b>Changes</b> of append-only data streams), for discovering the frequent frequency-changed items, vibrated <b>frequency</b> <b>changed</b> items, and stable <b>frequency</b> <b>changed</b> items over continuous append-only data streams. A new summary data structure, called Change-Sketch, is developed to compute the <b>frequency</b> <b>changes</b> between two continuous data streams as fast as possible. Moreover, a MFC-append-based algorithm, called MFC-dynamic (Mining <b>Frequency</b> <b>Changes</b> of dynamic data streams), is proposed to find the <b>frequency</b> <b>changes</b> over dynamic data streams. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our algorithms meet the major performance requirements, namely single-pass, bounded space requirement, and real-time computing, in mining data streams...|$|R

25|$|At 1:00a.m. on September 10, 1995, WCIX and WTVJ swapped channel positions. The entire WCIX {{intellectual}} unit (CBS affiliation, {{programming and}} staff) moved from channel 6 to channel 4, effectively returning CBS programming to channel 4 after a six-year hiatus. WTVJ had been Miami's CBS affiliate from its sign-on in March 1949 until the 1989 switch to NBC. Along with the <b>frequency</b> <b>change</b> came {{a new set}} of call letters, WFOR-TV, changing the reference to the station's channel number from its original allocation to its new one. Due to the way the asset exchange deal was structured, the two stations were required to swap licenses in addition to the transmitting facilities. As a result, WFOR-TV legally operated under WTVJ's old license on channel 4 {{through the end of the}} analog broadcasting era; however, the studios of both WFOR-TV and WTVJ remained the same at the time of the swap (WTVJ has since moved to a new facility).|$|E
25|$|Genetic drift is a {{cause of}} allelic <b>frequency</b> <b>change</b> within populations of a species. Alleles are {{different}} variations of specific genes. They determine things like hair color, skin tone, eye color and blood type; in other words, all the genetic traits that vary between individuals. Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles to a population, but it can reduce variation within a population by removing an allele from the gene pool. Genetic drift is caused by random sampling of alleles. A truly random sample is a sample in which no outside forces affect what is selected. It is like pulling marbles {{of the same size}} and weight but of different colors from a brown paper bag. In any offspring, the alleles present are samples of the previous generations alleles, and chance plays a role in whether an individual survives to reproduce and to pass a sample of their generation onward to the next. The allelic frequency of a population is the ratio of the copies of one specific allele that share the same form compared to the number of all forms of the allele present in the population.|$|E
