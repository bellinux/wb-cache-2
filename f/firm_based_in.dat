5|$|Owing to {{the effect}} of {{prevailing}} winds and rains on the walls, the mosque has needed several renovations and restoration work which over the years have altered some of its exterior designs. In September 2002, a severe storm destroyed the mihrab and the minaret. As a result, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) placed the mosque on the 2002 World Monuments Watch, also considering the damage sustained after the inappropriate restoration in the 1970s. The Ghana Museums and Monuments Board decided to restore the mosque and sought advice from CRAterre, an architectural <b>firm</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> Grenoble, France which has expertise in building earthen structures. The renovation work was supported by a WMF, with a grant fund of US$50,000 from American Express. The local community also provided support. The conservation process involved removal of the earlier cement plaster from the surfaces of the mosque, the wooden structural components were replaced, the minaret and the mihrab were reconstructed, the portal was redone, and the interior and exterior surfaces were plastered in the traditional way. The renovation resulted in reassessing the state of conservation of the site, involving a team of local artisans and labourers. It helped to restore the monument with special emphasis on reviving the knowledge of mud-plaster maintenance.|$|E
5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of the}} leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp <b>firm</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E

40|$|Using firm-level data, {{this paper}} {{examines}} the R&D intensity (R&D {{per unit of}} output) of foreign-controlled and Canadian-controlled <b>firms</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> Canada. The empirical results suggest that foreign-controlled firms, after accounting for the influence of other factors, are less R&D-intensive than Canadian-controlled firms, and this gap has not narrowed during the past ten years. On average, R&D intensity tends to be higher in high-tech and export-oriented firms, compared to low and medium technology and non-exporting firms. However, despite a lower R&D intensity, foreign-controlled <b>firms</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> Canada are more productive and pay higher wages than Canadian-controlled firms. These results in turn suggest that foreign-controlled firms benefit heavily from technology and knowledge transfer from their parent companies. ...|$|R
