500|$|During a {{diplomatic}} mission, Captain Picard is injured by terrorists and dies. He awakes {{to find himself}} in an otherwordly realm, where he is greeted by the god-like alien Q. [...] He explains that the peculiar weapon that shot Picard destroyed his artificial heart, and that a natural heart would have survived. [...] Picard lost his original heart as a young officer, when he was stabbed during a bar brawl, an event that he regrets and led to him becoming the disciplined and restrained man he is today. [...] When Picard remarks that he would <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>differently</b> if he could relive that moment, Q sends Picard {{back in time to}} two days before the brawl, where he meets with fellow cadets and friends Corey Zweller and Marta Batanides. They are surprised by Picard's change of personality; no more devil-may-care attitude.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Usher {{revealed}} that {{for his next}} album {{he was working on}} a new type of music which he has depicted as [...] "revolutionary pop", which combines different genres to form a new sound. His seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself was released on June 8, 2012, worldwide and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by Billboard magazine, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>differently</b> on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: [...] "What he wanted to do [...] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate". In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is [...] "the most artistic of an album" [...] he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself [...] "I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me".|$|E

6000|$|I {{was born}} in 1815, in Keppel Street, Russell Square; and while a baby, was carried down to Harrow, where my father had built a house on a large farm which, in an evil hour he took on a long lease from Lord Northwick. That farm was the grave of all my father's hopes, ambition, and prosperity, the cause of my mother's sufferings, and of those of her children, and perhaps the {{director}} of her destiny and of ours. My {{father had been a}} Wykamist and a fellow of New College, and Winchester was the destination of my brothers and myself; but as he had friends among the masters at Harrow, and as the school offered an education almost gratuitous to children living in the parish, he, with a certain aptitude to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>differently</b> from others, which accompanied him throughout his life, determined to use that august seminary as [...] "t'other school" [...] for Winchester, and sent three of us there, one after the other, at the age of seven. My father at this time was a Chancery barrister practising in London, occupying dingy, almost suicidal chambers, at No. 23 Old Square, Lincoln's Inn,--chambers which on one melancholy occasion did become absolutely suicidal. [Footnote: A pupil of his destroyed himself in the rooms.] He was, as I have been informed by those quite competent to know, an excellent and most conscientious lawyer, but plagued with so bad a temper, that he drove the attorneys from him. In his early days {{he was a man of}} some small fortune and of higher hopes. These stood so high at the time of my birth, that he was felt to be entitled to a country house, as well as to that in Keppel Street; and in order that he might build such a residence, he took the farm. This place he called Julians, and the land runs up to the foot of the hill on which the school and the church stand,--on the side towards London. Things there went much against him; the farm was ruinous, and I remember that we all regarded the Lord Northwick of those days as a cormorant who was eating us up. My father's clients deserted him. He purchased various dark gloomy chambers in and about Chancery Lane, and his purchases always went wrong. Then, as a final crushing blow, and old uncle, whose heir he was to have been, married and had a family! The house in London was let; and also the house he built at Harrow, from which he descended to a farmhouse on the land, which I have endeavoured to make known to some readers under the name of Orley Farm. This place, just as it was when we lived there, is to be seen in the frontispiece to the first edition of that novel, having the good fortune to be delineated by no less a pencil than that of John Millais.|$|E
