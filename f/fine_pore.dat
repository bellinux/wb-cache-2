Rivera produced this inexpensive filter developed in Guatemala by Mr. Mazariegos from {{a mix of}} local terra-cotta clay and sawdust or other combustible materials, such as rice husks. The combustible ingredient, which has been milled and screened, burns out in the firing, leaving a network of fine pores. After firing, the filter is coated with colloidal silver. This combination of <b>fine</b> <b>pore</b> size and the bactericidal properties of colloidal silver produce an effective filter, killing over 98 percent of the contaminants that cause diarrhea, thus dramatically reducing public health problems in the communities that use them to purify potable water. He designed a mold for the filter and a special clay press that was operated with a tire jack.|$|E

40|$|In {{wastewater}} treatment processes, aeration introduces air into a liquid, providing an aerobic environment for microbial degradation of organic matter. The purpose of aeration is two-fold: 1) {{to supply the}} required oxygen to the metabolizing microorganisms and 2) to provide mixing so that the microorganisms come into intimate contact with the dissolved and suspended organic matter. The two most common aeration systems are subsurface and mechanical. In a subsurface system, air is introduced by diffusers or other devices submerged in the wastewater. A mechanical system agitates the wastewater by various means (e. g., propellers, blades, or brushes) to introduce air from the atmosphere. <b>Fine</b> <b>pore</b> diffusion is a subsurface form of aeration in which air is introduced {{in the form of}} very small bubbles.

40|$|What is aeration? Aeration {{is a step}} in {{wastewater}} treatment where air is added to wastewater for mixing purposes and to enhance biological growth. The purpose of aeration is to dissolve oxygen into wastewater so that the microorganisms can utilize it while they break down organic material. What is fine bubble aeration? Fine bubble aeration is a subsurface form of diffusion in which air is introduced in the form of very small bubbles to aid or enhance the treatment of wastewater. Air flows from a pipe into diffusers located {{at the bottom of a}} tank. These diffusers have numerous small openings (known as pores) through which air flows into the wastewater in the tank. In the past, various diffusion devices have been classified as either fine bubble or coarse bubble based on how efficiently they transferred oxygen to the wastewater. Since it is difficult to clearly distinguish between fine and coarse bubbles, diffused aeration systems have been classified based on the physical characteristics of the equipment. In a fine bubble aeration system, several diffusers are mounted or screwed into a header pipe that may run along the length or width of the tank or on a short manifold mounted on a movable pipe. These diffusers come in various shapes and sizes, such as discs, tubes, domes, and plates. The common types of coarse bubble diffusers are fixed orifices, valved orifices, and static tubes. The bubble size of these diffusers is larger than the porous diffusers, thus, lowering the oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE). <b>Fine</b> <b>pore</b> diffusers (discs, tubes, domes, and plates) are usually made from ceramic, plastic, or flexible perforated membranes. Although many materials can be used to make <b>fine</b> <b>pore</b> diffusers, only these few are being used due to cost considerations, specific characteristics, market size, and other factors.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of {{chemical}} foaming is {{proposed for the}} preparation of geopolymers with fine porosity. The use of an interactive powder mixture of gas releasing agent and carrier particles, potentially combines the benefits of small point sources of gas with easy homogenization in the fresh geopolymer. This concept was exploited here for the preparation of porous flyash-based geopolymers. The interactive powder mixture was a SiC powder containing reactive submicron FeSi/FeSi 2 particles. Premature foaming was avoided due to prolonged induction period and slow reaction rate of the active phase. Samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, tree-point bending tests and thermal conductivity measurements.
