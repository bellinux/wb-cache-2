5|$|On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked by {{four members}} of al-Qaeda {{as part of the}} September 11 attacks. The hijackers' {{specific}} target was the United States Capitol. Among the pilots available that day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since the <b>fighter</b> <b>jets</b> were absent of missiles and packed only with dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, {{there was only one way}} to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. The <b>fighter</b> <b>jets</b> passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they would find out that United 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.|$|E
5|$|Chief Rubin {{initially}} confirmed four fatalities (including {{the train}} operator) and 74 injuries, 14 {{of which were}} considered moderate and 6 critical. Five of the dead were discovered in the wreckage and removed {{from the site of}} the collision on the morning of June 23, as cranes dismantling the wrecked trains revealed the bodies. Nine fatalities were eventually confirmed. Major General (ret.) David F. Wherley, Jr. of the District of Columbia Air National Guard – known for deploying <b>fighter</b> <b>jets</b> to defend Washington, D.C. during the September 11 attacks – was killed in the collision along with his wife, Ann; the other passengers killed in the crash were Lavonda King, Veronica DuBose, Cameron Williams, Dennis Hawkins, Mary Doolittle, and Ana Fernandez.|$|E
5|$|The wing {{hosted the}} Cape Cod Air Show & Open House, its last air show with the F-15C Eagle {{at the end}} of Air Force Week in August 2007. The wing shared a {{commonality}} with the 101st Air Refueling Wing, the 103d Fighter Wing, and the 104th Fighter Wing, which due to commission decisions, also changed the type of planes that they flew. Beginning in 2007, the F-15s began moving to Barnes Municipal Airport. With the grounding of the F-15 Eagles, the 158th Fighter Wing, which is based in Vermont took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies earlier than expected. This interruption of the F-15's flight, coinciding with the transitioning of the <b>fighter</b> <b>jets</b> to the 104th Fighter Wing, created some issues.|$|E

5|$|When Operation Linebacker {{began in}} May 1972, American <b>fighter</b> <b>jets</b> {{returned}} to the offense in the skies over North Vietnam {{for the first time}} in nearly four years. Navy and Marine Corps fighters, reaping the benefits of their TOPGUN program, immediately enjoyed considerable success. In contrast by June, as Olds had predicted, the Air Force's fighter community was struggling with a nearly 1:1kill-loss ratio. To the new Inspector General, Lt Gen , Olds offered to take a voluntary reduction in rank to colonel so he could return to operational command and straighten out the situation. Olds decided to leave the Air Force when the offer was refused (he was offered another inspection tour instead) and he retired on June 1, 1973.|$|E
5|$|Domestic defence is the {{responsibility}} of the all-volunteer military of Bulgaria, consisting of land forces, navy and air force. The land forces consist of two mechanised brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems in six air bases, and the navy operates a variety of ships, helicopters and coastal defence measures. Following a series of reductions beginning in 1990, the number of active troops contracted from 152,000 in 1988 to about 32,000 in the 2000s, supplemented in 2010 by a reserve force of 302,500 soldiers and officers and 34,000 paramilitary servicemen. The inventory is mostly of Soviet origin, such as MiG-29 fighters, SA-10 Grumble SAMs and SS-21 Scarab short-range ballistic missiles. , the government planned to spend $1.4 billion for the deployment of new <b>fighter</b> <b>jets,</b> communications systems and cyber warfare capabilities. Total military spending for 2016 was BGN 1.3 billion (USD 560m).|$|E
5|$|The F/A-18 Hornets are modern {{all-weather}} strike <b>fighter</b> <b>jets,</b> {{designed to}} attack both ground and aerial targets. Australia's F/A-18s were built during the 1980s and early 1990s and {{are currently being}} upgraded to improve their capabilities and extend their service lives. ACG operates a total of 71 F/A-18A and F/A-18B Hornets. The F/A-18A is a single-seat fighter and the F/A-18B is a two-seat variant which is mainly used for pilot training. The Australian Government is planning to replace the F/A-18A and Bs with the F-35A Lightning II from 2013 onwards. The F/A-18F Super Hornet is a dedicated strike aircraft in RAAF service and are considered superior to the F-22 Raptor {{in their ability to}} acquire and track moving ground targets, {{and will continue to be}} upgraded until the F-35s are delivered.|$|E

5|$|The shape-shifting Mystique gains {{information}} about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics {{for a second}} Cerebro. Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents in Boston and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The X-Jet is attacked by <b>fighter</b> <b>jets</b> en route back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it, and Xavier, to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, Jason, is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, which Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker {{was the man who}} grafted his adamantium skeleton onto his bones. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake.|$|E
5|$|At {{a charity}} event held by Stark Industries, {{reporter}} Christine Everhart informs Stark that his company's weapons, including the Jericho, were recently {{delivered to the}} Ten Rings and {{are being used to}} attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark then learns that Stane has been arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is staging a coup to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two F-22 Raptor <b>fighter</b> <b>jets.</b> He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has {{the rest of the group}} killed. Stane has a massive new suit reverse engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Pepper to hack into its database. She discovers Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged. Potts meets with Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities.|$|E
5|$|During the First Congo War, the Angolan {{government}} {{joined the}} coalition to overthrow Mobutu's government {{due to his}} support for UNITA. Mobutu's government fell to the opposition coalition on 16 May 1997. The Angolan government chose to act primarily through Katangese gendarmes called the Tigres, which were proxy groups formed from the descendents of police units who had been exiled from Zaire and thus were fighting {{for a return to}} their homeland. Luanda did also deploy regular troops. In early October 1997, Angola invaded the Republic of the Congo during its civil war, and helped Sassou Nguesso's rebels overthrow the government of Pascal Lissouba. Lissouba's government had allowed UNITA the use of cities in the Republic of Congo in order to circumvent sanctions. Between 11–12 October 1997, Angolan air force <b>fighter</b> <b>jets</b> conducted a number of air strikes on government positions within Brazzaville. On 16 October 1997 rebel militia supported by tanks and a force of 1,000 Angolan troops cemented their control of Brazzaville forcing Lisouba to flee. Angolan troops remained in the country fighting militia forces loyal to Lissouba engaged in a guerrilla war against the new government.|$|E

5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W. Bush over concerns about Pakistan's burgeoning nuclear program under the Pressler Amendment banned all military ties, supply of military hardware and jet fighters, and cut off political relations with Islamabad. Bhutto sought rapprochement with the Clinton White House, and Raphel became a key player in orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 <b>fighter</b> <b>jets.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{ran into}} unexpected difficulties, {{and did not}} achieve its objectives. The Soviet Union did not give explicit support to the operation, and the United States provided air and sea cover to Kuomintang supply ships up to within three miles of the Chinese coast. Kuomintang <b>fighter</b> <b>jets</b> shot down thirty-seven PRC fighters (while only losing three themselves), and Nationalist artillery and naval bombardments destroyed fourteen PRC ships. Peng had quietly opposed the operation since its beginning, and began to gradually end hostilities after the PLA encountered serious difficulties, announcing a series of intermittent ceasefires before eventually halting the campaign in late October. Su Yu was blamed for the disaster and replaced with another ally of Peng's, General Huang Kecheng. Peng's position was not directly affected, but his personal prestige suffered, and the practical effects of his efforts to modernize China's armed forces were called into question within the PLA. Su was accused of directing the aborted attack on Matzu and withdrawing troops from North Korea without authorization, and of secretly taking orders from the USSR. The conflict between Su and Peng lingered throughout Peng's life, and Su was not rehabilitated until after his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{country has}} {{developed}} into a centre of Islamic banking, and is {{the country with the}} highest numbers of female workers in that industry. Knowledge-based services are also expanding. To create a self-reliant defensive ability and support national development, Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. The privatisation has created defence industry, which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council. The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the defence industry. Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical devices, and IT and communication products. Malaysia began developing its own space programme in 2002, and in 2006, Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian to the International Space Station as part of a multibillion-dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM <b>fighter</b> <b>jets</b> by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The government has invested in building satellites in through the RazakSAT programme.|$|E

5|$|When Floyd was a {{tropical}} storm located over Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for the Florida Keys {{as well as the}} southwest Florida coast to Venice. It was the first warning in the state related to the storm, and was issued due to the anticipated intensification to hurricane status as well as short notice. A tropical storm watch, and later warning, was issued for eastern Florida. After the track became more easterly, a hurricane warning was issued for southeastern Florida, as well as the northwestern Bahamas. Officials in southern Florida closed schools due to the storm, and a few flights were canceled at Miami International Airport. Roughly 100 F-4 and F16 <b>fighter</b> <b>jets</b> were transported out of Homestead Air Force Base to safer facilities. The American Red Cross opened 55shelters in 10 Florida counties, housing about 2,000people at some point, primarily in Lee County.
