This is a useful view, but not the only possible one. A different ontology arises <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> attend to the electrodynamics in the device: Here signals propagate at finite speed and an object (like a resistor) that was previously viewed as a single component with an I/O behavior may now have {{to be thought of}} as an extended medium through which an electromagnetic wave flows.|$|E

60|$|The Irish {{question}} {{at the present time}} occupies a vastly different position to what it did in the year 1886. Ever since 1880 the attention of Parliament has been devoted constantly to Ireland, and the attention of Parliament, when devoted constantly to one object, is rarely fruitless. The twenty-five years that have passed have seen great changes in Ireland. We have seen a great scheme of local government, which Lord Salisbury said would be more disastrous than Home Rule itself, actually put into force. We have seen the scheme of land purchase, which in the year 1886 did more to injure the Home Rule Bill than anything else, actually carried, not indeed to a complete conclusion, but carried into practical effect by a Unionist Administration. These are great events; and their consequences, I think, ought to encourage us to move forward, and not to move back. They have produced results in Ireland which are beneficent, and the Irish question no longer presents itself in the tragic guise of the early eighties. They have produced an effect on Great Britain too. All over our country people have seen Bills which they were told beforehand would be ruinous to the unity and integrity of the United Kingdom--Land Bills and Local Government Bills--passed into law; and so far from the dire consequences which were apprehended from these measures, they have found--you here have found--that great good has resulted from that legislation. Many people are encouraged by what has taken place to make a step forward in the future; and I think <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> look for any further encouragement, we should find it in the great and undisputed triumph which, under the mercy of Heaven, has attended our policy in South Africa, and has resulted in bringing into the circle of the British Empire a strong and martial race, which might easily have been estranged for ever.|$|E

The analysis of conventional mutants (i.e. derived from non-AO programs) is typically unit-centred; the task is concentrated on the mutated statement and perhaps on its surrounding statements.

30|$|We should {{immediately}} examine {{sources of}} bleeding through thoracotomy if bleeding points are unclear on CT. Thoracotomy {{prove to be}} both diagnostic and theoretically therapeutic [7]. When the patient has massive bleeding unexplained by the estimated bleeding point, thoracotomy must be done. A question arises as to the option of incision. Once cardiac rupture is strongly suspected, incision is basically rapid, especially in cardiac arrest. Left anterolateral thoracotomy is speedy but it gives very poor access to any cardiac structure except {{the apex of the}} left ventricle [9]. In addition, the extension of this incision across the sternum into a clamshell (bilateral anterior thoracotomies) leads to four more bleeding vessels (internal mammary arteries and veins) to contend with [9]. However, in our case, we ought to have chosen the left anterolateral thoracotomy in supine position for an exploration of the left thorax, because the advantage of the left anterolateral thoracotomy is that the incision might be extended <b>to</b> the right <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> explore the right thorax.|$|R
