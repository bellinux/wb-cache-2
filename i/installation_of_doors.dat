50|$|A {{manufactured}} home {{is built}} entirely inside a huge, climate-controlled factory {{by a team}} of craftsmen. The first step in the process is the flooring, which is built in sections, each attached to a permanent chassis with its own wheels and secured for transport upon the home’s completion. Depending {{on the size of the}} house and the floorplan’s layout, there may be two, three or even four sections. The flooring sections have heating, electrical and plumbing connections pre-installed before they are finished with laminate, tile or hardwood. Next, the walls are constructed on a flat level surface with insulation and interior Sheetrock before being lifted by crane into position and secured to the floor sections. The interior ceilings and roof struts are next, vapor sealed and secured to each section’s wall frame before being shingled. Then, the exterior siding is added, along with the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> and windows. Finally, interior finishing, such as sealing the drywall, is completed, along with fixture installation and finishing the electrical and plumbing connections. The exposed portions of each section, where they will eventually be joined together, are wrapped in plastic to protect them for transport.|$|E
40|$|Airtightness {{and control}} of the {{internal}} ventilation are among the main factors to be considered in order to evaluate the energy efficiency of a building; moreover, they both strongly influence indoor air quality. Building airtightness has several advantages, such as the reduction of uncontrolled passage of cold draughts and of interstitial condensation. Non-adequate building envelope airtightness can cause mould formation. Some moulds are not infectious, while others produce toxic substances called “mycotoxins” that cause serious infections in more vulnerable people. Other types, such as Cryptococcus, may instead endanger everyone’s health. The sick building syndrome is one of the unpleasant consequences of uncontrolled air draughts, which contribute to the distribution of spores within the environment. Therefore, in order to verify the energy and environmental performance of the building related to airtightness, the “Blower Door Test” is used to measure the hourly rate of air exchange caused by the inaccurate <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> and windows, to the presence of passing pipelines or to common construction defects. The test is carried on closing all the openings and placing a fan as temporary replacement of a door. The test, carried on {{with the aid of a}} thermal imaging camera to identify the critical points and optimize the airtightness, gives general information about the construction quality. The paper presents the testing method and the results of air permeability “Blower Door Test – Method A”, carried out on March 6 th, 2015 at a private residence located in Fiume Veneto, PN, Italy. The test verified that the value fell within the limits for the building certification according to the CasaClima A Protocol. The paper wants to highlight how an appropriate level of building airtightness, together with a mechanical ventilation system, allows reducing heat losses but also contributes to improve the quality of indoor air with the reduction of pathologies for users...|$|E

50|$|Of the {{original}} 15 locomotives, 11 were deployed until December 2004 {{in charge of}} goods trains on the Rübeland Railway. Until that point they were stabled at Bw Blankenburg. Apart from 171 001 and 171 002, which were returned to their original state and placed under conservation protection, almost all locomotives are in the old Bw Zwickau, where they are awaiting future duties in southeast Europe. Class 171-hauled passenger services hauled ended in 2000 because the Federal Railway Office required the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>door</b> opening systems (Türsteuerung or TB0) on passenger trains. A TBO option for the trains was not followed through for cost reasons.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} “work structuring, ” a {{term used}} to describe the effort of integrating product and process design throughout the project development process. To illustrate current work structuring practice, we describe a case study involving the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>door</b> frames into walls in a prison. We analyze why various problems existed. To improve the work structuring effort, we apply the “five whys” to develop local and global fixes for the system of precast walls and door frames. The five whys is a technique to elicit alternative ways of structuring work without being constrained by contractual agreements, traditions, or trade boundaries. We discuss the importance of dimensional tolerances in construction and how these affect the handoff of work from one group of workers to the next. We argue that these constraints and tolerance management practices are so embedded that project participants can miss opportunities to better integrate product and process design. We propose shifting the focus of work structuring from maximizing local trade efficiency to improving overall performance in the delivery system of a capital project...|$|R
