40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new control strategy for highly loaded anaerobic digestion processes. This strategy {{is based on}} the analysis of disturbances added on purpose to the influent flow rate. The control system then carefully overlooks the response of only two parameters, the biogas output flow rate and the pH, in order {{to determine whether or not}} the load can be increased. The main advantages of this approach rely on its capability to automatically adapt the <b>input</b> <b>flow</b> rate to changes in the influ-ent concentration, without any information on its concentration, and to optimize the biological treat-ment in relation to the influent degradability. Experiments have been carried out using two fluidized bed reactors of dierent sizes and they have demonstrated very good capability of this control strategy. In addition, since only very simple sensors are needed, industrial applications of this strategy can be expected. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
