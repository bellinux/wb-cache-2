5|$|Horvath {{was born}} to Croatian {{immigrants}} in South Bend, Indiana in 1921; his family soon moved to Parma, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Parma Senior High School starting in 1936 and played on the track, basketball and football teams until the 11th grade. He decided to switch schools because he felt his basketball teammates were not taking the sport seriously. Horvath's family relocated, and in 1938 he enrolled at James Ford Rhodes High School in Cleveland, one of Parma's rivals. Playing as a quarterback for the Rhodes Rams, Horvath guided the team to seven straight wins in 1938, but the team lost to West Technical High School <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be the Cleveland Senate League's nomination {{to play in the}} city championship. He graduated in 1939.|$|E

5|$|The main Allied assault {{began on}} 25 August, {{reaching}} the Foglia valley—the Gothic Line proper—on 29 August. It was quickly breached, and the German command attempted {{to assemble a}} second defensive line on the Coriano ridge, a hilly spur {{to the north of}} the Conca river, and the last major geographic obstacle south of Rimini. The Allied offensive reached the river on 3 September, but ground to a halt due to mechanical difficulties with its tanks, strengthening German resistance, and heavy rain. The Allied forces halted, and brought up reinforcements whilst waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> resume the offensive along the coast. On the left flank of the assault, the attack had been halted in the Battle of Gemmano, to the south of the Conca river.|$|E

5|$|It {{was in the}} 1999–2000 {{season that}} the Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the new Pepsi Center that cost US$160million. Milan Hejduk scored the first goal of a 2–1 victory against the Boston Bruins on October 13, 1999. The Avalanche {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 42–28–11–1 record for 96 points and won the Northwest Division. Before the playoffs, the Avalanche strengthened their defense for a run towards the Stanley Cup. On March 6, 2000, the Boston Bruins traded future Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Ray Bourque and forward Dave Andreychuk to Colorado for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Samuel Pahlsson and a first round draft pick. Bourque, who had been a Bruin since 1979, requested a trade to a contender <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win the Stanley Cup. However, and just as the year before, Colorado lost in the Conference Finals against the Dallas Stars in a seven games after beating the Phoenix Coyotes and Detroit Red Wings in five games.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Combined Fleet {{was also}} seeking to draw Allied naval forces {{into what was}} hoped to be a decisive battle. Two fleet {{carriers}}— and —and one light carrier——arrived at the main Japanese naval base at Truk Atoll from Japan in early October and joined Shōkaku and Zuikaku. With five carriers fully equipped with air groups, plus their numerous battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the Japanese Combined Fleet, directed by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, was confident that it could {{make up for the}} defeat at the Battle of Midway. Apart from a couple of air raids on Henderson Field in October, the Japanese carriers and their supporting warships stayed in the northwestern area of the Solomon Islands, out of the battle for Guadalcanal and waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> approach and engage the U.S. carriers. With the Japanese Army's next planned major ground attack on Allied forces on Guadalcanal set for 20 October, Yamamoto's warships began to move towards the southern Solomons to support the offensive and to be ready to engage any Allied (primarily U.S.) ships, especially carriers, that approached to support the Allied defenses on Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|While {{food was}} {{extremely}} {{hard to come}} by, an even more pressing need was obtaining drinking water. Thirst {{and the search for}} water are mentioned in most of the Robinsons' memoirs. The most common sources originally included toilet cisterns, boilers, and standing water found inside bathtubs. As these ran out, those in hiding were forced to risk sneaking access to wells, which were often guarded by German soldiers. Some memoirs describe long periods observing a particular well and waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> obtain a quick drink. Another method involved obtaining polluted sewer water from the canals, and then filtering it through coals wrapped in rags. Generally, records indicate that whatever scant water supplies existed were shared fairly among individuals hiding as a group. In at least one instance, one person was unable to withstand the thirst and drank the whole group's water supply. As a result, Jakub Wiśnia, a former Gęsiówka inmate and after its liberation, a Home Army soldier, was court-martialed by his fellow group members and sentenced to death. The execution was to be postponed until after liberation, but when that occurred, the Robinsons were so overwhelmed with joy, the crime was forgiven and the sentence was never mentioned again.|$|E

5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{then went}} to Dawson Creek, British Columbia for a shot at an eighteenth Grand Slam title at the National. He went undefeated through the round robin and {{made it to the}} final, where he lost a close game 6–5 to Glenn Howard. In February, Martin and team went to Camrose, Alberta for the 2012 Boston Pizza Cup to play <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> {{represent}} Alberta at the 2012 Brier. They barely qualified for the playoffs after Martin broke his 22-game win streak at the provincials in losing their first qualifier game to Kevin Koe and then lost another qualifier game to Brock Virtue. They then defeated Robert Schlender in the bottom page playoff game and advanced to the semifinal against Virtue, where they lost a tight game in the tenth end. Martin's loss meant that he {{will not be able to}} represent Alberta at the Brier for the first time since 2010. It also marked the first time since 2005 that he has not won a provincial championship in which he participated. Martin then won the 2012 Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown final against Liu Rui, and then won the 2012 Victoria Curling Classic Invitational final against Mike McEwen. Martin wrapped up the season by participating in the 2012 Players' Championship, finishing the round robin with a 5–2 win-loss record. However, he was upset in the semifinals by John Epping, who went on to win the title.|$|E
