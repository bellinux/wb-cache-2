5|$|Because <b>denser</b> {{materials}} absorb more radioactive emissions than lighter ones, {{heavy metals}} {{are useful for}} radiation shielding and to focus radiation beams in linear accelerators and radiotherapy applications.|$|E
5|$|Barium salts are {{typically}} white when solid and colorless when dissolved, and barium ions provide no specific coloring. They are <b>denser</b> than the strontium or calcium analogs, {{except for the}} halides (see table; zinc is given for comparison).|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is a {{toxic gas}} that attacks the {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. Because it is <b>denser</b> than air, {{it tends to}} accumulate {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.|$|E
50|$|The {{complement}} of a nowhere <b>dense</b> set is a <b>dense</b> set. More precisely, the {{complement of}} a nowhere <b>dense</b> set {{is a set}} with <b>dense</b> interior. Not every <b>dense</b> set has a nowhere <b>dense</b> complement. The complement of a <b>dense</b> set can have nowhere <b>dense,</b> and <b>dense</b> regions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{complement}} of a closed nowhere <b>dense</b> set is a <b>dense</b> open set, {{and thus the}} {{complement of}} a nowhere <b>dense</b> set is a set with <b>dense</b> interior.|$|R
50|$|Every {{subset of}} a nowhere <b>dense</b> set is nowhere <b>dense,</b> {{and the union}} of finitely many nowhere <b>dense</b> sets is nowhere <b>dense.</b> That is, the nowhere <b>dense</b> sets form an ideal of sets, a {{suitable}} notion of negligible set. The union of countably many nowhere <b>dense</b> sets, however, need not be nowhere <b>dense.</b> (Thus, the nowhere <b>dense</b> sets need not form a sigma-ideal.) Instead, such a union is called a meagre set or a set of first category. The concept is important to formulate the Baire category theorem.|$|R
5|$|In the 13th century, Roger Bacon {{argued that}} {{the speed of light}} in air was not infinite, using {{philosophical}} arguments backed by the writing of Alhazen and Aristotle. In the 1270s, Witelo considered the possibility of light travelling at infinite speed in vacuum, but slowing down in <b>denser</b> bodies.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium {{tantalate}} (LuTaO4) is the densest known stable {{white material}} (density 9.81 g/cm3) and therefore {{is an ideal}} host for X-ray phosphors. The only <b>denser</b> white material is thorium dioxide, with density of 10 g/cm3, but the thorium it contains is radioactive.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; <b>denser</b> on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, <b>denser</b> on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet {{were involved in the}} majority of cases. Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E
50|$|Every {{reflexive}} relation is <b>dense.</b> A strict partial order < is a <b>dense</b> order iff < is a <b>dense</b> relation. A <b>dense</b> relation {{that is also}} transitive {{is said to be}} idempotent.|$|R
50|$|Dually, {{just as the}} {{complement}} of a nowhere <b>dense</b> set need not be open, but has a <b>dense</b> interior (contains a <b>dense</b> open set), a comeagre set {{need not be a}} Gδ set (countable intersection of open sets), but contains a <b>dense</b> Gδ set formed from <b>dense</b> open sets.|$|R
50|$|A subset A of a {{topological space}} X is called nowhere <b>dense</b> (in X) {{if there is}} no {{neighborhood}} in X on which A is <b>dense.</b> Equivalently, a subset of a topological space is nowhere <b>dense</b> if and only if the interior of its closure is empty. The interior of the complement of a nowhere <b>dense</b> set is always <b>dense.</b> The complement of a closed nowhere <b>dense</b> set is a <b>dense</b> open set. Given a topological space X, a subset A of X that can be expressed as the union of countably many nowhere <b>dense</b> subsets of X is called meagre. The rational numbers, while <b>dense</b> in the real numbers, are meagre as a subset of the reals.|$|R
5|$|Pathogenic {{micro-organisms}} include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate {{their host}} and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, {{but may also}} be used as biological pesticides. When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that they generally only occur as insect populations become <b>denser.</b>|$|E
5|$|Surface {{tension is}} the elastic {{tendency}} of a fluid surface {{which makes it}} acquire the least surface area possible. Surface tension allows insects (e.g. water striders), usually <b>denser</b> than water, to float and stride on a water surface.|$|E
5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% <b>denser</b> than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. It {{is difficult to}} detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E
5000|$|A nowhere <b>dense</b> set {{need not}} be closed (for instance, the set [...] is nowhere <b>dense</b> in the reals), but is {{properly}} contained in a nowhere <b>dense</b> closed set, namely its closure (which would add 0 to the set). Indeed, a set is nowhere <b>dense</b> {{if and only if}} its closure is nowhere <b>dense.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sign {{has been}} {{observed}} in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA), vertebral artery, and basilar artery; these have been called the <b>dense</b> MCA sign, <b>dense</b> PCA sign, <b>dense</b> vertebral artery sign, and <b>dense</b> basilar artery sign, respectively.|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} noticed that this {{terminology}} {{is different from}} the notion of a <b>dense</b> subset in general topology. No topology is needed to define a <b>dense</b> submodule, and a <b>dense</b> submodule {{may or may not be}} topologically <b>dense</b> in a module with topology.|$|R
5|$|Argon {{is used in}} {{the poultry}} {{industry}} to asphyxiate birds, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon is <b>denser</b> than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.|$|E
5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} of the universe. If the mass density of the universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become <b>denser</b> and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E
5|$|Before the flyby of Voyager 2, astronomers {{suspected}} that Triton might have liquid nitrogen seas and a nitrogen/methane atmosphere with a density {{as much as}} 30% that of Earth. Like the famous overestimates of the atmospheric density of Mars, this proved incorrect. As with Mars, a <b>denser</b> atmosphere is postulated for its early history.|$|E
50|$|A {{topological space}} with a {{countable}} <b>dense</b> subset is called separable. A topological space is a Baire space {{if and only if}} the intersection of countably many <b>dense</b> open sets is always <b>dense.</b> A topological space is called resolvable if it is the union of two disjoint <b>dense</b> subsets. More generally, a topological space is called κ-resolvable if it contains κ pairwise disjoint <b>dense</b> sets.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} <b>dense</b> subgroups in real Lie groups. In particular we {{show that}} any <b>dense</b> subgroup of a connected semisimple real Lie group G contains a free group on two generators which is still <b>dense</b> in G, and that any finitely generated <b>dense</b> subgroup in a connected nonsolvable Lie group H contains a <b>dense</b> free subgroup of rank ≤ 2 · dimH. 1...|$|R
50|$|On the cytoplasmic side of {{the plasma}} membrane, there are two <b>dense</b> {{structures}} called the outer <b>dense</b> plaque (ODP) and the inner <b>dense</b> plaque (IDP). These are spanned by the desmoplakin protein. The outer <b>dense</b> plaque is where the cytoplasmic domains of the cadherins attach to desmoplakin via plakoglobin and plakophilin. The Inner <b>Dense</b> Plaque is where desmoplakin attaches to the intermediate filaments of the cell.|$|R
5|$|Bobcats and bullsnakes hunt smaller animals, such as deer {{mice and}} white-tailed {{antelope}} squirrels in the park's riparian zones. Western pipistrelle bats feast on insects, and pallid bats eat beetles, centipedes, cicadas, praying mantises, scorpions, and other arthropods. On the Painted Desert rim, small animals find {{food and shelter}} among the <b>denser</b> foliage, and mule deer sometimes frequent the area.|$|E
5|$|Brook Farm {{was named}} for the brook that ran near the {{roadside}} and that eventually went to the Charles River. It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and <b>denser</b> pine woods. The land, however, {{turned out to be}} difficult to farm.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{extremely}} dense at this time—far <b>denser</b> than {{is usually}} required {{to form a}} black hole—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This {{may be explained by}} considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars, and do not apply to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} two optimization {{problems related}} to finding <b>dense</b> subgraphs. The <b>densest</b> at-least-k-subgraph problem (DalkS) is to find an induced subgraph of highest average degree among all subgraphs with at least k vertices, and the <b>densest</b> at-most-k-subgraph problem (DamkS) is defined similarly. These problems {{are related to the}} well-known <b>densest</b> k-subgraph problem (DkS), which is to find the <b>densest</b> subgraph on exactly k vertices. We show that DalkS can be approximated efficiently, while DamkS is nearly as hard to approximate as the <b>densest</b> k-subgraph problem. Comment: 12 pages, no figure...|$|R
50|$|The actin {{filaments}} of contractile {{units are}} attached to <b>dense</b> bodies. <b>Dense</b> bodies are rich in α-actinin, and also attach intermediate filaments (consisting largely of vimentin and desmin), and thereby appear to serve as anchors from which the thin filaments can exert force. <b>Dense</b> bodies also are associated with β-actin, which is the type found in the cytoskeleton, suggesting that <b>dense</b> bodies may coordinate tensions from both the contractile machinery and the cytoskeleton. <b>Dense</b> bodies appear darker under an electron microscope, {{and so they are}} sometimes described as electron <b>dense.</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to be}} rare. In <b>denser</b> regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bismuth is <b>denser</b> in {{the liquid}} phase than the solid, a {{characteristic}} it shares with germanium, silicon, gallium and water. Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, {{it was long}} a component of low-melting typesetting alloys, where it compensated for the contraction of the other alloying components, to form almost isostatic bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, various {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} the limb of Triton using the occultation of nearby stars, which indicated {{the presence of an}} atmosphere and an exotic surface. Observations in late 1997 suggests that Triton is heating up and the atmosphere has become significantly <b>denser</b> than when Voyager 2 flew past in 1989.|$|E
