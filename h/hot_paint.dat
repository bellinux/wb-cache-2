30|$|The most {{important}} wax used in ancient art is beeswax, a secretion of the honey bee (Apis mellifica). Beeswax {{was used as}} a binding medium as well as a varnish or coating in ancient Egypt. The earliest certain use of beeswax as a binder occurs in the mummy portraits, which primarily originate from the Fayum region. Many of the mummy portraits were executed in the encaustic technique, also known as <b>hot</b> wax <b>painting,</b> which involves using heated beeswax to which pigments are added. The use of beeswax as a binder or a coating has been identified in several examples [37, 38].|$|R

5000|$|The murals took on monumental status {{because of}} where they were situated, mostly {{on the walls of}} colonial era {{government}} buildings and the themes that were painted. The mural painters of Mexico freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group.

Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the fresco, painting on freshly plastered walls and encaustic or <b>hot</b> wax <b>painting</b> [...] Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement. The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with pyroxlene, a commercial enamel and Duco (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery {{and was one of the}} first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.|$|R

The most crucial event in the history of Topusko would be the building of the Roman road Via Eksecirtualis, which in turn sparked the creation of the Roman colony Ad Fines, which ultimately turned into modern day Topusko. The remnants of the luxurious architecture, the devices for heating the houses with <b>hot</b> water, the <b>painted</b> walls of the houses, the discovered altars dedicated to the Roman and domestic divinities, the grave-monuments, tools, ornaments, money (which was thrown into the thermal springs) are very valuable artifacts that tell us about the persistence of the colony through the whole antiquity.|$|R

His brother, Theo van Gogh, provides financial and moral support, while Vincent lives off and on with the critical Paul Gauguin. Vincent begins experiencing hallucinations and seizures and voluntarily commits himself to a mental institution. He signs himself out, and with Theo's help returns to a rural area to resume painting.

It soon becomes clear to the user of any MW oven that the energy distribution-thus the speed of absorbing energy, and hence warming up-varies topographically. The unaware can observe variations in results when the principles of topographic order are not followed meticulously. To understand the hot-spot phenomenon a certain theoretical knowledge is needed, as presented in this paper. In the 10 years that we have used MW ovens for our preparatory techniques we have learned how {{to solve the problem of}} <b>hot</b> spots. Thermographic <b>paint</b> can be applied to record energy distribution. In our studies, we have used a fiberoptic thermometer to follow precisely in time the temperature in the MW-exposed media, and these observations have provided us with the needed insight to obtain reproducible results. We argue that only when temperature curves are given by the authors can their recipes be used successfully in other laboratories...|$|R

40|$|Building defects {{were used}} to {{describe}} imperfections in constructed buildings that can causes inadequacy or failure. This issue may occur due to problems during design stage or construction stage. Building defects not only occur in specific or certain place, but it involves from many different range which are from complex foundation and framing issues to aesthetic issues. The main {{purpose of this study}} is identifying types of the building defects, to determine the causes or factors of the building defects and also to analyze appropriate methods and techniques of building maintenance. In this study, the scope will be focusing in Peninsular Malaysia. Questionnaires are distributed to the selected company and also an interview session is conducted with related person on selected company. Data and information are gathered and analyzed using statistical method which is Average Index Percentage using Microsoft Excel. It is found that, twelve (12) defects are identified which are fungus stain and harmful growth, erosion of mortar joint, peeling paint, defective rendering plaster, cracking walls and leaning walls, defective rainwater goods, decayed floorboards, insect or termite attacks, roof defects, dampness penetration through walls, unstable foundations and poor installation of airconditioning units. The factors that cause the defects are climate condition, location of the building, building type and change of use, maintenance approach to the building, building age, support and humidity. There are many methods to maintaining the building. For example, there are six (6) methods for peeling paint defect which are water washing, stream stripping, chemical paint removers, abrasive method, <b>hot</b> air <b>paint</b> stripper and burning off method. To identify those method are very important so that proper maintenance of building can be made and also to avoid defects form repeating...|$|R
50|$|After 1837, Delaroche stopped exhibiting {{his work}} altogether. The disappointing public {{reception}} of his painting, St. Cecilia, {{along with his}} overall rejection of Davidian values in French society and government led him to his “self-imposed exile from the government-sponsored Salons.” Delaroche then commenced the creation of his most famous work, The Hemicycle, painted on a semicircular saloon at L’Ecole des Beaux-Arts. The Hemicycle was a 27-meter panoramic that included over seventy {{of the most famous}} artists since Antiquity. The artists included represent Gothic, Greek, Roman, and Renaissance art. The subjects of this painting appeal to the academic taste of the nineteenth-century. Delaroche paints with encaustic mixtures to create this monumental piece—a technique in which pigment is mixed with <b>hot</b> wax and <b>painted</b> onto the plaster to create a smooth surface. Delaroche did not complete this project alone; four of his students assisted him and together they worked from 1837 to 1841. In 1855 the work was severely damage by fire and Delaroche spent {{the last year of his}} life restoring his work. Delaroche died in 1856 and restoration was taken over by Tony Robert-Fleury, a student of Delaroche.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Powers painted four rail bridges abovewest and Fayette streets, Between {{downtown}} and the Near West Side Syracuse {{as a part}} of A Love Letter to Syracuse. “Before he ever put a brush to metal, {{he spent a lot of}} time listening to neighborhood residents as they described the way they see their hometown. Powers describes bridges as links, not only between pieces of land but also to past and future generations, and he wanted to show respect for Syracuse as it used to be.” One of the bridges reads: “Spring Comes. Sumer Waits. Fall Leaves. Winter Longs.” The Subsequent bridge on Fayette Street: “I paid the light bill just to see your face” was inspired by the rusty, faded outline of an old light bulb, painted on the bridge long ago. [...] “A Love Letter to Syracuse” is a tribute, Powers wrote. It “is meant to be from Syracuse to Syracuse.

However, once players mastered doing so, [...] "You'll get a lot of pride out of designing some crazy, twisting corkscrew that winds in and out of lakes and <b>hot</b> dog stands, <b>painting</b> it bright neon pink and orange, and giving it a name like the Vominator.

The detail level is very cool, from the green-faced nauseous guest to the marquee scrolling the name of the ride at the entrance." [...] He also praised the endless amount of possibilities in designing rollercoaster rides, as well as the huge amount of specific detail, such as the location of a food stall, the player should and can focus on of their park, with the only slight criticisms being the [...] "sloppy" [...] interface.|$|R

That is what {{one wants to be}} sure of.... Wood is a pleasant thing to think about. It comes from a tree; and trees grow, and we don't know how they grow. For years and years they grow, without paying any attention to us, in meadows, in forests, and by the side of rivers--all things one likes to think about. The cows swish their tails beneath them on <b>hot</b> afternoons; they <b>paint</b> rivers so green that when a moorhen dives one expects to see its feathers all green when it comes up again. I like to think of the fish balanced against the stream like flags blown out; and of water-beetles slowly raising domes of mud upon the bed of the river. I like to think of the tree itself: first the close dry sensation of being wood; then the grinding of the storm; then the slow, delicious ooze of sap. I like to think of it, too, on winter's nights standing in the empty field with all leaves close-furled, nothing tender exposed to the iron bullets of the moon, a naked mast upon an earth that goes tumbling, tumbling, all night long. The song of birds must sound very loud and strange in June; and how cold the feet of insects must feel upon it, as they make laborious progresses up the creases of the bark, or sun themselves upon the thin green awning of the leaves, and look straight in front of them with diamond-cut red eyes.... One by one the fibres snap beneath the immense cold pressure of the earth, then the last storm comes and, falling, the highest branches drive deep into the ground again. Even so, life isn't done with; there are a million patient, watchful lives still for a tree, all over the world, in bedrooms, in ships, on the pavement, lining rooms, where men and women sit after tea, smoking cigarettes. It is full of peaceful thoughts, happy thoughts, this tree. I should like to take each one separately--but something is getting in the way.... Where was I? What has it all been about? A tree? A river? The Downs? Whitaker's Almanack? The fields of asphodel? I can't remember a thing. Everything's moving, falling, slipping, vanishing.... There is a vast upheaval of matter.
