500|$|Bowie {{found himself}} under great stress during the tour, {{and after the}} tour ended in New Zealand, he {{reportedly}} had the Spider set burned, saying [...] "It was so great ... We <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> thing in a field and set light to it. That was such a relief!" [...] This was, however, partially refuted in 2016 by road manager Peter Grumley, {{who claimed to have}} purchased and stored {{at least one of the}} sets in his West Auckland warehouse.|$|E
500|$|Pitbull and Jim Jones also {{recorded}} freestyle raps over the song. After releasing his version, Jones claimed {{in an interview}} that [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] was a song he originally recorded one year ago for an album by Pauly D, but that they ultimately scrapped it: [...] "When I started to hear the 'Harlem Shake' and heard the beat, I was like damn, I had the record for a year. So I <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> record out." ...|$|E
500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series and every time I looked at the award I kept on thinking that people would be expecting so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it. In the end, I <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> thing away." [...] The series then went on to win BAFTAs for its entire run.|$|E

5000|$|Quite properly, when a {{reporting}} system is {{put together by}} IT professionals, they need to consider all aspects of how the system will be used. In addition to <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> information together they {{need to consider the}} following: ...|$|R
60|$|Saturday {{morning was}} Polly's clearing-up day, and Fan found {{her with a}} {{handkerchief}} tied over her head, and a big apron on, <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> last touches to the tidy little room, which was as fresh and bright as water, air, {{and a pair of}} hands could make it.|$|R
500|$|Given {{the legal}} system's {{affirmation}} of its position, the SP began to forcibly {{remove some of}} the settlers. Their agents would attempt to serve eviction notices, but often would not find anyone at home, as homeowners knew they were coming. In these cases, the agents then tried removing the furniture from the homes, but the Settler's League would <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> furniture back after the agents' departure. Finally, it escalated to {{the point at which the}} agents would then disassemble the houses, but again, volunteers would just put them back together. The settlers were not above their own brand of justice, either. People who had purchased land from those forced to sell would be harassed by locals, and in one case one farmer who had aligned with the SP had his house burned down. Those supporting the railroads tended to be wealthier than the others, deriding the Settler's League as [...] "a set of demagogues" [...] who were [...] "very anxious to get something for nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Phillips {{explained}} when I (Lightoller) {{said that}} I did not recollect any Mesaba report: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> message under a paper weight at my elbow, just until I squared up what I was doing before {{sending it to}} the Bridge." [...] That delay proved fatal and was the main contributory cause {{to the loss of}} that magnificent ship and hundreds of lives. Had I as Officer of the Watch, or the Captain, become aware of the peril lying so close ahead and not instantly slowed down or stopped, we should have been guilty of culpable and criminal negligence.|$|E
2500|$|The Mesopotamians had symbols {{for each}} power of ten. [...] Later, they wrote their numbers in {{almost exactly the}} same way done in modern times. [...] Instead of having symbols for each power of ten, they would <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> {{coefficient}} of that number. [...] Each digit was at separated by only a space, but by the time of Alexander the Great, they had created a symbol that represented zero and was a placeholder. [...] The Mesopotamians also used a sexagesimal system, that is base sixty. [...] It is this system that is used in modern times when measuring time and angles. Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s. Written in Cuneiform script, tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework. The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient Sumerians and the system of metrology from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.|$|E
60|$|Caleb {{went out}} into the parlour. David and Dwight were <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> chairs around the tea table. At tea time, the boys talked a good deal about the mole, and they asked Mary Anna if she would help them rig some vessels to sail in the Maelstrom.|$|R
60|$|The Tolbridge {{house was}} one of the best in the town, but the family was small. There was but one child, a boy of fourteen, who was now away at school. The doctor had readjusted the logs upon the andirons, and was <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> tongs in their place when a maidservant came in.|$|R
60|$|The shower came, {{and feeling}} quite secure, she rumpled up her hair, {{took off her}} cuffs, and hurried to finish her chapter; for thirty pages a day was her task, and she liked to have it well done before evening. Josie had brought some flowers for the vases, and was <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> last touches when she saw several {{umbrellas}} bobbing down the hill.|$|R

2500|$|The tracklist for The Road Chronicles visualette DVD is very {{different}} from the LP release. Amos stated: [...] "I think the visualettes connect [...] as well. The order is different though, which was very intentional. The order of the visual side of things is different than if you're <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> sonic thing on headphones and taking a walk. I felt like you had to experience it very, {{very different}}ly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could just}} be idle all day today," [...] Anne told a bluebird, who was singing and {{swinging}} on a willow bough, [...] "but a schoolma'am, who is also helping to bring up twins, can't indulge in laziness, birdie. How sweet you are singing, little bird. You are <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> feelings of my heart into song ever {{so much better than}} I could myself. Why, who is coming?" ...|$|R
60|$|The undertaker, who had <b>just</b> <b>put</b> up <b>the</b> {{shutters}} of his shop, {{was making}} some entries in his day-book {{by the light}} of a most appropriate dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Same here. It's too big, we know, {{but if he}} were alone, {{he would}} not feel worried about it overmuch--I mean {{the safety of the}} pieces. He would <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> lot into any box or drawer that was handy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, sister, you <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> case into {{my hands}} and let me work it up. I won't say any thing to Ben till you give the word; but I'll watch him, and now that my eyes are open, it won't be easy to deceive me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you see, {{when you}} got to talking about the funeral, I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> bark back in my pocket and kept mum." ...|$|E

30|$|The PAI {{value is}} the product of the degrees of the two end nodes of an edge. Sorting edges with their PAI values <b>just</b> <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> edges with low degree end nodes to the front. The figure shows that the PAI value can detect outlier edges with fairly good performance. This {{indicates}} that most of the injected edges connecting the nodes with low degrees. Considering most of the nodes in a real-world graph are low degree nodes, this is an expected behavior.|$|R
60|$|TARLETON. [grimly, to Gunner] Young man: youre a fool; but youve <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> lid on {{this job}} in a masterly manner. I knew you would. I told you all to let well alone. You wouldnt; and now you must take the consequences--or rather I must take them.|$|E

They'll {{make out}} what they please, and when she's dying, they'll make her put her name to it; or they'll only <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> pen in her hand, when she's not knowing what she's doing. They'd do {{anything}} now, Daly, {{to get the money}} they've been fighting for so hard." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{little man}} was not long in {{accomplishing}} the job, and he had <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> claws in his pouch, and was standing up to wipe his knife, when the captain suddenly grasped his arm and drew him behind {{the trunk of a}} tree, from which point of vantage he cautiously gazed with an anxious expression and a dark frown.|$|E
60|$|We {{had a very}} cheery tea, and {{assisted}} Cynthia to wash up afterwards. We had <b>just</b> <b>put</b> away <b>the</b> last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door. The countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a stern and forbidding expression.|$|R

60|$|She {{read the}} letter for the second time; she turned back obstinately, despairingly, and began it for the third time. As she once more reached the last page, {{she looked at her}} watch.

6000|$|... "Ay, boy, {{you have}} tasted, {{and you feel}} the genuine {{reasoning}} of the thing! But the herd is heading a little this-a-way, and it behoves us to make ready for their visit. If we hide ourselves, altogether, the horned brutes will break through the place and trample us beneath their feet, like so many creeping worms; so we will <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> weak ones apart, and take post, as becomes men and hunters, in the van." ...|$|E

2500|$|On their {{collective}} sound, Doherty commented, [...] "It's like they say: Oasis {{is the sound}} of a council estate singing its heart out, and the Libertines {{is the sound of}} someone <b>just</b> <b>put</b> in <b>the</b> rubbish chute {{at the back of the}} estate, trying to work out what day it was".|$|R
