25|$|Heavily censored from 1975 {{until about}} 1980, Argentine film-makers {{generally}} limited themselves to light-hearted subjects. Among the productions during that era was Héctor Olivera's adaptation of Roberto Cossa's play, La nona (Grandma, 1979). The dark comedy became {{a reference to}} the foreign <b>debt</b> <b>interest</b> payments that later saddled the Argentine economy. One director who, even as a supporter of the military regime, delved into middle-class neuroses with frankness was Fernando Siro, an inventive film-maker seemingly insensitive to many of his colleagues' tribulations, many of whom were forced to leave during the dictatorship. Though his attitudes distanced him from his peers and public, his 1981 tragedy Venido a menos ("Dilapidated") continues to be influential.|$|E
25|$|Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992 - {{the highest}} since the Great Depression. The Liberal-National Opposition had {{proposed}} an ambitious plan {{of economic reform}} {{to take to the}} 1993 Election, including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax. Keating shuffled treasurers and campaigned strongly against the tax and won the 1993 Election. During his time in office, Keating emphasised links to the Asia Pacific region, co-operating closely with the Indonesian President, Suharto, and campaigned to increase the role of APEC as a major forum for economic co-operation. Keating was active in indigenous affairs and the High Court of Australia's historic Mabo decision in 1992 required a legislative response to recognition of Indigenous title to land, culminating in the Native Title Act 1993 and the Land Fund Act 1994. In 1993, Keating established a Republic Advisory Committee, to examine options for Australia becoming a republic. With foreign <b>debt,</b> <b>interest</b> rates and unemployment still high, and after a series of ministerial resignations, Keating lost the 1996 Election to the Liberals' John Howard.|$|E

The general portfolio balance model, which allows for both direct and indirect tests {{of the link between}} public <b>debt</b> and <b>interest</b> rates, is used as the economic framework. Indirect tests in this model consist of investigating the <b>debt</b> impact on <b>interest</b> rates through the effects of debt on the exchange rate and money demand. The evidence generally indicates the absence of causality in the long-run, between government debt and interest-rate related variables for all four countries under study. This suggests the neutrality of public <b>debt</b> on <b>interest</b> rates and is consistent with the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} government <b>debt</b> on <b>interest</b> rates in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. It builds on the general portfolio balance framework which allows for both direct and indirect tests {{of the link between}} public <b>debt</b> and <b>interest</b> rates, and uses the Johansen-Juselius multivariate cointegration techniques to perform these tests. Indirect tests in this model consist of investigating the <b>debt</b> impact on <b>interest</b> rates through the effects of debt on the exchange rate and money demand. The evidence indicates that both transitory and permanent changes in the level of government debt cause higher domestic interest rates and money demand and appreciate the exchange rate in all four countries under study. ...|$|R

30|$|Based on {{the above}} research, if want {{to prevent and}} control the debt risk of Chinese local government, an {{important}} step is to realize {{the relationship between the}} local debt power, responsibility, and interests.

In particular, there are three aspects, which endow the debt power to the local government in real time, assuring the debt responsibility of the local government reasonably, truly transforming the <b>debt</b> <b>interests</b> of the local government.|$|R
60|$|In {{the year}} 1764, Parliament voted 650,000l. towards the {{discharge}} of the navy debt. This sum could not be applied solely to {{the discharge of}} bills carrying interest; because part of the debt due on seamen's wages must have been paid, and some bills carried no interest at all. Notwithstanding this, we find by an account in the journals of the House of Commons, in the following session, that the navy <b>debt</b> carrying <b>interest</b> was, on the 31st of December, 1764, no more than 1,687,442l. I am sure therefore that I admit too much when I admit the navy <b>debt</b> carrying <b>interest,</b> after {{the creation of the}} navy annuities in the year 1763, to have been 2,200,000l. Add the exchequer bills; and the whole unfunded <b>debt</b> carrying <b>interest</b> will be four millions instead of ten; and the annual interest paid for it at 4 per cent will be 160,000l. instead of 299,250l.
