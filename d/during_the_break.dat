5|$|The episode's teleplay {{was written}} by Shana Goldberg-Meehan & Scott Silveri from a story by Michael Borkow (part one) and Jill Condon & Amy Toomin (part two). The episode's genesis came <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>break</b> between seasons three and four, when Channel 4, the British first-run {{broadcaster}} of Friends proposed an episode set in the United Kingdom to the series producers. The proposal fitted neatly with a storyline already being planned, whereby the character of Ross would be married {{at the end of}} the fourth season. The episode was filmed in March 1998 under the direction of executive producer Kevin S. Bright on locations in London, and in front of a live studio audience at The Fountain Studios. Scenes featuring Lisa Kudrow's character Phoebe Buffay were filmed on the show's sets in Burbank, California, as Kudrow was too pregnant to fly to London with the rest of the cast. Kudrow gave birth to her son on the day of the episode's original airing.|$|E

5|$|While {{the cars}} {{waited for the}} restart, work on the cars was allowed and Hamilton's front wing was changed, while Rio Haryanto ended his race. As the race resumed behind the safety car, both Ferrari drivers were running on the super-soft tyre compound, with both Mercedes now {{equipped}} with mediums, which were set to last {{for the rest of}} the race. The running order at the restart was: Vettel, Rosberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Hamilton, Massa, Grosjean, Bottas. Grosjean in ninth was the only driver who had not made a pit stop before the red flag was shown, which allowed him to save one pit stop and change his tyres <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E

25|$|Peter Canavan's {{contribution}} to the game was marvelled throughout the country. He started the match, and was taken off before half time. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>break,</b> and even some way into the second half, he was receiving treatment to his ankle, including having pain killing injections. Then, with seven minutes remaining, he was re-introduced by manager Mickey Harte, a shrewd, albeit necessary, move, considering Canavan was {{the only member of}} the team who had ever played in an All Ireland final before, in 1995.|$|E

25|$|The {{race was}} not held from 1988 to 2001 but was reintroduced in 2002 (along with a goalkicking contest, which only lasted one year). With {{the number of}} league clubs having grown to 16 <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>break</b> in competition, a new format was adopted with the players now split into two groups of eight for the heats (held before the grand final), with the top four from each heat {{advancing}} to the final (held at half-time of the grand final).

25|$|On January 28, 1981 Þeyr {{played at}} Hótel Saga, a date {{referred}} to as the reincarnation of Þeyr, where free haircuts were offered to the audience <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>break.</b> The band started to be acclaimed not only for their stage performances, but also by their accessible {{and at the same time}} creative music. The band was strengthened with the management of Guðni Rúnar Agnarsson, who was the host of the radio show Áfangar, and Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, who also collaborated with the lyrics, some art works and served as an influential figure whose interest on obscurantism was embodied in the lyrics.|$|E
25|$|The two Union forces {{lost contact}} with each other, with no means of {{communicating}} with or supporting each other if anything went wrong. Sigel's attack was successful at first; the brigade arrived in the Confederate rear soon after dawn. Artillery fire routed the Confederate cavalry units, which were encamped at the Sharp's farm. Sigel began a pursuit, but stopped along Skeeg's Branch. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>break,</b> he failed to post skirmishers, leaving his left flank open for an attack. Meanwhile, McCulloch rallied several Confederate units, including the 3rd Louisiana Infantry and the 3rd Division from the Missouri State Guard, to lead a counterattack. Sigel's men mistook the 3rd Louisiana for the 1st Iowa Infantry (which also wore gray uniforms) and withheld their fire until the Confederates were nearly upon them. His flank was consequently devastated by the counterattack, and his brigade was routed, losing four cannons. Sigel and his men fled the field, leaving the force under Lyon, Sweeny, and Sturgis holding out alone.|$|E

25|$|After the {{international}} break, Gabala traveled to Baku to face AZAL on 15 September, and {{they picked up}} their 4th win of the season. AZAL {{took the lead in}} the 3rd minute with Will John scoring, but Mendy struck 5 minutes later to level the game. Danijel Subotić, playing his first game for the club after his registration issues were sorted out <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>break,</b> scored {{what turned out to be}} the winner in the 32nd minute before Amit Guluzade picked up Gabala's second red card of the season for two bookings. Gabala recorded their 5th win, and moved top of the league for the first time in their history, on 20 September, defeating Ravan Baku at home. Subotić scored his second in two appearances in the 8th minute before Levin double the lead 2 minutes later and Leonardo finished off the scoring in the second half. Gabala's last game of September was a 0-0 draw away to Simurq, who played the majority of the game with 10 men following Ilkin Qirtimov's first half red card.|$|E
25|$|The {{chairman}} of the congress stopped Elbegdorj's speech and warned him not to say such things. It was 1989 and Mongolia had been a communist country for 68 years. At that time, it was alleged that every other person was an unofficial communist party spy who would report people who expressed opinions other than socialism and communism. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>break</b> of the congress, two young individuals met Elbegdorj and the three agreed to found a democratic movement and to secretly spread the news to other young people. Later the three met and united with ten other individuals and they are known as the Thirteen Leaders of Mongolia's Democratic Revolution. On his return from the congress, his boss at the newspaper Ulaan Od warned Elbegdorj {{that he would be}} fired if he participated further in any activities out of work or engaged in any conduct inconsistent with communist and socialist ideology. Despite the warning, Elbegdorj and his friends met secretly with other young people in the circle auditorium of the National University of Mongolia and discussed democracy, free market economic policy, and other prohibited subjects of the time, and began to draft a plan to organize a democratic movement. They met many times and brought new friends and new supporters to join them secretly. One night they placed ads of their open demonstration in streets.|$|E
25|$|In economics, {{since the}} late 1970s a {{widening}} gap of economic resources between the developed and underdeveloped regions of Yugoslavia severely deteriorated the federation's unity. The most developed republics, Croatia and Slovenia, rejected attempts to limit their autonomy as provided in the 1974 Constitution. Public opinion in Slovenia in 1987 saw better economic opportunity in independence from Yugoslavia than within it. There were also places that saw no economic benefit from being in Yugoslavia; for example, the autonomous province of Kosovo was poorly developed, and per capita GDP fell from 47 percent of the Yugoslav average in the immediate post-war period to 27 percent by the 1980s. However economic issues have not been demonstrated to be the sole determining factor in the break up of Yugoslavia, as Yugoslavia in this period was the most prosperous Communist state in Eastern Europe at this time period and the country in fact disintegrated {{during a period of}} economic recovery after the implementation of the economic reforms of Ante Marković's government. Furthermore, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>break</b> up of Yugoslavia, the leaders of Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, all declined an unofficial offer by the European Community to provide substantial economic support to them in exchange for a political compromise. However the issue of economic inequality between the republics, autonomous provinces, and nations of Yugoslavia resulted in tensions with claims of disadvantage and accusations of privileges against others by these groups.|$|E
