40|$|The {{objective}} of the present research {{was to investigate the}} thermal injury in the brain after minimally invasive electrosurgery using instruments with copper-doped diamond-like carbon (DLC-Cu) surface coating. The surface morphologies of DLC-Cu thin films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Three-dimensional brain models were reconstructed using magnetic resonance imaging to simulate the electrosurgical operation. In adult rats, a monopolar <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instrument</b> coated with the DLC-Cu thin film was used to generate lesions in the brain. Animals were sacrificed for evaluations on postoperative days 0, 2, 7, and 28. Data indicated that the temperature decreased significantly when minimally invasive electrosurgical instruments with nanostructure DLC-Cu thin films were used and continued to decrease with increasing film thickness. On the other hand, the DLC-Cu-treated device created a relatively small thermal injury area and lateral thermal effect in the brain tissues. These results indicated that the DLC-Cu thin film minimized excessive thermal injury and uniformly distributed the temperature in the brain. Taken together, our study results suggest that the DLC-Cu film on copper electrode substrates is an effective means for improving the performance of electrosurgical instruments...|$|E
40|$|Electrosurgery is used {{in modern}} {{surgical}} practice to cause various desirable clinical effects by invoking I 2 R heating in tissue. The ability to achieve a consistent clinical result is predicated {{on the ability of}} the <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instrument</b> to deliver a well-regulated constant output power, capable of quickly responding to changes in tissue impedance. Yet, electrosurgical devices available today suffer from very poor transient output power regulation, with potential for improvement limited by inherent restrictions in the chosen system architectures. This thesis presents a revolutionary new approach to the design of electrosurgical power supplies by employing current-programmed mode (“CPM”) control strategies to inherently achieve the desired output characteristic: a constant power AC source with maximum voltage and current limits and with near-deadbeat regulation. CPM control of a full-bridge boost inverter and nonlinear carrier-control of a buck converter are presented as new methods of producing constant power source AC outputs. Analysis and small-signal models contained herein demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed constant power control schemes, showing that major sources of non-idealities include peak-to-average error, artificial ramp-induced error, and transient error. The nonlinear carrier controlled buck power source exhibits a transient error dependent {{on the size of the}} inductor, while the CPM controlled boost power source transient error is independent of the inductor size. A prototype ESG employing CPM control generates the ideal output characteristic and achieves near-deadbeat regulation of output power. Maximum voltage- and current-limits are invoked equally quickly. The standard deviation in per-cycle output power during arc cutting is less than 2 %, compared to greater than 25 % in the prior art. Histological analysis of ex vivo tissue samples shows a marked decrease in collateral tissue damage, proving a previously unknown correlation between high-speed output power regulation and thermally-induced tissue necrosis. Simultaneous control of multiple converter stages in the prototype demonstrates the ability to achieve high peak output voltages with low average power using a continuous output carrier: a significant simplification over the prior art...|$|E

30|$|Operative {{hysteroscopy}} {{can also}} be performed using small diameter, continuous flow hysteroscopes which incorporate a small, usually 5 Fr or 7 Fr, diameter working channel down which mechanical or <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instruments</b> can be passed.

These systems usually incorporate their own fluid monitoring equipment but fluid overload can still occur. Smaller diameter operative hysteroscopes are less likely to cause fluid overload due to smaller diameter inflow channels and the generally less invasive nature of procedures that can be undertaken with such technology. However fluid overload may still occur and vigilance when using any operative hysteroscopic technology is mandatory.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the current practice of Dutch gynecologists in the removal of benign endometrial polyps and compare these results with the results of a previous study from 2003. In 2009 Dutch gynecologists were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire about polypectomy. Gynecologists answered questions about their individual performance of polypectomy: setting, form of anesthesia, method, and instrument use. The results were compared with the results from the previous survey. The response rate was 70 % (585 of 837 gynecologists). Among the respondents, 455 (78 %) stated to remove endometrial polyps themselves. Polyps were mostly removed in an inpatient setting (337; 74 %) under general or regional anesthesia (247; 54 %) and under direct hysteroscopic vision (411; 91 %). Gynecologists working in a teaching hospital removed polyps more often in an outpatient setting compared with gynecologists working in a nonteaching hospital [118 (43 %) vs. 35 (19 %) p< 0. 001]. These results are in accordance with the results from 2003. Compared to 2003 there was an increase in the number of gynecologists performing polypectomies with local or no anesthesia [211 (46 %) vs. 98 (22 %), p< 0. 001]. An increase was also noted in the number of gynecologists using direct hysteroscopic vision [411 (91 %) vs. 290 (64 %), p< 0. 001] and 5 Fr <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instruments</b> [181 (44 %) vs. 56 (19 %), p< 0. 001].

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{graduation}} {{project is}} to assess the feasibility of the photonic technology called diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to aid in intraoperative margin assessment {{with the goal of}} obtaining clear margins for liver, breast and soft tissue tumors. The idea is to integrate optical fibers in the existing and widely used electrosurgical knife, which consists of a pencil holder and a blade electrode. The work consists of workflow analyses and experiments. Based on the former the role of DRS in clinical practice can be specified. The main object of the experiments is to find out if DRS is still usable when a layer of coagulated tissue due to electrosurgical activity is present. Lumpectomy workflows using four techniques are investigated. For palpable tumors intraoperative ultrasound (US) and palpation are used, while non-palpable tumors require iodine seeds or placement of a guidewire. The most important limitations of current methods include: no information about the actual margin for iodine seeds and guidewire procedures, complex patient preparation, expertise required to understand US images and lack of reinforced learning for palpation. One advantage of all techniques is that they provide extra information, allowing the surgeon to create a more detailed mental image of the tumor. Ultrasound provides continuous information on the margin, while palpation is very intuitive. DRS integrated into the <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instrument</b> provides distinct benefits in the local assessment phase, including direct feedback on whether or not to make a cut without losing information. DRS sensing should be directed forward, parallel to the axis of the pencil. In the experimental phase the shape and size of the tissue area influenced by electrosurgical treatment is inves- tigated first. It is found that layers of coagulation up to 1. 4 mm may occur in surgery. Next, experiments are performed to identify the effect of coagulation on DRS spectra. Protein denaturation and reduced water con- tent are clearly visible in the diffuse reflectance spectra, resulting in a decreased slope and increased intensities of peaks in the near-infrared (NIR) range. Spectral alterations are severe, requiring further investigation using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Two-layered MC models that consist of coagulated tissue on top of normal tissue are build for coagulation up to 1. 5 mm. Using the slope and peaks described above a predictive model is created, based on a sigmoid fit of these so-called predictors. Coagulation depth is predicted with R 2 values up to 0. 99, indicating a valid model. Two-layered MC models of normal and tumor tissue show that breast tumors can be detected up to 4 mm, liver tumors are visible at 2 mm and lipoma in skeletal muscle can be seen at 5 mm when the fiber distance (FD) = 6 mm. Finally, three-layered MC models of coagulated, normal and tumor tissue yield predictors that strongly differ from tissue without tumor presence. No predictive model for tumor depth is created. The results from this project show that accurate depth determination of coagulation is possible as well as sensing the presence of a tumor within the sensing zone. The latter ensures that DRS may bring at least the same qual- ities as iodine seeds and the guidewire. An important benefit is that DRS provides information on the complete margin, rather than a discrete point. Quantitative depth prediction is required to compete with intraoperative US for invasive tumors. Overall, it was shown that if DRS is successfully developed it can bring important benefits to clinical practice. The effect of tissue coagulation on diffuse reflectance spectra is large, but can be accounted for with a mathemat- ical predictive model. The next crucial step is further investigation of tumor depth sensing and investigation of a complete predictive model. The depth sensing requirements are only completely met for breast tumors. For liver resection, tumors are only detected up to 2 mm. This means that the desired 1 cm margin cannot be safeguarded with DRS. Close margins however are often accepted in clinical practice and do improve patient outcome. DRS integration should not be considered as a replacement for current margin assessment techniques but rather as a complement. Overall, integration of DRS into electrosurgical instruments seems promising. More research is required to see if DRS can truly perform in the OR.

30|$|Hysteroscopy enables {{visualisation}} of the uterine {{cavity and}} allows the diagnosis and surgical treatment of intrauterine pathology. To achieve this, the uterine cavity needs to be distended by a medium which could either be fluid or carbon dioxide [1]. Carbon dioxide is used for diagnostic hysteroscopy, as bleeding during operative procedures obscures visibility. For this reason, fluid media are used for operative procedures, as they allow continuous irrigation giving a clear picture and enable use of both mechanical and <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instruments.</b> During operative hysteroscopy absorption of large volumes of distension solutions can occur leading to serious complications arising from significant fluid overload. Excessive fluid absorption is most likely with prolonged hysteroscopic procedures requiring continuous irrigation of fluid or where blood vessels within the myometrium are opened. Thus, particular care is required with resection of the endometrium (transcervical resection of the endometrium – TCRE) and hysteroscopic myomectomy – transcervical resection of fibroids – TCRF).|$|R

Office polyp removal was carried out under direct hysteroscopic vision using miniature mechanical (scissors, biopsy cups and grasping forceps) or <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instruments</b> (bipolar electrodes), with or without the need for minor degrees of cervical dilatation and local anaesthesia (direct cervical infiltration or paracervical injection). Blind avulsion with small polypectomy forceps was also allowed. Women who chose inpatient polypectomy could have traditional dilatation and curettage or removal under vision using a resectoscope.

30|$|Electrosurgical and {{ultrasonic}} energy {{techniques have}} become indispensable in minimally invasive procedures. These techniques {{are used for}} coagulation, cutting, and hemostasis. The traditional modalities are monopolar and bipolar electrosurgery. Bipolar vessel sealing systems and ultrasonic technologies further improved the efficiency of operations and facilitated the surgical abilities to perform certain procedures. However, each of these energy sources {{can be associated with}} distressing complications. Compared to open surgery, a hazard in laparoscopic procedures is the visual field: the electrical current may damage adjacent structures outside the view of the laparoscope. Laparoscopic surgery presents additional hazards for electrosurgery, the primary ones being direct application, insulation failure, and direct- and capacitive coupling. Both <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instruments</b> and ultrasonic instruments generate heat with the risk of thermal injury. It is important for users to have knowledge of the principles, applications, and safety aspects of the energy sources used in laparoscopy. We reviewed the literature concerning hazards of electrosurgical and ultrasonic energy sources in laparoscopy. Here we describe the specific complications and offer guidance to minimize the risks.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{limitations}} and hazards of monopolar <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instruments</b> in laparoscopic surgery are well known.

40|$|Introduction: Bipolar vessel-sealing devices (VSDs) have {{advantages}} in urological surgeries (less hemorrhage, shorter operating time). However, these instruments can cause thermal injuries, which {{can result in}} neural damage and necrosis. The objectives {{of this study were}} to establish a reproducible in vitro model for standardized assessment of electrosurgical devices and to evaluate whether optimized placement of surgical instruments can reduce the thermal spread. Methods: We evaluated thermal spread of two VSDs in vitro using thin bovine muscle strips. Thermal injury was measured using an infrared camera, temperature probes and histology. The recordings were made with the VSD alone and with a rectangular clamp next to the VSD. Results: Both instruments showed a significant temperature spread of 2. 5 mm lateral to the VSD.

Conclusions: In this study we describe a straightforward clinically relevant in vitro model for the evaluation of future <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instruments.</b> We demonstrated that the thermal spread of VSD could be further reduced by optimized placement of an additional surgical instrument.

30|$|Hysteroscopic {{treatment}} enables lysis of IUAs under direct {{vision and}} with magnification. The uterine distention required for hysteroscopy may itself lyse mild adhesions, and blunt dissection may be performed using only {{the tip of}} the hysteroscope [51]. The more lateral the adhesions and the greater their density, the more difficult the dissection and the greater the risk of complications such as uterine perforation [4, 52]. Monopolar [26, 53 – 56] and bipolar [57 – 59] <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instruments</b> and the Nd-YAG laser [26, 54, 60] have been described as techniques used to lyse adhesions under direct vision, with the advantages of precise cutting and good hemostasis. Disadvantages include potential visceral damage if uterine perforation occurs [8], further endometrial damage predisposing to recurrence of IUAs [61, 62], cost, and the degree of cervical dilation required to accommodate operative instruments. None of these techniques has been compared with any other; consequently, there is no available evidence that one method is superior to any other. Indirect evidence exists to avoid electrosurgery during adhesiolysis owing to the potential risk for further endometrial damage [63]. Mechanical division of adhesions by scissors [7, 26] and needle [64, 65] are described as modes of surgical treatment. Surgical treatment may also take place in an office or outpatient setting with outcomes similar to those in an inpatient setting [66].|$|R

MethodsDuring the study period from October 2010 to October 2012, 458 patients with gallbladder stones underwent LC. A total of 38 patients {{were excluded from the}} study for different reasons. The gallbladder was excised laparoscopically through the traditional method. The gallbladder specimens of the patients were divided into three equal groups randomly, and the distal part of the cystic duct was sealed ex vivo using ligaclips (Group A), HS (Group B), and LS (Group C). The gallbladders were then connected to a pneumatic tourniquet device and we very gradually increased the pressure with air. The bursting pressure of the cystic duct (CDBP) was measured and differences between the three groups were calculated. ResultsThe mean CDBP was 329. 7  ±  38. 8  mmHg in the ligaclip group, 358. 0  ±  33. 1  mmHg in the HS group, and 219. 7  ±  41. 2  mmHg in the LS group. A comparison of the mean CDBP between the groups indicated the superiority of HS over ligaclip and LS. CDBP was significantly higher in the ligaclips group compared with the LS group (p  195  mmHg) than the maximum common bile duct pressure, whereas for LS the CDBP range was 150 – 297  mmHg, indicating that it is not safe for sealing. ConclusionHS is a safe alternative to clips. In fact, it was even safer than clips. By contrast, LS is not safe for cystic duct sealing...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound-guided {{surgery is}} an area of minimally-invasive surgery where {{surgical}} procedures are performed with the aid of ultrasound imaging throghout the operation. This requires the operator to posses a certain degree of experience in endoscopic procedures, and to be adeptly skillfull in conducting US examinations. It is combining and finely tuning together these two elements that allows to perform efficiently an ultrasound-guided surgical procedure. Accessing an affected site correctly is of utmost importance in surgery, being oftentimes decisive in terms of the procedure’s final outcome. In ultrasound-guided procedures, the operative site is accessed percutaneously, with a single point incision, yet tissues situated deeper within are dissected with dissecting techniques in a fluid evironment, typical for this area of surgery. Dissecting techniques in ultrasound-guided surgery are currently divided into basic ones which employ either a hydrodissection needle, surgical <b>instruments,</b> <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instruments,</b> a thread, or a combination thereof, and advanced ones where either a balloon, a hook dissection technique, or a hybrid one is used. Hydrodissection with a needle was devised based on the rule of complementarity, and is the most frequently applied technique in ultrasound-guided surgery. The immense possibilities that go along with this modality will be of huge benefit to any surgeon, regardless of their field. Dissection with a variety of surgical instruments and electrosurgery instruments is a standard practice in all surgery areas, yet the method of imaging we employ in ultrasound-guided surgery results in certain modifications of these techniques. It is, however, learning the thread technique that facilitates a precise and oftentimes extensive dissection. This technique is successfully applied for dissecting muscle, ligament, tendon, vascular and other structures. Having mastered dissecting techniques allows to perform any minimally-invasive procedure efficiently, be they ultrasound-guided, artroscopic, or endoscopic ones.

Kirilyuk Odessa National Medical University, Odessa Abstract Introduction of suture less electro sealing technologies, made its wide use in non-invasive thoracic surgery. Most important use of these methods was seen in performing video thoracoscopic lung resections (VTLR). The aim of the work - to access possibilities of different methods of electro sealing VTLR. Videothoracoscopic wedge resection was performed in 142 patients with different surgical pathologies of chest. Out of which 103 operations were closed methods and 39 were video-assisted. Suture less VTLR were performed with the use of electro sealing complexes: EK- 300 M 1, “LigaSure Valleylab” and <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>instruments.</b> Few patients with suture less methods were additionally sealed with mechanical sutures by using end staplers and traditional stitching apparatus. All the examined patient were discharged from the hospital. Average hospital stay was 7. 8 days. Complications were seen in 7. 7 % cases. Lethality was not registered. High efficiency of VTLR for the diagnosis and treatment of solitary and disseminated lung processes of unknown etiologist and pneumothorax. No evidence in the results and effectiveness of EK 300 M 1 and LigaSure Valleylab in closed and video assisted methods. Criteria for the possibilities of combinations of suture less and mechanical suture in VTLR. Use of VTLR aloe us to minimize the cost of the operation. In the hospital, these methods can be used in closed and video assisted methods in VTLR, but needs further endoscopic electrosealing instruments. Key words: thoracic surgery, minimally invasive interventions, lung resection, electrowelding technologies...|$|R
30|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgery (MIS) is practiced by different surgical disciplines applying similar basic techniques. In 2007, the Dutch Health Care inspectorate indicated {{the need for}} a guideline including multidisciplinary agreements for MIS aiming towards better patient care and safety. A multidisciplinary guideline development group was founded consisting of general surgeons, gynecologists, an anesthesiologist, and an urologist. All members were authorized by their scientific professional associations. Clinically important aspects were identified and discussed. The best available evidence on these aspects was gathered by systematic review. Recommendations for clinical practice were formulated based on the evidence and a consensus of expert opinion. The guideline was externally reviewed by members of the participating scientific associations and their feedback was integrated. Identified important topics were: laparoscopic entry techniques, intra-abdominal pressure, laparoscopic port <b>instruments,</b> <b>electrosurgical</b> techniques, prevention of trocar site herniation, patient positioning, anesthesiology, perioperative care, patient information, multidisciplinary user consultation, and complication registration. The text of each topic contains an introduction with an explanation of the problem and a summary of the current literature. The current available evidence on safety aspects in minimally {{invasive surgery}} is limited. Few conclusions could be deduced from evidence-based data. This underscores the need for larger studies with adequate design and methodology to define conclusions of importance. Above all, the development of this multidisciplinary guideline facilitated a rich discussion, which resulted in a very complete and implementable guideline. This is the second of three papers on the multidisciplinary guideline for minimally invasive surgery, in which we present our literature reviews, conclusions, and practical recommendations for the use of specific port instruments, port site closure, and electrosurgical and ultrasonic techniques.|$|R
