40|$|We {{study the}} effect of quantum noise in 3 by 3 {{entangled}} quantum games. By considering different noisy quantum channels we analyze that how a two-player, three-strategy Rock-Scissor-Paper game {{is influenced by the}} quantum noise. We consider the winning non-transitive strategies R, S and P such as R <b>beats</b> <b>S,</b> <b>S</b> <b>beats</b> P, and P beats R. The game behaves as a noiseless game for maximum value of the quantum noise parameter. It is seen that Alice's payoff is heavily influenced by the depolarizing noise as compared to the amplitude damping noise. Depolarizing channel causes a monotonic decrease in players payoffs as we increase the amount of of quantum noise. In case of amplitude damping channel, the Alice's payoff function reaches its minimum for alpha= 0. 5 and is symmetrical. This means that larger values of quantum noise influence the game weakly. On the other hand, phase damping channel does not influence the game's payoff. Furthermore, the game's Nash equilibrium and non-transitive character of the game are not affected under the influence of quantum noise. Comment: 18 pages, 6. eps figures, 1. eps tabl...|$|R

Wallace Spearmon from the United States won gold with a championship record time of 19.87 <b>s,</b> <b>beating</b> Bolt's respectable time of 19.96 s. Further 200 m honours on both the regional and international stages awaited Bolt in 2007. He yearned to run in the 100 metres but Mills was skeptical, believing that Bolt was better suited for middle distances. The coach cited the runner's difficulty in smoothly starting out of the blocks, and poor habits such as looking back at opponents in sprints. Mills told Bolt that he could run the shorter distance if he broke the 200 m national record. In the Jamaican Championships, he ran 19.75 s in the 200 m, breaking the 36-year-old Jamaican record held by Don Quarrie by 0.11 s.|$|R

Coincidentally, Powell achieved the feat on the same track as Maurice Greene's 1999 world record run of 9.79 s. Wind assistance for Powell was measured at 1.6 m/s, within the IAAF legal limit of 2.0 m/s. Powell again won the 100 m final at the Jamaican National Championships. A groin injury in July cut short his season and forced him to miss the World Championships. His season ended with just two IAAF Grand Prix event wins.

40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] PU for CHE, 1999. This {{dissertation}} investigates Allen Ginsberg's Beat poetry {{within the}} framework of twentieth-century literary developments, from modernism to postmodernism. It is argued that Beat writing is founded on a rejection of the detached, intellectual and formal nature of the high modernism which came to be institutionalised in the American literary practice of the 1950 <b>s.</b> <b>Beat</b> poetry rejects this tradition in favour of an eclectic assemblage of ideas which may, either through direct influence or through parallel development, be linked to certain avant-garde modernist movements. All of these movements share assumptions which support and echo the personal and spiritual vision of Beat aesthetics, as well as its formal experimentation. This eclectic assemblage also involves the assimilation of the ideas of modernist movements often held to be in conflict, embodying opposing strains of modernism. This dynamic is illustrated by analysing the influence of two such opposing modernist influences on Ginsberg's Beat poetry, namely imagism and surrealism. Finally, it is argued that this double gesture of a rejection of the institutionalised form of high modernism and a simultaneous re-assessment of the avant-garde constitutes a crucial step in the development towards postmodernism. Together with the surfacing of postmodernist characteristics in Ginsberg's Beat poetry, this forms the basis for the conclusion that Ginsberg's Beat poetry may be regarded as playing a transitional and initiating role in the literary evolution from modernism to postmodernism.
