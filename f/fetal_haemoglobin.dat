40|$|K 562 cells, a human erythroleukaemic {{cell line}} blocked for differentiation, commit towards {{erythrocytes}} {{when exposed to}} haemin (20 microM). The cells synthesize <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobins</b> and show site-specific binding of caeruloplasmin, a plasma copper protein. These events are set into motion by haemin. On {{the assumption that the}} binding of caeruloplasmin could reflect a greater need for copper, we sought to determine whether the transfer of 67 Cu from caeruloplasmin was accelerated in haemin-induced compared with non-induced K 562 cells. Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) was the recipient. Haemin induction caused the K 562 cells to lose CuZnSOD activity. By 96 h, the level of SOD activity was less than 60 % of that of non-induced cells. The loss was confined entirely to the CuZn form, MnSOD activity staying essentially unchanged. Although CuZnSOD activity declined with the haemin induction, the incorporation of [4, 5 - 3 H]lysine into immunoprecipitable CuZnSOD protein was unaffected. There was also no change in CuZnSOD mRNA concentration in haemin-induced cells. Thus a loss of enzyme did not correlate with a decline in the synthesis de novo of CuZnSOD protein. When 48 h-induced cells were transferred to a medium supplemented with 0. 2 microM-caeruloplasmin, CuZnSOD activity was restored to control levels in 24 h. Caeruloplasmin also stimulated the incorporation of [3 H]lysine into immunoprecipitable CuZnSOD protein. Caeruloplasmin addition may have affected a post-translational regulatory site for CuZnSOD biosynthesis, possibly by providing copper for the newly synthesized enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the major}} {{cause of death in}} western industrialized countries. It is known, that low birth weight is an independent risk factor for glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as other cardiovascular diseases in later life. Barker and Bagby’s developmental origins hypothesis postulates that tissues are permanently influenced by the intrauterine environment, whereas Hattersley and Tooke proposed that low birth weight, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus in later life might all be phenotypes of the same insulin-resistant genotype. Actually it remains unclear whether the association between low birth weight and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adulthood has its origin in utero or whether it develops later in life depending on predisposition and exogenous factors. There are indications that gene mutations {{play an important role in}} the development of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the XbaI GLUT 1 gene polymorphism for the fetal growth and the glucose metabolism. Many studies have examined the XbaI GLUT 1 gene polymorphism in the last years and found significant associations between the XbaI GLUT 1 gene polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults in different populations and ethnic groups. The XbaI polymorphism consists of two alleles and is located in the second intron of the GLUT 1 gene, approximately 4. 5 kbp upstream of exon 3. The polymorphism consists of a guanine (G) being transversed to a thymine (T), which results in the XbaI recognition site being abolished. To investigate the role of the XbaI GLUT 1 gene polymorphism for the fetal growth and the glucose metabolism we performed a prospective epidemiological study. Total glycosylated haemoglobin (TGH) was quantified at delivery in 1034 mother/child pairs, reflecting the average blood glucose level of the last weeks. Genotyping for the XbaI polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based protocols using the previously reported primer sequences and restriction of the PCR product with the XbaI enzyme. Multivariable regression analysis considering gestational age at delivery, the child’s sex, maternal body mass index, and smoking during pregnancy revealed that newborns, which are homozygosis for the A-allele, offered a significant decrease of birth weight with increasing <b>fetal</b> total glycosylated <b>haemoglobin.</b> In contrast, newborns with homozygosis for the B-allele revealed no association between birth weight and <b>fetal</b> total glycosylated <b>haemoglobin.</b> <b>Fetal</b> total glycosylated <b>haemoglobin</b> was quantified as a surrogate of fetal glycaemia, which possibly reflects insulin resistance. Similar to the monitoring of glycosylated haemoglobin in diabetic adults, our approach assumes that increased insulin resistance in utero elevates fetal blood glucose concentrations and consequently the percentage of TGH. Maybe the reason for the significant inverse association between birth weight and <b>fetal</b> total glycosylated <b>haemoglobin</b> in newborns with homozygosis for the A-allele is a reduced fetal insulin secretion and/or insulin sensitivity, which already is present in utero. In summary, our data suggest that the XbaI GLUT 1 gene polymorphism plays an important role concerning the genetic determine linkage between prenatal growth and postnatal sensitivity to insulin...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a two-colour immunocytochemical staining method {{for the detection of}} <b>fetal</b> and embryonic <b>haemoglobin</b> in erythroid cells. The method was applied to study these <b>haemoglobin</b> types in <b>fetal</b> red cells. Specimens from fetal blood (10 weeks), cord blood and fetal liver (14 weeks) as well as chorionic villus samples (10 - 13 weeks) were stained for gamma and epsilon chains using CY 3 and FITC labelled antibodies. Morphometric analysis was applied to determine cell size. Samples from organs involved in early embryonic development contained relatively large erythroblasts expressing the epsilon globin chain (megaloblasts); later in gestation the gamma chain was co-expressed by the same cells which ultimately became smaller and contained HbF (alpha(2) gamma(2)) only. This phenomenon was confirmed in CVS samples in which all cell types were abundantly present. Since fetal erythroblasts are considered candidate cells for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis using FISH, we studied the phenotype of erythroblasts circulating in the maternal blood. The majority of erythroblasts in maternal blood appeared to be of the relatively small gamma globin-containing cell type. However, careful screening of the same maternal blood samples also revealed erythroblasts expressing epsilon or epsilon and gamma globins simultaneously, although at low frequency. Control specimens from non-pregnant women did not show nucleated red cells expressing either of the haemoglobin types. These observations may contribute to the better recognition of fetal cells in the maternal blood for prenatal diagnosis. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine risk factors for fetal anaemia in an area of high malaria transmission in southern Malawi. A case control study was undertaken with fetal anaemia defined as cord haemoglobin (Hb) < 12. 5 g/dl. Between March 1993 and July 1994, pregnant women attending the study hospitals for the first time in that pregnancy were enrolled. Data on socio-economic status, anthropometry, previous obstetric history and current pregnancy were collected. Malaria parasitaemia, Hb levels and iron status were measured in maternal blood at recruitment and delivery and in umbilical venous blood. Fetal anaemia occurred in 23. 4 % of babies. Mean (SD) cord Hb was 13. 6 g/dl (1. 83). Factors associated with fetal anaemia were: birth in the rainy season [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2. 33, 95 % CI 1. 73 - 3. 14], pre-term delivery (AOR 1. 60, 1. 03 - 2. 49), infant Hb < 14 g/dl at 24 hours (AOR 2. 35, 1. 20 - 4. 59), maternal Hb at delivery < 8 g/dl (AOR 1. 61, 1. 10 - 2. 42) or < 11 g/dl (AOR 1. 60, 1. 10 - 2. 31).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{immunohistochemical}} {{features of}} <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> cells and their distribution patterns in solid tumours, such as colorectal cancer and blastomas, suggest that fetal haemopoiesis may {{take place in}} these tumour tissues. These locally highly concentrated <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> (HbF) cells may promote tumour growth by providing a more efficient oxygen supply. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biomarkers of HbF were checked in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder, assessing this as a new parameter for disease management. <b>Fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> was immunohistochemically examined in tumours from 60 patients with TCC of the bladder. <b>Fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> erythrocytes and erythroblasts were mainly clonally distributed in proliferating blood vessels and not mixed with normal haemoglobin erythrocytes. The proportion of such HbF blood vessels could reach {{more than half of}} the total number of vessels. There were often many HbF erythroblasts distributed in one-cell or two-cell capillaries and present as 5 – 15 % of cells in multi-cell vessels. This suggests a local proliferation of HbF-cell progenitors. <b>Fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> cells were prominently marking lower grades of tumours, as 76 % (n 21) of the patients with G 1 pTa were HbFþ, whereas only 6. 7 % (n 30) of the patients with G 3 pT 1 -pT 2 a were HbFþ. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HbF, besides being a potential new marker for early tumour detection, might be an essential factor of early tumour development, as in fetal life.

40|$|The {{inherited}} disorders {{of human}} haemoglobin are {{very common in}} some populations. Relative protection afforded to heterozygous carriers of these conditions against P. falciparum malaria is a likely cause for these high gene frequencies. However, very little is known at the cellular level of how this protective effect works. As an approach to this problem, an in vitro culture technique was developed {{in order to examine}} the factors which might modify the interaction of P. falciparum with human red cells. <b>Fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> was of particular interest as a means of protection, since young infants, who are known to have high levels of this haemoglobin, are relatively resistant to P. falciparum. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that infants heterozygous for thalassaemia and other haemoglobinopathies have higher levels of <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> than expected {{during the first year of}} life. A paucity of parasites was observed in the fetal haemoglobin-containing cells in young infants but this was shown to be due to the predilection of the parasite for metabolically young cells. <b>Fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> was shown to have no effect on the rates of invasion of parasites into cells from a variety of conditions. However <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> caused significant retardation of growth once the parasite had entered the cell. This effect was independent of cell age. Further findings indicated that in the sickling disorders and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency the red cell provided an unfavourable environment for the development of P. falciparum. This was not the case in thalassaemia and haemoglobin C and E traits.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} haematological indices, socioeconomic status, and morbidity in prepubertal growth in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease. METHOD: Height, weight, and haematology were serially recorded in a cohort study of 315 children with SS disease from birth to 9 years at the sickle cell clinic of the University Hospital of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica. RESULTS: Height increment between 3 and 9 years correlated positively with total haemoglobin at age 7 years in boys but not girls. Attained height and weight at age 7 years correlated positively with haemoglobin and <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> in boys but not girls. Only the correlation between haemoglobin and weight showed a significant gender difference. Partial correlation analysis suggested {{that the effect of}} haemoglobin was accounted for by the effect of fetal haemolglobin and further analysis indicated that height correlated with F reticulocyte count (a measure of <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> production) in both sexes but not with the ratio of F cells to F reticulocytes (a measure of F cell enrichment). Growth was not significantly related to mean red cell volume, proportional reticulocyte count, alpha thalassaemia, socioeconomic status, or morbidity. CONCLUSION: A high concentration of <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> in boys with SS disease is associated with greater linear growth. It is postulated that in boys, low concentrations of <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> increase haemolysis and hence metabolic requirements for erythropoiesis, putting them at greater risk of poor growth.

Enrolment was based on clinical vasoocclusive severity and few studies included children with cerebrovascular events. Hydroxyurea enhanced <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> expression in almost all the children, despite a large inter-individual variability. Hydroxyurea signifi cantly reduces the number of vasoocclusive crises, hospitalisations, the frequency of the acute chest syndrome and the rate of transfusion. Long-term tolerance to hydroxyurea is good. However, clinical response does not correlate consistently with the degree and with the time of increment in <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin,</b> suggesting that hydroxyurea may mediate some of its clinical benefi ts through other mechanisms such as the reduction of sickle erythrocytes – endothelial cells adherence and of the vasoconstrictive stimulus...|$|E
40|$|Whereas the {{addition}} of four moles of zinc acetate to one of normal human haemoglobin at pH 7. 4 results in a clear solution, addition to unstable haemoglobin results in precipitate formation. Within certain limits no false-positive results are obtained with methaemoglobin, and with <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin.</b> With excess zinc, normal haemoglobin also precipitates, but this process is reversible {{and can be used}} for a rapid concentration of dilute solutions of normal haemoglobin...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary {{persistence}} of <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> (HPFH) is a clinically important {{condition in which}} {{a change in the}} developmental specificity of the gamma-globin genes results in varying levels of expression of <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> in the adult. The condition is benign and can significantly alleviate the symptoms of thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia when co-inherited with these disorders. We have examined structure-function relationships in the - 117 HPFH gamma promoter by analysing the effect of mutating specific promoter elements on the functioning of the wild-type and HPFH promoters. We find that CCAAT box mutants dramatically affect expression from the HPFH promoter in adult blood but have little effect on embryonic/fetal expression from the wild-type promoter. Our results suggest that there are substantial differences {{in the structure of the}} wild-type gamma promoter expressed early in development and the adult HPFH promoter. Together with previous results, this suggests that gamma silencing is a complex multifactorial phenomenon rather than being the result of a simple repressor binding to the promoter. We present a model for gamma-globin gene silencing that has significant implications for attempts to reactivate the gamma promoters in human adults by pharmacological means...|$|E
40|$|Multi-wavelength photometers, blood gas {{analysers}} and pulse oximeters {{are widely used}} to measure various oxygen-related quantities. The definitions of these quantities are not always correct. This paper gives insight in the various definitions for oxygen quantities. Furthermore, the possible influences of dyshaemoglobins and <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> on the accuracy of pulse oximetry are discussed. As pulse oximeters are constructed for the determination of arterial oxygen saturation, they should be validated with sample oxygen saturation values and not with the oxyhaemoglobin fraction. The influence of carboxyhaemoglobin is insubstantial over an oxygen saturation range of 0 % to 100 %. Through the presence of methaemoglobin, pulse oximetry will give an underestimation above 70 % and an overestimation below 70 % oxygen saturation. The influence of <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> is insignificant in the neonatal use of pulse oximetry, {{in the range of}} 75 % to 100 % arterial oxygen saturation. However, a pulse oximeter underestimates the arterial oxygen saturation at the 25 % level with 5 %, if the pulse oximeter has been calibrated in human adults. Such a low level of arterial oxygen saturation can be present in the fetus during labor...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThalassaemia is a {{group of}} {{inherited}} haemoglobin disorders characterized by reduced synthesis of {{one or more of the}} globin chains leading to imbalanced alpha /non-alpha globin production. These disorders display remarkable diversity in the severity, mainly related to the degree of chain imbalance and to the innate ability to produce <b>fetal</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> in adult life. Several genetic factors have recently been shown to influence HbF levels in beta-thalassaemia and may lead to new strategies to modify the disease course of severe haemoglobin disorders...|$|E
