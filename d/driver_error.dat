5|$|On 10 March 2000, a {{passenger}} train collided {{with an empty}} stock train in platform 5 due to <b>driver</b> <b>error.</b> Thirty-five people were injured. On 15 August 2017, a Class 456 electric multiple unit collided with an engineers' train at the station. The passenger train was derailed, causing disruption {{for the remainder of}} the day. Three people were checked for injuries, but nobody was hospitalised.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{was followed by}} a national day of mourning in Canada, and a ban on all E350 Ford Club Wagon type vehicles being used for student transport in New Brunswick. Two investigations, one by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the other by Transport Canada, found that the cause of the disaster was a combination of poor road conditions, lack of proper snow tires, and possible <b>driver</b> <b>error.</b> Pressure from the public and victims' families prompted the chief coroner of the province to launch an inquiry, which produced recommendations to improve student transport safety in New Brunswick. The provincial government agreed with the majority of the suggestions and has since enacted many of them.|$|E
5|$|Transport Canada {{released}} its report on July 30, 2008. It blamed weather conditions, but also focused on driver fatigue and <b>driver</b> <b>error.</b> It cited several breaches of provincial law regarding {{the operation of}} commercial vehicles. The coach had been on duty for sixteen hours when the collision happened, contravening the law that one cannot drive {{if they have been}} working more than fourteen consecutive hours. The report also identified inadequate pre-trip inspections and log book keeping, and the lack of a contingency plan in the event of poor weather. Transport Canada stated that although they put an added emphasis on some factors, their report was consistent with the RCMP's. They concurred that the vehicle would have failed an inspection in its pre-collision state because of worn tires and brakes.|$|E
50|$|On 22 November 1871, a head-on {{collision}} {{due to a}} <b>driver's</b> <b>error</b> and inadequate signalling resulted in a derailment. Fourteen people were injured in the incident.|$|R
50|$|On 4 August 1909, a motor-train hauled by Terrier No.83 Earlswood {{collided}} with the buffers at Brighton, due to the <b>driver's</b> <b>error.</b> Nineteen people were injured.|$|R
50|$|Assistant Shunter Morland - The shunter {{had seen}} the <b>drivers</b> <b>error</b> and had failed to act despite having {{the power to do}} so. Had Shunter Morland taken the {{initiative}} the accident might have been prevented.|$|R
25|$|A {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} the cause of the accident was a signalling error. <b>Driver</b> <b>error</b> was not ruled out, however.|$|E
25|$|On 23 June 1869, two trains {{collided}} at New Cross Gate, Surrey due to <b>driver</b> <b>error,</b> {{excessive speed}} and guard error, injuring 91 people.|$|E
25|$|On 26 November 1921, {{a serious}} {{accident}} {{occurred on the}} Midland half of New Street station, when an express from Bristol crashed into the rear of a stationary train to Derby, which was standing at platform four and had been delayed due to engine trouble. The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to telescope with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured. The later inquest ruled that the express had overrun the danger signal due to <b>driver</b> <b>error,</b> and the misty conditions had made the rails moist, leading to wheelslip when the train tried to brake.|$|E
50|$|ACC {{technology}} {{is widely regarded}} as a key component of any future generations of intelligent cars. They impact driver safety and convenience as well as increasing capacity of roads by maintaining optimal separation between vehicles and reducing <b>driver</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{expected}} championship challenge {{never materialized}} in 1998. Unreliability, <b>driver</b> <b>errors</b> and the inferior {{performance of the}} Goodyear tires compared to the Firestone tires all combined to leave de Ferran 12th in the standings, again with no wins in the year.|$|R
5000|$|The 2007 {{season was}} {{generally}} disappointing, with poor reliability and <b>driver</b> <b>errors</b> {{leading to a}} low finishing record.

25|$|On 13 October 1956 a {{passenger}} train hauled by Class 8F 2-8-0 WD512 {{was involved in}} a head-on collision with a permanent way train hauled by 0-6-0 diesel shunter WD877 Bari between Weaversdown Halt and Liss Forest Road stations. Six soldiers who were in a brake van behind the diesel locomotive were killed and eight were injured. The cause of the accident was <b>driver</b> <b>error</b> {{on the part of the}} driver of the passenger train, who had entered the section without authority. This was compounded by the signalling arrangements at Liss Forest Road, where there was no trap point to prevent the train entering the section after passing a danger signal.|$|E
25|$|Full {{automation}} commonly {{defined as}} requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished {{through a combination}} of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway. Fully automated driving would, in theory, allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds, which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible, politically unacceptable, or prohibitively expensive. Automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for <b>driver</b> <b>error,</b> which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes. Other potential benefits include improved air quality (as a result of more-efficient traffic flows), increased fuel economy, and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems.|$|E
25|$|The inquiry {{recommended}} {{the introduction of}} the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, although it is not certain this would have prevented the accident (ATP guards against <b>driver</b> <b>error,</b> not installation error). Following the Clapham Junction accident and two other fatal accidents in early 1989, British Rail was keen to implement the ATP system across the entire British railway network. However, the cost (estimated at over Â£1bn) was baulked at by the Conservative government, who were preparing the company for privatisation. In the end, two different proprietary systems were trialled, TBL on the Great Western Main Line and SELCAB on the Chiltern Main Line, but neither system was rolled-out across the network. Today, all First Great Western's HSTs are fitted with ATP and are not permitted to carry passengers unless the system is functioning.|$|E
50|$|The Bourne End rail crash {{occurred}} on 30 September 1945 when an overnight sleeping-car express train from Scotland to London Euston derailed {{due to a}} <b>driver's</b> <b>error.</b> 43 people were killed, making it Britain's joint seventh worst rail disaster in terms of death toll.|$|R
40|$|Collision {{avoidance}} system (CAS), {{with the}} help of surrogate safety measures is a beneficial tool for reducing <b>driver</b> <b>errors</b> and preventing rear-end collisions. One of the most well-known surrogate safety measures to detect rear-end conflicts is Time-to-collision (TTC). TTC refers to the time remaining before the rear-end accident if the course and the speed of vehicles are maintained constant. Different surrogate measures have been derived from TTC; however, the most important are Time Exposed Time-to-collision (TET) and Time Integrated Time-to-collision (TIT). In this paper a new surrogate safety measure based on TTC notion has been developed. This new indicator merges TET and TIT into one measure and gives a score between 0 and 100 %, as the probability of collision. Applying this indicator in CAS as a safety measure will be more useful than TET&TIT, to reduce <b>driver</b> <b>errors</b> and rear-end collisions. </p...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} week that the road was open, 15 {{accidents}} occurred and 3 people were killed. By July 8, 2015 (three weeks after the toll road was opened), there were 56 accidents with 12 people killed. Most of the accidents were caused by <b>driver</b> <b>errors</b> such as sleep-deprived driving, speeding, and using the emergency lane at high speed.|$|R
25|$|A report dated 13 June 2008 by the 'Marine Corps Center for Lessons Learned' {{indicated}} {{concerns about}} MRAP vehicles rolling over in combat zones. The V-shaped hulls of the MRAP {{give it a}} higher center of gravity {{and the weight of}} the MRAP can cause the poorly built or maintained roads in rural Iraq or Afghanistan to collapse. Of the 66 MRAP accidents between 7 November 2007 and 8 June 2008, almost 40 were due to rollovers caused by bad roads, weak bridges, or <b>driver</b> <b>error.</b> In many of the rollovers, troops were injured, and in two separate incidents five soldiers have been killed by rolling over into a canal and getting trapped under water. The report said 75% of all rollovers occurred in rural areas often where roads are above grade with an adjacent ditch or canal. The report raised concerns associated with MRAP vehicles snagging on low-hanging power lines in Iraq or its antennas getting close enough to create an electric arc, which may lead to the electrocution of the passengers. The person located in the gunner's hatch is at the highest risk.|$|E
500|$|On 3 February 1912, {{approximately}} 86 {{people were}} injured when a train hit the buffer stops as it arrived from [...] An estimated 860 passengers were aboard at the time. <b>Driver</b> <b>error</b> and excessive speed were blamed.|$|E
500|$|On 1 April 2017, a {{passenger}} train {{operated by a}} Class 158 diesel multiple unit from [...] collided with the buffer stops at a speed of [...] on arrival. Fifteen people were injured. The cause was <b>driver</b> <b>error.</b>|$|E
40|$|During this project, {{developing}} {{image segmentation}} software for {{different types of}} processors {{was found to be}} challenging due to several factors, such as <b>driver</b> <b>errors,</b> processor differences, and the need for low level memory handling. Therefore a novel framework for heterogeneous medical image computing and visualization was developed. This framework aims {{to make it easier to}} simultaneously process and visualize medical images efficiently on heterogeneous computer systems...|$|R
50|$|Ludwig von Stockert (1913) {{proposed}} a classification of accidents by their effects (consequences); e.g. head-on collisions, rear-end collisions, derailments. Schneider and Mase (1971) {{proposed a}}n additional classification by causes; e.g. <b>driver's</b> <b>errors,</b> signalmen's errors, mechanical faults. Similar categorisations {{had been made}} by implication in previous books e.g. Rolt (1956), but Stockert's and Schneider/Mase's are more systematic and complete. With minor changes, they represent best knowledge.|$|R
5000|$|Massa also {{retired from}} several races after <b>driver</b> <b>errors</b> and {{collisions}} with other cars, most notably at the Italian Grand Prix. His contact with Pedro de la Rosa's Jaguar {{earned him the}} sport's inaugural ten-place grid penalty for the next race at Indianapolis, and Sauber opted to replace him with the highly experienced Heinz-Harald Frentzen for that race, and ultimately the [...] season as well.|$|R
500|$|The {{excessive}} {{volume of}} traffic on Deerfoot Trail is a contributing factor to the 10,000 collisions recorded between 2002 and 2007, including 24 fatalities. [...] Constable Jeff Klatt of the Calgary Police Service stated {{that there is a}} [...] "consensus among police officers that itâs dangerous to do traffic stops" [...] on Deerfoot Trail. [...] A 1993 incident in which a stolen vehicle struck and killed a police officer on Deerfoot was the catalyst for the Calgary Police Service's acquisition of a helicopter. [...] 2013 statistics confirmed that Deerfoot Trail had more crashes and traffic jams than any other road in Calgary. [...] Deerfoot has many entrances and exits in close proximity which exacerbates problems, but some have attributed a portion of the congestion to <b>driver</b> <b>error.</b> Constable Jim Lebedeff of the Calgary Police Service stated, [...] "a lot of people donât understand, or donât want to understand, how to merge properly.â [...] 30% of respondents to a 2016 poll stated that the main reason they avoid Deerfoot Trail is because they do not feel safe on the freeway.|$|E
500|$|PayÃ¡'s {{daughter}} Rosa MarÃ­a {{stated that}} her father died after the rental car {{in which he was}} traveling was rammed several times by another car. PayÃ¡'s son Oswaldo added that his father had received numerous death threats and stated that the accident's survivors had reported that the car had been deliberately driven off the road. [...] The official statement by the Cuban government said that the driver lost control of the vehicle and collided with a tree. The MCL stated that [...] "the circumstances of these deaths have not been cleared up and are open to hypothesis" [...] and demanded a [...] "transparent" [...] inquiry into the accident. On 27 July, the Cuban Interior Ministry forwarded an official report to foreign press, blaming <b>driver</b> <b>error</b> and quoting Carromero as saying that the car had skidded off the road due to poor road conditions and bad weather. PayÃ¡'s widow rejected the report, stating that the crash was not an accident and that a government report could not be trusted.|$|E
500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars. Evans said his improved performance encouraged everyone working for the team and it gave Jaguar more confidence: [...] "If you look at the bigger picture, Iâve got to be satisfied with today. Qualifying was great, to be honest, I topped the group. If you ask me or the whole team if this would have happened after Marrakesh, we would have taken it with both hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by <b>driver</b> <b>error</b> or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Kelly {{finished}} the championship in seventh place and Skaife in twelfth {{after one of}} his worst seasons on record where it included a number of <b>driver</b> <b>errors</b> and reliability issues. For the endurance events Jason Plato joined Peter Brock in the second car. Skaife and Kelly {{finished the}} Bathurst 1000 in fourteenth position, two laps down after a belt from the engine broke early in the race.|$|R
50|$|On 15 February 2012, a FLIRT unit {{used for}} tests and driver education, without passengers, derailed near Holmestrand in Norway, {{injuring}} five people. The train had been entering a bend at 135 km/h {{instead of the}} allowed maximum speed of 70 km/h. The train driver was convicted of negligence but given a conditional discharge by the court who also faulted the lack of safety systems that could catch the <b>driver's</b> <b>error.</b>|$|R
40|$|Human error, its {{causes and}} consequences, {{and the ways}} in which it can be prevented, remain of great {{interest}} to road safety practitioners. This paper presents the findings derived from an on-road study of <b>driver</b> <b>errors</b> in which 25 participants drove a pre-determined route using MUARC's On-Road Test Vehicle (ORTeV). In-vehicle observers recorded the different errors made, and a range of other data was collected, including driver verbal protocols, forward, cockpit and driver video, and vehicle data (speed, braking, steering wheel angle, lane tracking etc). Participants also completed a post trial cognitive task analysis interview. The drivers tested made a range of different errors, with speeding violations, both intentional and unintentional, being the most common. Further more detailed analysis of a sub-set of specific error types indicates that <b>driver</b> <b>errors</b> have various causes, including failures in the wider road 'system' such as poor roadway design, infrastructure failures and unclear road rules. In closing, a range of potential error prevention strategies, including intelligent speed adaptation and road infrastructure design, are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|There was initial {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} the accident was caused by a <b>driver</b> <b>error</b> or a deflating rear tyre, and the Lotus was investigated thoroughly by aircraft crash investigators for three weeks. Many drivers including Surtees and Brabham were convinced that the crash was caused by a deflating rear tyre and were adamant {{that it was not a}} driver errorâsimply because they believed Clark was not capable of making such a mistake. According to Andrew Marriott of the classic journal Motor Sport who was covering the race as a young reporter [...] "Deaths in the sport were a regular occurrence in those days, but surely someone of Clark's sublime talent and skill? People reckoned that the rear tyre had deflated, and there is another theory that the mechanical metering unit [...] on the Cosworth FVA engine had seized and caused Clark to crash." ...|$|E
2500|$|For a {{full year}} before the Metrorail system's opening, a program to prepare drivers to share Houston streets with the Metrorail trains was conducted, {{consisting}} of driver safety classes, community forums and public service announcements. By August the system averaged six crashes per month, 20 times worse {{than the national average}} for light rail systems. The high rate of incidents gave rise to local derogatory nicknames among detractors such as the [...] "Wham Bam tram" [...] and [...] "Danger Train." [...] METRO has consistently blamed <b>driver</b> <b>error</b> as the cause of the high collision rate and the transit agency's police department regularly tickets motorists who cross paths with the train. An independent panel of transportation experts at Texas A University issued a report in 2004 finding no fundamental flaws with the Metrorail system, although this report did recommend minor adjustments to signal timing and signage.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] Ferrari's new car, the F1/86 {{designed}} by Harvey Postlethwaite, {{proved to be}} slower and less reliable than its predecessor as Alboreto retired from a total of nine races: only two of those retirements are counted as <b>driver</b> <b>error</b> while the remaining seven were mechanical failures. Alboreto only scored one podium, at the Austrian Grand Prix â even then both Williams cars of Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet had retired and Alboreto finished a full lap behind race winner Alain Prost. The Italian finished the season ninth in the Divers' Championship with fourteen points. While the Ferrari V6 turbo was rated {{as one of the}} more powerful engines on the grid, both Alboreto and team mate Stefan Johansson were hampered by the F1/86 which refused to handle on tracks which had a bumpy surface. Johansson finished 5th in the championship with 23 points despite being the #2 driver in the team, causing many to question why the team chose to re-sign Alboreto and let Johansson go.|$|E
25|$|For graphics, Windows Vista {{introduces}} a new {{as well as}} major revisions to Direct3D. The new display driver model facilitates the new Desktop Window Manager, which provides the tearing-free desktop and special effects that are the cornerstones of the Windows Aero graphical user interface.

50|$|The {{race was}} also the first time an LMP2 class car has taken first, both in {{qualifying}} and the race. The No. 42 Strakka Racing HPD ARX-01C achieved such feat, with LMP2 cars running comparatively in lap times in the practice sessions, qualifying, and the race, sweeping the top six positions in the race overall, while most of the LMP1 cars suffered from reliability issues and/or <b>driver</b> <b>errors</b> throughout the day-to-night race; the best finisher was the No. 5 Beechdean Mansell Ginetta-Zytek.|$|R
40|$|<b>Driver</b> <b>errors</b> {{related to}} visual and {{cognitive}} distraction were {{studied in the}} context of the Lane Change Test (LCT). New performance metrics were developed in order to capture the specific effects of visual and cognitive distraction. In line with previous research, it was found that the two types of distraction impaired driving in different ways. Visual, but not cognitive, distraction led to reduced path control. By contrast, only cognitive distraction affected detection and recognition/response selection. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed...|$|R
