40|$|Encontro realizado em Alacalá de Henares (Madrid), de 22 a 25 de Setembro de 2014 Dialkyl adipates are a {{class of}} esters {{materials}} used as components of lubricants and plasticizers. Diffusion of plasticizers in polymers is a complex process {{that is difficult to}} study [1]. As a contribution to understand this phenomenon, the self-diffusion coefficients of five dialkyl <b>adipates</b> (<b>dimethyl,</b> diethyl, dipropyl, dibuthyl and bis(2 -ethylhexyl)) were measured by the PFGSTE method in the temperature range 20 to 60 ºC. It was shown that these compounds follow the Stokes-Einstein equation [2]. In effect, the self-diffusion coefficients change linearly with T. η- 1 (η is the viscosity). The dependence of the activation energies for self-diffusion is discussed in terms of size and branching of the alkyl chains of the adipates. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were done for these sytems in order to predict the diffusion coefficients as a function of temperature [3].

40|$|International audienceIntroduction Modern {{lubricants}} {{are complex}} formulations, which are continually developed to meet increasing requirements for performance and durability [1]. In {{the scope of}} the investigation of more benign lubricants, as potential replacements of oils currently used, we have focused our attention on the diesters (adipates), which have excellent properties for industrial applications. Diesters are obtained by reacting a linear or branched diacid, with a monofunctional alcohol. In the case of adipates, 1, 6 -hexanoic diacid, also named adipic acid, is used. In the present work <b>dimethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DMA), diethyl adipate (DEA) and diisobutyl adipate (DiBA) have been studied over wide pressure and temperature intervals. The analysis of the effect of the molecular size is performed in terms of volumetric properties (density, isothermal compressibility and thermal isobaric expansivity), together with viscosity and viscosity index. Experimental The density  as a function of pressure and temperature was measured with a high pressure vibrating tube densimeter Anton Paar DMA HPM which is adequate to perform measurements up to 140 MPa. The calibration of this equipment has been performed with vacuum, water and decane [2]. Viscosity at atmospheric pressure was measured with a rotational automated viscometer Anton Paar Stabinger SVM 3000. We have verified the viscosity uncertainty of this viscometer with two Canon reference fluids S 60 and N 100, finding that the deviations are lower than 1 %. Results and Discussion Density measurements have been performed from 293. 15 to 403. 15 K and up to 140 MPa. The experimental density values have been correlated successfully using a Tait-type equation. In Figure 1 it can be seen the molecular structure of dialkyl adipates and the density behavior. At fixed temperature and pressure, density follows the trend DMA > DEA > DiBA. So, it decreases with the molecular size (molar weight or number of carbon atoms). The behavior of the isothermal compressibility for two temperatures can be also seen in Figure 1. This property decreases with pressure and increases with temperature for the three adipates. Furthermore, an increase on T occurs when the molecular size of the molecule increases. Similar behavior has been previously found for other fluids such as pentaerythritol ester lubricants [3]. The effect of changing the temperature or the pressure has more impact on the values of the isothermal compressibility than on the isobaric thermal expansivity...|$|E
40|$|Lignin {{is a major}} {{component}} of lignocellulosic biomass and could be an important renewable feedstock in industry for the production of (aromatic) bulk and fine chemicals. To this end, the development of new catalytic processes is required; both to depolymerise the biopolymer into small aromatic building blocks, as well as to further convert these to valuable products. A major challenge in lignin depolymerisation is the recondensation of reactive fragments back to larger, more recalcitrant, fragments. In this thesis, this was circumvented by employing a tandem catalytic depolymerisation procedure. One catalyst, a water-stable Lewis acid, such as scandium triflate, was shown to be responsible for cleaving ether bonds between the lignin monomers, while a second rhodium-based catalyst further converted the liberated small fragments to stable end-products. The rhodium catalyst was shown to have two possible modes of action and the interplay between both catalyst components was shown to be crucial for determining the ultimate product selectivity. Consequently the desired product streams could be chosen: when using a weak Lewis acid, the major products of depolymerisation were 4 -(1 -propenyl) phenols, whereas when using strong Lewis acids, the major products were 4 -methylphenols. The selective oxidation of catechol was studied as a potential route for valorisation of small lignin-derived aromatics. Using an iron(III) complex with a tris(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine ligand as catalyst and molecular oxygen as the reagent, catechol could be readily and selectively converted to derivatives of cis,cis-muconic acid, under mild conditions (50 °C, atmospheric pressure of air). Further two-stage conversion by hydrogenation and transesterification, using commercially available supported catalysts, allowed the isolation of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> in 62 % yield. A systematic investigation of the reaction conditions furthermore allowed the activity of the oxidation step to be increased 35 -fold under optimal conditions (80 °C, 25 bar 5 % O 2 in N 2, 0. 1 mol% catalyst). The catalytic oxidative cleavage reaction was also demonstrated to work directly on catechols obtained from catalytic depolymerisation of candlenut lignin, although the yield of cleavage products found was lower in that case. In addition, the propyl substituent of the lignin-derived catechols drives isomerisation of the cis,cis-muconic acid, leading to significant formation of g-muconolactones instead. The mechanism of this unique and highly selective oxidative carbon-carbon cleavage reaction was investigated using a combined experimental and theoretical study. Based on the combined results, a mechanism is proposed where iron is able to act as a ‘redox’ buffer by taking on an intermediate spin state, enabling the spin-forbidden electron transfer from the catecholate moiety to oxygen. This leads to formation of a bridging peroxide intermediate, which undergoes facile homolytic splitting, leading to oxygen insertion into the aromatic catechol ring. The rate-determining step was found to be the formation of the bridging peroxide. Crucially, the experimentally observed effect of both substrate and ligand substitution was accurately reproduced by the computational study, lending credibility to the mechanism. Importantly, results on other ligand systems reported in literature can now also be understood using this mechanism...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the synthesis, {{characterization}} and applications of aliphatic segmented poly(ester amide) s (PEA) s for use as potential biomaterials. Three different series of PEAs with different microstructures containing isolated, two and three adjacent amide groups within a polybutylene adipate (PBA) chain have been synthesized. Analytical techniques such as NMR (liquid and solid-state), SEC, DSC, FT-IR, WAXD and microscopy (AFM, SEM, optical) have been extensively used to characterize the synthesized monomers and PEAs. Thermal properties have been determined and correlated to features like morphology and crystallization behaviour; structure-property relationship of these polymers were established. The preparation of tailor made monomers for the synthesis of PEAs {{was carried out by}} ring opening of epsilon-caprolactam, epsilon-caprolactone or delta-valerolactone with 1, 4 -diaminobutane, 4 -aminobutanol, 3 -aminopropanol and/or 2 -aminoethanol. These preformed monomers which are alpha,omega-diamines, alpha,omega-amino alcohols or alpha,omega-diols, each containing an in-built amide bond, were obtained in high purity and yields. Synthesis of the PEAs containing an isolated amide group, two or three adjacent amide groups was achieved by a two-step melt polycondensation of the preformed monomers with 1, 4 -butanediol and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>adipate.</b> In the first step, trans-esterification was carried out so as to avoid a random microstructure and hence, PEAs with segmented microstructure could be obtained. In the second step, polycondensation took place. Further, the amide content in each series could be varied by taking different ratios of the preformed monomer to 1, 4 -butanediol. High molecular weight PEAs were obtained in good yield and NMR analyses showed that no side reactions had taken place. Thermal analyses revealed that the length of the amide segment, functional groups participating in the crystallization process as well as the amide concentration influenced the transition temperatures and their enthalpies. For the three-adjacent amide series, mainly the amide groups crystallize and only a single endotherm and exotherm was seen. The melting and crystallization temperature increase with increasing amide content. Similar trend was also observed for the two-adjacent amide series of PEAs but here, both ester and amide groups co-crystallize and show multiple endotherms and exotherms. In the isolated amide series, mainly ester groups formed the hard domains and only at very high amide content, ester-amide co-crystallization was observed. FT-IR analyses revealed that the PEAs crystallize mainly in the alpha-form found in even-even nylons and the chains are bridged via hydrogen bonds. Morphology of the two-adjacent amide series of PEAs was investigated in detail using solid state NMR analyses. Spin diffusion experiments were performed to determine the domain sizes of the rigid, interface and mobile phases. A correlation of these domain sizes with the amide content in the PEA was successfully established. 13 C solid state NMR analyses gave information about the functional groups participating in the crystalline and amorphous phases which were in line with the observed thermal properties. The hydrolytic degradation of the synthesized PEAs was evaluated in PBS buffer at 37 °C over a time period of 24 weeks. The PEAs showed slow degradation kinetics and a maximum mass loss of 7 % over the entire time period which proceeded by cleavage of the ester bonds. Further, PEA foils sustain cell growth and are non-cytotoxic to mouse fibroblasts (L 929) cells. Electrospinning of the two-adjacent amide series of PEAs was carried out from solution in order to obtain non wovens for tissue engineering purposes. Among a series of solvents and solvent mixtures used, CHCl 3 /HCOOH mixtures gave the best results. Small amounts of formic acid were added to break the hydrogen bonds in the polymers. Effect of polymer concentration, microstructure and applied voltage on the resulting fibre diameter and morphology were also studied. Fibre quality and homogeneity enhanced with increasing amide content and polymer concentration and these factors played a decisive role in obtaining uniform, randomly oriented, homogeneous fibres in the nanometre range...|$|E
