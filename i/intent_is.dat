5|$|The role of <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only {{one of the}} modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person is guilty of it, whether or not he had an intention to commit it.|$|E

The standard is designed to coexist with the previous USB Battery Charging specification.|$|E

Included on the calendar are musicians and artists who are associated with the Church, but are not typically thought of as “saints” in the classical sense. The <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals who have served the Church through their vocations rather than simply commemorating the outstanding among the religious.|$|E

During a visit, Winter receives a letter threatening the kidnapping of General Wheeler by the prisoners. After ordering his men into action, Winter discovers that the scheme was a fake orchestrated by Irwin to detect how prison guards would react during an actual uprising.|$|E

40|$|Do {{different}} cultures hold {{different views of}} intentionality? In four studies, participants read scenarios in which the actor's distal intent (a focus on a broader goal) and proximal intent (a focus on {{the mechanics of the}} act) were manipulated. In Studies 1 - 2, when distal <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> more prominent in the actor's mind, North Americans rated the actor more responsible than did Chinese and South Asian participants. When proximal <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> more prominent, Chinese and South Asian participants, if anything, rated the actor more responsible. In Studies 3 - 4, when distal <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> more prominent, male Americans rated the actor more responsible than did female Americans. When proximal <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> more prominent, females rated the actor more responsible. The authors discuss these findings in relation to the literatures on moral reasoning and cultural psychology...|$|R

5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work for restoring F-BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently not very well known, and it is still being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015, the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120million for a static display and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget, restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019, to coincide with the 50thanniversary of Concorde's first flight.|$|E
5|$|The dining room, {{originally}} the library, {{was designed by}} Lewis Wyatt in about 1808. Wyatt extended the room and added a shallow, semi-circular apse at one end. It features decorative plasterwork on both the ceiling and walls, but is largely unadorned. Wyatt implemented a design featuring gilded acanthus leaves and vines on the ceiling with large-scale egg-and-dart molding around the upper sections of the wall, scagiola columns and a black marble fireplace with bronze ornamentation. Wyatt's alteration works at Rode Hall {{are influenced by the}} style of Sir John Soane, and he described his designs for the interiors as an 'experiment in primitive simplicity... At Rode the primitivist <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> emphasized by the total absence of an entablature.' The room is furnished with original pieces of furniture designed and made by the English manufacturer Gillows of Lancaster and London; of note is the mahogany dining-table and the semi-circular sideboard built into the apse. A Royal Crown Derby dinner service, purchased by Mary Wilbraham-Bootle for her son Randle Wilbraham III in 1809, is on display here.|$|E

40|$|Two {{components}} of lay observers’ calculus of moral judgment <b>are</b> proximal <b>intent</b> (the actor’s mind {{is focused on}} performing the action) and distal intent (the actor’s mind {{is focused on the}} broader goal). What causes observers to prioritize one form of intent over the other? The authors observed whether construal level (Studies 1 - 2) and beliefs about free will (Studies 3 - 4) would influence participants’ sensitivity to the actor’s proximal versus distal intent. In four studies, participants read scenarios in which the actor’s proximal and distal <b>intent</b> <b>were</b> independently manipulated. In Study 1, when only distal <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> present in the actor’s mind, participants rated the psychologically distant actor more responsible than the psychologically near actor. In Study 2, when only distal <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> in the actor’s mind, participants with a chronic high level of action identification rated the actor more responsible than did those with a low level of action identification. In both studies, when only proximal <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> in the actor’s mind, construal level did not predict judgments of responsibility. In Study 3, when only proximal <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> present in the actor’s mind, the more participants believed in free will, the more they rated the actor responsible. When only distal <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> in the actor’s mind, free will belief did not influence ratings of responsibility. In Study 4, the same pattern emerged when free will / determinism beliefs were manipulated and the actor performed a positive (life-saving) act. The authors discuss how these results shed new light on the literatures on moral reasoning and psycho-legal theory...|$|R
