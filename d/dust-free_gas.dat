40|$|Small solids {{embedded}} in gaseous protoplanetary disks {{are subject to}} strong dust-gas friction. Consequently, tightly coupled dust particles almost follow the gas flow. This near conservation of the dust-to-gas ratio along streamlines {{is analogous to the}} near conservation of entropy along flows of (<b>dust-free)</b> <b>gas</b> with weak heating and cooling. We develop this thermodynamic analogy into a framework to study dusty gas dynamics in protoplanetary disks. We show that an isothermal dusty gas behaves like an adiabatic pure gas, and that finite dust-gas coupling may be regarded as effective heating/cooling. We exploit this correspondence to deduce that (1) perfectly coupled, thin dust layers cannot cause axisymmetric instabilities; (2) radial dust edges are unstable if the dust is vertically well-mixed; (3) the streaming instability necessarily involves a gas pressure response that lags behind dust density; and (4) dust-loading introduces buoyancy forces that generally stabilize the vertical shear instability associated with global radial temperature gradients. We also discuss dusty analogs of other hydrodynamic processes (e. g., Rossby wave instability, convective overstability, and zombie vortices) and how to simulate dusty protoplanetary disks with minor tweaks to existing codes for pure gas dynamics...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{radiation}} pressure on the dust in the inner rim of transitional disks with large inner holes. In particular, we evaluate whether radiation pressure can be responsible for keeping the inner holes <b>dust-free,</b> while allowing <b>gas</b> accretion to proceed. This has been proposed in a paper by Chiang & Murray-Clay (2007, Nature Phys., 3, 604) who explain the formation of these holes as an inside-out evacuation due to X-ray-triggered accretion of the innermost layer of the disk rim outside of the hole. We show that radiation pressure is clearly incapable of stopping dust from flowing into the hole because of dust pile-up and optical depth effects, and also because of viscous mixing. Other mechanisms need to be found to explain {{the persistence of the}} opacity hole in the presence of accretion, and we speculate on possible solutions...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{mid-infrared}} {{emission of}} quasars requires an obscuring structure {{that can be}} modeled as a magneto-hydrodynamic wind in which radiation pressure on dust shapes the outflow. We have taken the dusty wind models presented by Keating and collaborators that generated quasar mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and explored their properties (such as geometry, opening angle, and ionic column densities) {{as a function of}} Eddington ratio and X-ray weakness. In addition, we present new models with a range of magnetic field strengths and column densities of the <b>dust-free</b> shielding <b>gas</b> interior to the dusty wind. We find this family of models [...] with input parameters tuned to accurately match the observed mid-IR power in quasar SEDs [...] provides reasonable values of the Type 1 fraction of quasars and the column densities of warm absorber gas, though it does not explain a purely luminosity-dependent covering fraction for either. Furthermore, we provide predictions of the cumulative distribution of E(B-V) values of quasars from extinction by the wind and the shape of the wind as imaged in the mid-infrared. Within the framework of this model, we predict that the strength of the near-infrared bump from hot dust emission will be correlated primarily with L/L_Edd rather than luminosity alone, with scatter induced by the distribution of magnetic field strengths. The empirical successes and shortcomings of these models warrant further investigations into the composition and behaviour of dust and the nature of magnetic fields in the vicinity of actively accreting supermassive black holes.

40|$|The optical {{classification}} of a Seyfert galaxy {{and whether it}} is considered X-ray absorbed are often used interchangeably. But there are many borderline cases and also numerous examples where the optical and X-ray classifications {{appear to be in}} conflict. In this article we re-visit the relation between optical obscuration and X-ray absorption in AGNs. We make use of our "dust color" method (Burtscher et al. 2015) to derive the optical obscuration A_V and consistently estimated X-ray absorbing columns using 0. 3 [...] 150 keV spectral energy distributions. We also take into account the variable nature of the neutral gas column N_H and derive the Seyfert sub-classes of all our objects in a consistent way. We show in a sample of 25 local, hard-X-ray detected Seyfert galaxies (log L_X / (erg/s) ~ 41. 5 - 43. 5) that there can actually be a good agreement between optical and X-ray classification. If Seyfert types 1. 8 and 1. 9 are considered unobscured, the threshold between X-ray unabsorbed and absorbed should be chosen at a column N_H = 10 ^ 22. 3 / cm^ 2 to be consistent with the optical classification. We find that N_H is related to A_V and that the N_H/A_V ratio is approximately Galactic or higher in all sources, as indicated previously. But in several objects we also see that deviations from the Galactic ratio are only due to a variable X-ray column, showing that (1) deviations from the Galactic N_H/A_V can simply be explained by <b>dust-free</b> neutral <b>gas</b> within the broad line region in some sources, that (2) the dust properties in AGNs can be similar to Galactic dust and that (3) the dust color method is a robust way to estimate the optical extinction towards the sublimation radius in all but the most obscured AGNs.

40|$|The {{streaming}} instability {{is often}} invoked as {{solution to the}} fragmentation and drift barriers in planetesimal formation, catalyzing the aggregation of dust on kyr timescales to grow km-sized cores. However there remains a lack of consensus on the physical mechanism(s) responsible for initiating it. One potential avenue is disc photoevaporation, wherein the preferential removal of relatively <b>dust-free</b> <b>gas</b> increases the disc metallicity. Late in the disc lifetime, photoevaporation dominates viscous accretion, creating a gradient in the depleted gas surface density near {{the location of the}} gap. This induces a local pressure maximum that collects drifting dust particles, which may then become susceptible to the streaming instability. Using a one-dimensional viscous evolution model of a disc subject to internal X-ray photoevaporation, we explore the efficacy of this process to build planetestimals. Over a range of parameters we find that the amount of dust mass converted into planetesimals is often 100 AU) disc radii. The discrepancies are primarily a consequence of the different photoevaporation profiles assumed. Until observations more tightly constrain photoevaporation models, the relevance of this process to the formation of planets remains uncertain.

This spatio-temporal structure formation process is caused by a radiative/thermal instability of dust forming gases as identified by Woitke et al. (2000). Our 2 D (axisymmetric) models combine a time-dependent description of the dust formation process according to Gail & Sedlmayr (1988) with detailed, frequency-dependent continuum radiative transfer by means of a Monte Carlo method (Niccolini et al. 2003) in an otherwise static medium (v= 0). These models show that the formation of dust behind already condensed regions, which shield the stellar radiation field, is strongly favoured. In the shadow of these clouds, the temperature decreases by several hundred Kelvin which triggers the subsequent formation of dust and ensures its thermal stability.

40|$|The 30 Myr old A 3 -type star HD 21997 {{is one of}} the two known debris dust disks {{having a}} {{measurable}} amount of cold molecular gas. With the goal of understanding the physical state, origin, and evolution of the gas in young debris disks, we obtained CO line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Here we report on the detection of 12 CO and 13 CO in the J= 2 - 1 and J= 3 - 2 transitions and C 18 O in the J= 2 - 1 line. The gas exhibits a Keplerian velocity curve, one of the few direct measurements of Keplerian rotation in young debris disks. The measured CO brightness distribution could be reproduced by a simple star+disk system, whose parameters are r_in < 26 AU, r_out = 138 +/- 20 AU, M_*= 1. 8 + 0. 5 - 0. 2 M_Sun, and i = 32. 6 +/- 3. 1 degrees. The total CO mass, as calculated from the optically thin C 18 O line, is about (4 - 8) x 10 ^- 2 M_Earth, while the CO line ratios suggest a radiation temperature on the order of 6 - 9 K. Comparing our results with those obtained for the dust component of the HD 21997 disk from the ALMA continuum observations by Moór et al., we conclude that comparable amounts of CO gas and dust are present in the disk. Interestingly, the gas and dust in the HD 21997 system are not co-located, indicating a <b>dust-free</b> inner <b>gas</b> disk within 55 AU of the star. We explore two possible scenarios for the origin of the gas. A secondary origin, which involves gas production from colliding or active planetesimals, would require unreasonably high gas production rates and would not explain why the gas and dust are not co-located. We propose that HD 21997 is a hybrid system where secondary debris dust and primordial gas coexist. HD 21997, whose age exceeds both the model predictions for disk clearing and the ages of the oldest T Tauri-like or transitional gas disks in the literature, may be a key object linking the primordial and the debris phases of disk evolution.

40|$|Circumstellar disks around stars {{older than}} 10 Myr are {{expected}} to be gas-poor. There are, however, two examples of old (30 - 40 Myr) debris-like disks containing a detectable amount of cold CO gas. Here we present ALMA and Herschel Space Observatory observations of one of these disks, around HD 21997, and study the distribution and origin of the dust and its connection to the gas. Our ALMA continuum images at 886 um clearly resolve a broad ring of emission within a diameter of ~ 4. 5 arcsec, adding HD 21997 to the dozen debris disks resolved at (sub) millimeter wavelengths. Modeling the morphology of the ALMA image with a radiative transfer code suggests inner and outer radii of ~ 55 and ~ 150 AU, and a dust mass of 0. 09 M_Earth. Our data and modeling hints at an extended cold outskirt of the ring. Comparison with the morphology of the CO gas in the disk reveals an inner <b>dust-free</b> hole where <b>gas</b> nevertheless can be detected.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{characterization}} of the excess continuum emission of accreting T Tauri stars between optical and near-infrared wavelengths. With nearly simultaneous spectra from 0. 48 to 2. 4 microns acquired with HIRES and NIRSPEC on Keck and SpeX on the IRTF, we find significant excess continuum emission throughout this region, including the I, Y, and J bands, which are usually thought to diagnose primarily photospheric emission. The IYJ excess correlates with the excess in the V band, attributed to accretion shocks in the photosphere, and the excess in the K band, attributed to dust in the inner disk near the dust sublimation radius, {{but it is too}} large to be an extension of the excess from these sources. The spectrum of the excess emission is broad and featureless, suggestive of blackbody radiation with a temperature between 2200 and 5000 K. The luminosity of the IYJ excess is comparable to the accretion luminosity inferred from modeling the blue and ultraviolet excess emission and may require reassessment of disk accretion rates. The source of the IYJ excess is unclear. In stars of low accretion rate, the size of the emitting region is consistent with cooler material surrounding small hot accretion spots in the photosphere. However, for stars with high accretion rates, the projected area is comparable to or exceeds that of the stellar surface. We suggest {{that at least some of}} the IYJ excess emission arises in the <b>dust-free</b> <b>gas</b> inside the dust sublimation radius in the disk.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{have shown}} that the often cited radiation pressure barrier to accretion onto massive stars can be circumvented, when the radiation field is highly anisotropic {{in the presence of a}} circumstellar accretion disk with high optical depth. Here, these studies of the so-called flashlight effect are expanded by including the opacity of the innermost dust-free but potentially optically thick gas regions around forming massive stars. In addition to frequency-dependent opacities for the dust grains, we use temperature- and density-dependent Planck- and Rosseland mean opacities for the gas. The simulations show that the innermost dust-free parts of the accretion disks are optically thick to the stellar radiation over a substantial fraction of the solid angle above and below the disk’s midplane. The temperature in the shielded disk region decreases faster with radius than in a comparison simulation with a lower constant gas opacity, and the dust sublimation front is shifted to smaller radii. The shielding by the <b>dust-free</b> <b>gas</b> in the inner disk thus contributes to an enhanced flashlight effect, which ultimately results in a smaller opening angle of the radiation pressure driven outflow and in a much longer timescale of sustained feeding of the circumstellar disk by the molecular cloud core. We conclude that it is necessary to properly account for the opacity of the inner dust-free disk regions around forming massive stars in order to correctly assess the effectiveness of the flashlight effect, the opening angle of radiation pressure driven outflows, and the lifetime and morphological evolution of the accretion disk...|$|E
40|$|We present self-consistent {{calculations}} of non-equilibrium (time-dependent) cooling rates for a <b>dust-free</b> collisionally controlled <b>gas</b> in wide temperature (10 K< T< 10 ^ 8 K) and metallicity (10 ^- 4 Z_< Z < 2 Z_) ranges. We confirm that molecular hydrogen dominates cooling at 10 ^ 2 T 10 ^ 4 K and Z 10 ^- 3 Z_. We {{find that the}} contribution from H_ 2 into cooling rate around T∼ (4 - 5) × 10 ^ 3 K stimulates thermal instability in the metallicity range Z 10 ^- 2 Z_. Isobaric cooling rates are generally lower than isochoric ones, because the associated increase of gas density leads to both more efficient hydrogen recombination and equilibration of the fine-structure level populations. Isochoric cooling keeps the ionization fraction remains quite high at T 10 ^ 4 K: up to ∼ 0. 01 at T≃ 10 ^ 3 K and Z 0. 1 Z_, and even higher at higher metallicity, contrary to isobaric cooling where it at least {{an order of magnitude}} lower. Despite this increase in ionization fraction the gas-phase formation rate of molecular hydrogen (via H^-) lowers with metallicity, because higher metallicity shorttens the evolution time. We implement our self-consistent cooling rates into the multi-dimensional parallel code ZEUS-MP in order to simulate evolution of a supernova remnant, and compare it with an analogous model with tabulated cooling rates published in previous works.

40|$|We {{analytically}} derive {{the expressions}} for {{the structure of}} the inner region of protoplanetary disks based on the results from the recent hydrodynamical simulations. The inner part of a disk can be divided into four regions: <b>dust-free</b> region with <b>gas</b> temperature in the optically thin limit, optically thin dust halo, optically thick condensation front and the classical optically thick region in order from the inside. We derive the dust-to-gas mass ratio profile in the dust halo using the fact that partial dust condensation regulates the temperature to the dust evaporation temperature. Beyond the dust halo, there is an optically thick condensation front where all the available silicate gas condenses out. The curvature of the condensation surface is determined by the condition that the surface temperature must be nearly equal to the characteristic temperature ∼ 1200 K. We derive the mid-plane temperature in the outer two regions using the two-layer approximation with the additional heating by the condensation front for the outermost region. As a result, the overall temperature profile is step-like with steep gradients at the borders between the outer three regions. The borders might act as planet traps where the inward migration of planets due to gravitational interaction with the gas disk stops. The temperature at the border between the two outermost regions coincides with the temperature needed to activate magnetorotational instability, suggesting that the inner edge of the dead zone must lie at this border. The radius of the dead-zone inner edge predicted from our solution is ∼ 2 - 3 times larger than that expected from the classical optically thick temperature.

40|$|Abridged) We present {{radiation}} transfer simulations {{of a massive}} (8 Msun) protostar forming from a massive (Mc= 60 Msun) protostellar core, extending the model developed by Zhang & Tan (2011). The two principal improvements are (1) developing {{a model for the}} density and velocity structure of a disk wind that fills the bipolar outflow cavities; and (2) solving for the radially varying accretion rate in the disk due to a supply of mass and angular momentum from the infall envelope and their loss to the disk wind. One consequence of the launching of the disk wind is a reduction in the amount of accretion power that is radiated by the disk. For the transition from dusty to <b>dust-free</b> conditions where <b>gas</b> opacities dominate, we now implement a gradual change as a more realistic approximation of dust destruction. We study how the above effects, especially the outflow, influence the SEDs and the images of the protostar. Dust in the outflow cavity significantly affects the SEDs at most viewing angles. It further attenuates the short-wavelength flux from the protostar, controlling how the accretion disk may be viewed, and contributes {{a significant part of the}} near- and mid-IR fluxes. These fluxes warm the disk, boosting the mid- and far-IR emission. We find that for near face-on views, the SED from the near-IR to about 60 micron is very flat, which may be used to identify such systems. We show that the near-facing outflow cavity and its walls are still the most significant features in images up to 70 micron, dominating the mid-IR emission and determining its morphology. The thermal emission from the dusty outflow itself dominates the flux at ~ 20 micron. The detailed distribution of the dust in the outflow affects the morphology, for example, even though the outflow cavity is wide, at 10 to 20 micron, the dust in the disk wind can make the outflow appear narrower than in the near-IR bands.

40|$|Context. Water {{is a key}} {{probe of}} shocks and {{outflows}} from young stars because it is extremely sensitive to both the physical conditions associated with the interaction of supersonic outflows with the ambient medium and the chemical processes at play. Aims. Our goal is to investigate the spatial and velocity distribution of H 2 O along outflows, its relationship with other tracers, and its abundance variations. In particular, this study focuses on the outflow driven by the low-mass protostar L 1448 -C, which previous observations have shown {{to be one of}} the brightest H 2 O emitters among the class 0 outflows. Methods. To this end, maps of the o-H 2 O 1 (10) - 1 (01) and 2 (12) - 1 (01) transitions taken with the Herschel-HIFI and PACS instruments, respectively, are presented. For comparison, complementary maps of the CO(3 - 2) and SiO(8 - 7) transitions, obtained at the JCMT, and the H- 2 S(0) and S(1) transitions, taken from the literature, were used as well. Physical conditions and H 2 O column densities were inferred using large velocity gradient radiative transfer calculations. Results. The water distribution appears to be clumpy, with individual peaks corresponding to shock spots along the outflow. The bulk of the 557 GHz line is confined to radial velocities in the range +/- 10 - 50 km s(- 1), but extended emission at extreme velocities (up to v(r) similar to 80 km s(- 1)) is detected and is associated with the L 1448 -C extreme high-velocity (EHV) jet. The H 2 O 1 (10) - 1 (01) /CO(3 - 2) ratio shows strong variations as a function of velocity that likely reflect different and changing physical conditions in the gas that is responsible for the emissions from the two species. In the EHV jet, a low H 2 O/SiO abundance ratio is inferred, which could indicate molecular formation from <b>dust-free</b> <b>gas</b> directly ejected from the proto-stellar wind. The ratio between the two observed H 2 O lines and the comparison with H- 2 indicate averaged T-kin and n(H- 2) values of similar to 300 - 500 K and 5 x 10 (6) cm(- 3), respectively, while a water abundance with respect to H- 2 of about 0. 5 - 1 x 10 (- 6) along the outflow is estimated, in agreement with results found by previous studies. The fairly constant conditions found all along the outflow imply that evolutionary effects on the timescales of outflow propagation do not play a major role in the H 2 O chemistry. Conclusions. The results of our analysis show that the bulk of the observed H 2 O lines comes from post-shocked regions where the gas, after being heated to high temperatures, has already been cooled down to a few hundred K. The relatively low derived abundances, however, call for some mechanism that diminishes the H 2 O gas in the post-shock region. Among the possible scenarios, we favor H 2 O photodissociation, which requires the superposition of a low-velocity nondissociative shock with a fast dissociative shock able to produce a far-ultraviolet field of sufficient strength...|$|E
