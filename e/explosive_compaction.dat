40|$|Abstract A {{structural}} steel, 35 CrMoV steel, {{has been}} attempted firstly by <b>explosive</b> powder <b>compaction</b> followed by sintering (EPC-sintering). The nitrogen {{content of the}} steel was 0. 15 wt%, which was accordant with the definition of high nitrogen steel (HNS). The final density of the EPC-sintering steel was only about 6. 9 g/cm 3, which indicated that the processing parameters must be modulated further. In the sample of this steel, some radial cracks were found around {{the center of the}} cross-section of the steel, resulting in no mechanical tests carrying out. Observing the majority of the rim region of the sample of this steel, the microstructures were very tight, suggesting that it was possible and successful to manufacture HNS through EPC-sintering. The characteristics of the EPC-sintering high nitrogen 35 CrMoV steel were that the cementites in the pearlites were found to be extremely fine. There were many (Cr,Mo) 23 (C,N) 6 carbonitrides precipitates in the matrix. Some precipitates were round and others were needle-like.

40|$|Yttria-doped zirconia/ruthenia powders {{were made}} by co-precipitation. The {{calcined}} powders were compacted into green compacts using standard pressing techniques such as isostatical compaction compared to <b>explosive</b> <b>compaction.</b> <b>Explosive</b> <b>compaction</b> (EC) led to the highest density, but also to cracking of the compacts. The zirconia/ruthenia powders compacted by isostatical pressing could not be densified by pressureless sintering (58 %), but sinterforging these green compacts led to dense compacts (96 %), which showed large-scale phase separation between the yttria-doped zirconia and ruthenia phase. The explosively densified green compacts could be further densified to 92 % by pressureless sintering, without the occurrence of the large-scale phase separation that took place within the isostatically pressed (IP) and sinterforged (SF) samples. The microstructure of the explosively densified composites was more fine-grained and homogeneous.

Recent results on dynamics of X-welding and X-powder compaction are presented and discussed in this paper in the conceptual context of an orderly oscillating detonation wave (DW), a synergetic phenomena observed in detonation of all classes of composite energetic materials, that was discovered in LEDAP in last eight years. Regular instabilities that are induced by oscillating DW, are transmitted through the interface of the impacted materials, causing the local instability and fluctuations in both processes, formation of the interfacial waves (X-welding mechanism) and in an initial phase of powder compaction. Application of high resolution optical probes (spatial resolution 250 µm, temporal resolution 1 ns, 96 independent channels) allowed the simultaneous registration of the oscillating DW in the X-charge and transmission of oscillations, trough the flyer plate, up to the welding zone.

40|$|Firstly, recently, {{there are}} a lot of {{techniques}} being demanded for complex process, various explosive initiation method and highly accurate control of detonation are needed. In this research, the metal foil explosion using high current is focused attention on the method to obtain linear or planate initiation easily, and the main evaluation of metal foil explosion to initiate explosive was conducted. The explosion power was evaluated by observing optically the underwater shock wave generated from the metal foil explosion. Secondly, in high energy explosive processing, there are several applications, such as shock <b>compaction,</b> <b>explosive</b> welding, food processing and explosive forming. In these explosive applications, a high sensitive explosive has been mainly used. The high sensitive explosive is so dangerous, since it can lead to explosion suddenly. So, for developing explosives, the safety is the most important thing as well as low manufacturing cost and explosive characteristics. In this work, we have focused on the initiation sensitivity of a solid explosive and performed numerical analysis of sympathetic detonation. The numerical analysis is calculated by LS-DYNA 3 D (commercial code). To understand the initiation reaction of an explosive, Lee-Tarver equation was used and impact detonation process was analyzed by ALE code. Configuration of simulation model is a quarter of circular cylinder. The donor type of explosive (SEP) was used as initiation explosive. When the donor explosive is exploded, a shock wave is generated and it propagates into PMMA, air and metallic layers in order.
