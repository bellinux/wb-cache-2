40|$|A novel redox-responsive PEG-sheddable {{copolymer}} of disulfide-linked {{polyethylene glycol}} 5000 -lysine-di-tocopherol succinate (P 5 kSSLV) {{was designed and}} synthesized. Thin-film hydration method was used to prepare DOX-loaded P 5 kSSLV nanomicelle. To optimize the preparation technology, we investigate the effects of dosage, type of organic solvent, hydration temperature and time, and cryoprotectant on drug-loading content, encapsulation efficiency, particle size, and zeta potential. The mean particle size and zeta potential were determined by Zetasizer. The morphology of the P 5 kSSLV-DOX nanomicelles was visualized by transmission electron microscopy. The drug-loading content and encapsulation efficiency of P 5 kSSLV-DOX nanomicelle were investigated by UV. The drug-loading content, encapsulation efficiency, particle size, and zeta potential of the final optimized nanomicelles were 4. 58 %, 97. 20 %, 30. 21  nm and − 0. 84  mV, respectively. In addition, the stability of nanomicelles was investigated, which included <b>dilution</b> <b>stability</b> and storage stability.

40|$|AbstractIn {{an answer}} to the {{challenge}} of enzymatic instability and low oral bioavailability of proteins/peptides, a new type of drug-delivery vesicle has been developed. The preparation, based on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) embedded in chitosan gel, was used to successfully deliver the model drug-insulin. The self-assembled SDS/β-CD vesicles were prepared and characterized by particle size, zeta potential, appearance, microscopic morphology and entrapment efficiency. In addition, both the interaction of insulin with vesicles and the stability of insulin loaded in vesicles in the presence of pepsin were investigated. The vesicles were crosslinked into thermo-sensitive chitosan/β-glycerol phosphate solution for an in-situ gel to enhance the <b>dilution</b> <b>stability.</b> The in vitro release characteristics of insulin from gels in media at different pH values were investigated. The insulin loaded vesicles–chitosan hydrogel (IVG) improved the <b>dilution</b> <b>stability</b> of the vesicles and provided pH-selective sustained release compared with insulin solution–chitosan hydrogel (ISG). In vitro, IVG exhibited slow release in acidic solution and relatively quick release in neutral solutions to provide drug efficacy. In simulated digestive fluid, IVG showed better sustained release and insulin protection properties compared with ISG. Thus IVG might improve the stability of insulin during its transport in vivo and contribute to the bioavailability and therapeutic effect of insulin...|$|E

Caprolactam modified casein/waterborne polyurethane composite (CA-CPL/WPU) was prepared from CA-CPL and WPU. Effect of compounding conditions, {{such as the}} WPU dosage, compounding temperature and compounding time on CA-CPL/WPU performance were investigated. The results indicated that: CA-CPL/WPU achieved superior comprehensive performance when the WPU dosage was 50 %, the compounding temperature and the compounding time was 80 ℃and 2 h respectively. Viscosity of CA-CPL/WPU decreased firstly with the increasing amount of WPU When the WPU dosage was lower than 30 %, and then increased gradually when the WPU dosage was higher than 30 %. The more the dosage of WPU used in the reaction, the less <b>dilution</b> <b>stability</b> CA-CPL/WPU had.

The method was optimized and validated according to the Washington Concensus Conference on the Validation of Analytical Methods (V. P. Shah et al., Eur. J. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinet., 15 (1991) 249). The criteria of complete validation were specificity, linearity, precision, analytical recovery, <b>dilution</b> and <b>stability.</b> It involved extraction of the plasma with dichloromethane, followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a Kromasil(R) C- 8 column and UV detection at 360 nm.

The analytes were detected with an UV diode array detector. DHFU was detected at 205 run, 5 -FU at 266 nm, and chlorouracil at both wavelengths. The limits of quantification in plasma were 0. 040 mug /mL for 5 -FU and 0. 075 mug/mL for DHFU.

Furthermore, stability of KG-FS diluted to 80 U mL(- 1) 'administered' via single- and double-pump mock CI systems was tested. Finally, the in vivo stability of KG-FS diluted to approximately 60 U mL(- 1) and administered postsurgically by CI with the double-pump to a paediatric patient with severe haemophilia A undergoing implantable venous access device placement was investigated. Initial KG-FS dilution resulted in a 10 - 20 % FVIII loss; a further 25 - 30 % loss occurred over 72 h in vials or syringes. With the double-pump, 1 h recovery was 35 %, increasing to 80 % by 24 h; the initial losses were because of the Y-infusion of a 10 -fold larger volume of saline concomitantly with the FVIII.

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} {{preheating}} and dilution on methane/air non-premixed flame stability are studied experimentally. Six preheating levels are considered for initial reactant temperature between 295 K and 850 K {{in a round}} jet configuration. Four diluent gases are added on the air-side, either CO 2, N 2, Ar or a (CO 2 +Ar) mixture having the same molar heat capacity as N 2. For undiluted flames, jet transition velocities between attached and lifted states are investigated depending on initial reactant temperature. The hysteresis zone defined by these stability limits is shifted towards higher jet velocities with preheating. Whereas jet and coflow temperatures were identical in similar previous experiments, the present work allows examination of the thermal effects from either fuel or oxidizer streams. Flame stability is described based on the propagative aspects of the flame leading-edge, by analogy with the temperature dependency of the laminar burning velocity of a stoichiometric mixture. Results show that the jet temperature has {{a major influence on}} the lifting of an attached flame, whereas the coflow temperature remains important for the reattachment of a lifted flame. In addition, flame stability experiments have been performed at high levels of both preheating and <b>dilution.</b> <b>Stability</b> maps of critical dilution ratios at lifting have been obtained with preheating. It appears that the ability of a diluent to break flame stability keeps the same relative order as at ambient temperature. It is even enhanced with preheating because higher temperature widens the gap between diluent molar heat capacities Cp. The Cp approach is however not sufficient to interpret the temperature dependency of the relative influence of the different dilution effects. Furthermore, the role played by the jet flow regime on attached flame stability in dilution-induced lifting experiments is highlighted when dilution is coupled with preheating...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the iron catalyzed cross coupling of aryl electrophiles with alkyl Grignard reagents was studied. The reaction proceeds via a rate-limiting oxidative addition of the aryl halide to an Fe(I) complex generated in situ. A transmetalation from an aryl Grignard reagent occurs either {{before or after the}} oxidative addition. An exergonic reductive elimination closes the cycle, yielding the cross coupled product and regenerates the Fe(I) from Fe(III). Added ligands and <b>dilution</b> increases the <b>stability</b> of the active catalyst. The reaction can take place at dry ice temperature. Initial rate studies indicated that high concentrations of any reagent can lead to complete or partial catalyst deactivation. Under strongly reducing conditions, iron seems to form less active complexes that only slowly re- enter the catalytic cycle. The iron catalyzed cross coupling of alkyl electrophiles with aryl Grignard reagents follows the same mechanism as the aryl electrophile – alkyl Grignard coupling. With the more weakly reducing aryl Grignards, the iron catalyst is stable in diethyl ether without additives. The nature of the active catalyst has been under debate. In the couplings with aryl Grignard reagents, the active catalyst is an Fe(I) species. Fe(I) complexes are stable in ether, and they are active catalysts. The active iron catalyst has a spin state of S= 3 / 2, even though the precatalytic Fe(III) salts have a high spin state (S= 5 / 2). The spin change occurs after the first transmetalation, when the strong ligand field of the aryl group raises the energy of one d-orbital, inducing an electron pairing event...|$|R
40|$|The bilayer disc is a flat, lipid {{aggregate}} {{structure in}} the nanometre regime. It is composed of a bilayer of amphiphilic molecules with micelle-forming amphiphilic molecules supporting the rim, which prevent disc fusion and self-closure. Stable discs {{have been found in}} lipid mixtures containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) -lipids as a rim-stabilizing component. One of the aims of the work described in this thesis was to increase the fundamental knowledge and understanding of the systems in which these discs are formed. Other micelle-forming surfactants apart from PEG-lipids were also explored {{to see if they could}} be used to stabilize the disc aggregate structure. Due to the similarities of these lipid discs with natural membranes it was hypothesized that they could be used as models for biological membranes. It was demonstrated that discs are formed in PEG-lipid/lipid systems when the lipid mixture contains components that reduce the spontaneous curvature and increase the monolayer bending rigidity. Discoidal structures are furthermore preferred when the lipids are in the gel phase, probably due to a combination of high bending rigidity and reduced PEG-lipid/lipid miscibility. The disc size could be varied by changing the PEG-lipid concentration. The size and size homogeneity of the discs could also be varied by changing the preparation path. Generally, the preferences of certain lipid systems to form discs remained when the PEG-lipid was replaced by more conventional surfactants. However, discs prepared in PEG-lipid/lipid systems are more useful as model membranes because of their relatively large size and good temperature, <b>dilution</b> and long-term <b>stability.</b> Data obtained with isothermal titration calorimetry and drug partition chromatography indicate that these bilayer discs may serve as an attractive and sometimes superior alternative to liposomes in studies of drug-membrane interactions...|$|R

Growth rates at comparable plasma power are presented for substrate temperatures between 100 °C and 300 °C and for various H 2 dilution ratios. The optical bandgap, H content, and electronic transport properties in the light-soaked state were measured. H 2 dilution strongly reduces the growth rate for all techniques. The growth rate for the highest H 2 dilution ratio is higher for VHF (~ 4 Å/s) than for DC (~ 3 Å/s) or RF (0. 5 - 1 Å/s) excitation. In all three cases increasing the substrate temperature reduces the optical gap and the H content CH. Raising the substrate temperature slightly enhances <b>stability.</b> H 2 <b>dilution</b> increases the optical gap for all three techniques. The H content of RF- and VHF-deposited samples increases with increasing H 2 dilution ratio, while in DC deposition it produces an initial drop of the H content, followed by an increase. R. Platz et al. 2 In all three cases, H 2 dilution improves the electronic transport properties of the material by roughly a factor of two. The gain in stability is most pronounced for relatively small dilution; {{in the case of}} DC deposition, too strong a dilution even has an adverse effect on stability. We rule out universal relation between hydrogen content of the a-Si:H films and their stability against light-soaking. Enhanced stability may be obtained for films which incorporate either more or less hydrogen than standard a-Si:H. R. Platz et al. 3 I...|$|R
40|$|A UV-induced {{mutation}} of {{the enzyme}} glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) was characterized in the CHO clone A 24. The asymmetric 4 -banded zymogram and an in vitro GAPD activity {{equal to that}} of wild type cells were not consistent with models of a mutant heterozygote producing equal amounts of wild type and either catalytically active or inactive mutant subunits that interacted randomly. Cumulative evidence indicated that the site of the mutation was the GAPD structural locus expressed in CHO wild type cells, and that the mutant allele coded for a subunit that differed from the wild type subunit in stability and kinetics. The evidence included the appearance of a fifth band, the putative mutant homotetramer, after addition of the substrate glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate (GAP) to the gel matrix; <b>dilution</b> experiments indicating <b>stability</b> differences between the subunits; experiments with subsaturating levels of GAP indicating differences in affinity for the substrate; GAPD zymograms of A 24 x mouse hybrids that were consistent with the presence of two distinct A 24 subunits; independent segregation of A 24 wild type and mutant electrophoretic bands from the hybrids, which was inconsistent with models of mutation of a locus involved in posttranslational modification; the mapping of both wild type and mutant forms of GAPD to chromosome 8; and the failure to detect any evidence of posttranslational modification (of other A 24 isozymes, or through mixing of homogenates of A 24 and mouse). ^ The extent of skewing of the zymogram toward the wild type band, and the unreduced in vitro activity were inconsistent with models based solely on differences in activity of the two subunits. Comparison of wild type homotetramer bands in wild type cells and A 24 suggested the latter had a preponderance of wild type subunits over mutant subunits, and had more GAPD tetramers than did CHO controls. ^ Two CHO linkages, GAPD-triose phosphate isomerase, and acid phosphatase 2 -adenosine deaminase were reported provisionally, and several others were confirmed. ...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{interest}} in alternative fuels for gas turbines has motivated research in gaseous fuels other than natural gas. Methane enriched with hydrogen or diluted with carbon dioxide are of considerable interest. The latter seems quite relevant {{for development of}} technologies such as oxyfuel combustion for {{carbon capture and storage}} in order to control temperatures in the combustion chamber. Thus, this paper presents an experimental study on the combustion of methane-carbon dioxide mixtures at atmospheric conditions. Gas mixtures have been examined by using different levels of premixing with different injection strategies with and without swirl and with and without central injection. A 20 kW burner has been used to investigate the flame stability and emissions performance by using these blends to examine the effect of CO 2 addition. The burner configuration consisted of a centre body with an annular, premixed gas/air jet introduced through five, 60 ° swirl vanes. A TESTO 350 XL gas analyzer was used to obtain NOx and CO emission trends to characterize all the injection regimes whilst using different fuel blends. CH chemiluminescence diagnostics was also used and correlated to the levels of emissions produced during the trials. The resulting images were analysed using Photron FASTCAM PFV ver 2. 4. 1. 1 software and MATLAB R 2015 a. CO 2 <b>dilution</b> decreased flame <b>stability</b> and operability range. The introduction of CO 2 reduces temperatures in the combustion zone thus causing a reduction in emissions of nitrous oxides across all equivalence ratios. CO emissions also decreased with a limited (15 %) CO 2 addition. In terms of injection regimes, the outer purely premixed injection regime has lower NOx and CO, as expected. CH chemiluminescence distribution indicated that pure methane with central injection produced high fluctuation in CH production. The use of central premixed injection produces the most chaotic CH production case, possibly as a consequence of production of radicals in the central recirculation zone...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examined}} {{the performance of}} swirl burners using different injection strategies for various substitute fuels. The research procedure involved various stages; firstly, an assessment study between two liquid fuels, a pure biodiesel and saturated biodiesel, compared to kerosene. Atomization forms were obtained, and a combustion test campaign was initiated using a generic swirl burner. Emissions and power outputs were measured at gas turbine relevant equivalence ratios. Excess oxygen and atomization trends in the biodiesel seem to be playing {{a significant role in}} the creation of emissions and flame stability when compared to kerosene. Secondly, an experimental study on the combustion of methane-carbon dioxide mixtures was achieved. Gas mixtures were examined by using different injection strategies with and without swirl and with and without central injection. A smaller 20 -kW swirl burner was used to analyse stability and emissions performance by using these blends and to study the impact of CO 2 addition. The burner configuration comprised a centre body with an annular, premixed gas/air jet introduced through five, 60 ° swirl vanes. CO 2 <b>dilution</b> reduced flame <b>stability</b> and operability range. The introduction of CO 2 decreases temperatures in the combustion zone thus producing a lessening in emissions of nitrous oxides across all equivalence ratios. Regarding injection regimes, the external purely premixed injection system has lower NOx and CO. Addition of CO 2 increases the lean blowout limit of all blends. In the last section, a new burner was finally employed to carry out trials using multi-phase injection, where, experimental work investigated the performance of a swirl burner using various mixtures of CO 2 /CH 4 blends with either diesel or biodiesel derived from cooking oil. The swirl burner was employed to analyse gas turbine combustion features under atmospheric conditions to quantify flame stability and emissions by using these fuels. The results revealed that the use of biodiesel and CO 2 /CH 4 blends mixtures led to lower CO production. Results showed that a notable reduction of 50...|$|R
40|$|Actinobacillus succinogenes {{cells were}} grown on Poraver® support {{particles}} in a packed-bed reactor. Dilution rates (D) of 0. 054 – 0. 72 h- 1 were investigated. Glucose {{was used as}} substrate. CO 2 (g) was bubbled into a complex medium to satisfy the fixation requirements and maintain anaerobic conditions. At D ≥ 0. 31 h- 1, an initial glucose concentration of 35 g. L- 1 was used; at lower dilution rates, this was increased to 60 g. L- 1 {{in order to avoid}} substrate limitations. By-product formation included acetic and formic acids. A maximum productivity of 10. 7 g. L- 1 was obtained at D = 0. 7 h- 1. It was found that the system provided repeatable results at a given D. The longest steady state period was maintained for about 97 h at D = 0. 31 h- 1. Steady state stability was maintained for > 72 h at D < 0. 31 h- 1. For periods longer than 75 h, however, inhibitory acid titres resulted in a gradual decline in productivity. At higher <b>dilution</b> rates, long-term <b>stability</b> could not be maintained. The low acid titres produced significant biofilm sloughing following aggressive biofilm growth, resulting in oscillatory system behaviour. For fermentation times < 115 h, the dilution rate was secondary to the attachment area in determining the total biomass at steady state. Total biomass values were then used to determine specific rates. A clear trend was observed, with the specific glucose consumption rate, and specific acid production rates, increasing with increasing D. This was explained by assuming a maintenance-driven system at all Ds studied. A product analysis indicated that at ΔS < 15 g. L- 1, pyruvate formate lyase was the preferred oxidative route. A shift to the pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway occurred at higher ΔS values, so that the highest YSS values obtained exceeded 0. 85 g. g- 1. A decrease in C 3 by-product formation resulted in high YSS values being maintained, indicating an additional, unknown source of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). It is recommended that any process utilising immobilised A. succinogenes cells should operate at an intermediate D, in order to maintain long-term reactor stability, high productivities and good yields.

40|$|The {{structural}} stability of transcriptionally inert paternal chromatin is of vital {{importance for the}} fertilization process and early embryonic development. Accordingly, a series of eight experiments were conducted during a 7 -month period to investigate: (1) effects of bull breed, individuality, successive ejaculations, semen quality characteristics (SQC), semen dilution rates and hypothermic storage of semen in a Tris-egg yolk extender on incidence of sperm nuclear chromatin instability (NCI), and (2) effects {{of the interaction between}} variation of NCI within a frozen ejaculate and variation of oocytes quality due to maturation time and/or season on the efficiency of in vitro embryo production (IVEP). Semen samples were collected once a week from six bulls using an AV and only ejaculates (n = 220) of > 0. 30 x 10 (9) sperm/ml and >= 60 % motility were used. NCI was measured by: (1) detection of lysine-rich histones in sperm chromatin using aniline blue staining, (2) sperm susceptibility to acid-induced nuclear DNA denaturation in situ using acridine orange test, and (3) sperm susceptibility to nuclear chromatin decondensation (NCD). Bovine oocytes (n = 695) were matured in vitro for 18 or 24 h, fertilized after sperm selection through a swim-up procedure and cultured for 72 h. The results showed that the 2 nd ejaculates were superior to the 1 st ones with respect to chromatin <b>stability.</b> <b>Dilution</b> of semen to 49. 67 +/- 8. 56 x 10 (6) sperm/ml (1 : 19) decreased resistance of sperm to NCD. Cooling of semen had no significant effect on chromatin stability. Cryopreservation of semen augmented sperm vulnerability to DNA denaturation. Improvement of SQC (semen volume, sperm motility, velocity, viability and morphological normalcy) was generally concomitant with increase of sperm resistance to NCI. While Blonde d'Aquitaine bulls had a resistance to NCD higher than Limousine bulls in fresh semen, the former showed a greater susceptibility to DNA denaturation than the latter in cooled semen. Individuality significantly influenced NCI. The variability of NCI within a frozen ejaculate affected efficiency of IVEP. Significant negative correlations were observed between incidence of NCI and both fertilization rate and developmental capacity of embryos after maturation of oocytes for 18 h. The significant variation in IVEP traits due to season was independent of the effect of sperm chromatin instability. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
