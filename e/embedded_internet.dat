40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the suitability of}} <b>embedding</b> <b>Internet</b> hosts into a Euclidean space given their pairwise distances (as measured by round-trip time). Using the classical scaling and matrix perturbation theories, we first establish the (sum of the) magnitude of negative eigenvalues of the (doubly centered, squared) distance matrix {{as a measure of}} suitability of Euclidean embedding. We then show that the distance matrix among Internet hosts contains negative eigenvalues of large magnitude, implying that <b>embedding</b> the <b>Internet</b> hosts in a Euclidean space would incur relatively large errors. Motivated by earlier studies, we demonstrate that the inaccuracy of Euclidean embedding is caused by a large degree of triangle inequality violation (TIV) in the Internet distances, which leads to negative eigenvalues of large magnitude. Moreover, we show that the TIVs are likely to occur locally; hence the distances among these close-by hosts cannot be estimated accurately using a global Euclidean embedding. In addition, increasing the dimension of embedding does not reduce the embedding errors. Based on these insights, we propose a new hybrid model for embedding the network nodes using only a two-dimensional Euclidean coordinate system and small error adjustment terms. We show that the accuracy of the proposed embedding technique is as good as, if not better than, that of a seven-dimensional Euclidean embedding.

We then show that there exist stronger embeddings into ℓ 1 which exhibit gracefully degrading distortion: {{there is a single}} embedding into ℓ 1 that achieves distortion at most O(log 1 /ɛ) on all but at most an ɛ fraction of distances, simultaneously for all ɛ> 0.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the veracity of}} a basic premise, “that network distance is Euclidean”, assumed {{in a class of}} recently proposed techniques that <b>embed</b> <b>Internet</b> hosts in a Euclidean space for the purpose of estimating the delay or “distance ” between them. Using the classical scaling method on a number of network distance measurement datasets, we observe “non-Euclidean-ness ” in the network distance. We find that this “non-Euclideanness” is caused by the clustering effect of Internet hosts. We also observe that the distance between the nodes in the same cluster is significantly more non-Euclidean than the distance between nodes in different clusters. Our correlation dimension based analysis of intrinsic dimensionality of the datasets reveals that the network distances seem to have a fractional dimension between 2 and 3. We observe that further increasing the dimensionality does not improve the accuracy of the embedding in Euclidean space. Motivated by these results, we propose a new hybrid model for embedding the network nodes using only a 2 -dimensional Euclidean coordinate system and small adjustment terms. We show that the accuracy of the proposed embedding technique is as good as, if not better than, that of a 7 -dimensional Euclidean embedding. I...|$|R
