25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Again {{there are}} {{technical}} {{issues relating to}} spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, {{the solution to the}} problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function θ(x). We say that if the function θ oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum pnbsp&=nbsp&h/λ, which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by θ would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field θ comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of V and A.) The result is that we have an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.|$|E

2500|$|Certain {{mathematical}} [...] "relations", such as [...] "equal to", [...] "member of", and [...] "subset of", {{cannot be}} {{understood to be}} binary relations as defined above, because [...] their domains and codomains cannot be taken to be sets in the usual systems of axiomatic set theory. [...] For example, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> model the general concept of [...] "equality" [...] as a binary relation =, we must take the domain and codomain to be the [...] "class of all sets", {{which is not a}} set in the usual set theory.|$|E
2500|$|With this in mind, MumboJumbo hired {{three members}} of Soulblighters modding {{community}} {{to work on the}} game, as they were so familiar with Soulblighters source code, upon which The Wolf Age was being built, and the Myth franchise in general. Although initially hired to work on the technical aspects of the game, such as level design, the members of the community soon became invaluable to MumboJumbo in terms of writing the storyline. Executive producer Mike Donges explains, [...] "The existing Myth community is still very rabid about the games. We {{want to make sure that}} we catered to them, so to do that, we had some people from the Myth mod community. They're our Myth lore experts, so <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> put in something new, they have the ability to [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{his return}} home in February 1919 he stated, [...] "I {{have come from}} France more firmly {{convinced}} than ever that Negros should write Negro music.

We won France by playing music which was ours and not a pale imitation of others, {{and if we are}} to develop in America we must develop along our own lines." [...] In 1919 Europe made more recordings for Pathé Records. These include both instrumentals and accompaniments with vocalist Noble Sissle who, with Eubie Blake, would later have great success with their 1921 production of Shuffle Along, which gives us the classic song [...] "I'm Just Wild About Harry". Differing in style from Europe's recordings of a few years earlier, they incorporate blues, blue notes, and early jazz influences (including a rather stiff cover record of the Original Dixieland Jass Band's [...] "Clarinet Marmalade").|$|E

60|$|We {{reached the}} river {{just before the}} dawn. To my horror it was very full, so full that the drift looked dangerous, for it had been swollen by the thunder-rain of the {{previous}} night.

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} appears {{when there}} is no natural choice of elements from each set. [...] If we cannot make explicit choices, {{how do we know that}} our set exists? [...] For example, suppose that X is the set of all non-empty subsets of the real numbers. [...] First we might try to proceed as if X were finite. [...] <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> choose an element from each set, then, because X is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we shall never be able to produce a choice function for all of X. [...] Next we might try specifying the least element from each set. [...] But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: if x is in (0,1), then so is x/2, and x/2 is always strictly smaller than x. [...] So this attempt also fails.|$|E
2500|$|Addressing {{the issue}} of {{remaining}} faithful to the two previous games whilst still introducing new elements to the franchise, MumboJumbo president Mark Dochtermann explained the developers {{did not intend to}} reinvent the series' basic gameplay, although they were keen to try out new things; [...] "There's a lot left to explore in the Myth franchise even before we go in a somewhat different route. Although, we are taking a [...] route in terms of adding 3D acceleration, 3D models, and doing stuff with the terrain engine and physics that are still way beyond what the other RTS games are doing right now." [...] Similarly, producer and lead designer Scott Campbell stated [...] "We intend to pay respect to Myth and its fans. We don't care to change the whole appeal of the game just so we can call it ours." [...] With this in mind, MumboJumbo hired three members of Soulblighters modding community to work on the game.
