30|$|Equation (9) {{suggests}} that if <b>the</b> <b>H-range</b> of a magnetic storm is doubled, the occurrence frequency decreases to about one seventh of the reference value.|$|R
30|$|We {{showed that}} the {{frequency}} distribution of <b>the</b> <b>H-range</b> of magnetic storms resembles the Gutenberg–Richter relation between earthquake frequency and magnitude used in seismology.

The frequency distributions of <b>the</b> <b>H-range</b> of magnetic storms {{are consistent with the}} frequency distributions of solar flares, which was shown to be a power law distribution in Crosby et al. (1993). Riley (2012) indicates that space weather events including flare intensity, coronal mass ejection speeds, and disturbance storm time (Dst) all exhibit power law distributions. Love et al. (2015) used weighted least squares and maximum likelihood methods to fit lognormal functions to Dst maxima for years 1957 – 2012.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGiven an {{integral}} “stamp” basis Ak with 1 =a 1 <a 2 <…<ak, {{and a positive}} integer h, we define <b>the</b> <b>h-range</b> nh(Ak) as nh(Ak) =maxN∈N|n⩽N⇒n=∑ 1 kxiai,∑ 1 kxi⩽h with non-negative integers n and xi. It is often of interest to consider parameter bases Ak=Ak(h), where the basis elements ai are given as functions of h, and examine the asymptotic value of nh(Ak) for increasing h. Considering parameter bases of a suitable “normal” form, it is shown that such bases can be grouped into associate pairs {Ak, Âk} with <b>the</b> same asymptotic <b>h-ranges,</b> nh(Ak) ∼nh(Âk) as h→∞...|$|R
30|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> {{magnitude}} of a magnetic event, we adopted <b>the</b> <b>H-range</b> which {{is defined as}} the difference between the maximum and minimum values of H-component during the storm event. The definition is also used by Tsurutani et al. (2003). Records of 81 magnetic storms at Kakioka lack their ranges and those are not included in our analyses. Data of four magnetic storms which occurred in the 1940 s include saturation of the instrument. The maximum values of H-range were 700, 560, 412, and 368  nT. We include these events in our analyses.|$|R
40|$|A_k = { 1, a_ 2, [...] . a_k} is an h-basis for X {{if every}} {{positive}} integer not exceeding X {{can be expressed}} as the sum {{of no more than}} h values a_i; X(h) is called <b>the</b> <b>h-range</b> of <b>the</b> basis. h_ 0 is the smallest value of h for which X(h) is {{greater than or equal to}} a_k, and h_ 1 is <b>the</b> smallest value <b>for</b> which X(h+ 1) = X(h) + a_k for all h greater than or equal to h_ 1. h_ 2 identifies a further "stabilisation" in <b>the</b> <b>h-range</b> - a definition is included in the body of the paper. It is known that h_ 1 and h_ 2 do not exceed h_ 0 for h-bases A_ 3, but published proofs are complicated (see Ch. VIII of [4], where references [3] and [5] are given). This paper introduces the concept of a "stride generator" A = { 1, a_ 2, a_ 3 } which, while sharing some of the properties of a basis A_ 3, is simpler to treat mathematically. We establish a relationship between stride generators and h-bases, and show that the result follows immediately if the stride generator underlying a basis has a particular property - here called "canonicality". The proof is lengthy (with a number of special cases to consider), but the underlying principles remain simple...|$|R
30|$|No {{significant}} difference {{is seen in}} the values of the slopes of the frequency distributions of both <b>H-range</b> at <b>the</b> three observatories; in other words, magnetic storms have no latitude dependency on the slopes around Japan, between 22.0 ° and 35.4 ° in magnetic latitude. Rastogi (2006) shows that storm time variations of <b>the</b> <b>H-range</b> are largest at stations close to the magnetic equator and at the midday longitudes from data at stations in India between − 0.7 ° and 45.2 ° in magnetic latitude <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 17 – 18 November 1989 and the 20 – 21 February 1992 events. Pulkkinen et al. (2012) indicate that the maximum amplitude of the horizontal magnetic field drops across a boundary at about 40 °– 60 ° of geomagnetic latitude <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 13 – 15 March 1989 and the 29 – 31 October 2003 events. Further analyses are required to confirm the latitude dependency of the frequency distributions of geomagnetic phenomena.|$|R
30|$|The Japan Meteorological Agency keeps {{records of}} {{geomagnetic}} phenomena observed at Kakioka (magnetic latitude, 27.47 °), Memambetsu (magnetic latitude, 35.44 °), and Kanoya (magnetic latitude, 22.00 °). We used these records {{to examine the}} cumulative frequency distribution of magnetic storms, sudden impulses, and storm sudden commencements. The distributions of magnetic storms resemble the Gutenberg–Richter relation between earthquake frequency and magnitude used in seismology. The coefficients determined with the maximum likelihood method show that when <b>the</b> <b>H-range</b> of a magnetic storm at Kakioka is doubled, {{the frequency of the}} magnetic storm is about one seventh, for example. Intense magnetic storms occur less frequently than calculated by the functions. This statistical analysis proves that there are no significant differences between slopes of the frequency distribution functions of the magnetic phenomena at Kakioka, Memambetsu, and Kanoya.|$|R
