5|$|She {{suffered}} from bulimia very badly. That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. <b>Had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of twenty years, Maria Theresa gave birth to sixteen children, {{thirteen}} of whom survived infancy. The first child, Maria Elisabeth (1737–1740), was born {{a little less than}} a year after the wedding. Again, the child's gender caused great disappointment and so would the births of Maria Anna, the eldest surviving child, and Maria Carolina (1740–1741). While fighting to preserve her inheritance, Maria Theresa gave birth to a son named after Saint Joseph, to whom she had repeatedly prayed for a male child during the pregnancy. Maria Theresa's favourite child, Maria Christina, was born on her 25thbirthday, four days before the defeat of the Austrian army in Chotusitz. Five more children were born during the war: Maria Elisabeth, Charles, Maria Amalia, Leopold and Maria Carolina (1748–1748). During this period, there was no rest for Maria Theresa during pregnancies or around the births; the war and child-bearing were carried on simultaneously. Five children were born during the peace between the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War: Maria Johanna, Maria Josepha, Maria Carolina, Ferdinand and Maria Antonia. She delivered her last child, Maximilian Francis, during the Seven Years' War, aged 39. Maria Theresa asserted that, <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> been almost always pregnant, she would have gone into battle herself.|$|E

25|$|Tennessee {{lacked the}} speed needed to ram the Union vessels as they passed, {{allowing}} Farragut to order {{some of his}} small, faster gunboats to attack the three Confederate gunboats. Metacomet, unleashed from Hartford, captured Selma. Fire from the gunboats holed Gaines, {{and she would have}} sunk <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> been beached; she was then burned by her crew. Morgan put up no resistance, but fled to the protection of the guns of Fort Morgan; next night she crept through the anchored Union fleet and escaped to Mobile.|$|E

25|$|Next, Seymour {{captured}} the privateer brig Aimable Manette in the Channel on 1 May 1797, after an eight-hour chase. She was armed with 14 guns {{and had a}} crew of 69 men. She was a new vessel, half coppered, and beautiful. She had been out 13 days, and not only <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> taken anything, the evening before she had encountered an outward-bound English yellow-sided ship armed with sixteen 9-pounder guns. The engagement had cost Aimable Manette 15 men killed and wounded and forced her to sheer-off.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Bishop Michael Cox of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church (an Independent Catholic group not in communion with the Catholic Church) ordained O'Connor as a priest. The Roman Catholic Church {{considers}} {{ordination of women}} to be invalid and asserts that a person attempting the sacrament of ordination upon a woman incurs excommunication. The bishop had contacted her to offer ordination following her appearance on the RTÉ’s Late Late Show, during which she told the presenter, Gay Byrne, that <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> been a singer, she would have wished {{to have been a}} Catholic priest. After her ordination, she indicated that she wished to be called Mother Bernadette Mary.|$|E
25|$|The two {{walked out}} of the library at 11:36a.m., ending the hostage {{situation}} there. Cautiously, fearing the shooters' return, 34 uninjured and 10 injured survivors began to evacuate the library through the north door, which led to the sidewalk adjacent to the west entrance. Kacey Ruegsegger was evacuated from the library by Craig Scott. <b>Had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> been evacuated at this point, Ruegsegger would likely have bled to death from her injuries. Patrick Ireland, unconscious, and Lisa Kreutz, unable to move, remained in the building. Patti Nielson joined Brian Anderson and the three library staff in the exterior break room, into which Klebold had earlier fired shots. They locked themselves in and remained there until they were freed, at approximately 3:30p.m.|$|E

25|$|Davydova {{also participated}} in the 1981 World Championships, her last major {{international}} event. The USSR won team gold. Davydova contributed more points towards the Soviet team score than anyone else. She {{finished third in the}} all-around final after an improper landing in the balance beam event. <b>Had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> sat down on her beam dismount she would have won gold. Davydova suffered a serious neck injury in pre-competition warm up but still finished 3rd AA and was the only gymnast from any nation to make all 4 event finals. Davydova was the total points top scoring gymnast at the 1981 World Championships. She won silver on floor and bronze on bars. She would have won gold on vault but was unable to stand the incredibly difficult vault of her own invention, full twist on front tuck off. Jackie Fie, the US Head Judge on vault at the 81 World championships wrote that if the other vaults were to be marked out of 10 then Davydova's one should be scored out of 10.5. Davydova's vault was the pinnacle of the event. It was the most difficult vault of the competition – in either women's or men's gymnastics. Davydova {{is the only one who}} has done a vault that a male gymnast has not. Until Gabrielle Douglas 2015, she was the only IOC Olympic champion, since 1980, to have medalled in a World Championships after she had won the Olympic AA title.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, she {{graduated}} from Hunterdon Central Regional High School. During her junior year there, she found acting after being benched during a varsity soccer game; her friend convinced her to audition for the school production of The Vampire, and she won the lead role. Farmiga went on to study performing arts at Syracuse University, from which {{she graduated}} with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1995. In her final year at Syracuse, she portrayed Nina Zarechnaya in The Seagull at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival, and the production won the top prize. Her drama professor, Gerardine Clark, stated: [...] "We'd never have won <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> nailed the fourth act. A number of the judges told me that".|$|E
500|$|The English tour raised {{little money}} but {{restored}} Wagner's spirits. On his return he {{began work on}} what {{would prove to be}} his final stage work, Parsifal, a project that would occupy him for most of the next five years. Cosima's influence was such that Wagner asserted that he would not have written another note, <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> been there. On a practical level, when the festival's creditors began to press for payment, Cosima's personal plea to Ludwig in 1878 persuaded the king to provide a loan to pay off the outstanding debt and {{open the door to the}} prospect of a second Bayreuth Festival. For Cosima's birthday on 25 December 1878, Wagner hired an orchestra to play the newly composed prelude to Parsifal. The concert also included the Siegfried Idyll; Cosima wrote afterwards: [...] "There stands he who has called forth these wonders, and he loves me. He loves me!".|$|E

60|$|But {{our present}} story {{will have more}} to do with his {{daughter}} than with him. A pretty girl, I have said, was Patience Woolsworthy; and one, too, in many ways remarkable. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> taken her outlook into life, weighing the things which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> and those which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not,</b> in a manner very unusual, and, as a rule, not always desirable for a young lady. The things which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> were very many. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> society; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> a fortune; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> any assurance of future means of livelihood; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> high hope of procuring for herself a position in life by marriage; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> that excitement and pleasure in life which she read of in such books as found their way down to Oxney Colne Parsonage. It would be easy to add to the list of the things which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not; and this list against herself she made out with the utmost vigour. The things which <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> or those rather which she assured herself of having, were much more easily counted. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> the birth and education of a lady, the strength of a healthy woman, and a will of her own. Such was the list as she made it out for herself, and I protest that I assert no more than the truth in saying that she never added to it either beauty, wit, or talent.|$|R

500|$|In April 1957 she debuted on Broadway at the Henry Miller Theatre in Hotel Paradiso, a French burlesque set in Paris, {{directed}} by Peter Glenville. The play only ran for 15 weeks, although she earned good reviews {{for her role}} as [...] "Marcel Cat". She later stated that <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> appeared in the play, her [...] "whole career would have fizzled out." [...] She followed this with an appearance in 1960s Broadway performance of A Taste of Honey at the Lyceum Theatre, {{directed by}} Tony Richardson and George Devine. Lansbury played Helen, the boorish, verbally abusive, otherwise absentee mother of Josephine (played by Joan Plowright, only four years Lansbury's junior), remarking that she gained [...] "a great deal of satisfaction" [...] from the role. During the show's run, Lansbury developed a friendship with Plowright, as well as with Plowright's lover and future husband, Laurence Olivier. It was from Lansbury's rented flat on East 97th Street that Plowright and Olivier eloped to be married.|$|E
500|$|... "The Wedding of River Song" [...] concludes {{the story}} {{arc of the}} Doctor's {{apparent}} death {{which began in the}} series opener, [...] "The Impossible Astronaut" [...] and resolves more pieces of River Song's timeline. Despite this, it leaves ambiguous whether the Doctor and River are legitimately married. Showrunner and episode writer Steven Moffat described it as [...] "a big roller coaster ride of Doctor Who madness". One of the [...] "mad idea" [...] he included in the episode, [...] "Live Chess", came because Moffat wanted to make chess— which he called [...] "one of the most boring games in the world"— into a dangerous spectator sport. Originally, the script did not include the brief scene with a Dalek; Moffat had intended to rest the Doctor's most famous adversary for the sixth series. Amy's confrontation with Madame Kovarian, a scene which shows what she might have been like <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> met the Doctor, was also added into the script later.|$|E
500|$|Members of Ferraro's {{family were}} indeed facing legal issues. Her husband John Zaccaro had {{pleaded guilty in}} , to fraudulently obtaining bank {{financing}} in a real estate transaction and had been sentenced to 150hours of community service. Then in , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense {{did not have to}} present its own testimony. Ferraro said her husband never would have been charged <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> run for vice president. Meanwhile, in , the couple's son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. He was convicted, and in , sentenced to four months imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between a free press and being able to have fair trials. Asked in , whether she would have accepted the vice-presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, [...] "More than once I have sat down and said to myself, oh, God, I wish I had never gone through with it...
