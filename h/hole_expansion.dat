According to ISO 16630 - 2009 (Metallic materials [...] Sheet and strip [...] Hole expanding test), hole expanding tests of 15 types of steel sheet were conducted using conical punch. The results {{indicated that there was}} obvious correlation between <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> ratio and tensile strength.

Steels with tensile strength of 700 MPa or more, including DP 780, DP 980, MS 1180, have a common characteristic that they have relatively high volume of the hard phase (martensite phase). Therefore, it can be considered that, with large different deformation capacity during the forming process, the two-phase (ferrite & martensite) interface of these steels is prone to crack and expand. When the hard phase (martensite) reaches a certain volume fraction, there may be a limit of the damage energy during the microscopic damage of the two- phase interface...|$|E

To study edge fracture behavior of AHSS, a comprehensive <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> test (HET) program has been carried out on a DP 780 sheet. Specimen with three different edge conditions (milled edge, water jet cut edge and punched edge) are manufactured and tested. Results reveal that the <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> ratio (HER) of the present DP 780 sheet is around 38  % for milled specimen and water jet cut specimen, and about 14  % for punched specimen. A novel method of a central hole specimen tension is also introduced for edge fracture study, showing a similar trend as found in HET. The paper briefly presents a procedure and the results for a full calibration of the DP 780 sheet for plasticity and fracture, where a hybrid testing/simulation method is used to obtain parameters for Hill 48 plasticity model and modified Mohr–Coulomb fracture model.

Thus, thorough analysis of these differences and accuracy improvement of estimation programs are essential. In this master thesis, five different sheet steels and seven HER estimation programs are selected to analyze the feasibility of the estimation programs. The thesis includes theoretical, experimental and discussion parts. Theoretical parts will introduce theoretical backgrounds which relate to the thesis topic. Experimental parts comprise tensile tests, <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> tests, HER program estimations and microscopy.

Surprisingly, the behaviour of the specimens having cold expanded holes was worse than that of specimens with untreated holes.

Several hypotheses were formulated and experimentally verified to overcome this problem, such as deeper hole deburring, rivet diameter, joint design and grip material, steel instead of aluminium alloy.

40|$|AbstractUsing the AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} we derive {{a formula}} for the entanglement entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The leading term in the large black <b>hole</b> mass <b>expansion</b> of our formula reproduces exactly the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy SBH, whereas the subleading term behaves as lnSBH. This subleading term has the universal form typical for the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal fields theories (e. g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical point). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and is related with the entanglement entropy {{of a black hole}} with negative mass...|$|R
