It focuses on the use of principal component analysis (PCA) to differentiate between fracture signals and high levels of background noise. An artificial acoustic emission (AE) fracture source was developed and additionally five sources were used to generate differing AE signals. Signals were recorded from all six artificial sources in a real landing <b>gear</b> <b>component</b> subject to no load. Further to this, artificial fracture signals were recorded in the same component under airworthiness test load conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to automatically differentiate between AE signals from different source types. Furthermore, successful separation of artificial fracture signals from a very high level of background noise was achieved. The presence of a load was observed to affect the ultrasonic propagation of AE signals...|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustic}} emission {{technique is}} a passive non-destructive testing technique that has significant potential {{for use as a}} structural health monitoring technique for many large-scale structures, allowing continuous global monitoring. The location capability of the {{acoustic emission technique}} is its most beneficial attribute; however, the location accuracy can often be limited in complex materials and structures. This article discusses recent advances in the location of acoustic emission signals. The key sources of errors are identified as signal arrival time measurement and processing algorithm limitations. A series of strategies for reducing the effects of both causes of error are presented.

40|$|Abstract. Acoustic {{emission}} monitoring was completed on a painted aerospace grade steel landing <b>gear</b> <b>component</b> undergoing fatigue loading until rupture. A post-test linear location {{analysis of the}} collected signals revealed eleven groups where high activity (greater than 2000 hits) occurred within a defined location, three of which corresponded in location {{to the position of}} fracture and final rupture of the specimen. Feature data, such as amplitude, rise-time, energy etc. were used to describe the identified signals in each group. A dimension reduction through principal component analysis of the feature data of all groups was performed. Results showed that high amplitude signals associated with four groups of signals arising from noise could be separated from the fracture groups. However four groups not associated with noise or the known positions of the fracture groups were not separable from the signals attributed to fractures. The paint layer of the specimen was removed and a magnetic particle investigation was completed that showed these four groups coincided with regions of additional fracture in the component...|$|E

40|$|Landing gears of {{commercial}} aircraft make {{an important contribution}} to total aircraft noise in the approach configuration. Using fairings to shield components from high speed impingement reduces noise. Furthermore, perforating these fairings has been confirmed by flight tests to further enable noise reduction. Following a more fundamental study on the application of perforated fairings, a study has been performed to investigate and optimize the benefits of bleeding air through landing gear fairings. By means of wind tunnel tests, an aerodynamic and acoustic survey has been performed on a simplified A 340 look alike Main Landing Gear to explore the influence of (perforated) fairings on {{the lower part of the}} gear. The results show that for this specific case, the application of impermeable fairings reduces noise in the mid- and high frequency range by shielding sharp edged components from high velocity impingement. However, below 1 kHz the noise is shown to increase significantly. Application of the perforations is shown to diminish this low frequency increase whilst maintaining the reduction in the mid- and high frequency range.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{approach}} to investigate the transformation curve of gearing safety. Two types of tooth failures are known to happen to spur gears. There are tooth bending failure (breakage) and tooth surface pitting failure. The focus of this study however {{will be on the}} JGMA and AGMA standards of gearing.

The most important data is the allowable torque applied on the gear tooth which can be distinguished into causing either one of the tooth failures mentioned above. Several materials selected from the JGMA and AGMA standards with high value of allowable contact stress compared to its allowable bending stress have a transformation curve from surface durability to bending strength when its torque values are plotted against number of teeth. This allows the forming of a combination threats curve for the material. The curves are useful in determining the maximum torque that can be applied on the spur gear before failures occur.

40|$|This paper details {{progress}} {{in the application of}} a methodology for acoustic emission (AE) detection and interpretation for the monitoring of fatigue fractures in large-scale industrial environments. The approach makes use of a number of novel signal processing techniques. An online radius-based clustering algorithm (ORACAL) is used to identify clusters of data, both in the spatial domain (locating AE sources) and in the feature domain (identifying candidate fracture processes). The paper proposes a new approach to the identification of AE waveforms produced by crack propagation; rather than seeking to identify the waveform features characteristic of a fracture event, the new method looks for specific patterns of clustering in the feature space. The approach is validated by a full-scale experiment. An artificial acoustic emission source, representative of a fatigue fracture, was injected into a test of a substantial landing <b>gear</b> <b>component.</b> A commercial AE monitoring system was then used to successfully locate and identify the source in a blind test using the new signal processing methodology. The method was successful on two of three experiments performed and the position of the artificial source was determined accurately; further analysis shows that the unsuccessful test appears to have occurred due to incorrect mounting of the artificial source. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic and {{aerodynamic}} {{measurements were}} performed in NLR's Small Anechoic Wind Tunnel {{on the air}} curtain concept, which is intended for landing gear noise reduction. The idea of this concept is to apply an upstream blowing slot to deflect the flow around a landing <b>gear</b> (<b>component),</b> thus reducing the local flow speeds and therefore the aerodynamically generated noise. Prior to the wind tunnel tests, a design study was carried out to assess the possible benefit of an air curtain and to define the test set-up. For the subsequent proof-of-concepts tests, two-dimensional half-models were mounted on an endplate which {{was attached to the}} lower edge of the wind tunnel nozzle. Blowing was applied through a slot in the endplate, upstream of the model. Microphone array and PIV measurements were performed to characterize the acoustics and aerodynamics of the air curtain. Tests were done for different wind tunnel speeds, blowing speeds, slot geometries and model geometries. For the relatively quiet baseline half-models in the present tests, broadband noise reductions of 3 - 5 dB were obtained using an air curtain with normal blowing (i. e. perpendicular to the main flow). The noise reductions could be increased to 5 - 10 dB by oblique blowing (30 ° upstream) or by applying a small flow deflector directly before the blowing slot. For full models larger noise reductions are anticipated. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustic}} emission (AE) {{phenomenon has}} many attributes {{that make it}} desirable as a structural health monitoring or non-destructive testing technique, including the capability to continuously and globally monitor large structures using a sparse sensor array and with no dependency on defect size. However, AE monitoring is yet to fulfil its true potential, due mainly to limitations in location accuracy and signal characterisation that often arise in complex structures {{with high levels of}} background noise. Furthermore, the technique has been criticised for a lack of quantitative results and the large amount of operator interpretation required during data analysis. This paper begins by introducing the challenges faced in developing an AE based structural health monitoring system and then gives a review of previous progress made in addresing these challenges. Subsequently an overview of a novel methodology for automatic detection of fatigue fractures in complex geometries and noisy environments is presented, which combines a number of signal processing techniques to address the current limitations of AE monitoring.
