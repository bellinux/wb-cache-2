5|$|Banza was {{appointed}} {{minister of finance}} and minister of state in the new government. The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighboring Chad, whom Bokassa met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to <b>help</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> if either {{was in danger of}} losing power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials to convince them that the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To the new government, this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.|$|E
25|$|Persons {{interested}} in learning to perform magic can join magic clubs. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and <b>help</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other—sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Ishaq (d. 761 or 767), an Arab {{historian}} and hagiographer, wrote the account entitled Kitab al-Mubtada (In the Beginning), reporting that Zechariah is Mary's guardian briefly, and after being incapable of maintaining her, he entrusts {{her to a}} carpenter named George. Secluded in a church, she is joined by {{a young man named}} Joseph, and they <b>help</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> fetching water and other tasks. Mary is later described as a widow, without mention of a previous husband. The account of the birth of Jesus follows the Qur'an's narrative, adding that the birth occurred in Bethlehem beside a palm tree with a manger.|$|E

They shall <b>help</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{in the event of}} any attack on the people covered by this document. There shall be sincere friendship, exchange of good counsel, fair conduct and no treachery between them.' The three local Jewish tribes were the Banu Nadir, the Banu Qurayza, and the Banu Qaynuqa. While Mohammad clearly had no prejudice against them, and appears to have regarded his own message as substantially the same as that received by Jews on Sinai, tribal politics, and Mohammad's deep frustration at Jewish refusals to accept his prophethood, quickly led to a break with all three. Unfortunate linguistic misunderstandings may also have given the impression, evidenced in the Quran, that the Jewish community was publicly humiliating Mohammad.|$|E
25|$|Bound in Blood is a first-person shooter {{in which}} the player can control one of two characters; Ray McCall, or his brother Thomas. Whereas in the {{original}} Call of Juarez, the player controlled alternating characters from level to level, in Bound in Blood, most levels offer the player the choice of which character they wish to play as, with each character having a slightly different style of gameplay. The character which the player does not choose {{is controlled by the}} AI {{for the duration of the}} level. There are also occasional levels through which the player must play with a specific character. In many levels, there will be times where the brothers will have to directly <b>help</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> such as Thomas helping Ray to reach a high platform, or Ray kicking down a door for Thomas. Most levels are played through in the same manner, irrespective of which character is chosen, with the only difference being that of style. Occasionally, however, the brothers will separate within a level, and, as such, the level design will be different depending on which character the player is using.|$|E

This {{resulted}} in [...] "professional jealousy" [...] forming with Penny, and in retaliation to their disagreements, he put {{her career in}} jeopardy by revealing her affair. Registrar Greg Douglas was appointed as Oliver's mentor. The fast-paced storyline saw Greg initially [...] "kick against his newfound responsibility", before realising that Oliver could be beneficial to his own career, which resulted in an [...] "unlikely friendship" [...] forming between them. Though a [...] "fairly light, buddy-buddy" [...] storyline to begin with, Anderson felt that filming their scenes was [...] "intensive". Speaking of their friendship, Anderson explained: [...] "We start {{off on the wrong}} foot with each other and we're competitive, which is unhelpful to the patients and (initially) we're not out to <b>help</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> at all. But they have similarities... in terms of dropping people in it." [...] The pace of the storyline had to be changed when Anderson injured his knee upon falling down a ten foot cellar. The pair clashed over conflicting medical opinions on patient care, and their friendship soon created a negative effect over Oliver's work ethic. Greg's jokes at his expense left Oliver unable to carry out simple procedures correctly.|$|E

500|$|The non-role-playing games {{all have}} {{different}} gameplay: Card Summoner {{is based on}} the Devil Children card game, and has the player do card battles against non-player characters. The gameplay is similar to , with cards being used to summon demons, to protect the player's health and attack the opponent. Puzzle de Call! is a puzzle game in which the player pushes around boxes to {{make their way to the}} pentagram at the end of each screen. Additionally, there is an egg placed in each screen, which disappears if the player does not reach it in a certain number of turns; if they reach it in time, it hatches, giving the player a new demon that can be used when solving the puzzles. Each level, which consists of a number of screens, ends with a boss battle in which the player needs to collect icons while avoiding the bosses' attacks. Messiah Riser is a real-time strategy game in which the player battles by giving their demons commands. It focuses entirely on combat, with no exploration segments between battles. The 2011 Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children is a social game in which the player collects demons, referred to as [...] "devils", and complete quests to become the strongest Devil King; the player can test themselves in daily tournaments. Like in the earlier games, collected demons can be fused with each other; there is also an added [...] "social fusion" [...] feature, where the player can fuse one of their demons with another player's demon. Players can also <b>help</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> by giving them demons and money.|$|E

It's saying, We are one, but we're not the same. It's not saying we even want to get along, but {{that we have to}} get along together in this world if it is to survive. It's a reminder that we have no choice". The Edge described it on one level as a [...] "bitter, twisted, vitriolic conversation between two people who've been through some nasty, heavy stuff". On another level, he suggested that the line [...] "we get to carry each other" [...] introduces [...] "grace" [...] to the song and that the wording [...] "get to" [...] (instead of [...] "got to") is essential, as it suggests that it is a privilege to <b>help</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> not an obligation. The band have been told by many fans that they played the song at their weddings, prompting Bono to respond, [...] "Are you mad? It's about splitting up!" [...] There was some speculation that the song described a conversation between a father and his HIV-positive gay son, based on the connection of the song to David Wojnarowicz, a gay artist who died of AIDS.|$|E
