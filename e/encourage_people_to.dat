A free shuttle bus system operates year-round in the valley, and park rangers <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly impossible to find.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} idea for The Garden of Words came from Shinkai's desire {{to capture the}} beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku, he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards. Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> visit, Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo. Following the earthquake in March 2011, he was worried that it could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film.|$|E

5|$|Project M {{first began}} as a {{development}} project to rework the character Falco to play like he did in Melee. The designers' goal {{at the time was}} for the game to be accessible to newcomers and <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> get better at the game, which was accomplished by creating a character roster that is more balanced. The mod's first demo was announced on January 15, 2011, with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament, where it was featured. It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Brawl, as well as new stages Brawl had not included. It was later given a solid date of February 7, 2011. A patch was later created to fix the demo's bugs and fine-tune the player's control of their movement direction after being attacked.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1309 when Gibraltar's defences were {{put to the test}} {{for the first time in}} the First Siege of Gibraltar. That year Ferdinand IV of Castile and James II of Aragon joined forces to attack the Muslim Emirate of Granada, {{targeting}} Almería in the east and Algeciras, across the bay from Gibraltar, in the west. In July 1309 the Castilians laid siege to both Algeciras and Gibraltar. By this time the latter had a modest population of around 1,200 people, a castle and rudimentary fortifications. They proved unequal to the task of keeping out the Castilians and Gibraltar's Nasrid defenders surrendered after a month. Ferdinand gave up the siege of Algeciras the following February but held on to Gibraltar, expelling the Moors and repopulating it with Christians. A keep and dockyard were built on his orders to secure Castile's hold on the peninsula. Ferdinand also issued a letters patent granting privileges to the inhabitants to <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> settle, as it was initially not regarded as a particularly hospitable place to live.|$|E
