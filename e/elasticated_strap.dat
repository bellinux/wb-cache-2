40|$|Axial {{acoustic}} wave propagation {{has been widely}} used in evaluating the mechanical properties of human bone in vivo. However, application of this technique to monitor soft tissues, such as tendon, has received comparatively little scientific attention. Laboratory-based research has established that axial {{acoustic wave}} transmission is not only related to the physical properties of equine tendon but is also proportional to tensile load {{to which it is}} exposed (Miles et al., 1996; Pourcelot et al., 2005). The reproducibility of the technique for in vivo measurements in human tendon, however, has not been established. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the limits of agreement for repeated measures of the speed of sound (SoS) in human Achilles tendon in vivo. Methods: A custom built ultrasound device, consisting of an A-mode 1 MHz emitter and two regularly spaced receivers, was used to measure the SoS in the mid-portion of the Achilles tendon in ten healthy males and ten females (mean age: 33. 8 years, range 23 - 56 yrs; height: 1. 73 ± 0. 08 m; weight: 68. 4 ± 15. 3 kg). The emitter and receivers were held at fixed positions by a polyethylene frame and maintained in close contact with the skin overlying the tendon by means of <b>elasticated</b> <b>straps.</b> Repeated SoS measurements were taken with the subject prone (non-weightbearing and relaxed Achilles tendon) and during quiet bipedal and unipedal stance. In each instance, the device was detached and repositioned prior to measurement. Results: Limits of agreement for repeated SoS measures during non-weightbearing and bipedal and unipedal stance were ± 53, ± 28 and ± 21 m/s, respectively. The average SoS in the non-weightbearing Achilles tendon was 1804 ± 198 m/s. There was a significant increase in the average SoS during bilateral (2122 ± 135 m/s) (P < 0. 05) and unilateral (2221 ± 79 m/s) stance (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Repeated SoS measures in human Achilles tendon were more reliable during stance than under non-weightbearing conditions. These findings are consistent with previous research in equine tendon in which lower variability in SoS was observed with increasing tensile load (Crevier-Denoix et al, 2009). Since the limits of agreement for Achilles tendon SoS are nearly 5 % of the changes previously observed during walking and therapeutic heel raise exercises, acoustic wave transmission provides a promising new non-invasive method for determining tendon properties during sports and rehabilitation related activities...|$|R
