2500|$|Changes in the (M-L) bond {{distances}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> symmetry {{and electronic}} states of metal complexes. [...] UV-vis spectroscopy {{is a very}} useful tool for {{the determination of the}} changes of electronic states due to the SCO. [...] For example, the HS and LS states of an FeII compound such as FeII(pic)3Cl2·EtOH, can be followed with UV-vis spectroscopy. [...] The absorption spectra of these FeII molecules at different temperatures clearly show the change in intensities of the spin allowed transitions, due to these symmetric changes. Similarly to FT-IR, the intensities of the absorption bands are proportional to the fraction of metal centers in the corresponding spin state; the more intense the band, the higher the fraction of metal centers in that spin state. [...] In Figure 9, the 5T2→5E absorption band, (left spectrum), corresponds to the HS transition and is centered at 830nm. [...] The optical density of the HS band is proportional to the γHS, and a γHS vs. temperature can be plotted as in Figure 10. The LS state is seen at a higher energy which is centered at 470nm (shown on the right in Figure 9). [...] However, the LS state absorption bands are indistinguishable due to the high intensity absorption bands caused by the Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) absorption bands.|$|E

2500|$|Music blogger Kevin Cogill {{streamed}} nine {{tracks of}} Chinese Democracy on his website Antiquiet for 'an hour or two' in June 2008. The website server crashed {{shortly after the}} leak {{because of the high}} user traffic, and the tracks were removed later. In August, the FBI, under the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act, arrested Cogill for pre-releasing copyrighted material. According to Techdirt, Cogill's arrest unintentionally resulted in a large boost in illegal downloads of the album. They also revealed that UMG showed Best Buy search engine traffic results shortly after the case to capitalize on the interest and help them with the distribution deal. In November he agreed to plead guilty to one federal count of copyright infringement, later brought down to a misdemeanor. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash commented on the case, stating [...] "I hope he rots in jail. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> sales of the record, and it's not fair." [...] Prosecutors initially aimed for 6 months jail time, but the charges were brought down to a misdemeanor copyright infringement charge. Cogill was sentenced to two months house arrest and was required to produce an anti-piracy video with the RIAA. Cogill claimed he never did the video with the RIAA due to them not wanting to spend money on production costs.|$|E
2500|$|Transitions from a HS to a LS state cause a {{decrease}} in the bond distances between the metal center and the ligand. The {{decrease in the number of}} antibonding electrons also strengthens the metal-ligand bond in transitions from a HS to LS state. Because the HS and LS states differ with regard to metal-to-ligand bond distances, the harmonic approximation can be assumed. [...] The LS state will have the smaller equilibrium distance - meaning that it has the larger bond force constant, ωLS>ωHS, and the transitions must fall within the thermal energy, kBT [...] In addition, spin transitions are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> vibrational modes of the ligands. A strong interaction between the metal and the ligand, as is the case of a LS state, is going to cause a shift of the electronic density to the metal causing a weakness of the interligand bonds, and therefore a red shift of their vibrational modes. [...] Figure 6 shows the FT-IR spectrum of an iron(II) cluster at different temperatures. [...] As the temperature decreases, the Fe-N bond distance decreases. Therefore, the CN stretching band shifts to higher frequencies and at higher temperatures, the CN stretching band increases in energy. In this figure, it is shown how the HS state CN stretching band at 2054cm−1 is predominant at higher temperatures and the LS state CN stretching band at 2099cm−1 is predominant at lower temperatures, in addition to the different mixed HS and LS state and the fading of this band as the temperatures change. The area under the curves of the absorption peaks for these two states are going to be proportional to the fraction of HS and LS states in the sample. Figure 7 shows a plot of the area under the curves of the absorption peaks as a function of temperature for the same iron cluster (vide supra), showing a large hysteresis loop.|$|E

I noticed that their answers followed very much the trend of class and politics. An adjutant, sergeant, or devout Catholic considered that men would be improved, gain self-command, and respect for law and order, under prolonged discipline and daily sacrifice. A freethinker of the educated class, or a private of Socialistic tendencies, on the other hand, would insist that the strain must make men restless, irritable, more eager for their rights, less tolerant of control. Each imagined that the war would further the chances of the future as they dreamed of it. If I had talked with capitalists--there are none among French soldiers--they would doubtless have insisted that after-war conditions were going to be easier, just as the [...] "sans-sous" [...] maintained {{that they were going to}} be harder and provocative of revolution.

The problems of developing clinically viable gene therapeutic approaches and designing safe and efficient gene delivery reagents are inseparable: shortcomings in one are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> adversely <b>the</b> success of the other. It is generally accepted that the major impediment to the successful application of gene therapy for the treatment of a range of dis-eases is not a paucity of therapeutic genes, but the lack of efficient non-toxic gene delivery systems. Transfection vectors com-monly used in gene therapy are mainly of two types: viral and non-viral. Non-viral gene delivery is currently the subject of increasing attention {{because of its}} relative safety and its simplicity of use; however, its use is still far from being ideal due to its comparatively low efficiency.

There have also been, however, {{a number of issues}} that have dampened the relationship, notably attacks against Chinese citizens, the presence of Muslim Uighur militants in Pakistan, who wish to establish an independent Islamic state {{in the western part of}} China, and policy differences over Afghanistan. While none of these issues is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> seriously <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> relationship, they have nevertheless created notable stress in an otherwise relatively trouble-free relationship. Moreover, China is only too well aware of the many domestic problems afflicting Pakistan. Accordingly, it will continue to be the cautious player in the relationship. Key points: Three issues, notably attacks on Chinese citizens, the presence of Uighur militants in Pakistan’s tribal areas and policy differences over Afghanistan, have put stress on an otherwise trouble-free, 60 -year old bilateral relationship. Pakistan is keen to deepen the bilateral relationship even further but China remains cautious. Beijing is not about to displace Washington as Pakistan’s main economic patron.
