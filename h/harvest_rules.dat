40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{empirical}} {{investigation of}} stumpage price models and optimal harvest policies is conducted for loblolly pine plantations {{in the southeastern}} United States. The stationarity of monthly and quarterly series of sawtimber prices is analyzed using a unit root test. The statistical evidence supports stationary autoregressive models for the monthly series and for the quarterly series of opening month prices. In contrast, the evidence supports a non-stationary random walk model for the quarterly series of average prices. This conflicting result is likely an artifact of price averaging. The properties of these series significantly affect the forms of optimal price-dependent <b>harvest</b> <b>rules</b> and expected returns. Further, the results have implications for conclusions about market efficiency {{and the performance of}} a fixed rotation age.

40|$|For {{fish stocks}} where the unit price of harvest is {{constant}} and unit harvest costs {{are independent of}} quantity and non-increasing in biomass, regulation based on target escapement (TE) {{has been shown to}} optimise the net present value (NPV) of harvest to society. This result has also been shown to hold for fish stocks characterised by stochastic recruitment, whereas a more asymptotic approach has been advocated if price depends on quantity. In this paper, these theoretical results are empirically investigated. Our case is the Norwegian spring spawning herring fishery, a stock with stochastic recruitment and price decreasing in harvest. For this fishery, the theoretical results are verified in that TE can no longer claim optimality. At constant prices, TE is found to outperform a more gradual approach, but this comes at a cost of a lower expected spawning stock {{at the end of the}} period investigated. fisheries management, <b>harvest</b> <b>rules,</b> target escapement, herring, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Q 22, Q 28,...|$|E
40|$|Uncertainties are {{widespread}} in Pacific salmon fisheries, occurring in both biological and management components. Despite recent attempts by scientists {{to account for}} uncertainties in stock assessments and incorporate them into advice to managers, some sources of uncertainties are often still ignored. My dissertation addressed four of these sources for Pacific salmon fisheries related to: forecasts of adult abundances, effectiveness of fishing regulations when implemented, the ability of management to achieve stated objectives, and international management institutions. First, despite evidence for long-term increases in age-at-maturity of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), these increases have not been accounted for when forecasting age-specific abundances of adult returns. To account for these trends, I developed a new forecasting model that used a Kalman Filter to track long-term changes in its parameters. Second, stock assessors and managers often assume that management targets are achieved exactly, but outcomes from fishing regulations rarely match targets. I quantified bias and imprecision in this "outcome uncertainty" for sockeye salmon fisheries on the Fraser River, British Columbia, and developed a method to adjust current <b>harvest</b> <b>rules</b> for that source of uncertainty. Third, although my research suggests that these two modifications to forecasting models and <b>harvest</b> <b>rules</b> are feasible, the magnitude of improved performance of management that includes these modifications is not certain. I evaluated the performance of these two modifications in a computer model for sockeye salmon fisheries in British Columbia and Alaska. I found that, compared to the status quo, performance increased when outcome uncertainties were accounted for, but in contrast to initial expectations, {{this was not the}} case when accounting for forecasting uncertainty. Fourth, salmon body sizes at a given age have declined across the North Pacific over the last fifty years, in part due to increased competition among salmon populations from different countries for a common pool of prey resources. However, the incentives for collective action to reverse this trend are not clear, creating uncertainties in resolving this common-pool resource problem. I investigated the potential for international cooperation on this problem by identifying the incentives and disincentives for altering behaviour of individual nation states to encourage collective action...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{interactive}} simulation model that links ecological and economic systems, {{and explore the}} dynamics of harvest patterns as they simultaneously affect natural and human capital. Our models represent both single and multiple systems. The level of natural capital is influenced by interactions of (1) natural capital growth and (non-human influenced) depletion, (2) ecological fluctuations, (3) <b>harvest</b> <b>rules,</b> and (4) biological transfers from one ecological system to another. We focus first on isolated systems {{in which there are}} no biological transfers between units and humans rely for subsistence on the resource; thus both the economic and ecological portions of the system are relatively independent of other systems. In this case, the maximum sustainable harvest rate depends on the local carrying capacity, the stock growth rate, and fluctuations in such ecological variables as rainfall and temperature, which are ‘extrinsic ’ to the stock–human harvest, but nonetheless affect stock levels. Next, we address spatially complex situations in which biological resources move from one spatial unit to others. In these models, the greater the potential movement of stocks across ecosystems, the more any particular human sub-system can increase its harvesting rate without danger of its own collapse — although at a cost to neighboring subsystems. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The last {{multiannual}} Community {{program for}} the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector (Commission Decision 2008 / 949 /EC) stated the provision of precision levels and sampling intensities of the estimates at national level. However, the unequal compliance of this standard has hindered its application in stock assessment and the consequent scientific advice. The cost-benefit analysis of a sampling program, besides addressing logistical and economic constraints, should deepen {{the potential of the}} tools currently available. This article proposes to test the calculation, provision and use in stock assessment of extensively collected precision parameters. First, sampling intensities and coefficients of variation of fisheries-dependent parameters are calculated using the COST software, a statistical tool specifically designed to quantify uncertainty in marine sampled data. Secondly, alternative ways are explored to provide precision parameters to the stock assessment coordinators by using InterCatch, the existing ICES web-based system to submit national data and compile international catch matrices. Finally, the incorporation of these precision parameters in the assessment model is tested, through a stock assessed by statistical assessment models (such as SS 3) which can account for sampling errors. Thus, {{it will be possible to}} quantify how errors in input data propagate through stock assessment models to affect <b>harvest</b> <b>rules,</b> and also to help identify the most cost-effective data collections that adequately support the advisory process...|$|E
30|$|The {{production}} of aboveground woody biomass in Romanian production forests was {{half that of}} German forests for the same standing volume despite a similar fertility and climate. <b>Harvest</b> <b>rules</b> and differences in rotation length are such that 2 tree crops are harvested in Germany during the time necessary to harvest 1 in Romania. Estimating the wood balance over the rotation length of RO, the difference in stand volume between RO and D of about 300  m 3 ∙ha− 1 is compensated by more than factor 2 by {{a higher rate of}} harvest in D versus RO. In D about 1400  m 3 ∙ha− 1 are harvested over two rotations as compared to about 700  m 3 ∙ha− 1 harvested in R. The national level features confirmed these regional findings and pointed to a productivity loss of 12.8 million m 3 ∙year− 1 for the Fagus and Picea forests used primarily for wood production, which represents about 25  % of Romanian forests yearly production at country level. This difference increases to more than 15 million m 3 ∙year− 1 if managed protection forests are included in the comparison. The potential productivity in both countries may not be strictly equivalent, though large-scale studies point to very similar NPP values (e.g. Ťupek et al. 2010; Bellassen et al. 2011; Babst et al. 2013).

40|$|We {{consider}} a management that aims at controlling the removal from the stock, {{guided by a}} perception {{of the state of}} the stock derived from limited data that does not allow an ordinary analytic assessment. In simulation modeling, there is a 'real' stock and 'real' removals, and the stock develops according to these removals. The management part creates a feed back loop through a noisy link between the state of the true stock and the actual removals. The performance of the management will depend on how the real removal responds to the stock, and how the stock responds to the removals. Structurally, this is a quite simple feed-back system. The interior of the building blocks is complex and diverse, however, and include obstacles like time lags and stochastic terms. When an analytical assessment is not available, the link between the real stock and the management decisions is harder to understand and model, and it may be noisier. The main emphasis in this paper is finding decision rules that rely on sparse and noisy data. A simulation tool runs as a bootstrap and was made to cover a variety of stocks, decision rules and noise in a versatile way, but on a quite generic level. The link between state of the stock and the basis of the decision was modeled as SSB (or alternatively total stock biomass TSB) derived from the real stock numbers at age, but with random noise and a random year factor.

40|$|Ocean acidification, the {{progressive}} change in ocean chemistry caused by uptake of atmospheric CO 2, {{is likely to}} affect some marine resources negatively, including shellfish. The Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) supports {{one of the most}} economically important single-species commercial fisheries in the United States. Careful management appears to be the most powerful short-term factor affecting scallop populations, but in the coming decades scallops will be increasingly influenced by global environmental changes such as ocean warming and ocean acidification. In this paper, we describe an integrated assessment model (IAM) that numerically simulates oceanographic, population dynamic, and socioeconomic relationships for the U. S. commercial sea scallop fishery. Our primary goal is to enrich resource management deliberations by offering both short- and long-term insight into the system and generating detailed policy-relevant information about the relative effects of ocean acidification, temperature rise, fishing pressure, and socioeconomic factors on the fishery using a simplified model system. Starting with relationships and data used now for sea scallop fishery management, the model adds socioeconomic decision making based on static economic theory and includes ocean biogeochemical change resulting from CO 2 emissions. The model skillfully reproduces scallop population dynamics, market dynamics, and seawater carbonate chemistry since 2000. It indicates sea scallop harvests could decline substantially by 2050 under RCP 8. 5 CO 2 emissions and current <b>harvest</b> <b>rules,</b> assuming that ocean acidification affects P. magellanicus by decreasing recruitment and slowing growth, and that ocean warming increases growth.

40|$|For several decades, {{economists have}} been {{concerned}} {{with the problem of}} optimal resource use under uncertainty. In many studies, researchers assume that prices evolve according to an exogenous stochastic process and solve the corresponding dynamic optimization problem to yield an optimal decision rule for exploitation of the resource. This study is motivated by our attempt to understand the relationship between efficiency in resource markets and optimal harvest decisions in which price is an exogenous state variable. The literature on optimal commodity storage finds that in a rational expectations equilibrium commodity prices are stationary and serially correlated. Yet recent papers on optimal timber harvesting that assume exogenous stationary prices generate <b>harvest</b> <b>rules</b> inconsistent with the price processes on which they are based. In this study, we investigate the appropriate form of the stochastic process governing prices of renewable resources. We develop a model in which timber is supplied by profit-maximizing managers with rational expectations and aggregate timber demand is subject to independent exogenous shocks. In contrast to earlier studies, prices are endogenously determined. Managers know the structure of the timber market and form expectations of future market equilibria in making optimal harvesting decisions. We show under general conditions that efficient timber prices are stationary and serially correlated. Stationarity and serial correlation are shown to arise from two sources: the occurrence of stock-outs (i. e., depletion of the inventory) and stock-dependent growth of the resource. Further, we show that prices retain these properties {{even in the absence of}} stock-outs. Simulations are used to further illustrate the analytical results. Our findings have implications for a large number of economic analyses of optimal resource use. First, our results reveal why extraction rules for renewable resources based on exogenous price specifications are internally inconsistent, even when the specification conforms to the stochastic behavior of prices generated by an efficient market. These prices arise in a particular structural environment, and if large numbers of resource managers adopt the harvesting rule, the underlying structural environment would change, and the price process would deviate from that used to derive the harvesting rule. Second, we show that there can be no gains from exploiting the stochasticity of resource prices in a rational expectations world, a finding that challenges the prescriptive policies for resource use found in many studies, including those on option values. Third, our results show that time-series analyses designed to test for the efficiency of renewable resource markets cannot distinguish prices generated in an efficient market from those generated in an inefficient market. Finally, we extend the literature on optimal storage. Previous models of commodity storage models are shown to be a special case of our model involving age-independent depreciation of the inventory.

40|$|Cicin-Sain, BilianaApproximately 29 {{percent of}} the ocean’s fish stocks that have been {{assessed}} are considered as ‘overfished’, with levels increasing the most in tropical waters which often border developing countries. Following over two decades of international agreement that overfishing is a global environmental problem, on September 25, 2015 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution setting 17 ‘Sustainable Development Goals’ that included a commitment to end overfishing by 2020. Global models have suggested that achieving this target will require {{a significant reduction in}} the amount of fishing effort, with unknown costs to states or in aggregate to the international community. Acknowledging that there are many determinants of human fishing behavior, this dissertation adopts an institutions perspective on fisheries, to focus on governance as one of the key (and most feasible) variables that can be changed in order to reduce current levels of overfishing. Governance is defined as a systemic concept relating to the exercise of control or influence over fishing activity by political, economic and social institutions, and the organizations emerging from them and articulating policies to implement or change them or establish new rules. Given the diversity of different types of fisheries, any changes or reforms to governance in order to reduce overfishing will be context-specific and only likely to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) in the aggregate. As such, empirical analysis can be useful to understand the types of governance reforms that could support progress in different contexts and at different scales, and their potential costs. Although a wide body of literature exists on governance reform efforts at the level of specific fisheries, and a growing body on national-scale reforms in developed countries with temperate waters, relatively few cases have been documented of national or large-scale fisheries governance reforms in tropical developing countries, where the trends in overfishing are growing. This dissertation aims to contribute conceptual tools {{that could be used to}} expand the body of empirical analysis of fisheries governance reforms in tropical developing countries at a national or large spatial scale, and answer the following questions: (i) what is the conceptual framework that would be needed to support greater empirical analysis of fisheries governance reforms in tropical developing countries at national or large spatial scales, and (ii) what conclusions can be drawn from a first application of this framework to a relatively new body of experience in tropical fisheries governance reforms, based on the recent portfolio of investments by the World Bank? To answer this question, a conceptual framework for ocean fisheries governance reform has been developed based on a literature review, as a common lens by which to assess changes in different cases and contexts, and the potential costs. This lens has been applied to the World Bank’s portfolio of public investments over the last 10 years, which provides a relatively unique body of data on developing country large-scale reform efforts, including financial cost data. Within this dataset, two case studies from different types of fisheries and geographies are described in detailed, one coastal in West Africa, the other with small islands in the western Pacific. Analysis of the World Bank’s portfolio showed several common types of fisheries governance reforms supported with varying degrees of success in contributing towards reducing or preventing overfishing, including establishment of co-governance partnerships between the state and resource users to create (or in some cases return) management rights for the latter over coastal and multi-species sedentary fisheries; introduction of effort and catch rights in industrialized fisheries; and enhanced efforts of state agencies to support reforms, notably to increase compliance with existing rules. The financial costs, i. e. those costs incurred by states, of reforms in the cases was on the order of $ 245 million total, across 11 countries and one regional agency (i. e. the regional effort in the SWIOFP), over a period of 5 years maximum. The financial costs of policy formulation and reform were relatively small across the cases, though this was often a relatively lengthy time process, while the majority of the costs were incurred in developing and enacting rule changes or new rules—generally the transaction costs of establishing and supporting community/stakeholder management rights in co-governance partnerships, and also the costs of enhancing operations of state organizations charged with supporting <b>harvest</b> <b>rules,</b> such as monitoring and surveillance to enhance compliance—essentially the enforcement costs. In terms of the economic costs of the reform, foregone production and resource rent did not happen at a large scale in West Africa, where effort reductions were achieved by reducing illegal fishing effort and the industrial vessel buy-back in Senegal never occurred. In the Pacific Islands, the introduction of reforms in the purse seine fishery prior to overfishing, offered the potential to avoid effort reductions and foregone rent, in favor of a cap or limit. More broadly, the scale of financing for reform—some $ 245 million in 11 countries over 5 years—is both significant and yet a fraction of the ocean fisheries in many of these countries: representing seven districts in eastern Indonesia, four out of nine Pacific Island Countries, 10 {{percent of the}} EEZ in Tanzania, just under 20 pilot sites for coastal sedentary fishery systems in four countries of West Africa, etc. The duration of reform has been a minimum of five years in these cases, with many not considered complete after this period. Given the timeframe, and the mixed picture of success (as well as lack of data) in the cases examined, a note of caution may be warranted as to the scale of reform efforts needed in tropical ocean fishery systems in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target. Both significant time horizons and some $ 245 million in external financing resources were needed in order to achieve globally modest reductions in fishing effort, though prevention of overfishing in the Western and Central Pacific purse seine fishery system seems likely to be more cost-effective. Even if much more external financing became available, in the cases reviewed the entry points and characteristics of reform suggest a process of years. While care must be taken in extrapolating from case studies, this research suggests that at the current rate the Sustainable Development Goal target seems unlikely to be met. Greater empirical research to understand the types of large-scale fisheries governance reforms that have led to reductions in overfishing in different developing country contexts, notably in the tropics, and the economic costs and benefits of these reforms, are urgently needed. This could lead to more causal research on the amount of new investment in ocean fisheries governance reform needed to end overfishing and meet the Sustainable Development Goal.

40|$|General scope. For much {{of human}} history the oceans have been {{considered}} incomprehensibly vast; an inexhaustible source of goods and services. Over the last century however, that paradigm has proved largely inaccurate. The ocean {{is in a state}} of crisis, caused primarily by human overexploitation. A rational reaction to the crisis is to limit fishing, often by designating swaths of the ocean as marine protected areas (MPAs). To be effective, it has been suggested that marine protected areas must cover between ten and thirty percent of the world’s oceans, ideally linked into MPA networks. Protection targets on this scale, however, present critical implementation and governance challenges. While some nations can effectively implement and enforce MPA rules, many are impoverished, and lack the capacity to centrally govern marine protected areas. Experience shows that centrally mandating MPAs and marine use regulations in these contexts is not realistic, and will often lead to management failure. A weak central government does not always imply that a nation's marine resources are unmanaged. To the contrary, thousands of community-based organizations in developing countries, ranging from fishermen’s cooperatives to entire villages, have implemented localized marine management institutions. The vast majority of vulnerable coastal marine habitats (e. g. coral reefs, sea grass, mangroves) are found in tropical developing countries with local governance contexts, and so investigating how collectively implemented institutions, including MPAs, function there is vital for improving global outcomes. Broadly, this dissertation addresses questions about how locally managed MPAs influence and are influenced by the complex interactions between marine ecosystems and human governance systems. Specific Objectives. This dissertation sets out to accomplish the following objectives: 1. Place the study of marine protected areas within a theoretical framework that enables a comprehensive and simultaneous analysis of social and ecological factors 2. Utilize a linked social-ecological theoretical framework to better understand the emergence, evolution and outcomes of marine protected areas in Vanuatu; specifically to understand: a. Historical factors and trends that preceded and shaped the current marine resource governance regimes found in Vanuatu b. Motivations and expectations of ni-Vanuatu people regarding spatial marine closures c. Situational factors that may enable the selection and implementation of diverse marine closure regimes d. Ecological outcomes of diverse marine closure regimes e. Ways and means by which positive outcomes of marine closures may be fostered and enhanced into the future Refining MPA social-ecological theory. Understanding why and how user groups manage natural resources instead of overexploiting them has underpinned the development of theories on Commons and Collective Action. But because these kinds of questions typically focus on people, resulting theories tend to be firmly embedded in the social sciences. Marine protected area concepts, on the other hand, are generally encapsulated within the natural sciences. New paradigms are emerging that link social and ecological systems, and MPA investigators now routinely consider both social and ecological variables in their research. However, the social variables they investigate are often selected in an ad hoc fashion; they are rarely rooted in robust social-ecological theoretical frameworks. Elinor Ostrom has recently forwarded a framework to theoretically link social and ecological components of resource management systems; but, it has not yet been utilized to guide the empirical investigation of marine protected areas. This dissertation adapts Ostrom's theoretical framework, and operationalizes it to suit marine protected area social-ecological investigations. The framework theoretically situates MPAs within complex social-ecological systems and highlights links among systemic components including the users (e. g. fishermen), resource system (e. g. coral reefs), resource units (e. g. fish), governance systems (e. g. community decision making), outcomes (e. g. increased abundance), interactions (e. g. fisher conflicts), related ecosystems (e. g. climate), social settings (e. g. demographics) and historical trajectories (e. g. resource declines). If MPA case studies are designed and interpreted in the context of the framework, findings will be cumulative and more easily comparable with results from other case studies, and even from unrelated social-ecological systems. Using the framework to fill specific gaps in MPA knowledge and understanding. Much of the marine protected area literature focuses on permanently protected marine reserves that prohibit all forms of extraction. In contrast, only a handful of empirical studies have investigated the social and ecological outcomes of closures that are periodically harvested. Situating each type of MPA in the framework as a guide to empirical research facilitates a theoretically-based comparison of permanent and periodically harvested MPA types. Empirical data collected at the finest resolution can be 'scaled up' via the framework and compared to patterns emerging from other MPA case studies. The empirical foundation of this thesis derives from the Indo-Pacific region, specifically the Republic of Vanuatu, where marine protected areas are commonly implemented, managed and enforced by island communities. In Vanuatu it is now common to find some villages implementing permanent no-take reserves, and others non-permanent closures (locally called taboos). On the islands of Nguna and Pele, different MPA rules are selected even among villages that are geographically adjacent, ecologically similarand share a cultural and linguistic heritage. The variability in MPA rules here has created a unique ‘natural experiment’ by which it is possible to tease out the theoretically based social and ecological factors that have influenced the differential emergence, evolution and outcomes of marine protected areas. Accordingly, much of this dissertation is based on carefully constructed case study comparisons among communities on Nguna and Pele Islands with different MPA rules. Of foremost concern to fisheries managers, conservationists and community stakeholders are the direct fisheries outcomes of different MPA rule types. Utilizing the comparative case study approach, the ecological conditions of periodically harvested taboos, permanent reserves and openly fished (control) sites were contrasted. Periodically harvested taboos were found to be suboptimal conservation strategies for some targeted organisms, for example giant clams and trochus snails because they are particularly vulnerable to harvest. Targeted fish species were found to have significantly higher biomass inside periodically harvested taboos than in adjacent openly fished areas, suggesting that in some contexts, periodic harvest may hold conservation and ecological value. This finding is directly relevant for the thousands of communities in the Pacific and beyond that implement periodically harvested taboos in order to boost stocks. It is widely assumed that MPA establishment in the Pacific islands will be constrained by food security concerns. Many quite rightly ask why an island community would choose to permanently lock up its limited coral reefs under a no-take marine reserve regime. This research on Nguna and Pele suggests that the primary motivation for establishing MPAs (of both types) is, in fact, to improve food security by stemming the rapid decline in health and quantity of target marine resources. Additionally, non-ecological motivations for community-based MPA establishment were widely held, including the potential to gain indirect benefits from tourism and foreign aid. Further, perceived MPA outcomes did not always coincide with ecological findings, suggesting that communities may be selecting MPA rules based on a combination of contextual, political and ideological factors. To date, no studies have empirically investigated how contextual factors enable the selection of MPA operational rules. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis enabled a qualitative-quantitative investigation into the combination of factors that potentially enable the differential selection of MPA rules on Nguna and Pele. Communities with notake marine reserve rules were found to possess high levels of some conditions (for example the capacity to enforce closures). In contrast, communities that select periodically harvested MPA rules are characterized by low levels of these and other conditions. This finding suggests that there may be non-linear thresholds above and below which certain MPAs rules become inappropriate. Additionally, periodic <b>harvest</b> <b>rules</b> may represent an ‘easier’ management regime for some communities to implement. To avoid MPA failure, donors and conservation organizations seeking to implement specific MPA rules (e. g. no-take reserves) will need to consider 1) adapting the rules to suit specific community contexts, or 2) building capacity and capital in order to create the conditions necessary for obtaining desirable rules. Marine protected area panaceas or blue-print approaches to MPA rules are inappropriate here as they are not effectively linked to community conditions. Today however, an unlikely MPA panacea is being actively promoted throughout Vanuatu: customary taboos. Cultural elites argue that Pacific Island MPAs should imitate taboos that they claim were developed in the ancient past, assumedly over millennia. But the communities on Nguna and Pele have no collective memory of coral reef taboos being employed on their islands before present times. To investigate the historical longevity of taboos and marine management in Vanuatu, archaeological findings, existing custom stories, oral histories and the first-hand accounts of early explorers, missionaries and anthropologists were comprehensively reviewed. In sharp contrast to the prevailing ancient management paradigms, little evidence was found to support claims that ancient marine management existed on Nguna and Pele. Rather, the evidence indicates that marine resources have been systematically overexploited throughout the recent and ancient past. In essence, customary taboo panaceas are likely being promoted because they maintain the political authority (and often economic livelihoods) of urban-located cultural elites or kastom gatekeepers. In reality however, it is dynamism and diversity that have defined ni-Vanuatu custom over the millennia; an historical legacy of adaptive capacity. Diverse MPA rhetoric and conflicting historical accounts have led to confusion within Vanuatu's small marine resource management community. Island communities often don't know whether to call their closures MPAs, protected areas, conservation areas, or taboos. Likewise, government agencies are unable to give accurate MPA status reports in fulfillment of international convention and treaty obligations. To overcome this challenge, a series of specific policy measures is proposed which would alleviate the discursive confusion surrounding MPAs in Vanuatu, while at the same time embracing and enabling the rich diversity of local management strategies. Building consensus on MPAs in Vanuatu is critical if island communities are to deal with the environmental, social and climactic changes that are predicted for the future. Moving Forward. Because the world is changing faster now that ever before, communities on Nguna and Pele are constantly facing new and unique marine resource governance challenges. Accordingly, important questions remain: Can institutional adaptation match the speed and scope of the global changes? What social-ecological factors influence the speed of adaptation/institutional change across different contexts? Why have some ni-Vanuatu communities been able to collectively organize and adapt their management institutions (to varying degrees of success) while others have not? This dissertation provides strong evidence that communities in Vanuatu have long been using and making decisions about marine resources. Institutions developed in the past and more recently guide the actions and strategies adopted by ni-Vanuatu people. These in turn are adaptive and responsive to local and supra local contextual factors. Having identified these patterns on Nguna and Pele and coded them into a decomposable theoretical framework, it becomes possible to formulate and test hypotheses about MPAs, both in the marine science discipline and across natural resource fields. Answering broader questions will require a more comprehensive research agenda; specifically a large-N theory-building empirical focus that crosses national boundaries, disciplinary confines and levels of organization and analysis. As this type of expansive research is beyond the capacity of most individual researchers, scientists will need to develop and make better use of theoretical ontologies that enable the standardization and translatability of existing case study research. Ostrom's proposed social-ecological conceptual framework will need to be expanded if it is to serve its purpose as a foundation for building cross disciplinary systemic models, testing hypotheses and translating case study data. In time this type of framework may provide a common language to scholars working across disciplines, at multiple scales and in geographically disparate locations. ...|$|E
