500|$|Tom Hall {{announced}} that Ananchronox would feature a [...] "turbulent {{story with a}} roller coaster of emotion", and promised it would bring personality and humor to the role-playing genre. Hall aimed to make an emotionally gripping, cinematic experience from the beginning: [...] "I want this game to answer the question, 'Can a computer make you cry?' I {{want to make the}} characters so warm and friendly and lovable and identifiable... <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> them off in fun situations, but as the game goes on, I want the atmosphere to get darker and darker. Friends betray the lead character, other friends die, and you will feel some of what they feel because you have been with these people for 50 hours, and in a sense, lived part of their lives with them." [...] Hall remarked that the characters were facets of his childhood. He later compared the name Anachronox (meaning poison from the past) and the internal struggles of each character, caused by turbulent events in their pasts and [...] "psychic poison." [...] Hall aimed to feature high-quality direction and camera-work in Anachronox, reminiscent of epic cinematic themes in role-playing video games like the Final Fantasy franchise. Hall enlisted producer Jake Hughes to direct cut scenes; Hughes had previously worked on several short independent films. Developers used real-time game cutscenes instead of live-action cinematics to avoid [...] " [...] players out of the game." [...] Hall remarked, [...] "All these games switch to cutscenes that look five hundred times better than the game. The secret is not to let the cutscenes kick the game's ass." ...|$|E

50|$|And {{there was}} Flaherty. Instead {{of being a}} favor for him, {{it turned out to}} be a favor for me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> him <b>to</b> direct The Captain's Chair and he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> because it would have {{involved}} actors, you know, and he didn't like that. … and then I thought of somebody else directing it. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> other people directing and all that—I thought I was beginning a great thing, you know.|$|R

5000|$|... "For {{my first}} film Herakles I needed {{a good amount}} of cash, {{relatively}} speaking, because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> shooting in 35 mm and not 16 mm. For me filmmaking was only 35 mm; everything else seemed amateurish. 35 mm had the capacity to demonstrate, more than anything else, whether or not I had anything to offer, and when I started out I thought to myself, 'If I fail, I will fail so hard that I will never recover.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|From 2004 to 2014, Sussman researched, {{worked with}} biologists, and {{traveled}} {{all over the}} world to find and photograph continuously living organisms 2,000 years old and older. Sussman says [...] "The project is part art and part science. There's an environmental component.

5000|$|Keys told Humanity {{magazine}} that [...] "the music for this album was created so fast—the fastest I've ever created music before. It was like raining down every night, like storms of music was just coming out.
