This study thus intends to improve the understanding and analysis of <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> that undergoes not only large deformation, but also large strain. Impulsive loads are potential threat to the safety of <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> besides wind load, earthquake, and ice storm. This research explores the area using an already developed P-I diagram method and nonlinear finite element modeling to provide an efficient and effective way for structural integrity evaluation for <b>guyed</b> <b>towers.</b> The mechanical characteristics of basic components of <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> are investigated first. Because <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> with large defection also have large strain in some parts, material nonlinearity is introduced by improving the existing FEM codes for trusses and cables. It is found that the improved methodology can well predict the performance of structures and tremendous difference exists between elastic analysis and inelastic analysis. Under seismic loading condition, inelasticity in material can help dissipate the inputted seismic energy and reduce the intensity of structural response. To evaluate the <b>guyed</b> <b>tower's</b> safety under impulsive loads, relative P-I formulas have been derived based on existing transverse velocity profiles of rigid plastic beams under impulsive loads. The impact of boundary condition and load types on the response is investigated. It is found under certain conditions only one failure mode is possible. But shear failure and bending failure can coexist under very severe impulsive loads. Most <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> are expected to survive light or medium impulsive loads due to their high redundancy and small loading area...|$|R

50|$|Much {{more rarely}} and {{interesting}} under constructive details are partially <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> at {{which at least}} one basement of the guy anchors is on the ground. At such structures, the guyed mast on the top is in opposite to <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> with anchor basements {{on the top of}} free-standing tower much taller (in most cases taller than the basement tower) and it must be considered at its construction and maintenance, that the basement of the guyed mast is situated much more elevated than that of the anchor basements.|$|R
40|$|Steel lattice {{transmission}} line towers (TL) {{are widely used}} as supporting structures for overhead powerlines. According to their supporting configuration, these free-standing tower structures are classified as: Self-supporting <b>towers</b> and <b>guyed</b> <b>towers.</b> In general, they are designed for conductors’ weight and environmental loads such as ice accretion and wind gustiness. Other exceptional loads, such as cable rupture and ice-shedding effects, are also considered. Due to an overall perception that these structures have a relatively low vulnerability to earthquake loads, the earthquakes effects are usually not considered in TL tower design. The current standards, for instance, do not require a design check for earthquake loads, although {{a significant percentage of}} {{transmission line}} infrastructure is located on Western and Eastern Canada where the seismic risk is considered high and moderate-to-high. The main objectives of this research are: i) to assess the sensitivity of typical TL towers to earthquake loads, ii) to propose a simplified static method able to approximate the seismic response of TL <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> and iii) to study the dynamic interaction between the overhead powerlines and their supporting <b>guyed</b> <b>towers.</b> In this study, two <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> (37. 7 m and 53. 1 m height) and two Self-supporting towers (36. 7 m and 57. 1 m height) designed according to current standard provisions were selected for investigation. Detailed three-dimensional finite element models developed in ANSYS-APDL software were subjected to nonlinear time-history analyses. To study the sensitivity of these TL towers to earthquake loads, two sets of ten seismic ground motions were selected as representative for Western Canada. The first set corresponds to site Class “C” and the second to site Class “D”. It {{is important to note that}} the frequency content of these records is close to the natural frequency of the studied towers. Each tower was subjected to the aforementioned sets of seismic ground motions and the responses in term of axial forces triggered in tower members were compared with those resulted from standard load cases used in design. It was found that <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> are the most sensitive to seismic ground motions. To reduce the computation time, an equivalent static method is proposed herein in order to approximate the seismic response of the free-standing <b>guyed</b> <b>towers.</b> Finally, the dynamic interaction between the overhead powerlines and their supporting <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> is evaluated. This is done by carrying out detailed nonlinear transient simulations of the coupled tower-conductor system for a set of earthquake ground motion records of different frequency contents and by comparing the results of these simulations with the ones carried out for the free-standing towers...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for personal communication services (PCS), such as digital {{cell phones and}} pagers, as well as digital television (DTV), has created new challenges for creating and maintaining telecommunications towers. For such communication tools, antenna towers are the best choice because they are relatively economical and effective for remote transmission, especially in North America where land area is large. Wireless firms are further pressured to complete digital systems {{within the next five}} years and to provide 2 ̆ 2 seamless 2 ̆ 2 coverage. The Canadian Standard for Antennas, Towers and Antenna-Supporting Structures, CSA-S 37 - 01, provides guidance for seismic analysis of lattice towers. However, simplified design method for equivalent static forces for seismic analysis of <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> that covers different zones in North America is as yet unavailable especially for towers 300 m high and up. Furthermore, the upcoming (2005) National Building Code of Canada introduces new seismic hazard values in which the spectral levels of seismic loads are changed based on probabilistic response spectra of earthquake events. Analysis for <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> based on these hazard levels is not yet available. In addition, the American Society of Civil Engineers Task Committee on the Dynamic Response of Lattice Towers has recently stated that 2 ̆ 2 No approximate static method has been proposed yet for the seismic analysis of guyed masts 2 ̆ 2. The objectives of this research are to evaluate the seismic performance of <b>guyed</b> telecommunication <b>towers</b> in North America, to contribute to the efficient design of such towers by developing computer-based, analytical models capable of predicting accurately their response when subjected to seismic loading conditions, and to provide guidelines for the Performance Based Design (PBD) of such structures. The study incorporated 24 earthquake records and nine tall <b>guyed</b> telecommunication <b>towers</b> with heights varying from 60 to 591 m. The study proposes a simplified design method for the equivalent static forces due to the effect of seismic loading on <b>guyed</b> <b>towers.</b> This method can be used to predict the envelope of the base shear, bending moment, vertical reaction in the mast of <b>guyed</b> <b>towers</b> as well as the maximum tension in the guys along the elevation of the mast.
