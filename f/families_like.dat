25|$|Today, {{the nobility}} is a {{relatively}} marginal factor in the society, culturally and socially {{as well as in}} politics. Members of noble families are only individually prominent, like Anniken Huitfeldt. However, a handful of <b>families,</b> <b>like</b> Løvenskiold, Treschow, and Wedel-Jarlsberg, still possess considerable wealth. This includes fame and regular appearance in newspapers and also coloured magazines.|$|E
25|$|During {{the rule}} of the Seunas, ruling chieftains who were related to the Seuna kings were from Kannada-speaking <b>families,</b> <b>like</b> the Seunas of Masavadi in present-day Dharwad. Dr. A. V. Narasimha Murthy opined that during the later part of the Rashtrakuta rule from Manyakheta, Seuna chieftains were {{despatched}} from the Karnataka region to rule near Nasik.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{there were}} then some 50-60 {{influential}} and very wealthy families {{and with great}} family history, sometimes with Prince titles. However, those families did not have same impact {{on the politics of}} the Commonwealth, still being considered as Magnats of the Commonwealth. Among them there are most magnificent <b>families</b> <b>like</b> Lanckoronski, Tarnowski, Tęczyński, Prince Holszanski, Rzewuski, Gonzaga-Myszkowski or Prince Czertwertynski.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{particles}} like af, von, and de—all these mean of—was no particular privilege for the nobility, {{but on the}} other hand almost exclusively used by and associated with them. Especially in the late 17th century and the 18th century, one would often receive a particle together with one’s old or new name when ennobled. Examples are <b>families</b> <b>like</b> de Gyldenpalm (lit. ‘of Goldenpalm’) and, with two particles, von Munthe af Morgenstierne (lit. ‘of Munthe of Morningstar’).|$|E
25|$|With the {{financial}} expansion, trading rights became more jealously guarded by the commercial elite. Towns saw the growing power of guilds, {{while on a}} national level special companies would be granted monopolies on particular trades, like the English wool Staple. The beneficiaries of these developments would accumulate immense wealth. <b>Families</b> <b>like</b> the Fuggers in Germany, the Medicis in Italy, the de la Poles in England, and individuals like Jacques Coeur in France would help finance the wars of kings, and achieve great political influence in the process.|$|E
25|$|In 1704, Chastelein bought another land {{which later}} he named Weltevreden. In this new estate he {{established}} the first experimental coffee plantation in the Indies, {{as well as}} the first Indies zoo. In the estate of Depok he created a pepper plantation. It can not be a coincidence that Chastelein had let this family work in Depok, slave <b>families</b> <b>like</b> Laurens and Loen from Ambon. During the period he wrote a dissertation in which he established an ethical manifestation against Dutch East India Company's merchant politics, especially toward Governor General Willem van Outhoorn, who was in favor of aggressive trade policy.|$|E

25|$|Eco-tourism aims to be ecologically and {{socially}} conscious; {{it focuses on}} local culture, wilderness, and adventure. Nicaragua's eco-tourism grows every year, as the country boasts a number of eco-tourist tours and perfect places for adventurers. Nicaragua has three eco-regions, the Pacific, Central and Atlantic, which contain volcanoes, tropical rainforest and agricultural land. The majority of ecolodges and other environmentally-focused touristic destinations are found on Ometepe Island, found {{in the middle of}} Lake Nicaragua, an hour's boat ride from Granada. While some are foreign-owned, such as the tropical permaculture lodge at Finca El Zopilote, others are owned by local <b>families,</b> <b>like</b> the small but acclaimed Finca Samaria.|$|E
25|$|By 1553, the Board of Ordnance in London had {{purchased}} more than 250 of Levett's guns. At a stroke, this English parson {{who had the}} armaments business thrust on him by {{death in the family}} had morphed into a full-blown entrepreneur. Iron casting and cannon-making became England's first modern industrial economy. Old landowning <b>families</b> <b>like</b> the Sidneys, the Carylls, the Coverts and the Gratwickes rushed {{to cash in on the}} boom, which lasted for more than two centuries. The wars of Henry VIII were good for business: the 20 blast furnaces and 28 forges in Sussex in 1549 more than doubled in 25 years to 50 furnaces and 60 forges. The secret was in the English method of vertical casting.|$|E
25|$|The next 300-400 {{families}} (of {{in total}} {{tens of thousands}} of noble families) counting in power and land possession in the Commonwetlh could more likely be equal to the European aristocracy when referring to counts and barons. Those families should also be included as aristocrats but most publications refer only to titled nobility as the aristocracy which is not in accordance with Polish rank system {{during the time of the}} Commonwealth. There were many wealthy and influential families that hold several offices in the family like Voivode, Castellan, Bishop or Hetman which gave them a place in the Senat of the Commonwealth. This group hold many great <b>families</b> <b>like</b> Sieniawski, Arciszewski, Ossolinski, Koniecpolski, Prince Giedrojc and finally also many families included in the Clan of Ostoja.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Sicilians preferred independence to the Savoy kingdom; in 1866, Palermo became {{the seat of}} a week-long popular rebellion, which was finally crushed after Martial law was declared. The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several <b>families,</b> <b>like</b> the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century, Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libertà. These roads would soon boast {{a huge number of}} villas in the Art Nouveau style. Many of these were designed by the famous architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, {{is a good example of}} Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, and built by the Rutelli & Machì building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897.|$|E

500|$|In later periods, life-size {{sculptures of}} the {{deceased}} reclining as though at a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style. [...] Family tombs for the grandest late Roman <b>families,</b> <b>like</b> the Tomb of the Scipios, were large mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and bedrooms. [...] The Castel Sant'Angelo, built for Hadrian, was later converted into a fortress. [...] Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen. [...] Ancestor portraits, usually {{in the form of}} wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards, although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the atrium. [...] They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by Pliny the Elder and Polybius. [...] Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield (clipeus), and having it hung in a temple or other public place. [...] No examples of either type have survived.|$|E
500|$|The Apple River Fort was {{constructed}} by the early settlers in the region in present-day Elizabeth, Illinois for protection during the 1832 Black Hawk War. At {{the onset of the}} Black Hawk War, settlers in southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois constructed a series of [...] forts, stockades, and fortified homes; Apple River Fort was one of the forts erected after the Illinois Militia's defeat at Stillman's Run on May 14. The Galenian newspaper reported that the blockhouse was finished on May 22, 1832, with the stockade completed several days later. A militia company was formed from among the local families and single men and boys. This unit elected local surveyor and land-owner Clack Stone, as cptain and commander of the settlement's militia contingent. The Apple River settlement, {{at the time of the}} fort's completion, was home to several families who had traveled long distances: the Crains, the Armstrongs, and others. Some <b>families,</b> <b>like</b> the Flacks, the Howards, and Lawhorns and others took up residence in nearby cabins. The Murdock family already resided in a homestead near the new fort. Relatively few contemporary descriptions of the fort exist. One of the more complete later descriptions—and the only one to mention the blockhouse in detail—is found in the 1878 post-Black Hawk War text The History of Jo Daviess County: ...|$|E
500|$|Though Shiva is worshipped across Maharashtra in his {{original}} form, some Maharashtrian communities prefer to worship him {{in form of}} his avatars, Khandoba being the most popular. He {{is the most popular}} Kuldevta (family deity) in Maharashtra. One of the most widely worshipped gods of the Deccan plateau, Khandoba is considered as [...] "the premier god of Sakama bhakti (wish-granting devotion) {{and one of the most}} powerful deities responsive to vows (navas)". He is worshipped by the vast majority of Marathi Hindu people from all strata of that society. He is the patron deity of warrior, farming, herding as well as some Brahmin (priest) castes, the hunters and gatherers of the hills and forests, merchants and kings. The cult of Khandoba in the Deccan principally consists of peasant classes Marathas and Kunabis, shepherd Dhangars, village guards and watchmen Ramoshis— a [...] "Denotified tribe", the former [...] "untouchable" [...] Mahars and Mangs, fisher-folk Kolis, balutedar castes like gardeners (Mali) and tailors (Shimpi), though it also includes of a few Brahmins and even some Muslims. Although Brahmin presence is nominal in his cult, Deshastha Brahmins, as well as the Kokanastha Brahmins - in Nashik and Satara - do worship Khandoba, some imitating the Deshastha Brahmins. The Deshastha Brahmins, Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus, as well as the royal <b>families</b> <b>like</b> Gaikwads and Holkars worship Khandoba as their Kuldevta. He is also worshipped by Jains and Lingayats. He is viewed as a [...] "king" [...] of his followers.|$|E
