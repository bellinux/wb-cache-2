500|$|When Will ridicules Sue's fashion sense, Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{give her}} a makeover, recreating Madonna's [...] "Vogue" [...] video. Guidance {{counsellor}} Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) is inspired by Madonna's example, and tells Will that she intends to lose her virginity to him that evening. Santana (Naya Rivera) offers to take Finn's virginity, and Rachel and her boyfriend Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) also decide to have sex, leading to a dream performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] between all three couples. Ultimately, Emma and Rachel do not go through with it, but Finn does have sex with Santana. He later hides this from Rachel, having concluded that the sex was meaningless, and that he truly regretted it, in contrasted with Rachel, who despite not going through with it, claims she <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> said {{and it was no}} big deal.|$|E
2500|$|Abram and Sarai {{tried to}} make sense of how he would become a {{progenitor}} of nations, because after 10 years of living in Canaan, no child had been born. Sarai then offered her Egyptian handmaiden, Hagar, to Abram with the intention that she would bear him a son. After Hagar found she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress, Sarai. Therefore, Sarai mistreated Hagar, and Hagar fled away. En route an angel spoke with Hagar at the fountain in the way to Shur. He instructed her to return and that her son would be [...] "a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell {{in the face of all}} his brethren." [...] She was told to call her son Ishmael. Hagar then called God who spoke to her [...] "El-roi", ("Thou God seest me:" [...] KJV). From that day, the well was called Beer-lahai-roi, ("The well of him that liveth and seeth me." [...] KJV margin). She then <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was instructed by returning to her mistress in order to have her child. Abram was eighty-six years of age when Ishmael was born.|$|E
2500|$|To {{make way}} for the Bourbons, Grand Duke Ferdinand III was ousted and {{compensated}} with Salzburg. Maria Luisa, who had never lived away from her own family and was totally inexperienced in political affairs, opposed the plan. One of Napoleon's conditions was that the young couple had to go to Paris and there receive from him the investiture of their new sovereignty, before taking possession of Etruria. Maria Luisa was reluctant to make a trip to France, where only seven years earlier her relatives Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had been executed. However, pressed also by her family, she <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was told. On 21 April 1801 the couple and their son left Madrid, crossed the border in Bayonne and traveled incognito to France under the name of Counts of Livorno. Napoleon received them with great attentions, at their arrival in Paris on 24 May. At first, the young couple did not make a good impression. In her memoirs, the Duchess of Abrantes described Maria Luisa's character as a [...] "mixture of shyness and haughtiness which at first gave restraint to her conversation and manners".|$|E
