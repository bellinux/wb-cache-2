5|$|Glaciers {{were present}} on the volcano until the {{conclusion}} of the Little Ice Age, {{at the beginning of the}} 20thcentury. Pleistocene glaciers have largely eroded Thielsen's calderaleading to exposure of its contents. The small Lathrop Glacier in the northern cirque of the volcano is the only extant glacier on Mount Thielsen.

5|$|Outside of {{the urban}} area, the City of Skopje {{encompasses}} many small settlements.

Other large settlements are located north of the city, such as Radišani, with 9,000 inhabitants, whereas smaller villages can be found on Mount Vodno or in Saraj municipality, which is the most rural of the ten municipalities that form the City of Skopje.|$|E

In the 2000s, the hospital was changed from a primary and secondary care to a specialized tertiary care center, receiving complex cases from other hospitals and clinics in the region, but around 60% of patients in the hospital are still cases that could be handled by local health centers.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park <b>has</b> <b>almost</b> all its {{original}} native {{plant and animal}} species. Large mammals such as Grizzly bears, moose, and mountain goats, as well as rare or endangered species like wolverines and Canadian lynxes, inhabit the park. Hundreds of species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species, and a few reptile and amphibian species have been documented. The park has numerous ecosystems ranging from prairie to tundra. Notably, the easternmost forests of western redcedar and hemlock grow in the southwest portion of the park. Large forest fires are uncommon in the park. However, in 2003 over 13% of the park burned.|$|E

5|$|Maya stone {{sculpture}} {{emerged into}} {{the archaeological record}} as a fully developed tradition, suggesting {{that it may have}} evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood. Because of the biodegradability of wood, the corpus of Maya woodwork <b>has</b> <b>almost</b> entirely disappeared. The few wooden artefacts that have survived include three-dimensional sculptures, and hieroglyphic panels. Stone Maya stelae are widespread in city sites, often paired with low, circular stones referred to as altars in the literature. Stone sculpture also took other forms, such as the limestone relief panels at Palenque and Piedras Negras. At Yaxchilan, Dos Pilas, Copán, and other sites, stone stairways were decorated with sculpture. The hieroglyphic stairway at Copán comprises the longest surviving Maya hieroglyphic text, and consists of 2,200 individual glyphs.|$|E
5|$|The Château de Verteuil is {{recorded}} in 1080 as {{the property of}} the Lord of La Rochefoucauld. Since then the castle <b>has</b> <b>almost</b> always belonged to a member of this family. The first recorded successful siege was in 1135, by Count Wulgrin II of Angoulême (–1140), when the castle belonged to Aymar II de la Rochefoucauld. Hostilities continued between their descendants, William VI of Angoulême (died 1179) and Guy IV of la Rochefoucauld, but had ceased by 1170 when they both attended the dedication of the church of Saint-Amant-de-Boixe. Louis VII of France (1120–80) and Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122–1204) may have stayed at Verteuil in 1137. Eleanor's mother was a Rochefoucauld, and due to the unsettled state of the country the young couple only stayed in safe and preferably well-fortified places in their journey from Bordeaux to Paris.|$|E
5|$|The M. {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC) {{includes four}} other TB-causing mycobacteria: M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canetti, and M. microti. M. africanum is not widespread, {{but it is}} a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa. M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of pasteurized milk <b>has</b> <b>almost</b> completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. M. canetti is rare and seems to be limited to the Horn of Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants. M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in human societies {{has led to}} the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory. Smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres in the world that are authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population <b>has</b> <b>almost</b> no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{consists}} of parchment, originally in double sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four columns (48 lines per column) with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two columns per page. The codex <b>has</b> <b>almost</b> 4,000,000 uncial letters.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in Greenwich Village, New York. The main character, Mike de Wolf, is a {{struggling}} pianist. His friend, Horace Hackett, {{is an author}} and popular pulp fiction writer. Hackett is portrayed in the book as a skilled writer able to quickly produce voluminous amounts of material for pulp magazines. Hackett writes under stress, as he is facing a deadline. Hackett attempts to persuade his book publisher that he <b>has</b> <b>almost</b> finished writing his latest novel, while in actuality he has already depleted his advance payment prior to coming {{up with an idea}} for a story. Hackett's publisher pressures him and he rapidly decides to place his friend Mike as the central character in his story.|$|E
