5|$|Copper {{is one of}} a few {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the <b>energy</b> <b>difference</b> between these shells corresponds to orange light.|$|E
5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an <b>energy</b> <b>difference</b> matching {{the energy of the}} interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E
5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, {{it was predicted that}} the ground-state electron configuration of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (ground state term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium. However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 configuration. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 relativistic calculations concluded that the <b>energy</b> <b>difference</b> between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s2p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.|$|E

Rigid molecule lattice dynamical calculations {{have also been}} performed to estimate the vibrational contributions to lattice free energies. Distributions of the <b>differences</b> in lattice <b>energy,</b> free energy, zero point energy, entropy and heat capacity between polymorphs are presented. Polymorphic lattice <b>energy</b> <b>differences</b> are typically very small: over half of polymorph pairs are separated by less than 2 kJ mol? 1 and lattice <b>energy</b> <b>differences</b> exceed 7. 2 kJ mol? 1 in only 5 % of cases. Unsurprisingly, vibrational contributions to polymorph free <b>energy</b> <b>differences</b> at ambient conditions are dominated by entropy differences. The distribution of vibrational <b>energy</b> <b>differences</b> is narrower than lattice <b>energy</b> <b>differences,</b> rarely exceeding 2 kJ mol? 1.

5|$|Plutonium is {{an element}} in which the 5f {{electrons}} are the transition border between delocalized and localized; it is therefore {{considered one of the}} most complex elements. The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure. The <b>energy</b> <b>difference</b> between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn−16d17s2 configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|The stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold, {{all have}} an outer {{electron}} configuration nd10(n+1)s1. For {{each of these}} elements, the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration nd9(n+1)s2. Due to spin-orbit coupling between the d electrons, this state is split {{into a pair of}} energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d97s2 level is stabilized {{to such an extent that}} it becomes the ground state and the 6d107s1 level becomes the first excited state. The resulting <b>energy</b> <b>difference</b> between the new ground state and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance.

25|$|A {{metal ion}} {{with a single}} {{unpaired}} electron, such as Cu2+, in a coordination complex provides the simplest illustration of the mechanism of paramagnetism. The individual metal ions are kept far apart by the ligands, {{so that there is}} no magnetic interaction between them. The system is said to be magnetically dilute. The magnetic dipoles of the atoms point in random directions. When a magnetic field is applied, first-order Zeeman splitting occurs. Atoms with spins aligned to the field slightly outnumber the atoms with non-aligned spins. In the first-order Zeeman effect the <b>energy</b> <b>difference</b> between the two states is proportional to the applied field strength. Denoting the <b>energy</b> <b>difference</b> as ΔE, the Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of the two populations as , where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in kelvins. In most cases ΔE is much smaller than kT and the exponential can be expanded as 1 – ΔE/kT. It follows from the presence of 1/T in this expression that the susceptibility is inversely proportional to temperature.|$|E

25|$|The {{spectrum}} of the scattered photons is termed the Raman spectrum. It shows {{the intensity of the}} scattered light as a function of its frequency difference Δν to the incident photons. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks form a symmetric pattern around Δν=0. The frequency shifts are symmetric because they correspond to the <b>energy</b> <b>difference</b> between the same upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the lower state will be more populated than the upper state. Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the upper state (Stokes transitions) will be higher than in the opposite direction (anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks are stronger than anti-Stokes scattering peaks. Their ratio depends on the temperature, and can therefore be exploited to measure it.|$|E
