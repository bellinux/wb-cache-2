5|$|The sad elephant, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the <b>elephant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room, is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant {{for a short period}} of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from Jet Set Willy as once believed.|$|E
5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the <b>elephant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E

25|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{symbol of}} the elephant in Indo-Greek coinage {{may also have been}} associated with Buddhism, as suggested by the parallel between coins of Antialcidas and Menander II, where the <b>elephant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coins of Antialcidas holds the same relationship to Zeus and Nike as the Buddhist wheel on the coins of Menander II. When the Zoroastrian Indo-Parthian Kingdom invaded North India in the 1st century AD, they adopted {{a large part of the}} symbolism of Indo-Greek coinage, but refrained from ever using the elephant, suggesting that its meaning was not merely geographical.|$|E

25|$|To be sure, this fortuitous {{takeover}} of Salin {{was backed by}} no additional Ava troops, and could not last. Sithu Kyawhtin II returned with a 7000-strong army (2000 horses, 15 elephants). Though his army was outnumbered more than two-to-one, Sithu Kyawhtin I chose to make a stand. But Salin's defenses were breached on the second day. Inside the city, Sithu Kyawhtin I fought on atop his war elephant, and even engaged Sithu Kyawhtin II, who was also on his war <b>elephant.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, Toungoo troops won the battle. Sithu Kyawhtin barely escaped, fleeing to the Chin Hills.|$|E
25|$|The zoo is {{considered}} a world leader and educator in reproductive intervention.

25|$|While Khan {{was away}} from Mangalgarh, Mohammad Farooq Hakim, the Governor of Bhilsa, imprisoned his men and confiscated his {{personal}} property. When Khan returned and confronted him, {{he said that he}} believed that Khan had died in the battle with the Mughals. He released the imprisoned men, but returned only half of the Khan's belongings. The resulting hostility eventually led to a battle near Bhilsa. Farooq's army included 40,000 Maratha and Rajput soldiers, while Khan commanded just 5000 Afghans, supported by some Rajput soldiers. In a one-sided battle, Khan lost his brother Sher Mohammed Khan, and his men fled from the battlefield. Dost Mohammad Khan, with some of his most loyal men, had to hide in a thicket near the battlefield. As he lay hidden, he saw Farooq riding an <b>elephant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> victory procession. He dressed himself in the uniform of one of Farooq's slain soldiers, hiding his face with a scarf and a helmet. Amid the din of the victory drums, he mounted the howdah (seat) on the elephant, killed Farooq and his guard, and claimed victory.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of war <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Near East between the late third and early seventh centuries, {{and especially in}} Romano-Sasanian conflicts, is frequently reported {{in a wide variety}} of contemporary sources. The purpose of this paper is to examine the evidence for the military use of elephants over this period. This study gives particular attention to the literary concerns of individual authors, whether writing in Latin, Greek, Armenian, or Arabic, which might have influenced their inclusion of vivid depictions of war elephants. Informed by comparative evidence from Indian sources, this assessment also identifies a more diverse range of military applications and capabilities of <b>elephants</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 'classic' age of <b>elephant</b> warfare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hellenistic period...|$|R

500|$|Charles Cohen notes that, {{while the}} book {{mentions}} {{the intersection of}} Bliss and Mulberry Streets, their real-life counterparts in Springfield do not cross. Cohen connects the horse and wagon in Mulberry Street to Geisel's Springfield childhood and points to precursors of it in Geisel's earlier work. He traces the blue <b>elephant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book to the blue elephants that appear in Geisel's comic strip Hejji.

500|$|Later Tamil sources provide {{variants}} to Peruntevanar's version. In Villiputuralvar's 14th-century version, Krishna first offers {{himself as}} the sacrificial victim, but Aravan volunteers to replace him. There {{is no mention of}} Duryodhana in this version of the legend. In other accounts, Aravan is sacrificed in order to counteract the Kauravas' sacrifice of a white <b>elephant.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> traditions of the village of Neppattur, in the Thanjavur district, Aravan is described as being so strong that he could slay all the Duryodhanas at once, thus preventing any war from happening. So Krishna prescribes the human sacrifice of Aravan in order that [...] "the greater sacrifice of the war can take place".|$|E

500|$|Born {{approximately}} 570CE (Year of the <b>Elephant)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arabian city of Mecca, Muhammad was orphaned at {{an early}} age; he was raised {{under the care of}} his paternal uncle Abu Talib.

Three years later, in 610, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that [...] "God is One", that complete [...] "surrender" [...] (lit. islām) to him is the right course of action (dīn), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.|$|E
