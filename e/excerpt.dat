5|$|In August 2012, Weird Tales became {{involved}} in a media altercation after the editor announced the magazine was going to publish an <b>excerpt</b> from Victoria Foyt's controversial novel Save the Pearls, which many critics accused of featuring racist stereotyping. The decision was made despite the protests of VanderMeer, and prompted her to end her association with the magazine. The publisher subsequently overruled the editor, and announced that Weird Tales no longer had plans to run the <b>excerpt.</b>|$|E

5|$|As can {{be discerned}} from the {{previous}} description, the 1945 campaign was anything but genteel and polite. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech (written {{with the assistance of}} Lister Sinclair) that accused Drew of running a political Gestapo in Ontario. In the speech <b>excerpt</b> below, Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the Ontario Provincial Police was acting as a political police – spying on the opposition and the media.|$|E
5|$|At {{its first}} screening, {{the film was}} well {{received}} by critics and the public, and was later shown in Panama and Venezuela. Given the theme of leprosy, the film was criticized by some who believed {{it would have a}} negative impact on the image of Colombia.

5|$|At last, on Monday, 28 June 1841 {{the curtain}} rose on Giselle at the Salle Le Peletier. Grisi danced Giselle with Lucien Petipa as her lover Albrecht, Jean Coralli as the {{gamekeeper}} Hilarion, and Adèle Dumilâtre as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis. Typical of the theatrical {{practices of the}} time, Giselle was preceded by an <b>excerpt</b> from another production—in this case, the third act of Rossini's opera, Mosè in Egitto.|$|E
30|$|The second {{task was}} {{designed}} to measure general, possibly trait-congruent, tendencies in the emotions perceived in music. The stimuli for this task were selected from a set of music from movie soundtracks: the chosen 50 <b>excerpts</b> were short (15  s) and had previously been rated to be unfamiliar and expressive of basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, tenderness) with a varying degree of clarity/conformity (<b>excerpts</b> 001 – 050 from Eerola and Vuoskoski [2011]). For this task, it was not purposeful to only choose <b>excerpts</b> highly representative of certain emotions, but rather <b>excerpts</b> susceptible to {{a wider range of}} interpretation in order to provide more room for the occurrence of top-down biases in perception. Therefore, the set of the 50 chosen <b>excerpts</b> consisted of only 20 <b>excerpts</b> previously rated (Eerola and Vuoskoski [2011]) as clearly illustrative of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and tenderness and of 30 <b>excerpts</b> previously rated as only moderately expressive of these emotions.|$|R

40|$|Medical {{humanities}} (MH) modules {{have been}} conducted for first year students at KIST Medical College, Lalitpur, Nepal {{for the last four}} years. Literature <b>excerpts</b> are widely used in MH programs in developed nations. In Nepal English language literature <b>excerpts</b> had been used previously in two modules. Problems noted were difficulty in comprehending the <b>excerpts</b> and relating them to the Nepalese scenario. The MH module for the 2011 intake was conducted from December 2011 to March 2012. The present study was conducted in the third week of March to obtain student perceptions about use of literature <b>excerpts</b> and suggestions for further improvement using a questionnaire. Literature <b>excerpts</b> used in the module dealt with Nepal and health-related topics. Sixty-eight of the 80 students (85 %) participated in the study. The majority were male, self-financing and from urban areas. Respondents felt the <b>excerpts</b> introduced them to different aspects of the medical profession, prepared them for future practice, and underscored the importance of understanding the patients’ feelings. The literature <b>excerpts</b> with which they could identify the most and the least were noted. There were no differences in median enjoyment and effectiveness scores of the literature <b>excerpts</b> according to subgroups of respondents. The suggested benefits of using literature in medical education were similar to those reported previously. Most respondents were able to appreciate the English language <b>excerpts.</b> They felt that Nepali language <b>excerpts</b> and those by Nepali writers could also be included. The findings would be of interest to educators in other developing nations introducing MH modules...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a collection of}} restored <b>excerpts</b> from an astrological　text, "Hai-zhong zhan" (海中占). Although there were many astrological texts in ancient China, few are in existence today. Referring to an anthology of mantic words such as "Kaiyuan zhanjing" (開元占経) for restored <b>excerpts</b> {{is the only way}} to learn the content of these books. Although <b>excerpts</b> from "Hai-zhong zhan" are included to a great extent in "Kaiyuan zhanjing", "Guanxiang wanzhan" (観象玩占), and "Tianwen yaolu" (天文要録), they have only limited appearance in other works. "A corpus of restored <b>excerpts</b> in existing classic texts in Japan" (本邦残存典籍による輯佚資料集成 続) written by Ryuichi Suzuki (鈴木隆一) and edited by Hiroshi Niimi (新見寛) contains restored <b>excerpts</b> of "Hai-zhong zhan" found in "Tianwen yaolu" and "Tiandi ruixiangzhi" (天地瑞祥志). Yet still, only a partial picture of "Hai-zhong zhan" was available because no previous works, including Niimi's, included all the restored <b>excerpts</b> of this text. The purpose of this paper is to grasp the full picture of "Hai-zhong zhan" through a more extensive collection and organization of its restored <b>excerpts...</b>|$|R

5|$|At some {{stage in}} that summer the formal copying of the symphony began. On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius's long-time copyist, sent {{a bill for}} making a fair copy of the first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius {{informed}} him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript would be about eight times {{as long as this}} <b>excerpt,</b> indicating that the symphony might be on a larger scale than any of its seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.|$|E
