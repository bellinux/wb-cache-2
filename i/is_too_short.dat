5|$|Angel Beats! {{received}} generally positive reviews by critics. The {{integration of}} various individual elements together, such as musical performances, humor and action, was commended in one review but panned in another, {{saying that the}} story was overloaded with too many elements. P.A.Works was praised for the animation of the action sequences and attention to detail with the weapons used. A major flaw noted by critics, however, is that the anime <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short,</b> which leaves many of the characters with untold back-stories. The anime was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that stellar evolution of either Sirius A or Sirius B could {{be responsible for}} this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers {{on the grounds that}} the timescale of thousands of years <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place. An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance. Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic scintillations of the star when rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red, white and blue hues when near the horizon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} when the Deccan Traps {{hypothesis}} was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept {{the idea that the}} mass extinctions {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. Even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, however, such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. The duration of the K-T extinction event was less than 10 ky, and the time span <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> to be explained by Deccan volcanism. Geophysical models and high-precision radiometric dating suggest that the Chicxulub impact could have triggered some of the largest Deccan eruptions, and potentially, could have triggered eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on Earth.|$|E

5|$|While the Silver Line was {{originally}} planned to terminate at Stadium-Armory, in 2012 {{the plan was}} changed for the line to end at Largo Town Center instead, because Stadium-Armory's pocket track <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> for trains to turn around. It follows the Blue and Orange Line tracks through DC, continuing through Arlington along the Orange Line and branching off immediately east of the West Falls Church station. The new tracks run in the median of the Dulles Connector Road to an elevated bridge, which takes them over Virginia Route 123. Two elevated stops along {{the west side of}} Route 123 serve the national headquarters of CapitalOne, SAIC and two enclosed Tysons Corner shopping malls. The tracks then enter a tunnel which emerges in the median of Virginia Route 7. Two elevated stations above Route 7 serve the western section of Tysons Corner. The elevated track then swings into the median of the Dulles Access Road until it reaches the airport. Along the way, five new stations would be built with platforms in the median of the access road and a faregate and pedestrian bridges to parking areas elevated above the highway. In anticipation of the Herndon station being built, in 1999 Fairfax County constructed a 1,750-space parking garage with ramps to the Dulles Access Road toll lanes and this facility is being used for bus commuters on an interim basis. The garage has drawn criticism because of alleged construction flaws. As originally planned, upon reaching the airport the track will enter a tunnel which will follow the path of the arrivals driveway of the airport terminal to a station located close to the terminal. The track would leave the tunnel near the airport hotel and economy parking lots and would head north parallel to the main runways. A storage yard and maintenance facility would branch off to the west occupying the airport's buffer zone north of the end of its major runways. The final two stops would be in the median of the Dulles Greenway, serving the Ashburn suburb. Hence, the line is expected to draw both airport traffic and commuters from the far western suburbs of Washington, DC. Buses currently provide these users with limited public transportation. In contrast, the Silver Line is expected to provide trains once every six minutes during rush hours and once every fourteen minutes during non-rush hours.|$|E

25|$|In Zell am See, Austria, {{an aerial}} lift connects {{the city with}} Schmittenhöhe mountain. The gondolas {{sometimes}} run 24 hours per day, using electricity for lights, door opening and communication. The only available time for recharging batteries at the stations is during the brief intervals of guest loading and unloading, which <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> to recharge batteries. Supercapacitors offer a fast charge, higher number of cycles and longer life time than batteries.|$|E
25|$|Some jurisdictions {{that hold}} runoff {{elections}} allow absentee (only) voters to submit IRV ballots, because {{the interval between}} votes <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> for {{a second round of}} absentee voting. IRV ballots enable absentee votes to count in the second (general) election round if their first choice does not make the runoff. Arkansas, South Carolina and Springfield, Illinois adopt this approach. Louisiana uses it only for members of the United States Service or who reside overseas.|$|E
50|$|When Daniel Craig was {{announced}} as James Bond in 2005, intense {{criticism of the}} casting decision (made by Eon Productions) included {{the notion that the}} actor <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> to play 007, even though at 5 ft Craig is average height for a white British male. There have also been complaints on Henry Cavill being chosen to play Superman, arguing that he at a stature of 6 ft <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> for the role.|$|R

It did not consider the proposals cost-effective because the BBC will need to spend on a new brand and triple advertising budgets to increase awareness of the new service.|$|E
25|$|The zoos of the Old World breed Acheta domesticus, Gryllus bimaculatus, and Gryllus assimilis. Their cricket farms usually rotate four {{generation}} ("four crates") of insects. One {{generation or}} one physical crate {{is used for}} mating and incubation of eggs, which takes from seven to twelve days. One male usually mates {{to three or four}} females. Females are discarded (and fed to zoo animals) immediately after laying the eggs: their life span <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> to give them a second chance. Three other generations, spaced by the same seven to twelve days, are for raising the larvae, which takes 4–5 weeks. Thus the zoos restock their live food supply practically every week.|$|E
25|$|Of the Eucharistic celebration he says: “A sacrament is not 'a magical rite' {{but rather}} the {{instrument}} God has chosen {{in order to continue}} to walk beside man as his travelling companion through life”. In a brief address to liturgists on the anniversary of Musicam Sacram, Francis mentions eight times the importance of the peoples’ active participation in song. In an address to charismatics he reemphasizes this: “You are able to shout out when your team scores a goal, and you cannot sing the Lord’s praises and leave behind your composure a little to sing”. As regards his own singing at Mass, he has pointed out that since he had the upper portion of his right lung removed, he <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> of breath.|$|E

25|$|The term subfossil {{can be used}} {{to refer}} to remains, such as bones, nests, or defecations, whose fossilization process is not complete, either because the length of time since the animal {{involved}} was living <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> (less than 10,000 years) or because the conditions in which the remains were buried were not optimal for fossilization. Subfossils are often found in caves or other shelters where they can be preserved for thousands of years. The main importance of subfossil vs. fossil remains is that the former contain organic material, which can be used for radiocarbon dating or extraction and sequencing of DNA, protein, or other biomolecules. Additionally, isotope ratios can provide much information about the ecological conditions under which extinct animals lived. Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in paleoclimatology.|$|E
25|$|The clerk, {{standing}} in {{the centre of the}} portrait and uniting the two-halves, holds the music he is singing from, possibly entitled 'Farewell my Judy'. Jeremy Barlow speculates that this might be a sentimental love song. The two servants frame the picture, the black servant playing a pipe and tabor. The combination of these musical instruments had a popular accompaniment to dancing for several centuries, but was in decline in England by the eighteenth century. Barlow considers Hogarth's representation of the tabor pipe a poor one, arguing that it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> and has too many holes to be the usual three-holed tabor pipe, the boy holds it too far up its length and does not cover all the holes. Barlow points out that Hogarth may have intended the instrument to be a flabiol instead. He also notes that the lively music the instruments would have produced would be unlikely to complement a sentimental ballad that the clerk appears to be singing, and instead suggests the painting combines and conflates a number of typical activities in the cabin into one scene.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Shawn Sackenheim of Allgame {{also found the}} main downfall of the game to be that it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> and too easy. However, he found the new Time Attack mode and the expanded storyline to be interesting new features that extend playability. Sackenheim stated that despite the minor add-ons and overhauled textures, Jumping Flash! 2 was essentially a technical update of the 1995 original. Other criticisms include that the game <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> despite Game Revolution citing that the game offered a total of 32 levels if including the [...] "repetitive" [...] epilogue. Game Revolution also said that Jumping Flash! 2 was a [...] "very worthy sequel with better graphics, higher jumps, and lots more levels", and that upon release the game [...] "really [...] beyond the competition".|$|E

In subsequent chapters, Ernest worries that Mary is unable to kill the lion for various reasons: she <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> to see the prey in the tall grass; she misses her shots with other game; and he thinks she is too soft-hearted to kill the animal. During this period, Ernest becomes entranced with Debba, a woman from a local village, whom the others jokingly refer to as his second wife. From her and the villagers [...] he wants to learn tribal practices and customs.|$|E
500|$|Wario World {{received}} {{criticism for}} its length, with some reviewers {{stating that the}} game was shorter than the average console title. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer compared Wario World to Luigi's Mansion, a game also criticized for its length, {{and said that the}} game was like Luigi's Mansion [...] "all over again". GameSpy stated that Wario World [...] "offers little above and beyond the standard 3D platform romp, and what is offered turns out to be very short and repetitive". GameSpot commented that [...] "the final product <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> and simplistic to hold your attention for more than a day".|$|E
500|$|Dixon's late goal earnt Arsenal a point against Aston Villa on 5 March 2000. The team, without Adams, Keown and Overmars, lost to Middlesbrough a week later.
