5|$|Alonso is a Meath Gaelic {{football}} supporter. His {{interest in}} the Irish sport stems {{from the age of}} 15 when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Irish town of Kells, County Meath, and stayed with a family to learn English, where he played it in his spare time.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Technical College of Delft. From 1919 to 1922, Escher {{attended}} the Haarlem School of Architecture and Decorative Arts, learning drawing {{and the art}} of making woodcuts. He briefly studied architecture, but he failed a number of subjects (partly due to a persistent skin infection) and switched to decorative arts, studying under the graphic artist Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{launched}} two legal actions {{while in}} prison {{to secure a}} share of the estate, which the cousins said was part of an attempt to harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing that he should have inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister—the grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed 17 years' rent from his cousins who lived there. In 2004 <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola {{was carried}} on a chair to the local tobacco shop, and from there <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital. He had {{sustained}} multiple fractures of his right thigh, and his doctors doubted he would race again. He transferred to a private clinic in Bologna, where his injured leg remained in a plaster cast for six months. Caracciola defied the predictions of his doctors and healed faster than expected, and in the winter Charlotte took her husband back to Arosa, where the altitude and fresh air would aid his recovery.|$|E
5|$|Despite declining health, Vivekananda {{left for}} the West {{for a second time}} in June 1899 {{accompanied}} by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Spedding {{was awarded}} a Guggenheim Fellowship, {{allowing}} him to study in Europe. To save money, Spedding and his wife travelled to Europe by heading westward across the Pacific. His intention was to study in Germany under James Franck and Francis Simon, but they fled Germany after Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} March 1933. Instead <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England, where he was welcomed by Ralph H. Fowler. Spedding worked with John Lennard-Jones, and attended lectures given by Max Born. He paid a visit to Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, and gave a lecture in Leningrad.|$|E

5|$|One day Narendra {{requested}} Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali {{for their}} family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested {{him to go}} to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess. Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.|$|E
5|$|Reitz {{received}} his earliest schooling at home, from a governess, {{and at a}} neighbouring farm. When he was nine years old, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rouwkoop Boarding School in Rondebosch (Cape Town). Here he stood out for his academic achievements and was subsequently elected Queen's Scholar by the Senate of the South African College in Cape Town. In the six years he spent at the College, after arriving in 1857, he received a broad education in arts and sciences, and developed himself into a well-balanced young man with obvious leadership qualities. He graduated from South African College in September 1863 with {{the equivalent of a}} modern bachelor's degree in arts and sciences.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, on 10May 1940, when Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Netherlands, Oerip was {{recalled}} to active service. Three days after reporting to Colonel Pik in Magelang, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> KNIL headquarters in Bandung, {{where he was}} the first retired officer to report. Afterwards, he and his family– who had joined him– were transferred to Cimahi, where Oerip was tasked with establishing a new battalion depot. Several native officers were stationed in northern parts of the Indies during 1941 in preparation for an expected attack by the Empire of Japan, although Oerip stayed in Cimahi.|$|E

5|$|The Tar Heels' {{began to}} strain Kansas' defense with several players making {{perimeter}} shots, and {{when combined with}} Kansas' inability to convert from the field, this allowed the Tar Heels to jump out to a 114 lead. This led to Harp changing Kansas' defensive formation to a 23 zone, with Chamberlain under the basket. Rosenbluth — who was now relatively unguarded when compared to Kansas' previous formation — made a contested seventeen foot jumper. Kansas retaliated by giving the ball to Chamberlain who was subsequently fouled as he went up for a shot. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> free throw line and made one of two. As Kansas went up the floor coach Harp ordered his squad to revert to their original boxandone. Carolina's Kearns made a jumper from the floor after pump faking to lose a defender, which brought the score to 157 in favor of Carolina. Kansas came up the floor and missed their shot, but Chamberlain grabbed the rebound and was then fouled in air. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> line for a one–and–one and missed the first shot, while Rosenbluth caught the rebound.|$|E
5|$|The union, {{the city}} Labour {{establishment}} and the Bishop of Bristol, Oliver Stratford Tomkins, ignored Stephenson {{and tried to}} work with Bill Smith of the TGWU to resolve the dispute. Learie Constantine continued with {{his support for the}} campaign, meeting with the Lord Mayor of Bristol and Frank Cousins, leader of the Transport and General Workers Union. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Omnibus Company's parent, the Transport Holding Company, and persuaded them to send officials to talk with the union. The company chairman told Constantine that racial discrimination was not company policy.|$|E
5|$|Umbricht's {{death from}} {{melanoma}} helped alert {{the general public}} about the disease. Former Los Angeles Rams linebacker Jack Pardee credited Umbricht's battle with melanoma for saving his life in 1965. Pardee, a Pro Bowl linebacker, had been ignoring a mole on his armpit. After hearing of Umbricht's battle with cancer, and that his mole was similar to Umbricht's, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team doctor, who diagnosed him with melanoma. Although Pardee's melanoma had also spread throughout his body, he made a complete recovery.|$|E

5|$|Waller was a {{counsel in}} ecclesiastical trials. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> General Assemblies in 1844, 1853, 1861, 1865 to 1867, 1876, 1886, and 1890.

He was elected to be the Moderator of Presbytery in 1842, 1851, and 1881. At that time {{he was the only}} person to be elected to that position more than once.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} the American Chess Bulletin (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had {{resigned}} the world title in favor of Capablanca because {{the conditions of the}} match were unpopular in the chess world. The American Chess Bulletin speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match. When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in Havana had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from the Yukon, he assumed command of the A Division of the NWMP in Maple Creek (today in Saskatchewan). After two months at Maple Creek, {{he took over the}} NWMP Macleod Department (today in Alberta) as Superintendent, serving there until 1913. He became a prominent landowner during his time in Macleod, owning several lots in town, as well as a section outside. He was appointed a commissioner of police in the new province of Alberta in November 1911. In 1913, he was posted to the NWMP Headquarters in Regina to assist in the organization of the Criminal Investigation Branch. In August he was granted a leave of absence when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mayo Clinic at Rochester to undergo surgery to repair an undisclosed rupture and remove his appendix. After returning to Regina in 1914, he retired at the rank of Superintendent on April 5, 1915.|$|E
