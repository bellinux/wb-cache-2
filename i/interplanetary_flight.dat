Later books about space travel included The Exploration of Space (1951), The Challenge of the Spaceship (1959), Voices from the Sky (1965), The Promise of Space (1968, rev. ed. 1970) and Report on Planet Three (1972) among others.|$|E
25|$|Project Orion {{team member}} Freeman Dyson {{proposed}} in 1968 an interstellar spacecraft using nuclear pulse propulsion that used pure deuterium fusion detonations {{with a very}} high fuel-burnup fraction. He computed an exhaust velocity of 15,000km/s and a 100,000-tonne space vehicle able to achieve a 20,000km/s delta-v allowing a flight-time to Alpha Centauri of 130 years. Later studies indicate that the top cruise velocity that can theoretically be achieved by a Teller-Ulam thermonuclear unit powered Orion starship, assuming no fuel is saved for slowing back down, is about 8% to 10% {{of the speed of}} light (0.08-0.1c). An atomic (fission) Orion can achieve perhaps 3%-5% of the speed of light. A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range and pure matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the maximum speed. The concept of using a magnetic sail to decelerate the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity. Alternative designs utilizing similar principles include Project Longshot, Project Daedalus, and Mini-Mag Orion. The principle of external nuclear pulse propulsion to maximize survivable power has remained common among serious concepts for interstellar flight without external power beaming and for very high-performance <b>interplanetary</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Russian Space Agency {{launched}} a sample return mission to Phobos in November 2011, called Fobos-Grunt. The return capsule {{also included a}} life science experiment of The Planetary Society, called Living <b>Interplanetary</b> <b>Flight</b> Experiment, or LIFE. A second contributor to this mission was the China National Space Administration, which supplied a surveying satellite called [...] "Yinghuo-1", {{which would have been}} released in the orbit of Mars, and a soil-grinding and sieving system for the scientific payload of the Phobos lander. However, after achieving Earth orbit, the Fobos-Grunt probe failed to initiate subsequent burns that would have sent it off to Mars. Attempts to recover the probe were unsuccessful and it crashed back to Earth in January 2012.|$|E
50|$|Launch {{vehicles}} of sufficient size {{are capable of}} launching payloads smaller than their orbital capability, to the Moon or beyond. Translunar and <b>interplanetary</b> <b>flights</b> are commonly launched with the vehicle's final stage into a temporary parking orbit, to allow spacecraft checkout, and more precise control of the final injection maneuver, rather than being launched directly to terminal velocity.|$|R
50|$|Variants with a {{stretched}} {{cabin and}} a hinged nose {{have also been}} suggested. The former could be outfitted in orbit to carry people in comparative comfort on long duration flights, while the latter {{could be used to}} carry bulky cargo that would not fit through the normal cargo hatch. For <b>interplanetary</b> <b>flights,</b> the book suggested using one RL-60 modified to run on methane which was fitted with an engine bell extension, which was removable to allow aerobreaking.|$|R

In his 1925 paper [...] "Проблема полета при помощи реактивных аппаратов: межпланетные полеты" [...] of flight by jet propulsion: <b>interplanetary</b> <b>flights,</b> [...] Friedrich Zander made a similar argument.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{he was not}} the {{originator}} of {{the concept}} of geostationary satellites, one of his most important contributions in this field may be his idea that they would be ideal telecommunications relays. He advanced this idea in a paper privately circulated among the core technical members of the British Interplanetary Society in 1945. The concept was published in Wireless World in October of that year. Clarke also wrote a number of non-fiction books describing the technical details and societal implications of rocketry and space flight. The most notable of these may be <b>Interplanetary</b> <b>Flight</b> (1950), The Exploration of Space (1951) and The Promise of Space (1968). In recognition of these contributions, the geostationary orbit [...] above the equator is officially recognised by the International Astronomical Union as a Clarke Orbit.|$|E
2500|$|Among other microorganisms, {{a sample}} of living S.cerevisiae was {{included}} in the Living <b>Interplanetary</b> <b>Flight</b> Experiment, which would have completed a three-year interplanetary round-trip in a small capsule aboard the Russian Fobos-Grunt spacecraft, launched in late 2011. The goal was to test whether selected organisms could survive a few years in deep space by flying them through interplanetary space. The experiment would have tested one aspect of transpermia, the hypothesis that life could survive space travel, if protected inside rocks blasted by impact off one planet to land on another. [...] Fobos-Grunt's mission ended unsuccessfully, however, when it failed to escape low Earth orbit. [...] The spacecraft along with its instruments fell into the Pacific Ocean in an uncontrolled re-entry on January 15, 2012.

50|$|Current {{electric}} ion thrusters {{produce a}} very low thrust (milli-newtons, yielding {{a small fraction of}} a g), so the Oberth effect cannot normally be used. This results in the journey requiring a higher delta-v and frequently a large increase in time compared to a high thrust chemical rocket. Nonetheless, the high specific impulse of electrical thrusters may significantly reduce the cost of the flight. For missions in the Earth-Moon system, an increase in journey time from days to months could be unacceptable for human space flight, but differences in <b>flight</b> time for <b>interplanetary</b> <b>flights</b> are less significant and could be favorable.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—During the <b>interplanetary</b> <b>flights</b> the crewmembers will {{be exposed}} to cosmic ray {{radiation}} (CR) with great risk for their health. The adsorbed dose due to CR depends on the galactic (GCR) or solar (SCR) origin. GCRs are isotropic and relatively high in energy and deliver a dose nearly constant. The SCRs are usually much less energetic, {{of the order of}} few tens of MeV but during some exceptional solar bursts, a great number of particles, mainly protons, are ejected at higher energies. In this case the dose delivered in a few hours by a solar burst inside a spacecraft can easily exceed 1 year cumulated dose by GCRs. The high-energy component of SCRs is quasidirectional so that a shielding system based on a superconducting magnetic lens (a toroid) can reduce the dose rate of SCRs to the level delivered by GCRs. This paper presents the concept, the general aspects and the main technical solutions that are adopted for this magnet.

Nevertheless, at the moment there are no certainly available technologies that can safely and effectively bring humans back to the Moon and conquer more distant objects in the solar system. This thesis is dedicated to the case of future expeditions to Mars. An extensive list of problems and critical considerations for this kind of missions includes: long time life condition maintaining; space radiation protection; microgravity effects minimization; capability of abort options and failure risk minimization. There are a number of concepts and approaches for Human Mars mission design. Each of them under favorable conditions might allow overcoming the existing barriers. The nuclear electric propulsion concept and more specifically a VASIMR engine are examined in details in order to estimate their real potential. The attractive from many points of view VASIMR engine proposition was evaluated as currently unrealistic due to several serious technical challenges including a requirement in developing a new space nucleargenerator with high power-to-weight ratio.
