6000|$|One {{main source}} of {{excitement}} for us was [...] "cheeking" [...] people in vans and carts upon the Goudhurst road; and getting myself into a monstrous white mess in the chalk pits beyond the village, and catching yellow jaundice as a sequel to bathing stark naked with three other Adamites, old Ewart leading that function, in the rivulet across Hickson's meadows, are among my memorabilia. Those free imaginative afternoons! how much they were for us! how much they did for us! All streams came from the then undiscovered [...] "sources of the Nile" [...] in those days, all thickets were Indian jungles, and our best game, I say it with pride, I invented. I got {{it out of the}} Bladesover saloon. We found a wood where [...] "Trespassing" [...] was forbidden, and did the [...] "Retreat of the Ten Thousand" [...] through it from end to <b>end,</b> <b>cutting</b> our way bravely through a host of nettle beds that barred our path, and not forgetting to weep and kneel when at last we emerged within sight of the High Road Sea. So we have burst at times, weeping and rejoicing, upon startled wayfarers. Usually I took the part of that distinguished general Xenophen--and please note the quantity of the o. I have all my classical names like that,--Socrates rhymes with Bates for me, and except when the bleak eye of some scholar warns me of his standards of judgment, I use those dear old mispronunciations still. The little splash into Latin made during my days as a chemist washed off nothing of the habit. Well,--if I met those great gentlemen of the past with their accents carelessly adjusted I did at least meet them alive, as an equal, and in a living tongue. Altogether my school might easily have been worse for me, and among other good things it gave me a friend who has lasted my life out.|$|E

5000|$|When Prussia absorbed Hanover {{and then}} set up the German Empire in 1871, Windthorst became {{a leader of the}} all-Catholic Centre Party. It won over 80% of the Catholic vote in a new nation that was one-third Catholic. He opposed Bismarck's {{harassment}} of minorities such as Catholics, Hanoverian Guelphs, Poles, Danes, and Alsatians. He argued for natural law as the basis of political rights. He perfected the arts of opposition, forming alliances that could win majorities. The Centre party became what Anderson calls [...] "a liberal party manque." [...] That is, it kept its distance from the anti-Catholic National Liberal Party but championed the rights of minorities, the powers of parliament, {{and the rule of law}} against Bismarck's moves. In the 1870s he was a vigorous enemy of the Bismarck's Kulturkampf, which persecuted the Catholic Church in Prussia in an effort to destroy papal control. Bismarck eventually lost.

50|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{and common}} shape is a pointed area at one <b>end,</b> <b>cutting</b> edges along its {{side and a}} rounded base (this includes hand axes with a lanceolate and amygdaloidal shape {{as well as others}} from the family). Hand axes display a variety of shapes, including circular, triangular and elliptical. They are typically between 8 and 15 cm in length, although they can be bigger or smaller.They were typically made from a rounded stone, a block or lithic flake, using a hammer to remove flakes {{from both sides of the}} item. This hammer can be hard made of stone or of wood or antler. The latter two, softer hammers can produce more delicate results. However, a hand axe's technological aspect can reflect more differences. For example, uniface tools have only been worked on one side and partial bifaces retain a high proportion of the natural cortex of the tool stone, often making them easy to confuse with chopping tools. Further, simple bifaces may have been created from a suitable tool stone, but they rarely show evidence of retouching.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, we {{investigated}} ultra-precision cutting technology {{used in the}} production of Al alloy polygon mirrors. We compared characteristics of three Al alloys (Al–Mg, Al–Cu, and Al–Si) when cut with a straight diamond tool. When cutting Al alloys, it is desirable to reduce geometric surface roughness and remove tear-out marks and scratch marks. We investigated the relationship between <b>end</b> <b>cutting</b> edge length, surface roughness, and cutting force of straight diamond tools. In addition, we compared surface roughness and cutting force produced by double facet tools with microfacets at the <b>end</b> <b>cutting</b> edge and on the rake-face side. It was found that both tools have similar cutting characteristics and that Al–Mg has the best optical quality, followed by Al–Cu and Al–Si. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Considering cold-welding {{repaired}} {{layer is}} rough and microstructure contains hard phases, firstly, the two-factor three-level orthogonal milling experiment {{was conducted in}} remanufacturing cold-welding repaired area, then the influences of different parameters on Ni-base cold-welding repaired layer milling were studied. At the <b>end,</b> <b>cutting</b> force and surface roughness were used as objectives to optimize the milling parameters. Cutting force and surface roughness were processed by range analysis, and their influence sequences were obtained. The empirical formula of milling force and surface roughness can be obtained through linear regression method, which provided theoretical base for the prediction. The influences on cutting force and surface roughness of different parameters were studied to further optimization, which can provide technical support for high efficiency and precision cutting in cold-welding area...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this innovation was to ease, minimise the working time at chair side by loading the crimpable hook for retraction/protraction/any other clinical situation demanding placement of the crimpable hook when the archwire is in position. For the same reason a plier routinely used which can be modified to suit the above purpose was thought off. This innovative plier serves dual purpose. As it is a modified distal end cutter, there is an added feature of crimping the hook to the arch wire apart from serving the basic purpose of cutting the distal end. Thus saves time at chairside. The innovative FAS *twin function plier has a high efficiency, ease of use, is economic, for distal <b>end</b> <b>cutting</b> of the arch wire...|$|E
