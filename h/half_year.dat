5|$|Following {{the success}} of his debut album Brown Sugar (1995), D'Angelo went into a four and a <b>half</b> <b>year</b> absence from the music scene and {{releasing}} solo work.

After the match, which turned out to be La Sombra's final with CMLL, the two founding members of Los Ingobernables made peace with each other.|$|E
