5|$|An {{additional}} tram {{stop was}} opened in December 2016 in the Gogar area, between the Gyle Centre and Gogarburn tram stops.

5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government {{refused to}} pay for {{concessionary}} travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and <b>Edinburgh</b> Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but {{that they should be}} paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and that travel would be paid for by <b>Edinburgh</b> Council. However, only people with cards issued in <b>Edinburgh</b> would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into <b>Edinburgh.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Scotland a {{troop of}} English players came to <b>Edinburgh</b> in 1715 where they {{performed}} Macbeth {{and a series of}} Restoration comedies, but they soon left, perhaps because of objections from local kirk presbyteries. By 1725 English actor Anthony Aston, a friend of Ramsay, was performing in <b>Edinburgh,</b> but seems to have fallen foul of the Scottish Master of the Revels, who licensed plays, companies and playhouses, and soon left. In 1727 the Kirk attacked theatres as immoral in the Admonition and Exhortation. The <b>Edinburgh</b> Company of Players were able to perform in Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen and regular performances at the Taylor's Hall in <b>Edinburgh</b> under the protection of a Royal Patent. Ramsay was instrumental in establishing them in a small theatre in Carruber's Close in <b>Edinburgh,</b> but the passing of the 1737 Licensing Act made their activities illegal and the theatre soon closed. A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s.|$|E
