50|$|The MIBID/MIBOR rate {{is used as}} a {{bench mark}} rate for {{majority}} of deals struck for Interest Rate Swaps, <b>Forward</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Agreements,</b> Floating Rate Debentures and Term Deposits.|$|E
50|$|In finance, an {{interest}} rate swap (IRS) is {{an interest}} rate derivative (IRD). In particular it is a linear IRD {{and one of the}} most liquid, benchmark products. It has associations with <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements</b> (FRAs), and with zero coupon swaps (ZCSs).|$|E
50|$|An {{interest}} rate guarantee (IRG) {{is an option}} on a <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> (FRA) that is handled over-the-counter (OTC).|$|R
25|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> (FRA): A {{contract}} specifying {{an interest}} rate amount to be settled at a pre-determined interest rate on {{the date of the}} contract.|$|R
50|$|In finance, a <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> (FRA) is an {{interest}} rate derivative (IRD). In particular it is a linear IRD with strong associations with interest rate swaps (IRSs)..|$|R
50|$|Linear IRDs {{are those}} whose net present values (PVs) are {{overwhelmingly}} (although not necessarily entirely) {{dictated by the}} one-to-one movement of the underlying interest rate index. Examples of linear IRDs are; interest rate swaps (IRSs), <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements</b> (FRAs), zero coupon swaps (ZCSs), cross-currency basis swaps (XCSs) and single currency basis swaps (SBSs).|$|E
50|$|Euribors {{are used}} as a {{reference}} rate for euro-denominated <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements,</b> short-term interest rate futures contracts and interest rate swaps, in {{very much the same}} way as LIBORs are commonly used for Sterling and US dollar-denominated instruments. They thus provide the basis for some of the world's most liquid and active interest rate markets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements</b> (FRAs) are {{interconnected}} {{with short}} term interest rate futures (STIR futures). Because STIR futures settle against the same index as {{a subset of}} FRAs, IMM FRAs, their pricing is related. The nature of each product has a distinctive gamma (convexity) profile resulting in rational, no arbitrage, pricing adjustments. This is adjustment is called futures convexity adjustment (FCA) and is usually expressed in basis points.|$|E
2500|$|In {{business}} and contract law, a forward-forward agreement (FFA) {{is a form}} of <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> in which party A agrees to lend party B the m1 amount of money, at future time t1. In return, B will pay to A a larger monetary amount m2 at time t2 > t1. The name [...] "forward-forward agreement" [...] derives from the fact that both issuing and repayment of the loan take place in the future. A regular <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> lends the money at once. A quoted <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> is associated with every forward-forward agreement. This {{can be thought of as}} the interest rate earned by party A for lending the money to B.|$|R
50|$|A single Eurodollar {{future is}} similar to a <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> to borrow or lend US$1,000,000 for three months {{starting}} on the contract settlement date. Buying the contract is equivalent to lending money, and selling the contract short is equivalent to borrowing money.|$|R
50|$|In {{regard to}} structure, the euro money {{market has been}} less {{concentrated}} over the past years. But differences across the various money market segments continue to exist. The market that is least concentrated is the unsecured money market segment. The money market segments that are highly condensed are the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement,</b> other interest <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> and the cross currency swap segments. They constitute about 70% of the entire money market share.|$|R
5000|$|The Money {{market in}} India {{correlation}} for short-term funds with maturity ranging from overnight {{to one year}} in India including financial instruments that are deemed to be close substitutes of money. Similar to developed economies the Indian money market is diversified and has evolved through many stages, from the conventional platform of treasury bills and call money to commercial paper, certificates of deposit, repos, <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements</b> and most recently interest rate swaps ...|$|E
5000|$|Many {{banks and}} large {{corporations}} will use FRAs to hedge future interest or exchange rate exposure. The buyer hedges against {{the risk of}} rising interest rates, while the seller hedges against the risk of falling interest rates. Other parties that use <b>Forward</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Agreements</b> are speculators purely looking to make bets on future directional changes in interest rates. [...] The development swaps in the 1980s provided organisations with an alternative to FRAs for hedging and speculating.|$|E
50|$|In finance, a day count {{convention}} {{determines how}} interest accrues over {{time for a}} variety of investments, including bonds, notes, loans, mortgages, medium-term notes, swaps, and <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements</b> (FRAs). This determines the number of days between two coupon payments; thus, calculating the amount transferred on payment dates and also the accrued interest for dates between payments. The day count is also used to quantify periods of time when discounting a cash-flow to its present value. When a security such as a bond is sold between interest payment dates, the seller is eligible to some fraction of the coupon amount.|$|E
50|$|The CME Eurodollar futures {{contract}} {{is used to}} hedge interest rate swaps. There is an arbitrage relationship between the interest rate swap market, the <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> market and the Eurodollar contract. CME Eurodollar futures can be traded by implementing a spread strategy among multiple contracts {{to take advantage of}} movements in the forward curve for future pricing of interest rates.|$|R
5000|$|... 2015 (Jul), PBoC {{open up the}} $5.7 trn interbank {{bond market}} to foreign Central Banks, Sovereign Wealth Funds and {{international}} financial institutions. Previously quota {{was given to the}} relevant foreign investors on a case-by-case basis. The relevant investors can conduct trading of cash bond, repo, bond lending, bond <b>forward,</b> interest <b>rate</b> swap, <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> and other transactions permitted by the PBC. Relevant overseas institutional investors can decide on their own the size of their investments.|$|R
50|$|A <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement's</b> (FRA's) {{effective}} {{description is}} a cash for difference derivative contract, between two parties, benchmarked against {{an interest rate}} index. That index is commonly an interbank offered rate (-IBOR) of specific tenor in different currencies, for example LIBOR in USD, GBP, EURIBOR in EUR or STIBOR in SEK. An FRA between two counterparties requires a fixed rate, notional amount, chosen interest rate index tenor and date to be completely specified.|$|R
5000|$|Tailor-made derivatives, not {{traded on}} a futures {{exchange}} are traded on over-the-counter markets, {{also known as}} the OTC market. These consist of investment banks with traders who make markets in these derivatives, and clients such as hedge funds, commercial banks, government-sponsored enterprises, etc. Products that are always traded over-the-counter are swaps, <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements,</b> forward contracts, credit derivatives, accumulators etc. The total notional amount of all the outstanding positions at the end of June 2004 stood at $220 trillion. (source: BIS: http://www.bis.org/publ/regpubl.htm). By the end of 2007 this figure had risen to $596 trillion and in 2009 it stood at $615 trillion. (source: BIS: http://www.bis.org/statistics/otcder/dt1920a.pdf) ...|$|E
5000|$|Over-the-counter (OTC) {{derivatives}} are {{contracts that}} are traded (and privately negotiated) directly between two parties, {{without going through}} an exchange or other intermediary. Products such as swaps, <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements,</b> exotic options - and other exotic derivatives - are almost always traded in this way. The OTC derivative market is the largest market for derivatives, and is largely unregulated with respect to disclosure of information between the parties, since the OTC market {{is made up of}} banks and other highly sophisticated parties, such as hedge funds. Reporting of OTC amounts is difficult because trades can occur in private, without activity being visible on any exchange.|$|E
5000|$|Once traded, swaps {{can also}} be priced using {{rational}} pricing. For example, the Floating leg of an interest rate swap can be [...] "decomposed" [...] {{into a series of}} <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements.</b> Here, since the swap has identical payments to the FRA, arbitrage free pricing must apply as above - i.e. the value of this leg is equal to the value of the corresponding FRAs. Similarly, the [...] "receive-fixed" [...] leg of a swap can be valued by comparison to a bond with the same schedule of payments. (Relatedly, given that their underlyings have the same cash flows, bond options and swaptions are equatable.) See Swap (finance)#Using bond prices.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the pricing of sterling interest <b>rate</b> futures and <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> (FRA) contracts using a unique high frequency data set. The futures/FRA differential {{is close to}} zero with narrow dispersion, yielding limited arbitrage opportunities when synchronous data are employed. These results compare favorably with those reported in prior studies using low frequency data and implied <b>forward</b> <b>rates.</b> I also find that the information flow between the futures and FRA markets is largely contemporaneous although the futures market dominates the information transmission process in the 3 -month maturity. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} intuition on {{the relationship}} of accrual and mark-to-market valuation for cash and <b>forward</b> interest <b>rate</b> trades. Discounted cashflow valuation is compared to spread-based valuation for forward trades, which explains the trader's view on valuation. This is followed by Taylor series approximation for cash trades, uncovering simple intuition behind accrual valuation and mark-to-market adjustment. It is followed by the PNL example modelled in R. Within the Taylor approximation framework, theta and delta are explained. The concept of deferral is explained taking <b>Forward</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Agreement</b> (FRA) as an example...|$|R
40|$|Price-dependent loan {{agreements}} at {{low interest}} rates have sometimes been included in North American hog sector long-term marketing contracts. We show that a general form of this stipulation {{can be viewed as}} a hybrid between a <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> and a bundle of commodity spot options. In some cases, the provision amounts to a commodity swap. These observations provide an approach to valuing the provision. Historical data are used to estimate expected payouts to the producer under the contract feature. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{constant}} maturity swap is {{an interest rate}} swap where the interest rate on one leg is reset periodically, but with reference to a market swap rate rather than LIBOR. The other leg of the swap is generally LIBOR, but may be a fixed rate or potentially another {{constant maturity}} rate. Constant maturity swaps can either be single currency or cross currency swaps. Therefore, the prime factor for a constant maturity swap is {{the shape of the}} forward implied yield curves. A single currency constant maturity swap versus LIBOR is similar to a series of differential interest rate fixes (or [...] "DIRF") {{in the same way that}} an interest rate swap is similar to a series of <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements.</b> Valuation of constant maturity swaps depend on volatilities of different forward rates and therefore requires a stochastic yield curve model or some approximated methodology like a convexity adjustment, see for example Brigo and Mercurio (2006).|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that an increasing number of banks were trading actively in a variety of relatively new market instruments, notably interest rate swaps, foreign currency options and <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements.</b> While recognizing that such instruments brought more business and greater depth to the London Inter-bank market, bankers worried that future growth could be inhibited unless a measure of uniformity was introduced. In October 1984, the British Bankers' Association (BBA)—working with other parties, such as the Bank of England—established various working parties, which eventually culminated in the production of the BBA standard for interest rate swaps, or [...] "BBAIRS" [...] terms. Part of this standard included the fixing of BBA interest-settlement rates, the predecessor of BBA Libor. From 2 September 1985, the BBAIRS terms became standard market practice. BBA Libor fixings did not commence officially before 1 January 1986. Before that date, however, some rates were fixed for a trial period commencing in December 1984.|$|E
40|$|Some {{long-term}} marketing {{contracts in}} the North American hog sector provide for price-dependent loan agreements at low rates. We show that these provisions linking pricing with financing are hybrids between <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements</b> and commodity options. This observation presents approaches for valuing the stipulations. We {{suggest that the}} ledger arrangement is transaction-cost efficient, especially for a packer with a natural partial pass-through hedge from retail market positions. ...|$|E
50|$|The total {{turnover}} {{of the euro}} money market was moribund {{in the second quarter}} of 2004 although there was a huge surge in the turnover {{in the second quarter of}} 2003. Such developments were discontinuous across the market. After this upturn in all the market segments in the second quarter of 2003, there was a sharp downturn in the interest rate, cross currency and FX swaps in the second quarter of 2004. This was contrasted by a rise in the turnover in the unsecured, secured and other interest <b>rate</b> swaps. The <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> and the short term securities also witnessed a rise. The secured segment happens to be the largest money market segment.|$|R
25|$|Non-deliverable {{forwards}} (NDF): A strictly risk-transfer {{financial product}} {{similar to a}} <b>Forward</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Agreement,</b> but used only where monetary policy restrictions on the currency in question limit the free flow and conversion of capital. As the name suggests, NDFs are not delivered but settled in a reference currency, usually USD or EUR, where the parties exchange the gain or loss that the NDF instrument yields, and if the buyer of the controlled currency truly needs that hard currency, he can take the reference payout {{and go to the}} government in question and convert the USD or EUR payout. The insurance effect is the same; it's just that the supply of insured currency is restricted and controlled by government. See capital control.|$|R
50|$|Derivatives {{trading of}} this kind may serve the {{financial}} interests of certain particular businesses. For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a specific interest rate. The interest rate on the loan reprices every six months. The corporation is concerned {{that the rate of}} interest may be much higher in six months. The corporation could buy a <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> (FRA), which is a contract to pay a fixed rate of interest six months after purchases on a notional amount of money. If the interest rate after six months is above the contract rate, the seller will pay the difference to the corporation, or FRA buyer. If the rate is lower, the corporation will pay the difference to the seller. The purchase of the FRA serves to reduce the uncertainty concerning the rate increase and stabilize earnings.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the market consensus forecast of future monetary policy development and to quantify the priced-in probability of interest rate changes for different future time horizons. The proposed model uses the current spot money market yield curve and available money market derivative instruments (<b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements,</b> FRAs) and estimates the market probability of interest rate changes up to a 12 -month horizon...|$|E
40|$|The Montreal Exchange {{introduced}} futures contracts on 3 -month Canadian bankers' acceptances, {{known as}} BAX, in 1988. In this article, the author explains {{the nature of}} this new instrument, which is bought and sold {{on the floor of the}} Exchange, and its role in hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. She briefly reviews the technical aspects of the market and explains the difference between BAX contracts and <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements.</b> She also examines the market's rapid growth and its relationship to the market for treasury bills. ...|$|E

The first half of this paper describes the information content of two types of over-the-counter interest rate derivatives, <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreements</b> and interest rate swaps. Interbank interest rates and derivatives lend themselves well to a particular technique for fitting zero-coupon curves. The second half of this paper present this technique, along with some examples of how {{it can be used to}} gain insights into market views on interest rates and the stance of monetary policy.

40|$|There {{are a lot}} of ways to hedge. The article {{presents}} futures and forward transactions as one of them. The article is divided into four parts. From the beginning we can find the general principals of mentioned above transactions. During every futures and forwards the necessary base transaction is short selling, so {{at the end of this}} part there is an example of one. The second part is a description of forwards, especially the most popular on the market like currency <b>forward</b> and <b>Forward</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Next part describing the futures and finding the differences between them and forwards. We can find a lot about the standardization of conditions of contracts.

40|$|Islamic banks {{invest in}} risky assets {{alongside}} unrestricted profit sharing investment account holders. For an Islamic bank which can hedge its resulting exposure to market risk using Shariah compliant hedging instruments, it will transfer unwanted risk to a derivative counterparty. However, determination of an optimal hedge ratio {{must take into}} consideration a phenomenon which skews the distribution of risk towards shareholders, that of displaced commercial risk. Displaced commercial risk arises because of the competitive need of Islamic banks to benchmark the rates of return they pay to profit sharing investment account holders with the deposit rates of conventional banks. As a result of displaced commercial risk, the shareholders of Islamic banks make up shortfalls in contractual returns payable to investment account holders. This paper derives the optimal size of a hedge to mitigate displaced commercial risk using a single-period Shariah compliant <b>forward</b> <b>rate</b> <b>agreement.</b> It also estimates the optimal hedge size for Islamic banks in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTrading on OTC {{interest}} rate derivatives market in developed countries {{is one of the}} opportunities that a client of a bank is been offered by the financial market. We asked ourselves which is the dimension of these markets given the fact that in Romania we can find these {{interest rate}} derivatives between the products and services offered by the bank but the usual clients of these banks know just a few things about them or they did not heard about it. So, the objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the evolution of the interest rate derivative OTC market. We will focus in the beginning on the evolution of the OTC interest rate market in terms of turnover by instruments, by counterparty and currency on the basis of the data that can be accessed on the site of Bank of International Settlements, the principal international institution who provides data about derivatives generally through its department of statistics. We will insist on the <b>Forward</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Agreement</b> contract, one of the most transacted {{interest rate derivatives}} on the OTC market...|$|R
