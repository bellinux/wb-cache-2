These trials showed that such strafing could harass a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E

Hypothetical values of shock pressures experienced by ejected rocks are obtained with Martian meteorites, which suggest the shock pressures of approximately 5 to 55GPa, acceleration of 3Mm/s2 and jerk of 6Gm/s3 and post-shock temperature increases of about 1 K to 1000 K.

25|$|For bicalutamide, the antiandrogenic {{activities}} of sulfide and sulfone substitions of the X-linkage {{were tested in}} vitro. The sulfides showed in most cases at least 2-fold higher binding affinity than corresponding sulfones. However, this relationship was reversed when the R3 group was NHSO2CH3, where the binding affinity of sulfone was 3-fold {{higher than that of}} sulfide. These results indicate that substituents of the B-ring largely <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the X-linkage in AR binding. Researchers have proposed that the tertiary hydroxyl group is involved in direct interaction with AR because when an acetyl group is introduced to that hydroxyl moiety, the receptor binding affinity greatly decreases.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the information available {{on the subject of}} SGCs comes from research which was focused on the sensory neurons that the SGCs surround rather than the SGCs themselves. In the future, researchers plan to give more time and attention to the SGCs, which have many supportive and protective functions essential for life. Neurotransmitter and hormone receptors on SGCs in situ rather than in culture will likely be explored and definitively characterized. Changes in the receptors caused by various mutations and diseases will also be explored in order to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> these conditions. Additionally, the mechanisms behind neuronal-SGC communication is essentially unidentified, though {{it is likely that the}} various receptors both the neurons and SGCs have are used for chemical signaling, perhaps with P2Y. Ca2+ and NO and their effects must also be observed to gain further understanding of interactions between the two types of cells. Finally, the possibility of an influence of SGCs on synaptic transmission within autonomic ganglia provides another direction for future research.|$|E
