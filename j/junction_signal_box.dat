5|$|In September 1962 the {{passenger}} railway service from Barry to Pontypridd was terminated. Goods service at stations was cancelled in April 1964. but the through line was officially closed in July 1963 following the devastating fire at Tynycaeau <b>Junction</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> in March 1963.|$|E
5|$|The new station {{had four}} {{platform}} faces - two outer platforms, and two inner platforms sharing an island between the southbound line from Patchway and the westbound line to London. The western platforms served trains between Bristol and Wales, while the eastern platforms served trains {{on the new}} line. The platforms were linked by a subway {{which led to the}} booking office, situated on ground level by the main entrance {{on the east side of}} the station. The approach road led south from the main entrance, towards the A4174. There were waiting rooms and large canopies on each of the platforms. There were goods facilities to the south of the road, on the west side of the line and covering the site of the first station. There was a goods shed with a loading platform on a passing loop, as well as a north-facing covered loading platform and a south-facing siding. An additional south-facing siding for coal traffic was added after the First World War. Opposite the goods yard was Filton <b>Junction</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Box,</b> which controlled the junction and by 1948 had more than 70 levers.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 1959, a {{locomotive}} overran a signal and consequently crashed into Dock <b>Junction</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Box.</b> As a result, trains {{had to be}} handsignalled {{in and out of}} St Pancras for several days.|$|E
50|$|On 17 January 1918, two freight trains {{were in a}} head-on {{collision}} at Parkhall, Shropshire due to irregular operation of tablet instruments by signalmen at Oswestry North and Ellesmere <b>Junction</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> The design of the circuitry connecting the instruments and the weather were contributory factors.|$|R
50|$|From November 1991 {{the layout}} was reduced {{in keeping with}} the {{requirements}} of traffic, the Rotherham/Tinsley Yard line being reduced to single track. In 1992 both Shepcote Lane and Tinsley East <b>Junction</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were closed and the controlling panel installed in Woodburn Junction box, still, at that time, the old brick based, wooden box of Great Central vintage.|$|R

25|$|Oban {{originally}} had two signal boxes, namely Oban Station signal box (the larger of the two), and Oban Goods <b>Junction</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> The latter was situated {{about a quarter}} mile further south, where the line to the goods yard and engine shed diverged from the single line. The original signal boxes contained 21 and 5 levers, respectively. The single line between the two boxes was doubled in 1881.|$|E

Crewe North <b>Junction</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was built to a non-standard ARP design, with 15" [...] thick reinforced concrete walls and an 18" [...] thick concrete roof. This was due to it being commissioned in 1940 during World War II so it was built to survive an air raid.|$|E

5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} trouble, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to amalgamate {{they could not}} obtain government agreement until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains were separated by time interval. As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction and Bow <b>Junction,</b> opening <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> at all locations.|$|R
5|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> overlooking Norwood Road and {{a similar}} <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at {{the northern end of}} the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> adjacent to the north <b>junction.</b> The replacement <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff.

50|$|The present Kilmarnock <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{is located}} {{north of the}} station, in the vee of the junction. Opened on by British Rail on 12 April 1976, it is a plain brick {{building}} containing an NX (entrance-exit) panel on the upper storey. It replaced four mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in a scheme that saw the track layout greatly simplified. Originally, the box worked Track Circuit Block to Hurlford <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and Scottish Region Tokenless Block over the single lines to Barassie <b>Junction</b> and Lugton <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> Kilmarnock <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was severely damaged in a suspected arson attack on 25 December 2006 but was repaired and returned to full operation within weeks.|$|R
50|$|The first Lilyvale station {{opened in}} 1890 as 'Lilydale' station {{to service the}} small village of Lilyvale. This first Lilyvale station was located {{just south of the}} {{southern}} portal of the Lilyvale tunnel at the northern end of the Bulgo or Otford valley. To the north were the original Metropolitan Colliery siding <b>junction</b> with <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and short platform and then Helensburgh station. To the south were Vickery siding and Otford station and sidings. The first Lilyvale station consisted of a single platform and weatherboard building on the western side of the original single track alignment. A road passed over a level crossing of the railway line between the tunnel and the station.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} established, as the Coventry Steam Railway Centre, in 1986 {{by a group}} who set out to preserve Hudswell Clarke 0-6-0 tank locomotive number 1857. The group established the site and located the loco and other collected items of motive power, rolling stock and infrastructure including Little Bowden <b>Junction</b> Midland Railway <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> there. The land was previously used {{as part of the}} municipal water treatment works and there was never any railway infrastructure there until the creation of the Centre.|$|R

50|$|On 24 January a {{preliminary}} hearing was conducted at the New Inn Hotel in Pontypridd, where interviews were held and witness statements were taken. On the following Thursday a coroner's inquest was opened at Pontypridd Police Court. The inquest heard conflicting reports from signalmen Hutchings of the Gyfeillion Lower and Quick of the Rhondda Cutting <b>Junction,</b> the other <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{in control of the}} stretch of line where the accident took place. Due to lack of definite evidence an open verdict was returned; though the fireman of the coal train was censured for not alerting the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> of the stationary train's position as he was required to do under Rule 55.|$|R
50|$|On 12 July 1925, a 660-volt third-rail system {{came into}} {{operation}} on both routes through Herne Hill, from Victoria to Orpington on the Chatham Main Line {{and along the}} entire length of the City Branch. Electric trains ran every 20 minutes on both routes during the day and were kept overnight at the sorting sidings north of the station.The distinctive <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> overlooking Norwood Road and a similar <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at the northern end of the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> adjacent to the north <b>junction.</b> The replacement <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff.

5000|$|The {{station was}} built {{next to the}} level {{crossing}} of Pinn Lane. This was operated by the station staff until 1875 when a small <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was brought into use; it was situated {{on the north side}} of the line to the east of the road. The initial 11 levers were extended to 17 in 1943 when the cold store was built. On 11 June 1967 one of the two tracks between Pinhoe and [...] was taken out of use and trains towards London would often wait in the closed station for a westbound train to clear the 14 mi single track section. The level crossing gates were replaced with lifting barriers on 17 March 1968. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was finally closed on 13 February 1988, the level crossing and signals now being controlled from Exmouth <b>Junction.</b> The old <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was dismantled and re-erected in the railway museum at [...] on the Tamar Valley Line.|$|R

50|$|Crewe North <b>Junction</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> is {{signal box}} with a Westinghouse All Electric Style 'L' lever frame which was commissioned, along with Crewe South <b>Junction</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> (which also had a Westinghouse Style 'L' frame), on 29 March 1940 {{as part of a}} resignalling project at Crewe railway station. It saw {{continued}} use until 19 July 1985 when it was decommissioned for a redesign of Crewe station and its track layout and signalling.|$|E
50|$|Brechin North <b>Junction</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{controlled}} {{the convergence of}} the Edzell and Forfar lines; a double track ran from there to Brechin station.|$|E
50|$|The {{configuration}} of the curves at Clarkston is complex. The Busby Railway line runs south-east to north-west and the later L&AR line runs south-west to north-east. The south curve as described above is shown as in situ but disconnected at both ends on an Ordnance Survey map dated 1911; the junction at the Neilston end is named Clarkston West <b>Junction</b> and the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at the Clarkston end is Clarkston East Junction; this is in addition to Clarkston station <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> An east curve, not referred to by Paterson, is also shown, and is also disconnected at the Clarkston end; it is likely it was never connected as a through route. It ran parallel with the L&AR line and joined it at Muirend station: in effect this was a long siding from Muirend, and was used for wagon storage.|$|R
50|$|Newmarket {{was once}} a centre of railway activity, with {{significant}} growth occurring after the rail line from the city was opened in 1873. Eventually, there was a <b>junction</b> station, two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> two railway workshop complexes, railway houses, a railway social hall and extensive goods yard. This changed in 1930 when the Newmarket Workshops closed and were replaced by the Otahuhu Workshops. The Workshops bordering Broadway {{on the other side}} of the Remuera Road overbridge were torn down. The workshops along Middleton Road were retained and transferred to the New Zealand Post Office for use as Post Office workshops and these structures remained in place until they were unceremoniously torn down in the mid-1990s.|$|R
50|$|Crewe South <b>Junction</b> was a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> of {{the same}} design as North Junction and was {{commissioned}} as part {{of the same}} project. Absolute Block working was operated between Crewe North and South Junctions, with a Block Bell for each platform to communicate with South Junction. 'Train On Line' would be given to South Junction as the train entered the platform as seen from track circuits or visually from the box. 'Out of Section' would be given when South Junction had seen the train leave the platform complete with tail lamp, thus ensuring no part of the train had become uncoupled and left in the platform. Platforms 4, 5 and 6 were 'Up Platforms' which meant trains could only be sent 'Up' into those platforms i.e. towards South Junction. Platform 3 was 'bi-directional' so a train could be sent to or from South Junction, meaning there are two block instruments for this platform in both North and South Junctions. Platform 2 was 'Down only' and trains could only be sent from South to North. South Junction closed on 2 June 1985, just over a month before Crewe North <b>Junction</b> closed. <b>Signalling</b> was handed over to Crewe Signalling Centre (a Power <b>Signal</b> <b>Box)</b> which still exists to this day.|$|R
