40|$|The {{integration}} of instruments with the Grid promotes scientific and business collaboration by allowing shared access to rare and expensive instrumentation, {{regardless of its}} physical location. Instruments on the Grid are virtualized resources similar to storage and computing devices, and {{can be part of}} composite services or workflows concurrently invoked by multiple users in such Service-Oriented environments. The requirement for real-time, interactive control of instruments poses a need for exclusive or limited access by concurrent clients. Unfortunately, instrument modeling and standardization <b>of</b> instrument <b>reservation</b> and management are still in a very early stage. According to a number of use case requirements, which we review in this work, we propose a standards-compliant model for the representation of instruments on the Grid, and we describe a set of primitives for their <b>reservation.</b> The definition <b>of</b> these constructs can be used for the normative <b>description</b> <b>of</b> such <b>reservation</b> capabilities and the future specification of a standardized protocol. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{presents}} a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the Natural <b>Reservation</b> Râpa Roşie. Because {{of the need}} to protect this area, in recent years this has produced the need for a natural reservation. Although each Natural Reservation is different, many important values remain the same. Therefore, there are different reservations with different types of natural protection, like: geological, landscape and a range of biodiversity protections (flora and fauna), pedological and speological protection. Of national importance, Râpa Roşie is located near Sebeş, in the centre of Romania. It exhibits spectacular forms of natural soil erosion of the Secaşelor plateau, an area measuring over 25 ha (fig. 1),(Borza Al. 1959). The reservation is home to many rare plant species, such as Cotoneaster integerrimus, Centaurea atropurpurea, Dianthus serotinus, Cephalaria radiata and Asplenium adiantum-nigrum. Although founded as a National Reservation decades ago, it was only recently proposed as a Natural 2000 site...|$|R
40|$|Reservation {{policy is}} an {{extremely}} contentious topic in Indian politics. Proponents claim that a policy of positive discrimination {{is the only way}} to rectify the past injus-tices against India’s poor. Opponents claim that reservation policy creates perverse incentives that strengthen traditional caste boundaries and encourage backwardness. Despite vocal advocates on both sides of the issue, there is little empirical data on the actual effects <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> policy. This thesis provides theoretical and quantitative evidence on the unintended consequences <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> policy. I develop and estimate a model of marriage choice in the presence <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> to determine the effects <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> on the persistence of caste identity. I conclude that different effects <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> encourage both exogamy and endogamy along different dimensions, but the net impact <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> policy favors exogamy. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|R

40|$|The Resource System Package is a {{software}} tool developed {{to aid in}} the design and use <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> system databases. The package is designed to automate the creation <b>of</b> a <b>reservation</b> database for arbitrary objects and to facilitate ease of maintenance and updating of existing databases. Databases set up via the resource system are maintained through the Mistress Relational Database System, although no specific knowledge of Mistress is required of either the database designer or the users of the database. The package is menu-driven for ease of use. This package consists of two separate programs, a Resource System program and a Reservation System program. The Resource System program allows a database designer to create the reservation database. A designer is prompted for the characteristics of the objects which will be represented in the database, for <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> the objects available, and for information which will be used in the maintenance of the database; the program goes on to construct the actual Mistress database from the information supplied. The Reservation System program allows users to manipulate any <b>of</b> the available <b>reservation</b> databases which they have permission to modify. An individual user is presented with a set of options for manipulation of the database, which include the creation, modification, and deletion <b>of</b> <b>reservations,</b> as well as options to allow examination of the database.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{question}} of the legality <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> to international human rights treaties. The evolution <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> law demonstrates that the system seek to promote universal adherence to multilateral treaties through flexible rules that reflects the superiority of national sovereignty in the international society. However, the flexibility <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> law as codified in the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties has facilitated wide acceptance of multilateral treaties at the cost of their integrity. In the case of human rights treaties, this issue is of paramount importance considering the essentiality of a balance between integrity and universality for human rights norms. There is an urgent necessity to promote adequate reforms of the Vienna Convention system and rely on human rights treaty bodies’ competence and jurisdiction to review the validity <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> and ensure that universality and integrity are equally respected...|$|R
