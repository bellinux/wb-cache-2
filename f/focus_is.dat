5000|$|In geometry, focuses or foci ( [...] , [...] ), {{singular}} <b>focus,</b> <b>are</b> special {{points with}} reference to which any {{of a variety of}} curves is constructed. For example, one or two <b>foci</b> can <b>be</b> used in defining conic sections, the four types of which are the circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola. In addition, two <b>foci</b> <b>are</b> used to define the Cassini oval and the Cartesian oval, and more than two <b>foci</b> <b>are</b> used in defining an n-ellipse.|$|R

25|$|The <b>focus</b> spread <b>is</b> {{related to}} the depth of focus. Ray (2000, 56) gives two {{definitions}} of the latter. The first is the tolerance {{of the position of}} the image plane for which an object remains acceptably sharp; the second is that the limits of depth of <b>focus</b> <b>are</b> the image-side conjugates of the near and far limits of DOF. With the first definition, focus spread and depth of <b>focus</b> <b>are</b> usually close in value though conceptually different. With the second definition, focus spread and depth of <b>focus</b> <b>are</b> the same.|$|R

5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|De re militari, a {{treatise}} on Roman military affairs by Vegetius, a late 4th or early 5th-century writer, contains considerable {{information on the}} late army, although its <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> on {{the army of the}} Republic and Principate. However, Vegetius (who wholly lacked military experience) is often unreliable. For example, he stated that the army abandoned armour and helmets in the later 4th century (offering the absurd explanation that this equipment was too heavy), which is contradicted by sculptural and artistic evidence. In general, it is not safe to accept a statement from Vegetius unless it is corroborated by other evidence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Liver {{tissue from}} 17 West Highland White Temers (WHWTs) with cirrhosis, {{subacute}} bridging necrosis, hepatitis, or massive necrosis were examined for the presence, composition, {{and distribution of}} inflammatory <b>foci.</b> Copper analysis <b>was</b> performed on the specimens. The foci of inflammation and necrosis composed {{a significant part of}} the lesion in 15 of the samples. The <b>foci</b> <b>were</b> of two types. One, characteristic of idiopathic chronic active hepatitis, consisted of one or two apoptotic hepatocytes attended by lymphocytes and plasma cells. These <b>foci</b> <b>were</b> found primarily in the vicinity of the portal tracts, not associated with centrolobular copper-laden hepatocytes. The other type of <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> characteristic of copper toxicosis. These <b>foci</b> <b>were</b> larger and composed of debris-filled macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and scattered neutrophils, and on occasion apoptotic hepatocytes were found at the periphery. These <b>foci</b> <b>were</b> always found around the central vein among the copper-laden hepatocytes. Such <b>foci</b> <b>were</b> found only in dogs with copper concentration> 2, 000 parts/million on a dry weight basis. These morphologic studies show that clinical liver disease in WHWTs is caused by more than one etiologic agent. Among 17 WHWTs with clinical liver disease, two had copper toxicosis, five had idiopathic chronic active hepatitis, and 10 had hepatic disease of undetermined type...|$|R

5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have {{had anything to do with}} the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom at present, the {{mainstream}} approach towards representative standing is broad and liberal. The <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> on whether illegality {{or some other}} ground of review can be shown, rather than the applicant's relationship to the illegality complained of. If some unlawfulness can be demonstrated, the courts tend to grant a remedy even where the applicant is not directly affected by the executive decision.|$|E

5|$|Sonically, Impossible Princess is a {{departure}} from Minogue's previous music, having taken influence by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from the dance genre, including trip hop, electronica, rock, drum and bass and house. Additionally, selected recordings experiments with cultural elements like Middle Eastern music and Celtic origins. Lyrically, the album's central <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> about Minogue's self-discovery, which she found during a series of trips in Asia, America and Australasia, and further delves into the freedom of expression, relationships and emotions.|$|E

5|$|The New Directions glee club is in Chicago for the {{national}} show choir competition, but Mercedes (Amber Riley) is sick in her hotel bed with a bad fever and stomach pains, possibly due to food poisoning. Will (Matthew Morrison) drafts Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) into the Troubletones number to add vocal heft with Mercedes sidelined, and Sue (Jane Lynch) starts medical measures to restore her to health. During final rehearsals, fights break out among the New Directions members, but are easily resolved because the intensity of their <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> on winning.|$|E

The painting has been both hailed and criticized for its complexity. It is one of Matejko's most recognizable works, and has likely contributed to the popular image {{of the battle of}} Grunwald, and its enduring fame in Polish consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The second group, plates 48 to 64, {{detail the}} effects of the famine which ravaged Madrid from August 1811 until after Wellington's armies liberated the city in August 1812. Starvation killed 20,000 people in the city that year. In these plates, Goya's <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> {{directed}} away from the generalised scenes of slaughter of anonymous, unaligned people in unnamed regions of Spain; he turns towards a specific horror unfolding in Madrid. The famine was a result of many factors. For example, French invaders and Spanish guerrillas and bandits blocked paths and roads into the city, hampering the provision of food.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the main}} <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> {{protection}} of wildlife, the reserve management has also encouraged ecotourism. In 1993, a training course covering natural history, visitor management and park interpretation {{was introduced to}} train nature guides. A second course followed in 1995 which recruited more guides for the same purpose. This allowed {{the staff of the}} reserve, previously preoccupied with guiding the visitors, to carry out management activities uninterrupted. Additionally, the Indian government has organised workshops on ecotourism in Corbett National Park and Garhwal region to ensure that the local citizens profit from tourism while the park remains protected.|$|E
5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
