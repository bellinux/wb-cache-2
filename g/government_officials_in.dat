5|$|Following {{accusations of}} forced labour {{on the large}} American-owned Firestone rubber {{plantation}} and American accusations of slave trading, the Liberian government asked the League to launch an investigation. The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia. In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour. The report implicated many <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> <b>in</b> the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia {{and led to the}} resignation of President Charles D. B. King and his vice-president. The Liberian government outlawed forced labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms.|$|E

5|$|<b>Government</b> <b>officials</b> <b>in</b> Sri Lanka {{issued a}} last-minute {{evacuation}} order for potentially affected areas, though few received the evacuation order. The cyclone hit {{the eastern and}} western coastlines with powerful waves, wrecking 25fishing boats in eastern coastal towns and washing away 109 boats near Puttalam. Eight people were left missing and feared dead. The cyclone was accompanied with a storm surge as made landfall that flooded areas up to 330feet (100m) inland. While crossing the country, the cyclone dropped between 4 and 8inches (100 to 200mm) of precipitation, compounding the effects of severe monsoonal flooding from the previous month. Wind gusts from the cyclone reached 110mph (175km/h) near where it made landfall.|$|E
5|$|In {{observing a}} {{multitude}} of biographies and funerary inscriptions, Hymes states that officials in the Northern Song era displayed a primary preoccupation with national interests, as they did not intervene in local or central government affairs {{for the benefit of}} their local prefecture or county. This trend was reversed in the Southern Song. Since the majority of central <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> <b>in</b> the Southern Song came from the macroregion of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, Hartwell and Hymes state that there was a great amount of ad hoc local interests represented in central government policies.|$|E
5|$|Some Weiquan {{lawyers have}} {{advocated}} {{for the rights}} of HIV/AIDS victims who contracted the virus as a result of state-sponsored blood drives. In the 1990s, <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> <b>in</b> central China, and especially in Henan, encouraged rural citizens to sell blood plasma in order to supplement their incomes. Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV. According to activists, victims have not been compensated, and no government officials were held accountable. Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic, which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of Li Changchun, the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan.|$|E

5|$|The grain {{trade was}} a {{profitable}} private enterprise {{during the early}} Western Han, yet Emperor Wu's government intervened in the grain trade when it established the equable marketing system (also known as the ever-normal granary system) in 110 BC. The government purchased grain when it was plentiful and inexpensive, shipping it to granaries for storage or to areas where grain was scarce. The system was intended to eliminate grain speculation, to create a standard price and to increase government revenue. The system was designed by civil servant Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BC)—who was previously a merchant. Sang Hongyang was criticized by merchants for placing <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> <b>in</b> market stalls. This supply system was discontinued in Eastern Han, although it was briefly revived by Emperor Ming of Han (r. 57–75). Emperor Ming also abolished the system in 68 AD, when {{he believed that the}} government's storage of grain increased prices and made wealthy landowners richer.|$|E

5|$|A {{road from}} Julian to Kane Springs was {{completed}} in 1925. Efforts to include this road extending to Brawley into the state highway system date back from 1927, {{in order to receive}} state funding for the road. Plans for a cross-country road through Borrego Springs were being discussed by county <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> <b>in</b> 1927, as there were no east–west state highways in between Mountain Springs and Riverside. Those living in Calipatria and Westmorland supported the prospect of the road to Julian being improved, and included in the state highway system. In 1928, state assembly member Myron Witter {{wrote a letter to the}} San Diego County Board of Supervisors to suggest that the highway be incorporated as a second entrance to the county from the east, and that it would not detract from the progress of the other highway from El Centro; however, the county wanted to prioritize the paving over the designation. Chambers of commerce in the Imperial Valley generally agreed with Witter, proposing that the El Centro–Calexico road be made a part of the state highway system, and the Kane Springs–Julian road be given second priority for inclusion.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Colt {{received}} an extension on his patent {{since he did}} not collect {{on it in the}} early years. In 1852, gun makers James Warner and Massachusetts Arms infringed on the patent. Colt sued the companies and the court ordered that Warner and Massachusetts Arms cease revolver production. Colt then threatened to sue Allen & Thurber over the cylinder design of their double-action pepperbox revolver. However, Colt's lawyers doubted that this suit would have been successful and the case was resolved with a settlement of $15,000. Production of Allen pepperboxes continued until the expiration of Colt's patent in 1857. In 1854 Colt fought for his patent extension with the U.S. Congress, who launched a special committee to investigate charges that Colt had bribed <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> <b>in</b> securing this extension. By August he was exonerated and the story became national news when Scientific American reported that the fault was not with Colt, but with Washington politicians. With a virtual monopoly, Colt sold his pistols in Europe, where demand was high due to tense international relations. By telling each nation that the others were buying Colt's pistols, Colt was able to get large orders from many countries who feared falling behind in the arms race.|$|E
5|$|In other countries, {{the state}} played a {{stronger}} {{role in the}} process of commissioning memorials. France, for example, mostly relied on local communities to organise and commission most war memorials, but the state played a comparatively larger role than in Britain and similar countries. A law was passed in 1919 establishing an official role for local <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> <b>in</b> the process of commissioning memorials; many towns then formed committees to take this process forward, typically at the commune level. Members of the Souvenir Français organisation {{played an important role in}} many of the resulting local committees. In other cases, governments increased their role in commissioning memorials during the inter-war period. In Romania, most memorials in the early 1920s were initially erected by local communities; in 1919 the royal family created the Societatea Cultul Eroilor Morţi to oversee commemoration of the war more generally; the organisation was headed by the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. By the 1930s official concern over the diverse range of designs led to increased central control over the process.|$|E
