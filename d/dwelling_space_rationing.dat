Mathematical formulations for developing Pareto-improving pure road <b>space</b> <b>rationing</b> schemes and hybrid policies are presented. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed hybrid policy offers greater flexibility and is more prominent in leading to Pareto improvement than both pure congestion pricing and road <b>space</b> <b>rationing</b> schemes.

5000|$|Road <b>space</b> <b>rationing</b> in Beijing was {{introduced}} in the city in a permanent basis after successful results obtained with the policy during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Road <b>space</b> <b>rationing</b> or driving restriction is a transportation demand management regulation aimed to reduce traffic by restricting automobile travel through means such as restriction of cars that could enter common road space based upon the last digits of the license number on certain established days during certain periods in Beijing. The main objective of this restraint policy in Beijing is {{to reduce the amount of}} exhaust gas generated by motor vehicles.|$|R

It {{has been used in}} some large cities especially when there are some major events. This paper analyzes the efficiency of road <b>space</b> <b>rationing</b> schemes by establishing the bounds of the reduction in the system cost associated with the restricted flow pattern at user equilibrium in comparison with the system cost at the original user equilibrium. The bounds are established under the general traffic equilibrium model formulated as variational inequalities and illustrated with a simple example. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between housing characteristics and residential property price is complex to illustrate. To {{have a better}} understanding of the housing-price structure, structural or spatial submarkets have been introduced in previous studies. However, there is no consensus on the importance of neighborhood effect among them. With regard to this issue, this study specifically focuses on the differences in structural, geographical, and demographical effects between housing submarkets (as categorized by <b>dwelling</b> <b>space).</b> Market subdivisions are relative to consumer behaviors. The heterogeneity of spatial effects in different submarkets gives an explanation as to why the impact of nonneighborhood housing factors in those submarket models is similar, regardless of whether the neighborhood effect is included or not. It also indicates that only some, but not all, of the potential purchasers would make decisions with reference to transaction records of flats in the surrounding areas, only when the flat they want to buy is within a specific range in size. Other critical characteristics such as building age, <b>dwelling</b> <b>space,</b> location choice, and commuting time (to central business district) show remarkably different effects on housing price in those submarkets. Segmentation of housing market by <b>dwelling</b> <b>space</b> (and the average price per square feet is higher when the flats are larger) helps to obtain a better understanding of the importance of <b>dwelling</b> <b>space</b> in housing valuations and in urban housing planning.

5000|$|Transport economists {{consider}} road <b>space</b> <b>rationing</b> {{an alternative}} to congestion pricing, but road <b>space</b> <b>rationing</b> is considered more equitable, as the restrictions force all drivers to reduce auto travel, while congestion pricing restrains less {{those who can afford}} paying the congestion charge. Nevertheless, high-income users can avoid the restrictions by owning a second car. Moreover, congestion pricing (unlike rationing) acts [...] "to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evinced by users' willingness to pay for the resource". While some [...] "opponents of congestion pricing fear that tolled roads will be used only by people with high income. But preliminary evidence suggests that the new toll lanes in California are used by people of all income groups. The ability to get somewhere fast and reliably is valued in a variety of circumstances. Not everyone will need or want to incur a toll on a daily basis, but on occasions when getting somewhere quickly is necessary, the option of paying to save time is valuable to people at all income levels." [...] Road <b>space</b> <b>rationing</b> based on license numbers has been implemented in cities such as Athens (1982), México City (1989), São Paulo (1997), Santiago, Chile, Bogotá, Colombia, La Paz (2003), Bolivia, and San José (2005), Costa Rica.|$|R

In such projects, there can be large variation in costs and quantitative design efficiency indicators. Therefore, quantitative analysis and optimisation techniques are required to achieve cost-effective designs of such development systems.

Using these optimisation techniques, a planner can achieve both directly and simultaneously, multiple design objectives involving criteria such as density, open space standards, and so on, while minimising the cost of a given <b>dwelling</b> <b>space,</b> or maximising the <b>dwelling</b> <b>space</b> within a given affordable cost.

50|$|Despite {{implementation}} since 1997 of road <b>space</b> <b>rationing</b> by {{the last}} digit of the plate number during rush hours every weekday, traffic in this 20-million-strong city still experiences severe congestion. According to experts, {{this is due to}} the accelerated rate of motorization occurring since 2003 and the limited capacity of public transport. In São Paulo, traffic is growing at a rate of 7.5% per year, with almost 1,000 new cars bought in the city every day. The subway has only 61 km of lines, though 35 further kilometers are under construction or planned by 2010. Every day, many citizens spend between three up to four hours behind the wheel. In order to mitigate the aggravating congestion problem, since June 30, 2008 the road <b>space</b> <b>rationing</b> program was expanded to include and restrict trucks and light commercial vehicles.|$|R
