5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences,</b> although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of the Project, many CVP operations have had considerable <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences,</b> including a decline in the salmon population of four major California rivers, and the reduction of riparian zones and wetlands. Many historical sites and Native American tribal lands have been flooded by CVP reservoirs. In addition, runoff from intensive irrigation has polluted rivers and groundwater. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act, passed in 1992, intends to alleviate some of the problems associated with the CVP with programs like the Refuge Water Supply Program.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shark populations began declining. Since {{they are}} predators {{near the top}} of the marine food chain, an {{umbrella}} species, playing an important role in maintaining ocean ecosystems, this could have serious adverse <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences</b> for marine fisheries. Campaigns began in many nations to prohibit or greatly curtail finning in both territorial and international waters and work toward international agreements on the practice. In the U.S., President Bill Clinton signed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act (SFPA) into law in 2000 shortly before leaving office. It amended the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the primary statute regulating fisheries in the U.S.'s Exclusive Economic Zone up to 200 nautical miles offshore, to prohibit finning in U.S. territorial waters by any vessels, and the possession of fins by a U.S.-flagged vessel in international waters or the landing of any fins at a U.S. port without corresponding carcasses amounting to at least 20 times the weight of the fins. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was charged with promulgating and implementing regulations to enforce the act.|$|E

30|$|Early {{childhood}} practitioners used investigator-developed recording {{forms to}} code {{the number of}} learning opportunities (trials) afforded each child per game and to compute the percent of trials per game that were associated with a child response-contingent behavior having an <b>environmental</b> <b>consequence.</b> A trial {{was defined as the}} availability of a child reinforcement where a child-specific targeted behavior did or did not result in a social or non-social <b>environmental</b> <b>consequence</b> (e.g., a parent talking to her son or daughter in response to the child smiling at the parent). The two child measures were used to assess parent effort and effectiveness, respectively, where both were used as a latent variable for measuring efficacious parenting practices. Research assistants made 95 joint visits with the practitioners to ascertain interrater agreement {{over the course of the}} 8  weeks of intervention. Interrater agreement for number of learning opportunities was 92 %, and interrater agreement for the number of child behavior that resulted in reinforcing consequences was 91 %.|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore TechnologyEven {{with the}} recent {{developments}} in renewable energy, oil & gas are still our most important energy source today. This will also {{be the case in}} the foreseeable future, but new demands are constantly being forced on the industry. The need for hydrocarbons is recognized, but they are expected to be produced with minimal risk to operating personnel, company economy and the environment. The latter is the subject in this thesis, which aims to propose a new procedure to assess <b>environmental</b> <b>consequence</b> of failure within the discipline of risk-based inspection. Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) is a formal approach developed to aid in the assessment of risk connected to the static equipment on a process plant, and to assign inspection intervals which give a good balance between safety, practicality and economy. The risk for each module is calculated using the probability of failure (PoF) and the consequence of failure (CoF). These two factors are combined to give a risk rating, which is then used to set an appropriate inspection interval for the module or component in question. The consequence part of RBI is typically divided into three main categories: safety, cost and environment. Safety consequence is concerned with the possible injuries or fatalities {{in the case of an}} accident, while cost consequence covers the material damages, loss of production and reputation damage. The last category describes the consequence if the surrounding environment is exposed to spills or emissions. The study presented in this thesis is partly based on existing literature, but the previous work in this area has proved to be limited. The <b>environmental</b> <b>consequence</b> has mostly been based on cost for clean-up, fines and penalties. The reason for this limited approach is probably the huge number of factors which could affect the <b>environmental</b> <b>consequence</b> from a spill. Detailed models exist, but they are too comprehensive to be applied in a practical RBI context. In this thesis, factors influencing the <b>environmental</b> <b>consequence</b> of failure (E-CoF) are first identified and discussed. A procedure is then presented to assess the various factors and combine them into an E-CoF rating. The procedure is presented in the form of flowcharts, and a guide is provided to show the calculation of each contributing factor. As quantitative calculations are not always possible for RBI purposes, several methods for evaluation are presented for some of the factors. The cost term has been left out of the E-CoF analysis, as it is difficult to compare cost to environmental harm. However, as costs are important, a separate procedure has been prepared for estimating the costs involved with a liquid hydrocarbon release. A matrix is also provided to allow combination of E-CoF and cost into a common consequence rating...|$|R
25|$|Incineration {{is common}} in {{countries}} such as Japan where land is more scarce, as these facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. Waste-to-energy (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent organic compounds such as dioxins, furans, and PAHs, which may be created and which may have serious <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences.</b>|$|E
25|$|A common view is {{that the}} CAP has {{traditionally}} promoted a large expansion in agricultural production. At the same time it has allowed farmers to employ unecological ways of increasing production, such as the indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides, with serious <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences.</b> However, a total re-focusing of the payment scheme in 2004 now puts the environment at the centre of farming policy. By linking the payments to farmers to a number of strict environmental standards (among others) in the so-called cross compliance scheme, farmers will have to face cuts in their subsidy levels if they don't meet the strict environmental requirements.|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) applied to agricultural land (via synthetic fertilizers, composts, manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences.</b> Excess N supplied by both synthetic fertilizers (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic {{sources such as}} manures (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by soil microorganisms) can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate. Nitrate-contaminated drinking water can cause blue baby syndrome. Together with excess P from these same fertilizer sources, eutrophication can occur downstream due to excess nutrient supply, leading to anoxic areas called dead zones.|$|E

All of the learning games were characterized by behavior-based contingencies where a social or non-social <b>environmental</b> <b>consequence</b> was dependent on child behavior responding (Gunnar 1980; Tarabulsy et al. 1996).|$|R
25|$|The {{relative}} poverty of many cocoa farmers means that <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences</b> such as deforestation are given little significance. For decades, cocoa farmers have encroached on virgin forest, mostly after the felling of trees by logging companies. This trend has decreased as many governments and communities {{are beginning to}} protect their remaining forested zones. In general, the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides by cocoa farmers is limited. When cocoa bean prices are high, farmers may invest in their crops, leading to higher yields which, in turn tends to result in lower market prices and a renewed period of lower investment.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to {{establish}} (or attribute) the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, {{at a point in}} time (typically the recent past). Consequential LCAs seek to identify the <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences</b> of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications of a decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development as a different approach to life cycle thinking intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.|$|E
25|$|Some {{countries}} employ {{energy or}} carbon taxes to motivate energy users {{to reduce their}} consumption.

Meanwhile, taxes on all energy consumption stand to reduce energy use across the board, while reducing a broader array of <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences</b> arising from energy production. The State of California employs a tiered energy tax whereby every consumer receives a baseline energy allowance that carries a low tax. As usage increases above that baseline, the tax is increasing drastically. Such programs aim to protect poorer households while creating a larger tax burden for high energy consumers.|$|E

25|$|Wisconsin's economy also diversified {{during the}} early years of statehood. While lead mining diminished, {{agriculture}} became a principal occupation in the southern half of the state. Railroads were built across the state to help transport grains to market, and industries like J.I. Case & Company in Racine were founded to build agricultural equipment. Wisconsin briefly became one of the nation's leading producers of wheat during the 1860s. Meanwhile, the lumber industry dominated in the heavily forested northern sections of Wisconsin, and sawmills sprang up in cities like La Crosse, Eau Claire, and Wausau. These economic activities had dire <b>environmental</b> <b>consequences.</b> By the close of the 19th century, intensive agriculture had devastated soil fertility, and lumbering had deforested most of the state.

In May 2010, China announced a major, five-month crackdown on illegal mining {{in order to protect}} the environment and its resources. This campaign is expected to be concentrated in the South, where mines– commonly small, rural, and illegal operations– are particularly prone to releasing toxic wastes into the general water supply. However, even the major operation in Baotou, in Inner Mongolia, where much of the world's rare-earth supply is refined, has caused major environmental damage.|$|E
