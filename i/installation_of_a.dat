40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} and compare perceived pain intensity and discomfort between {{the placement of}} two different orthodontic anchoring units designed for osseointegration and premolar extraction in adolescent patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>A</b> total <b>of</b> 120 adolescent patients (60 girls and 60 boys) were recruited and randomized into three groups. Group <b>A</b> underwent <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> onplant, group B <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Orthosystem implant, and group C premolar extraction. Pain intensity and discomfort, analgesic consumption, limitations in daily activities, and functional jaw impairment were evaluated the first evening and {{one week after the}} intervention. RESULTS: Pain intensity following surgical <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> onplant was comparable to the pain intensity experienced after premolar extraction, but there was significantly less pain after surgical <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Orthosystem implant compared to <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> onplant (P =. 002) or premolar extraction (P =. 007). The protective, vacuum-formed stent caused great discomfort, even more discomfort than the surgical sites following <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> the onplant or the Orthosystem implant. CONCLUSION: The Orthosystem implant was better tolerated than the onplant in terms of pain intensity, discomfort, and analgesic consumption and was, therefore, the anchorage system <b>of</b> choice in <b>a</b> short-term perspective...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of a 2006 {{settlement}} of a lawsuit filed by the Boston Center for Independent Living and a group of individuals, the MBTA installed additional elevators at Porter and four other busy MBTA subway stations.

5|$|Reports {{into the}} crash by the Greek Air Force, and an {{independent}} investigator hired by Onassis, the Englishman Alan Hunter, concluded that it had occurred {{as a result of}} the reversing of the aileron connecting cables during the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new control column. This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that had taken off before them had caused the crash.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Scheer {{underwent}} a refit while her sister ships {{set out on}} commerce raiding operations in the Atlantic. Admiral Scheer was modified during {{the early months of}} 1940, including the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new, raked clipper bow. The heavy command tower was replaced with a lighter structure, and she was reclassified as a heavy cruiser. Additional anti-aircraft guns were also installed, along with updated radar equipment. On 19–20 July RAF bombers attacked Admiral Scheer and the battleship , though they failed to score any hits. On 27 July, the ship was pronounced ready for service.|$|E

5|$|Although no flight-deck cruisers {{were ever}} {{built by the}} U.S. Navy, the Soviet Union's , {{developed}} in the 1970s, is remarkably {{similar to that of}} the original flight-deck cruiser design, featuring an angled flight deck aft with anti-ship missile launchers forwards. In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end a much more modest conversion, lacking the flight deck, was carried out.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather, which necessitated the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tarpaulin sheet over {{the rear of}} the cab and the front of the tender, restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two class members (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|E
5|$|Before the Croatian War of Independence Velebit {{served with}} the 88th Submarine Flotilla of the Yugoslav Navy {{entering}} service during the late 1980s. Velebit, then named Soča, was like other Una-class submarines, named after rivers in Yugoslavia. In 1991, it was being overhauled in Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata {{until the beginning of}} the war, when Croatian forces captured it. In 1993, Brodarski Institut (BI) of Zagreb started a modification program to improve the operational capabilities of the submarine captured two years earlier. The hull was lengthend to create space needed for the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single MTU 105kW diesel generator, a feature the original Una-class design lacked. A new steering system developed by BI was also installed.|$|E
