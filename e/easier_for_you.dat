500|$|The album's songs also feature offbeat sounds, improvisational elements, and {{conversational}} vocals {{derived from}} rap. The Revival {{begins with a}} directive from a grave voice: [...] "Play this record as frequently as possible, Then, as it becomes <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> play the record once a day, or as needed." [...] The album also features dialogue between an old lady who asks the group {{whether it will be}} like their last album, on which she was also featured; they respond to her question [...] "No, ma'am". [...] "All the Way" [...] has a scrambling beat, whistle sounds, and the rhythmic call and response [...] "What are we, what are we, what are we? ... Just a bunch of brothers having a party". The end of [...] "Feels Good" [...] features witty jazz keyboard playing behind a lively voice saying [...] "it feels good ... in the hands, feet, bones, heart, and soul". Ed Hogan of Allmusic writes that [...] "the last part sounds like a Sunday morning testimonial." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be all that they can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to swallow if I sat and smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on the double standard with the lyrics [...] "The guy gets all the glory the more he can score / While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore". Lil' Kim shares a similar sentiment during her verse in the bridge, questioning why a man is able to give a woman [...] "some sex or sex her raw" [...] while [...] "if the girl do the same and then she's a whore".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, Reagan asked viewers: [...] "Are you better off now {{than you were}} four years ago? Is it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less {{unemployment}} in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout {{the world as it}} was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gan Ning {{was unhappy}} with Huang Zu and wanted to leave him, but was worried that Huang would not allow it, so he felt very frustrated. Su Fei was aware of Gan Ning's intention, so he invited him for drinks and said, [...] "I {{recommended}} you to Huang Zu many times, but he doesn't {{want to give you}} important responsibilities. Days pass by and people become older. You should make plans for the future and find someone who truly appreciates your talents." [...] Gan Ning paused for a moment before replying, [...] "That's what I've in mind, but I can't find an excuse to leave." [...] Su Fei then said, [...] "I'll suggest to Huang Zu to appoint you as the Chief (長) of Zhu County (邾縣; northwest of present-day Huanggang, Hubei). The initial phase is difficult, but after you reach it, it'll be much <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to decide where to go from there." [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Great." [...] Huang Zu approved Su Fei's suggestion. Gan Ning managed to gather a few hundred men who were willing to follow him, and they headed towards Zhu.|$|E
