40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} flowering phenology on pollen <b>flow</b> <b>distance</b> and spatial genetic structure in a population of a bumblebee-pollinated herb, Primula sieboldii, we investigated the flowering phenology of 1712 flowers of 97 genets in a population in Nagano Prefecture, Japan, and constructed a mating model based on the observed mating pattern, which was revealed by paternity analysis using 11 microsatellite markers. The effects of flowering phenology were inferred by comparing estimated pollen <b>flow</b> <b>distance</b> {{and the level of}} heterozygosity in the next generation between two scenarios. In the first scenario, both the intergenet distance and flowering phenology influenced mating opportunity, while in the second scenario only intergenet distance influenced mating opportunity. Although the frequency distribution of pollen <b>flow</b> <b>distance</b> at the population level did not differ significantly between the two scenarios, the mean pollen <b>flow</b> <b>distance</b> of several flowers increased by more than 10 m as a result of variation in flowering phenology. Furthermore, accounting for flowering phenology predicted change in heterozygosity in the next generation from 20. 04 to 0. 07.

40|$|Global river {{models are}} an {{essential}} tool for both earth system studies and water resources assessments. As advanced physical processes {{have been implemented}} in global river models, increasing computational cost has become problematic for executing ensemble or long-term simulations. To improve computational efficiency, we here propose {{the use of a}} local inertial flow equation combined with a vector-based river network map. A local inertial equation, a simplified formulation of the shallow water equations, was introduced to replace a diffusion wave equation. A vector-based river network map which flexibly discretizes river segments was adopted in order to replace the traditional grid-based map which is based on a Cartesian grid coordinate system. The computational efficiency of the proposed flow routing and river network map was tested by executing hydrodynamic simulations with the CaMa-Flood global river model. The simulation results suggest that the computational efficiency can be improved by more than 300 % by applying the local inertial equation. It can be improved by a further 60 % by implementing the vector-based river network map instead of a grid-based map. It is found that the vector-based map with evenly distributed <b>flow</b> <b>distances</b> between calculation units allows longer time steps compared to the grid-based map because the latter has very short <b>flow</b> <b>distances</b> between calculation units at high latitudes which critically limit time step length. Considering the improvement in simulation speed, the local inertial equation and a vector-based river network map are preferable in global hydrodynamic simulations with high computational demands such as ensemble or long-term experiments...|$|R
