500|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements. The opening chorus {{is followed by}} an ancient chorale, then the male soloists sing a sequence of recitative and aria each. The work is completed by a closing chorale.

2500|$|It is {{calculated}} that when swimming some fish can achieve a propulsive efficiency greater than 90%. Furthermore, they can accelerate and maneuver {{far better than}} any man-made boat or submarine, and produce less noise and water disturbance. Therefore, many researchers studying underwater robots would like to copy this type of locomotion. Notable examples are the Essex University Computer Science Robotic Fish G9, and the Robot Tuna built by the Institute of Field Robotics, to analyze and mathematically model thunniform motion. The Aqua Penguin, designed and built by <b>Festo</b> of Germany, copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front [...] "flippers" [...] of penguins. <b>Festo</b> have also built the Aqua Ray and Aqua Jelly, which emulate the locomotion of manta ray, and jellyfish, respectively.|$|E

Festo's claim had been amended during prosecution for, at the very least, compliance with 35 U.S.C. §112, and thus Shoketsu claimed that prosecution history estoppel should bar <b>Festo</b> from asserting equivalents.|$|E
