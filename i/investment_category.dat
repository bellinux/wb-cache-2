40|$|We {{develop a}} new rating of mutual funds: the atpRating. The atpRating assigns crowns to each {{individual}} mutual fund based upon the costs an investor pays when investing in the fund in relation to {{what it would cost}} to invest in the fund’s peers. Within each <b>investment</b> <b>category,</b> the rating assigns five crowns to funds with the lowest costs and one crown to funds with the highest costs. We investigate the ability of the atpRating to predict the future performance of a fund. We find that an investor who has invested in the funds with the lowest costs within an <b>investment</b> <b>category</b> would have obtained an annual risk-adjusted excess return that is approximately 3 - 4 percentage points higher per annum than if the funds with the highest costs had been invested in. We compare the atpRating with the Morningstar Rating. We show that one reason why the atpRating and the Morningstar Rating contain different information is that the returns Morningstar uses as inputs when rating funds are highly volatile whereas the costs the atpRating uses as inputs when rating funds are highly persistent. In other words, a fund that has low costs one year will most likely also have low costs the following year, whereas the return of a fund in a certain year generally contains only little information about the future return that the fund will generate. Finally, we have information on the investments in different mutual funds made by a small subgroup of investors known to have been exposed to both the atpRating and the Morningstar Rating, i. e. information is provided on how investors use the two ratings. We find that investors have a clear preference for high-rated funds. investor-cost based rating; funds...|$|E

Further, funds of hedge funds when examined as a separate <b>investment</b> <b>category</b> do not show aggressive loading on higher-moment risks. Second, we provide evidence on economically significant premiums being embedded in hedge fund returns on account of their exposures to higher-moment risks. Third, we uncover a set of higher-moment factors that are not strongly associated with factors in benchmark models that are currently used for evaluating hedge fund performance. Finally, the addition of these higher-moment factors to benchmark models can better explain the variation in hedge fund returns. Bearing on issues of practical consequence, we find that benchmark models augmented with higher-moment factors can considerably alter the hedge funds’ alpha-based rankings...|$|E

These opportunities are then evaluated through a conventional financial analysis in order to assess their economic and environmental attractiveness. To this purpose, the IRR of a typical project in each <b>investment</b> <b>category</b> is calculated by taking into account country- specific parameters, such as baseline emission factors, load factors, costs, energy prices etc. The results reveal substantial differences in the economic and environmental return of different types of projects in different host-countries and show that for the full exploitation of the CDM a multifaceted approach to decision-making is necessary.

This paper proposes an {{effective}} model to integrate shareholders ’ requirements {{with regard to}} Bank’s investment categories {{in an effort to}} rank the best project portfolios in order of importance whereby they reap the benefits of their secured investments. This study attempts to utilize Quality Function Deployment (QFD) in an investment bank sector, a customer oriented design tool which starts with House of Quality (HOQ). In this manner, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach was employed to fulfill the intended HOQs through measuring the relative importance of shareholders ’ needs as well as finding the relative weight of each investment more precisely. For this purpose, a well-structured questionnaire initially should be developed to identify the selection-criteria “wants ” and thereby analyzing the intensity of internal relationships through cooperation with the Bank’s Decision makers (BDMs).

The 1990 s saw a decline in home bias, which, coupled with rapid financial deepening, led to a large increase in gross international investment holdings. The home bias of non-U.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, local {{currency}} emerging market (EM) debt {{has been developing}} to become an attractive and complementary <b>investment</b> <b>category</b> as many EM countries have been successful to reduce currency mismatches and maturity problems by implementing sound fiscal and monetary policies. Analyzing the period from 2002 to July 2009, we show that the local currency EM debt investments provide significant additional alpha and diversification to traditional bond portfolios. In particular, first, EM local currency bond returns are less correlated to the US stock market, treasury and high-yield bond markets, and global risk premia compared to the a case of EM equity and US dollar-denominated bond markets. Second, yields and excess returns on local currency debt depend largely on expected depreciation of the exchange rate against US dollar, while excess returns on dollar-denominated EM debt {{are for the most}} part compensation for bearing the global risk. Third, EM sovereign local currency bond returns beat other emerging and mature market asset classes by providing higher risk adjusted excess returns and diversification. In light of our findings, we suggest that the development of local currency bond markets in EM countries could contribute to global financial stability by reducing currency mismatches and reliance on foreign currency debt, which in turn is linked to growth and poverty reduction. ...|$|E
