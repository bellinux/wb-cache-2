500|$|According to Taraborrelli, [...] "Many female artists {{behave like}} a diva for a period when they reach superstar status, and the 'Who's That Girl?' tour marked the {{beginning}} of Madonna's." [...] For instance, she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her; they had to talk to her representatives, lest they distract her from the business at hand. She also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to even look at her unless they were onstage with her. Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of [...] "those who couldn't help but stare". DeMann commented: [...] "She <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was. [...] "You don't {{behave like a}} bitch until you are that successful. The tour sure helped cement her star status", he commented.|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell explained how the season would interact with Agent Carter saying, [...] "Agent Carter {{seems to be}} about SSR pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that.

[...] Ultimately, the opening scene of [...] "Shadows" [...] serves as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter with the inclusion of Atwell as Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including the then unconfirmed involvement of Howard Stark, who is mentioned in the scene, as well as Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

Willa Paskin wrote for New York Magazine that Carter, [...] "spoke with enough people involved in the situation to provide an account so detailed, it even includes re-created conversations and dialogue". Neal Justin of Star Tribune commented on the author's neutrality in his writing style, [...] "The next time network TV executives stumble into an ugly behind-the-scenes battle, they should consider hiring Bill Carter to negotiate.

Bradley Stern from MuuMuse remarked how the video looked like the video game Grand Theft Auto and showed things that did not look [...] "angelic": [...] "Between the tough-looking gangbangers, fancy cars and flashy jewelry, strippers and dozens of 'In Loving Memory' tees and tributes, it seems like Bey's trying to say these aren't exactly the easiest streets to live... But like the song suggests, just because things might get rough sometimes doesn't mean it's not still home." [...] A mixed review came from an editor of Houston Chronicle who described the clip as [...] "somber, shocking" [...] and noted the omissions of many landmarks characteristic for the city such as Waterwall, the Houston Astrodome and The Galleria. The editor also noted that the video offered a glimpse in the town's sex industry and elaborated, Many Houstonians probably don't know that side of the city. They almost certainly don't see it as beautiful. ' culture' is what some pundits call it. But underneath is something complicated, and it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> influencing society unlike anything else Houston produces.

500|$|Wood's {{performance}} of Steffy has received acclaim, {{and she has}} become a fan favorite. On-Air On-Soaps said Wood had the [...] "unique challenge" [...] of making the despised character into a more complex and well-rounded one, who fans were rooting for, while also praising her as [...] "one of the hardest working younger actresses in daytime today". Writing for Canyon News in July 2009, Tommy Garrett applauded Wood for making the role [...] "believable" [...] and noted that fans have [...] "readily accepted her as the surviving twin of Ridge and Taylor's", saying: [...] "Stepping into a role that has been played {{by more than one}} actress would be a very daunting task for a lesser actress. But Jacqueline has embraced the role and made it her own." [...] Garrett enjoys Wood playing a story in which she is [...] "shocked to learn things". While criticizing the material written for the character as being [...] "often repetitive and silly", Sara Bibel of Xfinity opined in June 2012 that Wood is a [...] "charismatic actress" [...] who rises above the script to [...] "deliver consistently interesting performances". In July 2012, Soaps In Depth commended Wood's performance, observing that [...] "While her sexiness is a given, Wood <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> bringing a cool, copacetic attitude to her scenes", while praising her ability to infuse [...] "both melancholy and mirth" [...] in her performance.

[...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> taking everything and turning it upside down. That's {{the great thing about}} this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E

Desmond is clearly puzzled, but is relieved to finally be with Penny again. Desmond later goes to Penny's billionaire father, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) and asks for his permission to marry his daughter. Widmore rejects Desmond, who is crushed and humiliated. Walking out of the building, Desmond sees Charlie singing and playing his guitar for money on the sidewalk. Desmond asks him if he remembers him but Charlie does not. Frustrated, Desmond rants about his time {{on the island and}} predicts it will rain, which it suddenly does. At a pub, Desmond meets with his friend, a physicist, and after retelling the events on the island asks him if time travel is possible. Desmond tries to predict more events but they do not happen and his friend assures him time travel is impossible. While shopping for a ring for Penny, Desmond runs into the shopkeeper, Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan). Hawking takes Desmond on a walk where they see a man crushed to death by falling scaffolding. She explains that although she knew the man would die, she did not help because the universe <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> [...] "course correcting", and he would die anyway. Desmond and Penny go on a walk together and take a picture, where he breaks up with her after realizing that he does not have enough money to support her. He returns to the pub, where one of his predictions before about the bartender being attacked finally comes true (proving that he really knew about the future, but that his timing was off), but he ends up being accidentally hit himself and is knocked out. Desmond wakes up back on the Island, completely naked, as seen in [...] "Further Instructions".|$|E

[...] The magazine also praised Zelder's direction: [...] "ction, comedy and a touch of sweetness... exactly what distinguishes Caroline Zelder's debut feature.... Zelder <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> imbuing even the smallest gestures -- like a teenager's slump or a 5-year-old's intractable stare -- with meaning." [...] Variety also gave high marks to the film's technical production. [...] "Lenser Mark Vargo bathes the Montana locations in glorious natural light; Alan Muraoka's production design and Nola Roller's costumes mostly nail the 1968 aesthetic, but could have been even more consistent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{is often}} {{considered}} among {{the best and most}} influential heavy metal bassists.

Before playing, Harris often chalks his fingers, to make these fast patterns easier to play, as shown on the bonus DVD for the A Matter of Life and Death album. Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers has commented that [...] "Steve taught himself in a way that nobody can really copy it. People say it's like a lead guitar, but it's not. It gives the band a basis and it moves around quite a lot, but it's the tone that he has. Steve <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> hearing things and a tone that isn't normally associated with a bass, it's more like a rhythm guitar." ...|$|E

In 1996, Capitol Records was preparing a contract for Underwood but canceled it when company management changed.

Everything <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> working out." [...] While at Checotah High School, she was an Honor Society member, a cheerleader, and played basketball and softball. Underwood graduated from Checotah High School in 2001 as salutatorian. She chose not to pursue singing after graduation. She said, [...] "After high school, I pretty much gave up on the dream of singing. I had reached a point in my life where I had to be practical and prepare for my future in the 'real world'". She attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, graduating magna cum laude in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in mass communication and an emphasis in journalism. She spent part of one of her summers as a page for Oklahoma State Representative Bobby Frame. She also waited tables at a pizzeria, worked at a zoo, and at a veterinary clinic.

Balancing her new job, her family, and trying to rebuild her love life is not easy, but she keeps trying. She makes a name for herself in family court for her unusual methods and sentences and her stubbornness, which sometimes gets her in trouble. She dates several men. Her longest and more serious relationships are with lawyer Stuart Collins and David McClaren. Amy and Stuart dislike each other at first, but when she asks him to be Eric Black's lawyer, they get closer and eventually get engaged. However, Amy leaves him at the altar on their wedding day, saying he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> always convincing her to do things she does not want to do, calling him [...] "a bully". She meets David McClaren during her short stint in the criminal court, and things are rocky from the start. Amy becomes pregnant by him and they plan to marry, but things fall apart when she miscarries and they part ways soon thereafter. In the last episode of the series, she quits the judiciary to run for Senate, to try to prevent the passage of a law that will effectively end the juvenile justice system by allowing the State's Attorney's office to try teenagers as adults at their own discretion. Amy's often complicated and ever changing definition of a relationship with her Court Services Officer, Bruce Van Exel, whom she calls her [...] "best friend" [...] and with whom she's shared intimate moments – despite his refusal to date white women, ends with him coming to be with her in Washington as she testifies at a Senate Hearing.|$|E
