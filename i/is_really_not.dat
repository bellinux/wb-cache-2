25|$|According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect” (Ethics 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), {{and capable}} of loving both himself—and us, insofar as {{we are part of}} his {{perfection}} (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends amor intellectualis dei (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> the kind of being who could ever love us back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).|$|E

Dennis Rodman, of all people. Keeping us safe <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> my job; it’s the black guy’s [...] job.

When you get footage like that, you realise that your job <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> technical. It was my job to look at {{something}} that Emma Thompson had done and say, 'Eh, that's not good, I'll use this other one instead.' And not only was I allowed to pass judgment on these tremendous actors, I was required to." ...|$|E
500|$|Interiors {{were shot}} with three cameras in wide, {{lingering}} master shots in single takes. Welles states that Corman [...] "had two camera crews on the set—that's why the picture, from a cinematic standpoint, <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> very well done. The two camera crews were pointed {{in opposite directions}} so that we got both angles, and then other shots were 'picked up' to use in between, to make it flow. It was a pretty fixed set and it was done {{sort of like a}} sitcom is done today, so it wasn't very difficult." ...|$|E

I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording, marketing and distribution which I think is very important to any product you want to bring to market ... but I never had that with the record industry. Now that I'm {{on the other side of}} it trying to be the artist and the industry, I realize what the importance of the system was, but I also realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now."

[...] He threatened to expel Taylor, who responded by saying a forced departure would mean the end of US support. However, Khánh later said he was open to the possibility of going abroad and asked Taylor if he thought this {{would be good for the}} country, to which the ambassador replied in the affirmative. Khánh also said he took responsibility for his generals' actions, and expressed regret at what they had done. Khánh then ended the meeting, saying he would think about his future.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hampp {{felt that}} [...] "for an album [...] {{inspired}} by performance art, {{it was the}} one moment where music and shock value merged indelibly and credibly." [...] The performance also received criticism for the vomiting act. Recovered bulimic Demi Lovato complained that the show [...] "glamorized" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News, [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> a statement about eating disorders themselves." [...] Gaga confessed on Today, [...] "Millie and I know that not everybody's going to love that performance, but we both really believe in artistic expression and strong identities, and I support her and what she does. Artpop, my new album, is about bringing art and music together in the spirit of creative rebellion, and for us, that performance was art in its purest form." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... I just thought that <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> fair and I {{think we have to}} put something in that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E

500|$|Scholars and {{academics}} have offered different {{interpretations of the}} music video and its story line. Allen Metz, {{one of the authors}} of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, noted that when Madonna enters the church at the beginning of the clip, the line [...] "I hear you call my name, And it feels like.... Home" [...] is played. The women of Italian East Harlem in New York call their Church as la casa di momma (Momma's House). In that respect, Metz believed that Madonna alluded herself to be one from Harlem, but also refers herself as divinity returning to the Church. This divine aspect is further explored by Nicholas B. Dirks, author of Culture/power/history, who argued that Madonna falling into a dream is the most important point of the narrative as it signified that [...] "Madonna <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> putting herself in place of the redeemer, but imagining herself as one." ...|$|E
500|$|Tolkien quotes {{at length}} what the scholar W. P. Ker thought of Beowulf, namely that [...] "there is nothing {{much in the}} story", and that [...] "the great beauty, the real value, of Beowulf is in its dignity of style". Tolkien notes that Ker's opinion had been a {{powerful}} influence in favour of a paradoxical contrast between the poem's supposed defect in speaking of monsters, and (in Tolkien's words) its agreed [...] "dignity, loftiness in converse, and well-wrought finish". Tolkien cites other critics, such as Raymond Wilson Chambers and Ritchie Girvan, who objected to the poem's [...] "wilderness of dragons" [...] and its unworthy choice of theme. Tolkien finds it improbable that [...] "a mind lofty and thoughtful", {{as evidenced by the}} quality of the poetry, [...] "would write more than three thousand lines (wrought to a high finish) on matter that <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> worth serious attention". He notes that heroic human stories had been held to be superior to myth, but argues that myth has a special value: [...] "For myth is alive at once and in all its parts, and dies before it can be dissected." [...] Finally Tolkien states directly [...] "We do not deny the worth of the hero by accepting Grendel and the dragon." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{also held}} a one-off concert for ArtRave: The Artpop Ball inside a six-storey vending machine at Doritos' annual South by Southwest (SXSW) music festival at Austin, Texas. The city's Music and Entertainment {{division}} had initially denied permission to Gaga for playing inside the venue citing {{that it was}} for [...] "public safety concerns". Don Pitts from the division said that the venue being in close proximity with a parking lot was the reason they had to cancel Gaga's application. On March 6, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Gaga would indeed play at the venue. Tickets were sold to the fans through different competitions and challenges. Randal Lane from Forbes reported that the concert would support Gaga's Born This Way Foundation and charity events, but nevertheless opined that [...] "the way they're doling out the tickets is still crass". The concert was criticized when artist Millie Brown vomited a green liquid over Gaga during the performance of [...] "Swine" [...] from Artpop. The performance received complaints about [...] "glamorizing" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News: [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> a statement about eating disorders themselves." [...] Gaga herself told Today [...] "Millie and I know that not everybody's going to love that performance, but we both really believe in artistic expression and strong identities, and I support her and what she does.

2500|$|Allen {{tried to}} {{recapture}} the success of Family with Hothouse for ABC in 1988; the drama about the lives and work experiences of the staff of a mental hospital lasted eight episodes. Personally Allen thought it was some of her best work, though its short life was a mixed blessing for her, said Allen: [...] "Unfortunately, ABC didn't have the courage of their initial convictions. They skewered it, they turned tail on it. However if they had picked it up I'd have had to turn out 26 episodes. I'd be in Forest Lawn now. Television is a killer. It <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> for sissies." ...|$|E
2500|$|The notion {{implicit}} in questions like this attributed by the rabbis to Koraḥ {{is the same}} as that expressed in Koraḥ's challenge to Moses and Aaron (Numbers 16:3), [...] "The entire congregation is holy, and God is in their midst, so why do you exalt yourselves above God's congregation?" [...] Koraḥ ostensibly subscribed to the laws that were the subject of his questions to Moses, but was really using them to mock and discredit Moses. Therefore, Koraḥ's question about a tallit made entirely of blue yarn, which is ostensibly [...] "more kosher than tzitzit" [...] but <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not,</b> since it still requires tzitzit, became, in Hebrew idiom, an epithet used sarcastically against hypocritical displays of false piety.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 3 stars with its review by Scott Yanow, stating: [...] "Throughout the set, Weston's solos {{hold on to}} one's interest, {{although}} the overall results <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> all that essential".|$|R

2500|$|On 6 February 2009, Borisov, {{speaking}} in Chicago, told Bulgarian expatriates {{that the human}} material and the basis of Bulgarian population at that moment included 1 million Roma, 700,000 Turks and 2.5 million retirees. He added that the human material that they are left with as voters and as a pool for recruiting staff <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> that big, as {{half a million people}} have left Bulgaria.

2500|$|Prior to the book's release, Victoria's Secret {{released}} a statement claiming Bisutti had made [...] "numerous fabrications and misstatements…She was never a Victoria's Secret 'Angel' {{as defined by the}} terms of our Angel model contract. [...] And contrary to Ms. Bisutti's claims, she was never offered any subsequent modeling contracts or opportunities with Victoria's Secret despite her multiple appeals for further work." [...] Bisutti responded in an interview: [...] "All the truth is in the book. … My book <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>not</b> about Victoria's Secret. It's about the modeling industry as a whole and about helping girls with self-body image issues, eating disorders and really exposing the entire industry for what it is.
