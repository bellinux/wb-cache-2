Seven of the {{unsuccessful}} films were critically acclaimed and have achieved strong cult status over the years among the viewers; these films included Mehbooba, Bundal Baaz, Tyaag, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Naukri, Chakravyuha and Janta Hawaldar, which were directed by Shakti Samanta, Shammi Kapoor, Din Dayal Sharma, Meraj, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and Mehmood Ali, respectively. Khanna persuaded Samanta to cast his sister-in-law Simple Kapadia opposite him in Anurodh. Films starring Rajesh Khanna and directed by Shakti Samanta tended to be commercially successful, but Mehbooba was an exception. The change from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers caused some decline of Khanna's career in terms of box office ratings. The declaration of emergency in India had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption to become successes. Actor Joy Mukherjee made Chhailla Babu, a suspense thriller in 1977, which became the only successful film of his as a director, and the unexpected success of Chhailla Babu gave a boost to the career of Khanna.

40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} malaria is {{becoming}} endemic in highland areas beyond its previously known upper limit of transmission. Assessment {{of the situation}} of the disease in such areas is necessary in order to institute appropriate control activities. Objectives: The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of malaria, the parasite species involved and Anopheles species responsible in local malaria transmission. Methods: A systematic sampling technique was used to select survey <b>households.</b> Blood <b>films</b> were collected monthly between October and December 1999 from all household members by a trained and experienced laboratory technician. Larval and adult mosquitoes were monthly collected using different methods from September 1999 to October 2000. Results: Among 2136 examined blood films, 78 (3. 7 %) of them were malaria positive of which 54 (69 %) were due to Plasmodium vivax and 24 (31 %) due to P. falciparum. Anopheles gambiae s. l. (presumably An. arabiensis) and An. christyi were the dominant man-biting species, with the former being the major vector in the area. Both these species were found to be more of exophagic and active in the early evening, unlike An. pharoensis, which showed an endophagic tendency. Conclusion: This study indicated that indigenous transmission of malaria occurs in the study area. Transmission is reckoned to be maintained by low density of vector species for short period of time under favorable conditions. Therefore, the acquisition of communal immunity is interrupted by long duration of non-malaria season leading to the occurrence of recurrent malaria epidemics. [Ethiop. J.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify spatially explicit indicators of Plasmodium falciparum infection among school-aged children and to undertake a model-based spatial prediction of P. falciparum infection risk using environmental predictors. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted, including parasitological examinations and interviews with more than 5, 000 children from 93 schools across Côte d'Ivoire. A finger-prick blood sample was obtained from each child to determine Plasmodium species-specific infection and parasitaemia using Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood <b>films.</b> <b>Household</b> socioeconomic status was assessed through asset ownership and household characteristics. Children were interviewed for preventive measures against malaria. Environmental data were gathered from satellite images and digitized maps.

40|$|Slapstick, the American silent film {{comedy of}} the 1910 s and 1920 s, {{is marked by}} a highly “mechanical” use of space {{as can be seen in}} its fascination for {{speeding}} car chases as well as for the skyscrapers of the modern metropolis. Particularly the so-called thrill comedies by Harold Lloyd, such as "Safety Last," demonstrate slapstick’s playful and acrobatic celebration of new architectural typologies. First and foremost, however, slapstick’s interest in architecture focuses on the house, which is often presented as a site of destruction. Ridiculing figures of authority and bourgeois respectability, slapstick films often chuckled at the gradual and systematic destruction of the bourgeois home and its valuable furniture and priceless objects – particularly Laurel & Hardy skilfully mastered this practice. In addition, slapstick films celebrate the house as a mechanical object in various ways. In films such as "Mum’s the Word" or "Mighty Like a Moose" by Charley Chase, for instance, the spatial structure of the interior is presented as a mechanical precision apparatus for a perfectly timed choreography of chasing characters. Moreover, slapstick homes are often crammed with the mechanical gadgets of the machine age, which were also elaborately discussed in the pages of contemporaneous journals such as "Popular Mechanics. " With their foldaway beds and electric <b>household</b> utensils, <b>films</b> such as "One AM" (Charlie Chaplin), "He Done His Best" (Charley Bowers), "The Scarecrow" (Buster Keaton), "The Electric House" (Buster Keaton), or "It’s a Gift" (Snub Pollard) present the home as a machine à habiter, which also fascinated avant-garde architects and designers of the era. What’s more, films such as "One Week" (Buster Keaton), "The High Sign" (Buster Keaton), and "Family Life" (Sunshine Hart) present the house in its entirety as a mechanical gadget characterized by a flexible space thanks to prefabricated elements, mobile walls, swing doors, and hidden trapdoors.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{listening}} practices in 1970 s China and examines the cinematic soundtracks {{of a handful of}} films, domestic and foreign, that were edited specifically for the purpose of radio broadcasting. Coined as 'edited film recording', this made-for-radio sonic compilation is a new product, one that takes crucial pieces from the original soundtrack but has significant editorial input, specifically in the insertion of an omniscient narrator. The narrator tells the story, expands narrative at times and comes in at crucial moments to drive key messages home. Film production was also designed for auditory consumption outside of the theatre, on gramophone and radio, before television entered individual <b>households</b> in China. <b>Film</b> literacy thus could be achieved without an actual access to the film products themselves. The hybridity of the genre created an illusion of broader and equal access to the symbolic order of a socialist visual culture. While communal life in 1970 s China can be characterized by an infatuation with film and film culture, a web of other media, particularly those of sound, facilitated this fascination.

An integrated malaria and trachoma control program is being implemented by the Regional Health Bureau. To provide baseline data, a survey was conducted during December 2006 to estimate malaria parasite prevalence, malaria indicators, prevalence of trachoma, and trachoma risk factors in households and people of all ages in each of the ten zones of the state, excluding three urban centers (0. 4 % of the population). Methodology/Principal Findings: The study was designed to provide prevalence estimates at zone and state levels. Using multi-stage cluster random sampling, 16 clusters of 25 households were randomly selected in each of the ten zones. Household heads were interviewed for malaria indicators and trachoma risk factors (N = 4, 101). All people were examined for trachoma signs (N = 17, 242), and those in even-numbered <b>households</b> provided blood <b>films</b> for malaria parasite detection (N = 7, 745); both thick and thin blood films were read. Zonal malaria parasite prevalence ranged from 2. 4 % to 6. 1 %, with the overall state-wide prevalence being 4. 6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 3. 8 %– 5. 6 %).

Women had begun mimicking her speech, her make-up and her hairstyle. She had become a household name. Her fame and impeccable acting skills landed her the title character in the film Naila (1965), the first color film produced in the then West Pakistan. Her portrayal of the tragic Naila won her further critical acclaim. She went on to star in many hit films including Devdas, Doraha, Humraz. However, Qaidi (1962), Chingari (1964), Farangi (1964), Naila (1965), Aag Ka Darya (1966), Lakhon Mein Eik (1967), Saiqa (1968) and Salgirah (1968) were landmarks in her career securing her a position as the top actress of the 1960s in Lollywood.
