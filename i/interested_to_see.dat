25|$|The film {{rights were}} picked up by Rogue Pictures in 2006, with the remake being the first film {{produced}} by Wes Craven's new production studio Midnight Pictures. Craven, who wrote and directed the 1972 original, was <b>interested</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what kind of film could be produced on a large budget, as the limited funds in 1972 forced him to eliminate scenes {{he had wanted to}} film to tell a complete story. Alleca's original script included elements of the supernatural, which prompted the studio to reject it and bring in Ellsworth to perform a rewrite. One of the elements director Iliadis wanted to avoid with this film, given its graphic nature, was turning it into torture porn — a subgenre of horror popularized by the Saw franchise. For Craven and Iliadis, The Last House on the Left primarily illustrates how even the most normal of families can be driven to evil acts if pushed too far.|$|E
500|$|Billingsley {{also enjoyed}} the romantic subplot with Kellie Waymire as Elizabeth Cutler, however he was {{concerned}} that Waymire's working schedule wouldn't allow her {{to return to the}} show easily and so he wasn't anticipating the romance being followed up upon in future episodes. She had previously appeared as Cutler in the episode [...] "", and was pleased for her character to be involved with Phlox saying that she'd be <b>interested</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the romantic plot was brought back by writers in a future episode. Waymire made one final appearance as Cutler in [...] "Two Days and Two Nights", before her death on November 13, 2003 of an undiagnosed medical condition. Amongst other guest stars in this episode was Karl Wiedergott, who is better known for his voice work on The Simpsons.|$|E

500|$|Den of Geek {{viewed the}} episode positively, observing that in {{contrast}} to the previous installment, [...] "Ability" [...] "progresses the main plot arc in a substantial way... I’m now really <b>interested</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what happens next, whereas last week I wasn’t that bothered." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was a little more critical and rated the episode 7.8/10. He noted that though the ending with Walter [...] "was as good as you could ask for" [...] and enjoyed David Robert Jones as a villain, the episode had a [...] "number of rough patches," [...] as the middle was [...] "paced slowly" [...] and lacking in suspense, Peter's [...] "handiness was again reduced to ...'that guy with connections'", and the audience was [...] "once again subjected to the torture that is Sanford Harris". After describing the Olivia-Peter scene near the end as [...] "tense and cleverly written," [...] Isler concluded his review by noting references to The X-Files and hoping Jones would appear again soon.|$|E
500|$|Josh Jackson of Paste Magazine {{disliked the}} [...] "deus ex machina" [...] aspects that [...] "neatly solved the puzzles {{of the first}} two episodes", and also criticized {{perceived}} [...] "plot contrivances" [...] like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim. Despite these flaws, Jackson said he would tune in next week because he would [...] "rather have a show {{err on the side of}} unbelievable than unremarkable, and I'm <b>interested</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve". Erin Fox of TV Guide also liked [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] better than the pilot because she thought that it [...] "had really cool special effects, awesome Walter-isms, and actual chemistry forming between Olivia and Peter", and [...] "we also got to delve more into the connections between Walter, Nina Sharp, Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was institutionalized".|$|E
500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said [...] "The Stakeout" [...] was [...] "the best Parks & Recreation episode {{by a long}} shot". He said Poehler {{seemed more}} at ease with the Leslie character, and thought [...] "the {{intersection}} of business and personal stress" [...] served the episode well. He also praised the supporting cast and particularly the Ron Swanson subplot. Matt Fowler of IGN said with [...] "The Stakeout", the second season of Parks and Recreation continued to be [...] "significantly funnier" [...] than the first season. Fowler {{said he thought the}} pairing between Leslie and Tom helped ground both characters, and said he was <b>interested</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Leslie dealt with the growing romance between Ann and Mark. Entertainment Weekly writer Henning Fog said [...] "The Stakeout" [...] showed growth improvement for the series, and praised the guest performance of Louis C.K. Fog said the disparate pairing of Leslie and Tom, Mark and Ann, and Ron and April, created a sense that the characters [...] "really knew each other [...] had lives outside of Leslie's immediate orbit". Chicago Tribune columnist Maureen Ryan particularly praised the performance of Offerman, of whom she said, [...] "His pained reactions and stoic silence are hilarious." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Lose Yourself" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most television critics. James Poniewozik of Time has mixed {{reactions to the}} episode. He was critical of the plot arc between Grey and Chase, [...] harshly criticizing Grey's acting and expressing that [...] " [...] didn't think that Adrian Grenier had completely sold Vince’s downward spiral." [...] He continued: [...] "There’s something half-jokey about his manner that makes me think he’s about to break up laughing, as in a blooper reel." [...] In contrast, Poniewozik felt that [...] "for {{the first time in}} a while, I’m really <b>interested</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what happens on Entourage next." [...] Dan Philips of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Philips praised [...] "Lose Yourself", opining that it was an [...] "excellent, extremely entertaining climax to this season's two main plot lines." [...] He added, [...] "Even though the episode never got around to providing any resolution, the overall journey was engaging enough to make its cliffhanger feel less like a cheap trick to get us to tune in for season eight." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Josh Wagler of MTV, who praised Grenier's performance, opining that it was his best performance to date. The A.V. Club writer Kyle Ryan gave the episode a 'B-' grade. Ryan wrote, [...] "The last episode teed up tonight’s many confrontations [...] For a show that has specialized in spinning its wheels, these were surprisingly high stakes." [...] He was critical with the development of Vincent Chase, as well as his storyline with Sasha Grey, commenting that [...] "Vincent and his coterie just aren’t that interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|AJ {{brings out}} a {{different}} side to Masood, which Ganatra said could [...] "upset the status quo". He said that AJ {{was brought in}} [...] "to stir up Masood's life, and that has exciting prospects", and they would [...] "get up {{to all sorts of}} shenanigans." [...] Presenter Kate Thornton, when interviewing Ganatra, said AJ was a [...] "playmate" [...] for Masood, while Wadia said that AJ brings the comedy back to Masood. Inside Soap Kate White called AJ [...] "a world away from family man Masood", while Soaplife said AJ is [...] "not a good influence but he sure puts a smile on [...] face and a new spring in his step." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ's influence on Masood is [...] "infectious". AJ's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab, as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her. Ganatra stated: [...] "So by opening this door, you get to see what Masood was like in his childhood and as a teenager. Masood did have a naughty streak—he was in a band with his brother, and they got up to mischief. Masood [...] has been put on the straight and narrow [...] But prior to that, he was a teenager like any other—getting into trouble, and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ!" [...] Ganatra said that, as British Asians, Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls. Now, Masood sees AJ as somebody with [...] "no responsibilities, no children and no stress of having to provide for a family" [...] and as AJ suffers marrital problems, is feeling lonely and has no children, Ganatra said [...] "they want each other's lives, which is quite a nice dynamic to play." [...] He added that [...] "AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood's, while Masood would love to pack his bags, get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger's bed. I'm <b>interested</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him bring out Masood's naughty streak—and where that could take them..." [...] AJ is accepting of Syed's homosexuality and his relationship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge).|$|E

2500|$|In 1993 Moore {{declared}} {{himself to be}} a ceremonial magician. The same year marked a move by Moore back to the mainstream comics industry and back to writing superhero comics. He did so through Image Comics, widely known at the time for its flashy artistic style, graphic violence, and scantily clad large-breasted women, something that horrified many of his fans. His first work published by Image, an issue of the series Spawn, was soon followed by the creation of his own mini-series, 1963, which was [...] "a pastiche of Jack Kirby stories drawn for Marvel in the sixties, with their rather overblown style, colourful characters and cosmic style". According to Moore, [...] "after I'd done the 1963 stuff I'd become aware of how much the comic audience had changed while I'd been away [...] That {{all of a sudden it}} seemed that the bulk of the audience really wanted things that had almost no story, just lots of big, full-page pin-up sort of pieces of artwork.

2500|$|Caine wrote a guidebook {{entitled}} The Little Man Island: Scenes and Specimen Days in the Isle of Man for the 1894 tourist season. Published by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company {{it comprises}} {{a mixture of}} descriptions, pictures and advertising. [...] At {{the end of the}} 19th century the Isle of Man was a popular tourist destination, a result of the Wakes Weeks, when Lancashire mills and factories closed for holidays. To meet growing demand the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company purchased new steamers to bring many thousands of tourists to Douglas from Liverpool. The Isle of Man Advertising Committee was set up in 1894 under the Advertising Rate Act. A group of bankers, local businessmen and developers built new hotels, boarding houses and entertainment venues. They formed a Committee publicising the Isle of Man as a holiday resort, opening an office in London with Caine’s brother in charge. When Caine wrote the Deemster in six weeks at a boarding house on the Douglas esplanade he saw these developments. He believed that the Island’s economic prosperity lay in developing this trade. The success of Caine’s novels set in the Isle of Man boosted the tourist trade. Tynwald Day, the island’s national day, became better known both in England and America because of his novels. [...] Caine and Greeba Castle became a visitor attraction. Cruising around Great Britain aboard the Royal yacht, King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra visited the Isle of Man, in August 1902. They were the first British monarchs to set foot on Manx soil. The King had read most of Caine’s works and through reading them he wanted to visit the island. The Queen enjoyed Caine's Manx novels and was <b>interested</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where his characters lived. The royal party enjoyed Caine’s hospitality. [...] He was invited to join the royal couple on their yacht and to accompany them on their tour of the island the following day.|$|E
