30|$|ABAQUS/standard version 6.7 {{was used}} to {{establish}} a 3 D full-scale FE model of the RC bridge. Different types of elements were utilized to create the model. The model consisted of a concrete slab on the steel girders, which in turn were supported by capped concrete columns. <b>Deck,</b> <b>girders,</b> cap, and columns were modeled separately, and then assembled together. <b>Deck,</b> <b>girders,</b> and stiffeners were modeled with shell elements, and cap and columns were modeled using continuum solid elements. The resulting FE model contains 50, 776 shell elements formed by 57, 878 nodes, of which 11, 016 elements {{were used for the}} deck slab and 24, 736 elements were needed to model girders. Also, 15, 024 solid elements were used in the model containing 19, 502 nodes.|$|R
5000|$|This {{railroad}} crosses Martins Creek on {{an unusual}} bridge with two different spans, a 67 ft riveted <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> and a 56 ft riveted lattice deck truss. The bridge originally had two 67 ft <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> spans, {{but these were}} doubled up to increase their strength. The 56 ft lattice deck truss spans were salvaged from Bridge No. 138 on the DL&W’s Buffalo Division and a new abutment constructed to accommodate the shorter span.|$|E

50|$|In the {{cantilever}} strutted version, {{shown in}} the illustration at left, the top strut (or struts, depending on design) can be fashioned into a cantilever truss. By all going to the same footing, {{the upper part of}} the <b>deck</b> <b>girders</b> are thus in tension and the moment of the cantilever section is offset by the moment of the water impinging on that section.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} headstocks, now {{encased in}} concrete, are 610mm deep wrought iron girders of similar construction to the <b>deck</b> <b>girders.</b> Cast iron piles 2.4m and 1.2m sections and bolted through either {{internal or external}} flanges are used to support the headstocks. The piles are 610mm in diameter with 25mm thick wall. Attempts have been made, unsuccessfully, to fill the piles with concrete.|$|R
50|$|The fixed spans were 116 ft long, made {{of three}} wrought iron hogback plate girders each, resting on three piers. The swing span was {{constructed}} of three hogback wrought iron box girders, each 250 ft long, each box girder having a thickness of 2 ft made of plates 0.3125 to 0.4375 in thick. In {{addition to the}} transverse <b>deck</b> <b>girders</b> the swing span was also braced by three transverse frames, which also served to support a bridgeman's hut over {{the centre of the}} bridge.|$|R

5000|$|Steel dams use {{a series}} of {{footings}} anchored in the earth. These footings hold struts which in turn hold up {{a series of}} <b>deck</b> <b>girders</b> which in turn hold steel plates. It is these plates that the water comes in contact with. The girders and plates are angled in the downstream direction so that part of the weight of the water acts with a downward force on the struts and footings, holding them in place. (Consider that, if the plates were vertical, as in a steel cofferdam, all the force would be horizontal and much more massive struts and anchors would be required to counteract the horizontal force and bending moment.) ...|$|R

40|$|Bridge deck crack {{surveys were}} {{performed}} on twelve bridges on US- 59 {{to determine the effects}} of mixture proportions, <b>deck</b> type, and <b>girder</b> types on the crack density of reinforced concrete bridge decks. Of the twelve, eight have prestressed concrete girders and four have steel girders. Four of the <b>decks</b> with prestressed <b>girders</b> have partial-depth precast deck panels, two are monolithic, and two have overlays. Of the four <b>decks</b> with steel <b>girders,</b> two have overlays and two are monolithic. The surveys were performed, crack maps were analyzed, and cracking trends were observed. The results for the US- 59 bridge decks were compared with crack densities obtained in a study of low-cracking high-performance concrete (LC-HPC) bridge decks in Kansas. The monolithic concrete bridge decks supported by prestressed concrete girders within this study exhibit less cracking than decks supported by steel girders in the first three years. At an age of approximately three years, the US- 59 monolithic <b>decks</b> on prestressed <b>girders</b> with <b>deck</b> panels are not displaying significant cracking at the joints of the panels. The US- 59 decks supported by prestressed girders without overlays exhibit significantly less cracking than the <b>decks</b> on prestressed <b>girders</b> with overlays. No benefits of using fibers in either the overlay or in the deck have been observed in this study...|$|R

50|$|A Zores section (also: Z-section) was {{a railway}} beam section {{designed}} by French engineer, Charles Ferdinand Zores, {{in the second}} half of the 19th century for use in the supporting frames of various railway structures. They were very common in France. In other countries, such as Germany, the originally designated fer arrondi (rounded profile) became a standardised rolling mill profile for wrought iron, its shape resembling an upside down rain gutter. It was used as surfacing on steel bridges, covering the <b>deck</b> <b>girders</b> and forming the base on which gravel, concrete or plaster for the actual trackbed was laid. It was spaced 2 to 3 centimetres apart in order to improved drainage. For the same purpose, usually for smaller loads, buckled plate was used.|$|R
50|$|On June 23, 2010, a {{brush fire}} {{severely}} damaged the Lobato Trestle, {{a long and}} high <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge. The railway trucked locomotive 484 and some coaches from Chama to Cumbres so that operations could continue {{on both sides of}} the break. On June 20, 2011, the Lobato Trestle was returned to service, and trains were once more traveling the full length of the railroad.|$|E
50|$|Fort Road Bridge is {{a girder}} bridge that spans the Mississippi River between St. Paul, Minnesota and Fort Snelling, Minnesota.

It is the third bridge on the site, the first bridge, a <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge was built in 1880. The second bridge, a metal arch bridge was built by 1912.|$|E
50|$|The bridge uses an {{orthotropic}} steel <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> for {{a central}} {{section of the}} 360 m long main span, {{while the rest of}} the main span and the short lateral spans are a prestressed concrete girder. Both steel and concrete deck girders have the same external shape. This original design principle was later used for the 756 m main span of the Pont de Normandie, a cable-stayed bridge in Normandy, France.|$|E

40|$|Bridge {{monitoring}} {{plays an}} important role in reducing catastrophic failure. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been performed on one of the bridge components such as <b>decks,</b> <b>girders,</b> abutments/piers independently. However, the failure can be attributed either a component defect or combination among them. Bridge deterioration model requires the analysis of complex and dynamic variables. The system dynamic (SD) is a powerful simulation method to study the dynamic and complex systems. This paper aims to discuss the concept of bridge deterioration monitoring using SD approach.  The proposed model utilized variables from the previous studies to represent the bridge component interrelationship, while SD will be used to simulate the probability of bridge failure and to find the dominant bridge component that influences the failure. The model can also be used as guidance for bridge deterioration mitigation and repair program...|$|R
5000|$|A {{spectacular}} viaduct, 89 ft {{high and}} one of altogether seven, had to be built across the valley at Inchanga, 40 mi from Durban. It was completed in July 1880, with piers made of tubular steel sections which supported a lattice <b>decking</b> <b>girder</b> on which the track was laid. The viaduct was prone to swaying in windy conditions and, as a safety precaution, train speed across the bridge was restricted to about 7 mph. Trains {{were not allowed to}} run across it [...] "during times of more than average wind" [...] and, when the wind speed exceeded 10 mph, passengers had to disembark and walk across the bridge, after which the train would follow. Between June 1885 and July 1886, additional slanted supporting struts were attached to the bridge piers to give the structure greater stability.|$|R
