40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} diabetic retinopathy severity and blood flow parameters in the central retinal artery (CRA) and internal carotid artery (ICA). Methods: This comparative study included 40 eyes of 20 patients with asymmetric diabetic retinopathy. Twelve subjects had asymmetric diabetic macular edema while eight patients had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in one eye and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in the fellow eye. Bilateral color Doppler imaging (CDI) of the CRA and ICA was performed to determine resistance index (RI) and peak systolic velocity (PSV). RI and PSV values were compared between <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> higher grades of macular edema (> 2 grades of difference <b>with</b> the fellow <b>eye)</b> and fellow <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> less severe macular edema, {{as well as between}} <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> PDR and fellow <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> NPDR. Results: Mean RI of the CRA in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> higher grades of macular edema was 0. 78 ± 0. 11 as compared to 0. 69 ± 0. 08 in fellow <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> less severe macular edema (P= 0. 012), while PSV of the CRA was 58. 83 ± 18. 93 cm/s in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> higher grades of macular edema versus 59. 75 ± 11. 83 cm/s in fellow <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> less severe macular edema (P= 1. 00).

40|$|AIM:To {{compare and}} analyze the {{diagnostic}} value of iris fluorescein angiography(IFA) combined with fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA), indocyanine green angiograph(ICGA), fundus fluorescein angiography in the diagnosis of early diabetic retinitis(DR). METHODS: Totally 70 patients(136 <b>eyes)</b> <b>with</b> early diabetic retinopathy enrolled in our hospital from August 2015 to August 2016 were selected in this study. All patients were respectively treated with ICGA, FFA and IFA+FFA, and the detection results of three kinds of imaging methods were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 120 pathological eyes(88. 2 %) were detected by FFA, 124 pathological eyes(91. 2 %) were detected by ICGA, 130 pathological eyes(95. 6 %) were detected by IFA+FFA, {{and there was no}} significant difference in the detection rate between the three methods(P > 0. 05). FFA detected 48 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> neovascularization, 18 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> vitreous hemorrhage, 38 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular edema, 16 eyes without perfusion area; ICGA detected 49 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> neovascularization, 38 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular edema, 17 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> vitreous hemorrhage, 20 eyes without perfusion area; IFA+FFA detected 17 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> proliferative diabetic iridopathy(DI), 22 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> non-proliferative DI, 5 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> NVG, 92 <b>eyes</b> without DI. CONCLUSION: In the diagnosis of early diabetic retinopathy, iris fluorescence angiography, fundus fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography all have good diagnostic value, but IFA+FFA can detect the diabetic retinopathy in time and provide the help for the timely treatment...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{changes of}} the foveal photoreceptor layer using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and evaluate the correlation with visual acuity (VA) loss. DESIGN: Observational case series. METHODS: We studied 28 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> acute or chronic CSC using high-resolution OCT. The tomographic findings of the detached foveal photoreceptor layer were compared <b>with</b> VA. Sixteen <b>eyes</b> also were evaluated after foveal reattachment. RESULTS: The outer photoreceptor layer (OPL) in the detached fovea was preserved in 14 eyes, of which 13 had symptoms for 1 year. The preserved OPL had an even profile in 7 eyes and a granulated profile in 7 eyes. Mean VA was 0. 19 logMAR with a preserved OPL and 0. 72 logMAR with an atrophic OPL (P <. 001). Cases seen after the detachment resolved included 6 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> preserved even OPL, 5 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> preserved granulated OPL, and 5 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> atrophic OPL. Mean final VA was 0. 06 logMAR in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> preserved OPL and 0. 90 logMAR in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> atrophic OPL (P <. 001). The VA improved in 73 % of <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> preserved OPL and no <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> atrophic OPL (P =. 025). The VA recovered completely in 83 % of <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> preserved even OPL and no <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> preserved granulated OPL (P =. 015). CONCLUSION: High-resolution OCT demonstrates changes in the foveal photoreceptor layer in CSC that highly correlate with VA loss and may predict visual recovery after macular reattachment...|$|R
40|$|AIMS [...] A {{study was}} carried out to {{ascertain}} the natural outcome of each stage of idiopathic macular hole. METHODS [...] One hundred and fifty four <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> different stages of idiopathic macular holes were retrospectively studied: stage 1 (40 eyes), 2 (25 eyes), 3 (58 eyes), and 4 (31 eyes). RESULTS [...] Of 27 of 40 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> a stage 1 lesion with posterior vitreous attachment to the macula initially, nine (33 %) eyes developed a full thickness macular hole. No stage 1 lesions with posterior vitreous separation from the macula initially progressed to full thickness holes. Twenty one (84 %) of 25 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> a stage 2 lesion, 32 (55 %) of 58 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> a stage 3 lesion, and five (16 %) of 31 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> a stage 4 lesion underwent macular hole enlargement during the median follow up period of 3 years. Visual acuity decreased two or more lines of Snellen equivalent during the follow up period in 12 (30 %) <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> a stage 1 lesion, 17 (68 %) <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> a stage 2 lesion, 17 (29 %) <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> a stage 3 lesion, and four (13 %) <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> a stage 4 lesion. The percentage was significantly higher in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> stage 2 lesions than the other stages (p < 0. 01).

5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always see eye to <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, {{there was always the}} factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E
5|$|After {{unearthing}} {{an ancient}} crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen {{discovered that the}} cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, {{could be used to}} calculate the height of a distant mountain {{in the same way that}} mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height.

40|$|Phacoemulsification and posterior-chamber-lens {{implantation}} in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> acute angle-closure glaucoma {{compared to}} cataract extraction in their partner eyes. Methods: Twelve patients were included, one with bilateral angle-closure-glaucoma and eleven with unilateral glaucoma. Thirteen <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> an elevated intraocular pressure {{due to an}} angle-closure were treated by phacoemulsification and IOL implantation and compared to 11 partner <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> narrow angle (three previously treated by iridectomy) without intraocular pressure elevation. The average follow-up period was 15. 7 ± 2. 1 months. Results: The average intraocular pressure in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> angle-closure glaucoma was 54. 1 ± 14. 7 mmHg and in the partner eyes 22. 4 ± 8. 6 mmHg preoperatively.

40|$|Purpose: The {{pathogenesis}} of macular pucker and macular holes {{is poorly}} understood. Anomalous posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and vitreoschisis {{have been proposed}} as possible mechanisms. This study used clinical imaging to seek vitreoschisis and study the topographic features of macular pucker and macular holes. Methods: Combined optical coherence tomography and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (OCT/SLO) was performed in 45 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular hole and 44 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular pucker. Longitudinal imaging was used to identify vitreoschisis and measure retinal thickness. The topographic features of <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular hole with eccentric macular contraction were compared to 24 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> unifocal macular pucker using coronal plane imaging. Results: Vitreoschisis was detected in 24 of 45 eyes (53. 3 %) with macular hole and 19 of 44 (43. 2 %) with macular pucker. Retinal contraction was detected eccentrically in the macula of 18 of 45 <b>eyes</b> (40 %) <b>with</b> macular hole. In <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular hole with unifocal retinal contraction, the average surface area of contraction (23. 12 ± 18. 79 mm 2) was significantly smaller than in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular pucker (63. 20 ± 23. 68 mm 2; P =. 006). The distance {{from the center of}} retinal contraction {{to the center of the}} macula was significantly greater in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular hole (8. 64 ± 2. 33 mm) than <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular pucker (4. 45 ± 1. 90 mm; P =. 0001). Conclusion: Vitreoschisis was detected in about half of all <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular hole and macular pucker. The topographic and structural features in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular hole with retinal contraction differed in comparison to <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> macular pucker alone, suggesting that although each condition may begin with anomalous PVD, differences in subsequent cell migration and proliferation probably result in the different clinical appearances detected in this study.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Decreased {{perfusion}} or increased vascular {{resistance of}} the choroidal vessels had been proposed as the vascular pathogenesis for age related macular degeneration (AMD). This study planned {{to answer the question}} whether pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) was different in patients with asymmetric exudative AMD between <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> drusen, choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), or disciform scar.  METHODS— 37 patients with asymmetric exudative AMD were enrolled in this observational case series study. POBF were measured in both eyes of each subject. <b>Eyes</b> <b>with</b> high myopia, anisometropia, recent laser treatment, and glaucoma were excluded.  RESULTS—After adjusting for ocular perfusion pressure, intraocular pressure, and pulse rate, multivariate regression analysis with generalised estimating equation showed POBF was significantly higher in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> CNV (1217  (SD 476) µl/min) than the contralateral <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> drusen (1028  (385) µl/min) (p =  0. 024). <b>Eyes</b> <b>with</b> disciform scar had lower POBF than the contralateral <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> drusen (999  (262) µl/min and 1278  (341) µl/min, respectively, p< 0. 001). There was no significant correlation between the POBF and the lesion size of the CNV.  CONCLUSION—The POBF in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> drusen was lower than their fellow <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> CNV, but higher than their fellow <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> disciform scar. This finding suggests that haemodynamic differences between fellow eyes in individuals are relevant to the development of CNV and the formation of disciform scar.

The central pressure was presumed to be 978 hPa (28.88 inHg). Interacting with Sicily, the cyclone turned northeastwards and started to make an anticlockwise loop. On 8 November, Qendresa crossed Syracuse {{in the morning and}} then significantly weakened. Turning southeastwards then moving eastwards, Qendressa moved over Crete, before dissipating over the island on November 11.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on {{examination of}} the <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E
5|$|Prescott {{enrolled}} at Harvard College {{as a second}} year student (sophomore) in August 1811, {{at the age of}} 15. He was not considered academically distinguished, despite showing promise in Latin and Greek. Prescott found mathematics particularly difficult, and resorted to memorizing mathematical demonstrations word-for-word, which he could do with relative ease, in order to hide his ignorance of the subject. Prescott's eyesight degenerated after being hit in the <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> a crust of bread during a food fight as a student, and it remained weak and unstable throughout the rest of his life. Prescott was admitted to the Phi Beta Kappa Society as a senior, which he considered a great personal honor, and graduated from Harvard in 1814. After a short period of rheumatic illness, he embarked on an extended tour of Europe.|$|E

40|$|AIMS—To {{determine}} whether quantitative differences in sector based slope can differentiate between <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> ocular hypertension {{with and without}} glaucomatous disc changes and <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> normal tension glaucoma with glaucomatous disc changes.  METHODS—Seventy six <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> ocular hypertension or early glaucomatous disc changes were consecutively categorised into three groups: 22  eyes with ocular hypertension and no glaucomatous disc changes (OHND); 35  with ocular hypertension and glaucomatous disc changes (OHD); and 19  with normal ocular tension and glaucomatous disc changes (NTD). Twenty eyes served as controls. The average total slope angle and sector based slope angle of the cup, total contour area, effective area, neuroretinal rim area, half depth area, cup to disc ratio, contour variation, mean contour depth, average depth, volume below, half depth volume, and contour tilt were evaluated with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope.  RESULTS—The earliest changes in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> OHND or OHD started in the slope at the nasal inferior sector (p< 0. 05), followed by the superior and temporal superior sectors (p< 0. 05). The mean slopes in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> NTD and OHD were steeper than in controls (p< 0. 05). Statistically {{significant differences were found}} between controls and disease groups in the half depth area, mean contour depth, and half depth volume. The cup to disc ratios in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> OHD and NTD were greater than in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> OHND; the volume below was greater in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> NTD than in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> OHND and OHD.  CONCLUSIONS—The steep slope in the nasal inferior section is the first indicator of glaucomatous nerve defects in many eyes. The half depth parameters, half depth area, and half depth volume may be useful for distinguishing ocular hypertension with and without glaucomatous disc changes. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Eyes with epiretinal {{membranes}} (ERMs) {{often have}} alterations of retinal vessels. The authors studied perifoveal microcirculation in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> epiretinal membranes (ERMs) using scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) fluorescein angiography.  METHODS—Mean capillary blood flow velocity (CFV) was measured as {{an index of}} perifoveal microcirculation by SLO fluorescein angiography in 26  eyes with ERMs (19  eyes with idiopathic epiretinal membranes, seven <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> epiretinal membranes after retinal detachment surgery) before and 6  months after vitreous surgery, and in 23  healthy control subjects.  RESULTS—The mean CFV was significantly reduced in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> ERMs compared with healthy controls (p= 0. 012), and the postoperative mean CFV was significantly increased compared with the preoperative mean CFV (p= 0. 041).  CONCLUSION—Significant changes of capillary blood flow velocity in the perifoveal areas were observed between normal subjects and <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> epiretinal membranes. This indicates that <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> ERMs show abnormal haemodynamics in the perifoveal capillaries. ...|$|R
