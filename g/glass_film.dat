40|$|In this work, {{metallic}} <b>glass</b> <b>films</b> (Zr-Cu-Al-Ni) {{were successfully}} deposited and patterned by sputter and {{reactive ion etching}} (RIE) technologies for widening micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) field. The amorphous structure of the deposited Zr-based alloy films were confirmed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The home-made RIE equipment was used to dry etch the metallic <b>glass</b> <b>films</b> for patterning. This technique removes the atoms by ion bombardment. The different gases were selected during the RIE plasma etching process such as argon (Ar), octafluorocyclobutane (C 4 F 8) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6). Two kind photoresists, AZP 4620 and OFPR 800, were used as the etching masks for transferring the patterns to Zr-based metallic <b>glass</b> thin <b>film.</b> The etching rate and etching selectivity of photoresist and metallic glass were tested in different photoresist hard-baking conditions and different etching RF power. Besides, the condition of employing different working gases during RIE etching process was carried out and studied in this work. As a result, the metallic <b>glass</b> Zr-Cu-Al-Ni <b>films</b> were successfully structured with 20 nm/min etching rate and 1 : 3. 2 (metallic glass: photoresist) etching selectivity by using a mixture of Ar and C 4 F 8 gases.

40|$|One {{contributing}} {{factor in the}} nonattainment of proper boron concentrations i borophosphosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>films</b> is the variability of the diborane concentration in gas mixtures used in the process. We describe an analytical procedure that allows the monitoring of small changes in diborane concentrations utilizing a internal reference standard in the gas mixture. Employing this procedure, the decomposition kinetics of diborane mixtures prepared in steel cylinders with concentrations of less than 10 % was investigated. The rate law for the decomposition of diborane in these mixtures follows the rate law observed for pure diborane d (B 2 Hs) _ k (B 2 Hs) ~ 5 dt where k at 20 ~ was 1. 0 • 10 - 3 mole-~/ 2 1 u 2 day- 1.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} included the toxicity, fecundity, residual effect, biochemical effects and quantitative recovery of pesticides by HPLC. The two selective neem compounds viz. NFC and NC and an insect growth regulator dimilin were used against adults of pulse beetle Callosobruchus analis. For all the experiments conducted, the two laboratory methods were used i. e., filter paper impregnation and <b>glass</b> <b>film</b> method. The LD 50 of NFC, NC and dimilin were calculated as 39. 28 ug/cm 2, 7, 16 ug/cm 2 and 13. 0 ug/cm 2 respectively by <b>glass</b> <b>film</b> paper impregnation whereas 10. 0 uh/cm 2 and 3. 2 ug/cm 2 for NC and dimilin by <b>glass</b> <b>film</b> method. No toxicity of NFC was recorded by <b>glass</b> <b>film</b> method. On {{the basis of}} the efficiency, the tested compounds could be arranged descendingly as NC>dimilin>NFC by filter paper impregnation and by <b>glass</b> <b>film</b> methods as dimilin>NC. Residual and fecundity observations of dimilin, NC and NFC were found to be slightly varied when all the compounds are compared Biochemical analysis were made on total protein content, percent activity of acid and alkaline phosphates, total esterase acetylcholinesterase, transaminases (GOT and GPT) and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA). It was found that NFC, NC and dimilin inhibited the total protein content, acid and alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase, total esterase and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA).

In congruence with this vision, this contribution aims to introduce a reliable technological recipe for coating fairly complex 3 D-shaped implants (e. g. dental screws) with uniform and mechanical resistant bioactive <b>glass</b> <b>films</b> by the radio-frequency magnetron sputtering method. The mechanical reliability of the bioactive <b>glass</b> <b>films</b> applied to real Ti dental implant fixtures has been evaluated by a procedure comprised of c̈oldïmplantation in pig mandibular bone from a dead animal, followed by immediate tension-free extraction tests. The effects of the complex mechanical strains occurring during implantation were analysed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron dispersive spectroscopy. Extensive biocompatibility assays (MTS, immunofluorescence, Western blot) revealed that the bioactive <b>glass</b> <b>films</b> stimulated strong cellular adhesion and proliferation of human dental pulp stem cells, without promoting their differentiation. The ability of the implant coatings to conserve a healthy stem cell pool is promising to further endorse the fabrication of new osseointegration implant designs with extended lifetime.
