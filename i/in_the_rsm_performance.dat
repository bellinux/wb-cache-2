The results stress the high level of efficiency attained by the new model checking algorithms implemented in our tool SMART, and demonstrate their applicability to real-world systems. Attempts to verify RSM with NuSMV and SPIN have failed due to excessive memory consumption...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- In {{presented}} paper {{a design}} model is developed {{which is used}} to find an optimal design space in order to improve precision and accuracy of reversed 3 D models. Significant parameters and their mutual effects in scanning process are recognized with the help of Design of Experiments (DOE) principles, and in second step recognized significant parameters are also optimized using <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> (Response Surface Methodology). Back propagated neural network is used for prediction of response factors whose input variables are not possible to set during experimentation {{due to the nature of}} the scan device. With neural network (NN) predicted response-design data, the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was performed. On a basis of significant parameters the analytical model is established, which enables prediction and optimization of critical scan parameters, according to the prescribed standard deviation (abberation) of analysed 3 D CAD models. After getting knowledge about the relationships between significant parameters it is possible to predict and optimize them using a model established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> on a basis of D-optimal Design of Experiment test (DOE). At the end also the precision assessment of predicted response factors by DOE approach and by neural network approach is done and results are beeing compared.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{reliability}} of a novel multi-direction repeated sprint ability (RSA) test [RSM; 10 × (6 × 5 -m) ] compared with a RSA with one change of direction [10 × (2 × 15 -m) ], and the relationship of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> and RSA with Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR 1) and jump performances [squat jump (SJ) and counter-movement-jump (CMJ) ]. Thirty-six (male, n = 14, female n = 22) young basketball players (age 16. 0 ± 0. 9 yrs) performed <b>the</b> <b>RSM,</b> RSA, Yo-Yo IR 1, SJ, and CMJ, and were re-tested only for RSM and RSA after 1 week. The absolute error of reliability (standard error of the measurement) was lower than 0. 212 and 0. 617 -s for the time variables of <b>the</b> RSA and <b>RSM</b> test, respectively. <b>Performance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RSA and <b>RSM</b> test significantly correlated with CMJ and SJ. The best time, worst time, and total time of <b>the</b> RSA and <b>RSM</b> test were negatively correlated with Yo-Yo IR 1 distance. Based on these findings, consistent with previously published studies, it was concluded that <b>the</b> novel <b>RSM</b> test was valid and reliable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} results of plate load tests that imposed incremental cyclic loading to a sandy soil bed containing multiple layers of granulated rubber-soil mixture (RSM) at large model scale. Loading and unloading cycles were applied with amplitudes incrementally increasing from 140 to 700 kPa in five steps. A thickness of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> layer of approximately 0. 4 times the footing diameter was found to deliver the minimum total and residual settlements, irrespective {{of the level of}} applied cyclic load. Both the total and residual settlements decrease with increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of <b>RSM</b> layers, regardless of the level of applied cyclic load, but the rate of reduction in both settlements reduces with increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of <b>RSM</b> layers. When <b>the</b> thickness of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> layer is smaller, or larger, settlements increase and, at large thicknesses may even exceed those of untreated soil. Layers of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> reduced <b>the</b> vertical stress transferred through the foundation depth by distributing the load over a wider area. With <b>the</b> inclusion of <b>RSM</b> layers, <b>the</b> coefficient of elastic uniform compression decreases by a factor of around 3 - 4. A softer response was obtained when more RSM layers were included beneath the footing damping capacity improves appreciably when the sand bed incorporates RSM layers. Numerical modeling using “FLAC- 3 D” confirms that multiple RSM layers will improve the performance of a foundation under heavy loading...|$|R
