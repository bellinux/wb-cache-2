However, the recent discovery of new tubulins, such as �-, �-, or �-tubulin, could constitute a breakthrough for deciphering the assembly steps of this unconventional microtubule scaffold. Here, we report the functional analysis in vivo of �-tubulin, based on gene silencing in Paramecium, which demonstrates that this protein, which localizes at the basal bodies, {{is essential for the}} assembly and anchorage of the centriolar microtubules...|$|R

He was <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E

He has mentioned American playwrights Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams as influences on the show's writing, and Italian director Federico Fellini as an important influence on the show's cinematic style.|$|E

Most Ibsen men and women have lived their lives before the curtain rises. Shakespeare has often been pronounced tedious by actors because his characters require a great deal of study. But even Shakespeare seems easy when compared with the thought that must be bestowed upon Ibsen. The beautiful verse, the wonderful character drawing of Shakespeare furnish solutions of perplexing problems, but Ibsen is so elusive. He <b>fascinates</b> <b>by</b> his aloofness. He is the Wagner of the drama. Wagner struggled for understanding just as Ibsen has struggled." ...|$|R

25|$|Head's final {{study was}} one of {{degeneration}}, a project {{made all the more}} poignant and <b>fascinating</b> <b>by</b> the fact it was, in part, his own degeneration that he was to be studying. As Parkinson's Disease worked away at his own faculties of speech he combined his knowledge of neurology with his intensive war studies on defects of speech produced by brain injuries to produce two large volumes under the title Aphasia and Kindred Disorders of Speech (1926). These volumes were devoted not only to the clinical or symptomatic aspects of disturbances of speech, but were also an attempt to investigate the psychical processes concerned therein, and the physiological integrations necessary for the comprehension and expression of ideas as language.|$|R
