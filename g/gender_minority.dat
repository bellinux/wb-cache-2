2500|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} indicates that exposure to distal stressors leads to proximal stressors in sexual minority populations. While sexual minority stress and <b>gender</b> <b>minority</b> stress both use Meyer's Minority Stress Model as a framework, and share some characteristics with <b>gender</b> <b>minority</b> stress, some researchers have suggested that sexual minority stress is distinct from the minority stress experienced by transgender, gender non-conforming, and gender non-binary individuals. [...] For example, LGB youth and adults who have experienced prejudice about their sexual orientation sometimes choose to conceal their sexual identity from others. Concealing such personal information causes significant psychological distress, including intrusive thoughts about the secret, shame and guilt, anxiety, and isolation from other members of the minority group. Internalized homophobia is another proximal stressor prevalent among LGBT individuals. [...] It refers to the internalization of negative social views about homosexuality, which leads to self-hatred and poor self-regard. As predicted by minority stress theory, internalized homophobia is associated with exposure to distal stressors, insofar as it only occurs because LGB individuals are exposed to negative societal attitudes toward same-sex attraction. Rejection sensitivity represents a third proximal stress among sexual minority individuals. [...] Rejection sensitivity refers to chronic, anxious expectations of rejection based on one's stigmatized status. [...] Among sexual minority individuals, rejection sensitivity emerges from experiences of rejection from parents and is associated with internalized homophobia, unassertiveness, depression, and anxiety. [...] Thus, previous experiences with prejudice are associated with proximal stress among LGB individuals, including concealment of their sexual identity, internalized homophobia, and rejection sensitivity.|$|E

Breaking was documented in Style Wars, and was later given more focus in fictional films such as Wild Style and Beat Street. Early acts include the Rock Steady Crew and New York City Breakers.|$|E

We briefly discuss how each discipline has attended to sexual and <b>gender</b> <b>minorities</b> to date, and suggest ways in which each discipline can enrich the other through collaborative scholarship on sexual and <b>gender</b> <b>minorities</b> in disaster. Importantly, we draw attention to critical limitations and occlusions concerning sexual and <b>gender</b> <b>minorities</b> in disaster risk reduction (DRR) policy and practice. Redressing these gaps in DRR globally should be a critical focus for future collaborative and applied research on sexual and <b>gender</b> <b>minorities</b> in disaster...|$|R

Drawing from 25 interviews with transgender and gender nonconforming individuals in Portland, Oregon, this article finds that <b>gender</b> <b>minorities</b> experience frequent harassment while engaging with the public transit system. We articulate the concept of transmobilites to describe the ways that transgender and gender nonconforming individuals experience a form of mobility that is altered, shaped, and informed by a broader cultural system that normalizes violence and harassment towards <b>gender</b> <b>minorities.</b> We conclude that <b>gender</b> <b>minorities</b> have unequal access to safe and accessible public transportation when harassment is widespread, normalized, and when policies prohibiting discrimination remain unenforced on urban public transit...|$|R
