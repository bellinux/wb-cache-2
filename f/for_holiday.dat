5|$|The {{spring of}} 1912 was emotionally unsettling for Potter; {{her father was}} ill and severe strikes across the country caused hardships. In April 1912, she managed {{to get away from}} London for Hill Top to execute {{background}} drawings for the tale. By July, most of the colour blocks were finished, but Potter was concerned about the anatomy of the fox, and checked photographs and reference books in the Natural History Museum in an attempt to distinguish the true English red fox (Vulpes vulpes) from other species. The book was finished by the end of July when she left <b>for</b> <b>holiday</b> at Lake Windemere. Completion of the tale had taken longer than usual because her time had been shared with participation in a campaign opposing hydroplanes on Lake Windemere and the proposed construction of an aeroplane factory near the lake.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, British Airways, Iberia, and Icelandair {{were the}} 757's largest {{mainline}} customers, while other carriers such as Lufthansa rejected the type as {{too large for}} their narrow-body aircraft needs. Many European charter airlines, including Air 2000, Air Holland, and LTU International, also acquired the twinjet <b>for</b> <b>holiday</b> and tour package flights in the late 1980s. In Asia, where even larger aircraft were commonly preferred because of greater passenger volumes, the 757 found fewer orders. A 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer Japan Airlines, and the first Asian customer, Singapore Airlines, sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of standardizing on the 240-seat wide-body Airbus A310, just five years after debuting the type on Indonesian and Malaysian routes. The 757 fared better in China, where following an initial purchase by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in 1987, orders grew to 59 aircraft, making it the largest Asian market. Operators such as China Southern, China Southwest, Shanghai Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, and Xinjiang Airlines used the 757 on medium length domestic routes.|$|E

25|$|Travel by car in {{the city}} is often {{difficult}} with regular jams centred on the Exe Bridges area. Historically, the bridges were a significant bottleneck <b>for</b> <b>holiday</b> traffic heading to southwest England, leading {{to the construction of}} the first bypass in the mid-1930s over Countess Wear Bridge, followed by the M5 in 1977. To further address the problem of congestion in the city centre, Devon County Council has current park and ride services and is considering the introduction of congestion charges.|$|E

25|$|For years, {{the overall}} {{scarcity}} of oranges in particular {{led to the}} general perception that they were suitable only <b>for</b> <b>holiday</b> table decoration or as indulgences for the affluent.

Substantial foreign (out-of-state) markets for California citrus would come into full stature by 1890, initiating a period referred to as the Orange Era.|$|E
25|$|The current {{building}} has also suffered over its history with poor construction requiring constant repair {{as well as}} the need for upgrades to modern infrastructure and technical standards. The courthouse underwent major renovations in the 1950s, many of which disrespected the building's original architectural design, and again in this century with THC funding that further modernized the structure while rectifying many of the previous renovation's design deficiencies bringing the building closer to its original glory. The courthouse grounds are planted mostly with native species, and continues to serve as a focal point <b>for</b> <b>holiday</b> celebrations and community observations.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{cultural}} and social differences between local communities, lindy hoppers have much in common. They not only share specific dance forms, but also dance cultures. There is great enthusiasm for social dancing in most lindy hop communities (with of course allowance for regional variation), and lindy hoppers are often keen travellers. The lindy exchange culture which developed in the United States and Canada, coupled with a European enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>holiday</b> camps has seen the development of many large events held throughout the world, which not only attract local dancers but also visitors from other communities. There is a strong culture of hospitality in lindy hop culture today.|$|E
25|$|The station serving Thorverton village {{opened with}} the railway in 1885. Two {{platforms}} were provided {{as it was}} a passing place. The main buildings and goods yard were on the southbound side, while a wooden shelter was provided on the opposite platform for passengers travelling towards Tiverton. The station master had a house {{to the north of the}} station. The village was not on a main road and had no bus service with the result that the station was one of the best-used on the line and also generated a lot of freight due to nearby Thorverton Mill, a watermill that was connected to the station by a siding. Camp coaches were based here from 1936 to 1939 which provided accommodation <b>for</b> <b>holiday</b> visitors.|$|E

In the next game against rival Michigan, the Wolverines avenged their 2002 loss by beating the Irish by a score of 38–0 in the first shutout in the series in 100years and the largest margin of victory ever between the two teams. After another loss to Michigan State, many Irish fans were calling <b>for</b> <b>Holiday</b> to be taken out of the game in favor of freshman Brady Quinn, who saw his first collegiate action in the fourth quarter of the Michigan rout.
