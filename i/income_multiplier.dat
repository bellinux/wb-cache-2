40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the paucity of financial intermediates in developing countries and the alternatives to formal financial institutions as a source of funds. Low income besets developing countries and disparate financial practices affect saving, consumption, and the <b>income</b> <b>multiplier.</b> Informal and formal “financial intermediaries ” are a means for allocating funds with and without the use of interest payments. Informal systems consist of interest and non-interest generating practices. Examples of informal systems are the Esusu in West Africa and the Iddir in Ethiopia in which interest does not play a role. An example of a formal system is Islamic banking in which interest is eschewed. By contrast, Western banking practices depend strongly on the intervention of interest as an allocative mechanism between savers and dissavers or present consumers. In the paper it is shown that under Islamic banking rules, saving is lower than consumption and the <b>income</b> <b>multiplier</b> is higher. In presence of Islamic banking, disposable income is siphoned off as transfers to God and to the poor. Thus, Islamic saving practices tend to exacerbate the gap between saving and investment, while encouraging higher levels of consumption. The paper implies that, under very restrictive assumptions, transfers of income from the West to Islamic countries in Africa would increase income by more than it would reduce it. That would be the case since the <b>income</b> <b>multiplier</b> in Western banking countries is lower than the <b>income</b> <b>multiplier</b> of Islamic banking countries...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically show the {{relative}} importance of the agricultural sector in the productive framework of Mato Grosso State (Brazil) using an inter-regional input-output model for two regions: Mato Grosso and the rest of Brazil for 1999. The idea was to identify the most important sectors of the economies in question, their connections and the propagation of impacts between regions, besides verifying the impact on the Mato Grosso soybean exports on the total production of other activities. The hypothesis on the importance of the primary sectors for the state economy has been confirmed, and some agricultural sectors and others directly linked to them have been found to be key-sectors, or centres of economic growth in the region under study. Special mention should be given to soybean cultivation in Mato Grosso state, which shows a high employment and <b>income</b> <b>multiplying</b> effect on the economy, as well as being a centre of economic growth and major exporter, attracting exchange gains to the country and positively impacting the production of other sectors.

25|$|To {{calculate}} the total benefits a retiree is eligible for, the average indexed monthly salary (AIME) is then {{divided into three}} separate salary brackets—each multiplied by a different benefit percentage. The benefits receivable (the so-called Primary Insurance Amount, PIA) are {{the sum of the}} salary in each bracket times the benefit percentages that apply to each bracket. The benefit percentages are set by Congress and so can easily change in the future. The bendpoints, where the brackets change, are adjusted for inflation each year by Social Security. For example, in 2013 the first bracket runs from $1 to $791/month and is multiplied by the benefit percentage of 90%, the second salary bracket extends from $791 to $4,781/month is multiplied by 32%, the third salary bracket of more than $4,781/month is multiplied by 15%. Any higher incomes than the ceiling income are not FICA covered and are not considered in the benefits calculation or in determining the average indexed monthly salary, AIME. At full retirement age the projected retirement income amount (PIA) is the sum of these three brackets of <b>income</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the appropriate benefit percentages—90%, 32% and 15%. Unlike income tax brackets, the Social Security benefits are heavily biased towards lower salaried workers.

The {{existing}} literature has not presented a synthetic {{view on the}} evolution of inequalities in physical development across childhood. We examine social disparities as children grow older using a range of different outcomes. Study design. Population-based secondary data analysis. Methods. We employ longitudinal data on British children ages 9 months to 12 years from the Millennium Cohort Study (N= 13, 811 - 18, 987) and focus on multiple child physical measures: weight, BMI, overweight, fat mass, and waist circumference. Results. Higher family income is associated with lower BMI (for females), less body fat, and a smaller likelihood of overweight (for both genders) on average throughout childhood. When <b>income</b> is <b>multiplied</b> by three, the probability of overweight decreases by 2. 8 (95 % CI - 0. 041 to - 0. 016) percentage points for females and by 2. 7 (95 % CI - 0. 038 to - 0. 016) percentage points for males. Social inequalities in weight, BMI, overweight, and body fat significantly widen as children grow older, for both genders.
