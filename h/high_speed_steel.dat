5|$|To inhibit corrosion, {{at least}} 11% {{chromium}} {{is added to}} steel so that a hard oxide forms on the metal surface; {{this is known as}} stainless steel.

40|$|Wear, {{fatigue and}} {{corrosion}} {{are the most}} widely encountered failure modes of materials used in engineering applications, including aero-gas turbines. Although wear is distinctly classified as adhesive, abrasive, erosive, fretting and so on, there are usually more than one wear mechanisms which contribute towards the failure of components in service. This {{is due to the}} fact that there are large numbers of system and materials variables active during the course of materials wear which make the study of materials wear more difficult. This is further complicated by the discrepancies between the laboratory tests and field data. The present investigation was set up to examine wear characteristics of M 50 and T 1 <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>steels</b> at both room and elevated temperatures to draw a thorough understanding of wear behavior of this class of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>steels.</b> This article is concentrated on the mechanical and microstructural characterization of wear for T 1 and M 50 <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>steels</b> using pin-on-disk wear machine.

40|$|This is {{a report}} on {{grinding}} action of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>steels</b> in constant feeding load, that is, free infeed plunge-cut grinding. A grinding wheel is WA 46 G 6 V and the used <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>steels</b> are SKH 4 (18 - 4 - 1 - 10) and HV 5. The latter {{is said to be}} improved in the resistance of tool wear behaviour by adding high vanadium and high carbon. The relations between grinding ratio, grinding force and grinding time are obtained. The wheel wear in grinding is observed by a micro-scope also. The conclusions are as follows. 1. Though a small difference in grinding force between SKH 4 and HV 5 is observed, SKH 4 differs remarkably from HV 5 in grinding ratio. The grinding ratio of SKH 4 is far better than HV 5 in both this value and in a tendency of G-t curves. 2. The poor grinding raio of HV 5 will make it difficult to apply it to multiple teeth cutter in the grinding accuracy. SKH 4 is more preferable than HV 5. 3. The wear, fracture and breakdown of a grinding wheel grains progress rapidly in case of high load. 4. The free infeed plunge-cut grinding process is seemed to be severer in view of the poor grinding ratio than the conventional grinding method of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R

50|$|For {{several decades}} now, hacksaw blades have used <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> for their teeth, giving greatly {{improved}} cutting and tooth life.

This limited their practical use to benchwork on a workpiece that was firmly clamped in a vice. A softer form of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> blade was also available, which wore well and resisted breakage, but was less stiff and so less accurate for precise sawing. Since the 1980s, bi-metal blades {{have been used to}} give the advantages of both forms, without risk of breakage.
