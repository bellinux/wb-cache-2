The development of sophisticated <b>dialogue</b> <b>managers</b> using Reinforcement Learning requires a simulation domain before any human evaluation, and we describe the Negotiative Slot-Filling domain.

40|$|This work {{shows how}} a {{dialogue}} {{model can be}} represented as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with observations composed of a discrete and continuous component.

Further, we present a method for automatically improving handcrafted <b>dialogue</b> <b>managers</b> by incorporating POMDP belief state monitoring, including confidence score information. Experiments on the testbed system show significant improvements for several example handcrafted <b>dialogue</b> <b>managers</b> across a range of operating conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to developing a tractable affective dialogue model for general probabilistic frame-based dialogue systems. The dialogue model, based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and the Dynamic Decision Network (DDN) techniques, is composed of two main parts, the slot level <b>dialogue</b> <b>manager</b> and the global <b>dialogue</b> <b>manager.</b> It has two new features: (1) being able to deal with a large number of slots and (2) being able to take into account some aspects of the user's affective state in deriving the adaptive dialogue strategies.

40|$|Recent work in {{the area}} of {{probabilistic}} user simulation for training statistical <b>dialogue</b> <b>managers</b> has investigated a new agenda-based user model and presented preliminary experiments with a handcrafted model parameter set. Training the model on dialogue data is an important next step, but non-trivial since the user agenda states are not observable in data and the space of possible states and state transitions is intractably large. This paper presents a summary-space mapping which greatly reduces the number of state transitions and introduces a tree-based method for representing the space of possible agenda state sequences. Treating the user agenda as a hidden variable, the forward/backward algorithm can then be successfully applied to iteratively estimate the model parameters on dialogue data. ...|$|R

Over the last few years, research in human-computer dialogue systems has increased and much attention has focused on applying learning methods to improving a key part of any dialogue system, namely the <b>dialogue</b> <b>manager.</b> Since the <b>dialogue</b> <b>manager</b> in all dialogue systems relies heavily {{on the quality of the}} semantic interpretation of the user’s utterance, our research in the Companions project, focuses on how to improve the semantic interpretation and combine it with knowledge from the Knowledge Base to increase the performance of the <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Manager.</b> Traditionally the semantic interpretation of a user utterance is handled by a natural language understanding module which embodies a variety of natural language processing techniques, from sentence splitting, to full parsing.

This is due, in part, to the communicative efficiencies provided by the shared visual context. However, a large gap exists between our current theoretical understanding and our existing models.

40|$|Abstract—Statistical {{dialogue}} {{systems are}} motivated by {{the need for a}} data-driven framework that reduces the cost of laboriously hand-crafting complex <b>dialogue</b> <b>managers</b> and that provides robustness against the errors created by speech recog-nisers operating in noisy environments. By including an explicit Bayesian model of uncertainty and by optimising the policy via a reward-driven process, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide such a framework. However, ex-act model representation and optimisation is computationally intractable. Hence, the practical application of POMDP-based systems requires efficient algorithms and carefully constructed approximations.
