5|$|K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil was {{installed}} as the 14th dynastic ruler of Copán on 7June 738, 39days after {{the execution of}} Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. Little is known of his reign {{due to the lack}} of monuments raised after Quiriguá's surprise victory. Copán's defeat had wider implications due to the fracturing of the city's domain and the loss of the key Motagua River trade route to Quiriguá. The fall in Copán's income and corresponding increase at Quiriguá <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> massive commissioning of new monuments and architecture at the latter city, and Copán may even have been subject to its former vassal. K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil died in January749.|$|E
5|$|The Chola dynasty in Tamil Nadu was {{particularly}} favourable to {{the beliefs of}} Shaiva sect. It is said that the sectarian aspect got highlighted during their reign. This <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> four Sharabha images, the earliest at the Vikramsolishwaram temple near Kumbakonam built by Vikrama Chola (1118–35). The other images are at Darasuram and Kampahareshvarar temple, Thirubuvanam built by a Chola ruler, Kulottunga Chola III where Sharabha's image is housed in a separate shrine.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} {{nature of}} the Mycenaean Greeks <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> numerous weapons unearthed, the use of warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, and the preserved Greek Linear B records. The Mycenaeans invested {{in the development of}} military infrastructure, with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centers. According to the Linear B records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army. Similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Jainism {{became popular}} in the dynasty in the 8th century when the ruler King Shivamara I {{constructed}} numerous Jain basadis. King Butuga II and minister Chavundaraya were staunch Jains which <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> construction of the Gommateshwara monolith. Jains worshipped the twenty four tirthankars (Jinas) whose images were consecrated in their temples. The worship of the footprint of spiritual leaders {{such as those of}} Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola from the 10th century is considered a parallel to Buddhism. Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of Bahubali, the son of Tirthankar Adinatha (just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva). The worship of subordinate deities such as yaksa and yaksi, earlier considered as mere attendants of the tirthankars was seen from the 7th century to the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|According to Morgan, {{the town}} hall was {{designed}} for multiple uses and this <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plans and {{the exterior of the}} building. The largest section, the center section, serves as the government function and has municipal offices on the first floor. A stairwell to the right leads to the second floor, which functions as a town meeting room. A secondary entrance on the western facade accesses the northern section of the building, previously a library. The southern section of the building was previously a high school with separate entrances for boys and girls. The second floor of the southern section was used by the Antiquarian Society for meetings and its collections. In 1917, the original library was moved to the southern section following the completion of the Leander R. Peck School. Two additions to {{the town hall}} were made to expand the library. The two additions consisted of two parallel gable units that matched the original material and form of the town hall, the first addition was made in 1938 by Howe & Church and the second in 1963 by Michael Traficante.|$|E

25|$|Paripaadal is a metre full {{of rhythm}} {{and music and}} the {{anthology}} known by this name consists of songs composed in this metre. There are religious poems {{as well as those}} on love-themes. The love-theme is worked against the background of bathing festivities. These songs were sung in different tunes as <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> notes on the music at the end of these. The names of the musicians who set tunes to these songs are also mentioned therein.|$|E
25|$|The Cholas {{are also}} known as the Choda. There is very little {{information}} available in regarding their origin. Its antiquity <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mentions in ancient Tamil literature and in inscriptions. Later medieval Cholas also claimed a long and ancient lineage. Mentions in the early Sangam literature (c. 150 CE) indicate that the earliest kings of the dynasty antedated 100 CE. Cholas were mentioned in Ashokan Edicts of 3rd Century BCE as one of the neighboring countries existing in the South.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the manuscripts {{from the}} Umayyad Dynasty, {{many of the}} early Abbasid manuscripts were copied {{in a number of}} volumes.

50|$|Although {{writings}} by Indonesian exiles, including Tan Malaka, Sukarno, Sutan Sjahrir, and Mohammad Hatta, <b>were</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1920s, {{the most}} commonly studied form of Indonesian exile literature is of that which resulted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 30 September Movement coup and its aftermath. Literary tensions between leftist {{groups such as the}} Institute of People's Culture (Lekra) and humanist writers <b>were</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1950s; in 1963, the humanists signed the Cultural Manifesto, which sparked great outcry among Lekra and its supporters and led many humanists to emigrate to foreign countries.|$|R

25|$|With some modifications, {{the story}} is {{repeated}} by Constantine VII in De Administrando Imperio, followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including John Skylitzes and Joannes Zonaras. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Orthodox sees, compiled during the reigns of Leo the Wise and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.|$|E
25|$|The Wallowa Batholith {{is formed}} of granite from a magma {{upwelling}} in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous time (between 160million and 120million years ago). The placement of this rock caused uplift of the surface, {{which at the}} time was tropical sea. This <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> slate, quartzite, and marble present in the mountains, which come from metamorphism of the sedimentary deposits of oceans during the Triassic. At the center of the Batholith are granodioritic rocks, while the outer limits of the range are tonalitic. The granite batholith is cut by dikes; however, these are uncommon.|$|E

His wealth must have been prodigious, for in addition to his town mansion on the Caelian Hill, and several houses in the city which he lent to his friends, he possessed upwards of a dozen villas in Italy, many detached farms, together with estates in Sicily and Mauritania.|$|E
