40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between credit risk and securitisation in the South African banking sector. Panel data {{analysis was used to}} analyse the annual observations from four major South African banks for a sample period from 2005 to 2014. Results indicate that the basis <b>for</b> <b>securitisation</b> variation in South African banks stems from capital, bank size and the economic growth of the country. A positive impact of securitisation on credit risk was discovered. The paper revealed that, contrary to previous findings, the global financial crisis of 2007 – 2009 had no effect on the securitisation in the South African banking sector. This paper also found that size has a significant influence on capitalisation. Compared to small banks, large banks tend to securitise more and take on further credit risk. Therefore, banks should increase or maintain an acceptable capital amount to hedge against any unexpected risks. Proper systems should be established and adopted to encourage repayment of loans by borrowers...|$|E
40|$|Securitisation {{has been}} the method of choice for non-realist {{international}} relations theorists, especially those seeking to understand state responses to terrorism. It has proved effective in discerning various types of actors {{and the manner in}} which they respond, legitimise and confer legitimacy on anti-terrorist activity. Securitisation, however, has been unable to address two crucial aspects of the legitimising process. First, it has been unable to negotiate with the fact that in most states (even liberal democratic ones) ‘emergency ’ legislation is written into the normal legal structure, hence removing the requirement <b>for</b> <b>securitisation.</b> Second, and following from the first, securitisation actually occurs in many cases without the direct reference to existential threats. Using the Indian state’s responses to the Naxalite and Khalistan movements, this article argues for a re-evaluation of the nature of the state and security, if securitisation is to maintain its conceptual coherence and operationalisability.

40|$|Securitisation {{theory has}} contributed greatly to {{critical}} security studies. However, the Copenhagen School’s focus on discursive analysis fails {{to answer the}} “so what” question of why issues are securitised and for whose benefit. This article contends that more nuanced explanations can be provided by taking seriously the political economy context within which the process of securitisation is embedded. The article has two aims. First, it contributes to further refining securitisation theory by embedding Balzacq’s pragmatic act – which implies that securitising actors gain the assent of an audience based on a shared view of vulnerabilities – within a broad social conflict analysis. This latter can explain the socio-political struggles that create popular support <b>for</b> <b>securitisation,</b> and what social groups benefit from it. Second, it contributes to explanations of Bali’s contemporary political economy by operationalising the refined approach to explain how struggles over the spoils of tourism have created a receptive audience among a cross-class section of Balinese for the securitisation of “outside influences” – a euphemism for migrants, non-local investors and Western cultural influences. Securitisation has resulted in conservative elite groups marginalising progressive voices; “traditional” institutions being favoured in accessing state resources; and in a policing landscape in which migrants are harassed and exploited...|$|E

40|$|Alternative {{financing}} {{of small and}} medium-sized enterprises This thesis analyses whether the legal framework, both present and envisaged, regulating securitisation and crowdfunding is likely to improve the access of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} to financing. The first chapter focuses on securitisation, with a particular focus on securitisation of SME loans. In doing so it evaluates the costs and benefits associated with securitisation, as well as securitised assets and the products of securitisation. The following part describes the mechanism of both a true sale and a synthetic securitisation. The key part of the chapter, however, deals with the legal framework regulating securitisation as well as each individual step of a securitisation transaction, and analyses several issues that may arise under Czech law in relation to securitisation. Next, the proposal <b>for</b> the <b>securitisation</b> regulation, which proposes criteria <b>for</b> qualified <b>securitisations,</b> is introduced. This chapter concludes with an evaluation of the said proposal and presents a level of scepticism as to its intended positive impact on SME financing. The second chapter deals with crowdfunding.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} securitisation {{technology as}} a source of capital. Securitisation can be defined as a process of converting cash flows arising from underlying assets due to the originator into a smooth repayment stream, thus enabling the originator to raise asset-backed financing (funds). Deals are normally structured by a transfer of receivables from the originator to a newly established company known as a special purpose vehicle, designed to separate the receivables from the insolvency risk of the originator, and referred to as a “true sale”. In the US, securitisation is stable and mature. In Europe, the securitisation market is growing rapidly, and in Poland it is still at an early stage of development, having to cope with number of obstacles including legal and tax issues that hamper securitisation of all asset classes. The rationale <b>for</b> <b>securitisation</b> varies widely from company to company. One of the most frequently cited reasons for undertaking securitisation is a lower cost of funds, which is possible first of all because of the segregation of receivables from the insolvency risk of the originator. Another objective of securitisation may be the freeing of regulatory capital, balance sheet management, funding diversification, transfer of risk or a strategic profile. Market mechanisms in financial markets increasingly displace administrative solutions of allocating scarce capital. Securitisation facilitates disintermediation in financial markets. The use of asset securitisation is propelling the use of market mechanisms to allocate capital...|$|E
40|$|Threats to {{and from}} ‘the environment’ inform {{geographical}} depictions of danger with widespread reach in political and policy circles. These fears invoke an existential anxiety about collapsing conditions of life – from ‘dangerous climate change’, and species extinctions to fossil fuel depletion and global water shortages. The ‘securitisation’ of socio-environmental processes is at once both a consequence and driver of such concerns, prescribing urgent, even emergency, measures to prevent serious harm. Against this tendency, the papers in this themed section critically interrogate the application of securitising moves {{to a series of}} perceived environmental threats – moves which mark out spaces of safety in terms of ‘climate security’, ‘water security’, ‘food security’ and ‘energy security’. Theoretically, the papers serve as a productive foil to the dominant strand of securitisation theory associated with the so-called Copenhagen School. There has been relatively little interrogation by geographers of this approach, despite its strong spatial assumptions: the Copenhagen School posits state-bounded territoriality as the foremost arena of security dynamics, and advances explanatory claims about the conditions and scope <b>for</b> <b>securitisation</b> of the environment. Two featured papers argue that the Copenhagen School perspective on environmental security misses important spatialities of geopolitical power, while two more explore other modes of securitisation – disciplinary, biopolitical and geo-economic – neglected by this approach. For critical geographers the research challenge is, we argue, to capture the distinctive trajectories of securitisation attached to environmental danger, demonstrating that their effects more often than not foreclose rather than protect human freedom and dignity...|$|E
40|$|Annual {{issuance}} of {{asset backed securities}} reached to $ 3. 650 billion globally {{at the end of}} 2005 and the securitisation activities have taken several forms ranging from traditional securitisation transactions to different types of synthetic structures. Continuous studies for the establishment of international standards and harmonisation of national regulations for accounting and regulatory capital treatment of securitisation transactions, as constituent parts of International Accounting Standards and Basel II, resulted in a very complex and widely accepted framework <b>for</b> <b>securitisation</b> activities. Turkey has also been introduced to securitisation activities with future flow securitisation transactions backed by diversified payment rights, amounting to 4. 3 billion as of June 2006. Preparation of a draft law on housing finance recently, which is establishing the legal and regulatory infrastructure for housing finance and a general securitisation framework has increased the appetite of Turkish banks for traditional ABS transactions. As a result of my analysis and overview of major concepts and developments both in a domestic and international context, some necessary actions have been addressed for a well functioning securitisation market and mitigation of major risks in Turkish banking sector. These actions can be summarised as; the maintenance of tax neutrality and bankruptcy remoteness of the domestic SPV like structures, provision of hedging opportunities through derivative transactions, limiting the level of government intervention, avoiding crowding-out effect of public borrowing requirements, establishment of domestic credit rating agencies and a national rating scale and structuring of some transactions in domestic currency. It is strongly believed that a successful implementation of securitisation together with a well functioning housing finance system will have important contributions to economic development and stability of Turkey...|$|E
40|$|Declines in {{property}} markets {{played a central}} role in the Great Financial Crisis. Off-balance sheet financing activities, particularly securitisations, were used to fund higher volumes of bank lending, concentrated in real estate. In response to the current low appetite <b>for</b> <b>securitisations,</b> the European Union has proposed a new Securitisation Regulation, with the aim of restarting EU securitisation markets. This article explores the possible legal and economic significance of this Regulation and argues that the proposed approach to regulating securitisation is likely to be deficient. Instead of addressing flaws in the securitisation process through improved incentives – which I term ‘process-focused’ regulation – regulation ought to concentrate on the excessive credit-origination which securitisation may facilitate. This is particularly relevant to housing bubbles, which in general are driven by over-optimistic expectations about future house prices, shared amongst lenders, borrowers and investors. Improving incentives in credit-channel widening structured finance when all parties are over-optimistic is unlikely to guard against future bubble formation. This is particularly relevant to the UK market in light of structural reforms to the UK banking sector (so-called “ring-fencing”), which is likely to result in today’s large universal banks being converted into monoline mortgage lenders...|$|R

40|$|Current {{explanations}} <b>for</b> <b>securitisation</b> rely predominantly on empirical {{logistic regression}} models. Quantitative models predicting {{the likelihood of}} securitisation do not consider all {{of the factors that}} influence the securitisation decision. In combination with conflicting extant literature and a lack of industry evidence, the answer to why some firms securitise and others do not is incomplete. This study examines how New Zealand (NZ) non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) make the decision to adopt and use securitisation and how that compares to extant theory. The background theory of capital structure is alone unable to address the research question, therefore a multidisciplinary framework is used to determine what could contribute {{to an understanding of the}} decision to adopt and use securitisation. Four case studies are carried out in NZ NBFIs and the findings are compared to literature from Finance, Decision Research, Psychology, and their related sub-disciplines. This research highlights the usefulness of a multidisciplinary approach to examining corporate finance decisions and the complementary nature of quantitative and qualitative models. Firm and region-specific information improves understanding of the securitisation decision at the micro level in areas previously unexplained by macro level theory. While NZ NBFIs make the decision to adopt and use securitisation in a manner consistent with aspects of securitisation and capital structure literature, this study provides insights into problems surrounding information availability, the importance of information sources and the reliance firms place on such information, decision-making methods utilised, the factors and process involved in selecting securitisation over alternative financing, and why some characteristics of securitisers in NZ differ from what is expected by quantitative securitisation models.

40|$|This thesis proposes {{theoretical}} models to study bank risk-taking and financial stability. Three issues are explored: (1) the moral-hazard incentive <b>for</b> <b>securitisation,</b> (2) the socially optimal banking {{structure for the}} economy, and (3) the relationship between bank competition and financial stability, based on bank funding structures and fire-sale risks. Chapter 2 proposes a model to study how bank securitisation affects the value of bank equity, and hence what leads a bank to securitise its assets. The proposed model shows that moral hazard (which is induced by the deposit insurance scheme), can be one essential motive for the securitisation of deposit-taking commercial banks. This chapter also discusses some factors that can restrain the moral-hazard and risk-taking behaviour in bank securitisation. Chapter 3 investigates the social value of different banking structures. The proposed model finds that total separation is not the optimal banking structure for an economy, because it forbids the liquidity transfer between subsidiary banks, which is socially valuable. The comparison between ring-fencing and universal banking is more complicated; Chapter 3 shows that whether ring-fencing or universal banking is the best banking structure for an economy depends on the returns to the different subsidiary banking sectors. Chapter 4 studies how asset fire-sales risks and bank funding structures can affect the relationship between bank competition and financial stability. The proposed model finds that the funding-structure risks of the banks can create an incentive for excess risk-taking in a multi-bank economy. Moreover, the model shows that the excessive risk taking increases {{with the number of}} banks in the economy. This result is similar in spirit to the Cournot equilibrium in standard microeconomic theory. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} elderly people has been {{steadily}} rising in Sweden {{for a long time}} and as a proportion of the population, the increase has been even greater. The population structure in the country means that in the not too distant future, there will be a sharp rise in demand for care and elderly accommodation. A tighter credit market as a consequence of new rules and regulations with a stricter capital and liquidity requirements combined with market turbulence, has made financing property developement more difficult and more expensive which has resulted in many companies using alternative sources of finance. DEmand for safe investments with low risk is high as the market is volatile and banks, pension funds, fund management and life insurance companies are looking for investments outside the stock market that can deliver a safe return in the longer term. There has also been a debate about whether institutional investors as the AP pension funds really should own properties directly. As properties for care and elderly accommodation are definable assets with predictable payment flows, long leases and often a local authority as tenant that would not risk cancelling payments, these would be highly appropriate <b>for</b> <b>securitisation,</b> i. e. to issue bonds or other tradable securities based on the cash flows from the assets. In other words, the securitisation of rent flows would offer the opportunity to create an attractive investment product of the type being demanded, well suited to institutional investor requirements, while at the same time, it can provide an attractive financing opportunity to meet the need for more care and elderly accommodation...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} well publicised {{corporate}} collapses has focused {{the minds of}} policy makers, business representatives, unionists and academics {{on the problem of}} how best to protect the entitlements owed to employees of a failed enterprise.

40|$|The {{print media}} {{functions}} {{as an important}} means of information communication in society in that it brings global events into the homes of consumers {{on a daily basis}} where text and images can be read and re-read at the user’s leisure. In the specific instance of the ongoing refugee crisis the reporting of the print media has become increasingly loaded and virulent, therefore, this creates a heated political context, which this research contributes to. This research conducted a rigorous grounded theory analysis over a four month period on the media coverage of the refugee crisis from June-September 2015 from both the Scottish Daily Mail and the Guardian, and uncovered 328 Guardian articles and 333 Daily Mail articles. This process generated a set of conceptual categories: geopolitical and economic discourses, the reactionary power of politics and the media and the language of fear. It was found that the Guardian mainly focuses on the humanitarian elements of the crisis, while the Daily Mail tended to take a differing stance, which places emphasis on increasing calls <b>for</b> <b>securitisation.</b> The ideologies and historical context of these differing stances are at odds and the underlying rationale appears to rest on political allegiance. The language used in reporting is crucial in relaying information to readers and therefore the distinction made between migrants and refugees is critical, as this has a direct effect on the public appetite to support international assistance. This is owing to the structured reality that the print media builds and develops through a series of narratives and representations; this not only shapes, but constrains the public’s understanding of the refugee crisis {{in such a way that}} perceptions of the crisis are distorted...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{study how}} {{information}} and asset market frictions {{can affect the}} investment and funding decisions of financial institutions, and their implications for the efficiency and stability of the financial system as a whole. The first chapter, Self-fulfilling fire sales, shows that while collateralised short-term debt mitigates individual borrowing firms’ incentives to take excessive risk, it also exerts pressure on the liquidity of the collateral asset market. When the asset market is not liquid enough, a vicious feedback loop between borrowers’ risk-taking incentives and expected asset fire-sale discount can cause instability in this secured funding market. Central bank intervention such as asset purchase is shown {{to be able to}} enhance stability and welfare. In the second chapter, Counter-cyclical foreclosure <b>for</b> <b>securitisation,</b> Jing Zeng and I study how information asymmetry in the mortgage securitisation process could distort the foreclosure policy of delinquent mortages. We show that banks would choose to commit to foreclose delinquent mortgages excessively {{in order to reduce the}} information friction in the securitisation process. This offers a potential explanation to the large number of foreclosures of delinquent mortgages in the U. S in the aftermath of the Subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 - 2009. The last chapter, Asset market runs and the collapse of debt maturity, shows that when market-makers have limited riskabsorbing capacity and there is uncertainty in the execution prices of sell orders, a borrower may want to shorten the debt maturity in order to allow his creditor to demand repayment and liquidate the collateral asset ahead of creditors of other firms in the case of default. This strategic shortening of debt maturity in equilibrium amplifies the borrowers risk of failing to roll-over their debt and leads to excessive asset liquidation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to examine the nexus between energy {{security}} and International Relations security studies. The purposes of the thesis are, on one hand, elaborating the conversation concerning political aspects of energy security on international level, and on the other, bringing more theoretical depth to contemporary political analysis of energy affairs. One of the main issues of the study is to define the internal logics of the term energy security. This is achieved through the analysis of several factors in energy policies. The core data of the study are six energy initiatives of the European Union. Through reading of energy security argumentation, the thesis examines the nature of energy security claims and gives disciplinary meaning for the argumentation. By using four defining factors as an analytical tool, the nature of energy security argumentation is thus clarified. Simultaneously, the thesis concentrates on conceptualizing the relationship between energy security and International Relations security studies. This connection is researched through the process of policy analysis combined with theoretical reading of findings. It means that the research nexus is analysed from both perspectives – from the perspective of energy security and the perspective of the discipline. Therefore, this study used energy security as the defining concept of IR security studies. The thesis argues that energy security is a very flexible concept {{from the point of view}} of IR cecurity studies. According to the findings, energy security is vulnerable <b>for</b> <b>securitisation</b> acts. This means that energy security argument is particularly easily used to meet the needed criteria. In addition, the theoretical framework of IR security studies shows that energy security can be seen to have characters of many different IR security study theories. Hence, energy can be argued to be a usable concept from the perspective of these theories. Energy clearly has potential to be included in many discussions of security in International Relations...|$|E

Based on the current market environment the key drivers of change that will lead to an increase in equity and debt securitisation {{within the next five years}} are discussed. Furthermore, the crucial legal requirements and restrictions that will determine the future success of German real estate securitisation are identified. In terms of real estate investment, Germany is the biggest market in Europe. Nevertheless, the total securitised real estate equity has only been € 7 billion as of August 2005. It is broadly anticipated that the introduction of REITs in Germany will promote a fast expansion of the listed property sector. Particularly by eliminating the current tax disadvantages and by providing corporates and private equity investors with an attractive exit vehicle for their property portfolios. On the debt side, 70 % of all German real estate is funded through the use of traditional bank loans. Apart from synthetic debt securitisation structures and the German Pfandbrief market, which exceeds a volume of over € 1 trillion, international capital market instruments have not yet been established. However, recent changes in the German legal landscape have opened the door <b>for</b> true-sale <b>securitisation</b> deals.

40|$|M. Comm. Securitisation and asset-backed {{securities}} are established lending and investment concepts internationally. It changed {{the manner in}} which lending is facilitated and the funding of banks and finance entities other than banks are managed, thereby transforming lending into packaged tradeable debt paper in which investors invest directly. Capital requirements introduced on banks worldwide by the Bank of International Settlements created pressure on margins, which led to banks finding ways through financial engineering in substituting margin income with fee income to better manage their balance sheets and minimum capital requirements for the purpose of capital adequacy. South African Banks are characterised by high infrastructure costs compared with international banks, where technology has been utilised in optimising operating logistics. Foreign banks operate on much narrower margins and are reentering the South African economy which creates an element of threat to South African banks. This creates the need for more innovative funding strategies for both South African banks and finance entities that operate in the grey market in improving competitiveness. Securitisation and {{asset-backed securities}} offers this potential, but is underdeveloped in South Africa due to bank legislation and legislation pertaining to tradeable debt paper being derived from the commercial paper and debenture schedule. Only two securitisation and asset-backed security issues have been conducted in South Africa, which creates questions as to why securitisation and asset-backed securities are not actively being practised and, if there is potential <b>for</b> <b>securitisation</b> and asset-backed securities to evolve and be practised by banks and financiers, what prevents it from being developed as seen internationally?

40|$|This {{paper is}} a primer for policy analysts on the {{securitisation}} of assets and liabilities. It describes {{key elements of}} a typical asset securitisation; outlines the reasons for securitising assets; discusses the types of assets that can be securitised; describes the requirements for a successful asset securitisation; examines whether New Zealand's financial infrastructure presents any barriers to securitisation; discusses the issues surrounding the securitisation of liabilities; and analyses the potential public policy uses of securitisation. The paper does not aim to review sovereign securitisations that have occurred to date. The potential public policy benefits include more efficient financing, improved balance sheet structure, better risk management and improved fiscal credibility. However, the Crown's low borrowing costs and diversity of financial exposures limits {{the extent to which}} benefits are achievable and measurable. There is scope <b>for</b> <b>securitisation</b> to enhance fiscal credibility, particularly in the area of superannuation where policy credibility is a key determinant of a successful policy outcome. An appendix to the paper examines {{the costs and benefits of}} securitising the Crown's student loans portfolio. It concludes that further work could be done to quantify the costs and benefits but notes that the benefits would have to be significant in light of the additional costs associated with securitisation.

Securitisation is “the issuance of marketable securities backed not by the expected capacity to repay of a private corporation or public sector entity, but by the expected cash flows from specific assets ” [OECD (1995) ].

40|$|The {{adoption}} in Europe of IFRS international accounting standards, which became mandatory for listed companies beginning 1 January 2005, brings undeniable benefits, {{most notably in}} improving the comparability of published financial statements. However, {{the potential impact of}} the IFRS on the behaviour of credit institutions, and the financial system as a whole, raises concerns from the perspective of financial stability. The new standards’ increased reliance on “fair value” may increase the volatility of balance sheets and income statements, and some of that increase may be artificial. The standards also complicate the application of the risk management techniques commonly used by credit institutions, and they often depart significantly from the principle of prudence. These uncertainties regarding the effect of the IFRS on the behaviour of institutions are reinforced by the absence of a body of interpretation – still to be constructed – which can provide answers to questions raised in the practical application of the new standards. Finally, the discretion provided to institutions by the “fair value option” may ultimately hamper the comparability of their fi nancial statements. These issues take on all the more importance from the perspective of bank supervisors, given that the IFRS have a direct impact on the calculation of the prudential ratios that {{play a central role in}} the supervision of credit institutions. The rapid rate of change in the international accounting framework makes it necessary for bank supervisors to remain watchful in this area, as regards in particular the potential introduction of a full fair value model. In response to these concerns, bank supervisors, working together at the international level, have developed a set of adjustments, referred to as “prudential filters”, which are designed to correct certain accounting values determined in accordance with the IFRS before they are used to calculate prudential ratios. The adoption of prudential filters does not, however, resolve all of the financial stability issues raised by the introduction of the IFRS. The coexistence of the international framework with national accounting standards can create problems, particularly when the different frameworks call for disparate treatments of the same transaction, as is currently the case <b>for</b> <b>securitisation</b> operations. This situation can complicate the operational management of banking groups, and can also introduce accounting distortions between institutions subjected to different accounting frameworks. Most seriously, it can encourage arbitrage between the different accounting frameworks. These considerations have led bank supervisors to disconnect the prudential treatment of certain banking operations from their accounting treatment. ...|$|E

In this paper we offer a preliminary examination of the securitisation of HIV/AIDS. In {{the first half of}} the last decade there was a widespread assumption that HIV/AIDS had been successfully securitised. We argue that in 2000 the UNSC made a securitising move which fulfilled the three facilitating conditions identified by Buzan et al for a successful speech act. However, we suggest that HIV/AIDS was only partly securitised, as seen by the reaction of the intended audience, the policy community. We suggest that the reason for this was that the securitising move was weakened by a lack of consensus within the securitising actor, and empirical evidence undermining the case made. In so doing we suggest that political consensus and the ability to support securitising claims with empirical evidence contribute to the facilitating conditions necessary <b>for</b> successful <b>securitisation.</b> This analysis also serves to draw a distinction between a securitising move and successful securitisation. However we would wish to nuance this significantly by suggesting that securitisation is not a binary condition, neither are the results of a securitising move homogenous. Rather some actors have accepted HIV/AIDS? status as a security issue more readily than others. This variety may in part be a reflection of the disease itself, that its effects are not homogenous but diverse depending on context; but it also suggests that different actors (often at the level of ministries or even individuals) were more easily persuaded than others.

40|$|Based on 10 months’ {{qualitative}} fieldwork and {{the filming}} of a documentary conducted on the islands of Lampedusa and Fuerteventura, this thesis examines ground-level Europeanisation, concentrating on two well-established Communitarian policy frames [...] the Common Fishery Policy (CFP) and {{the management of the}} external border of the Schengen space of free movement of people – and two populations of artisanal fishers who were exposed to them. It analyses how governmental logics operated on the ground through individuals’ engagement with Communitarian policies, and it reconstructs the major transformations that the two islands’ fishing industries underwent in the duree of more than fifty years of European integration. While until less than thirty years ago the economy of the Italian island of Lampedusa was centred on bluefish fishing and canning industries, on the Spanish island of Fuerteventura most islanders lived from agriculture for centuries. Following the European integration of Italy and Spain, both islands turned into major tourist destinations and the centres of frequent European migration crises. By focusing on these two territories, this investigation explores how EU governance contributed to transforming the local sociocultural and economic fabric and the islanders’ everyday life. Following the overview of how both policies were played out on the ground, I analyse the effects that the CFP produced on the two islands, and those that the management of the European external border generated in Lampedusa. Giving centrality to the marine element, I push the study of Europeanisation towards the sea and reveal how European policies had reconfigured the islanders’ relation with the seawaters surrounding them. Concurrently, by exploring the ways in which individuals interacted with EU governmentalities, I also unearth the several unintended consequences of Communitarian governance – as conservation policies aiming at recovering overfished fish stocks actually generated the conditions for increasing and uncontrolled overexploitation, while border policies <b>for</b> the <b>securitisation</b> of the European space de facto de-securitized life in Lampedusa...|$|R
40|$|July 2010 "Thesis (DBA) [...] Macquarie University, Macquarie Graduate School of Management (MGSM), 2011. Bibliography: p. 174 - 178. Introduction: {{continuous}} {{change in}} the securitisation market [...] Literature review [...] Data collection and research methodology [...] The role of Corporate Trustees in servicing the Australian securitisation market [...] System technology challenges for Corporate Trustees [...] Corporate Trustee strategy review [...] Conclusion and follow-up [...] Future outlook and implications. There are many different definitions <b>for</b> <b>securitisation</b> {{and there are many}} different business models for the participants that comprise the market. The rapid growth of the industry and the increasingly complex structured solutions on offer has increasingly blurred the definition and scope of securitisation itself. The mortgage value chain, as the largest component of securitisation, is also undergoing significant change as competition increases and profit margins decline. [...] Australia's preference for the Trust structure in securitisation has given Corporate Trustees a prominent role in transactions that is unique and central to the Australian industry. The role of the Trustee to act on behalf of investors while also facilitating the complex nature of securitisation funding and financial transaction flows has given it a position that can be seen to act as providing a fiduciary duty while being commercially successful at the same time. [...] The growth of securitisation and increased level of importance to the provision of asset funding as a means to fund business growth has created opportunities for mortgage manufacturers to avail of and be part of the funding component of the value chain while increasing their overall profits from mortgages. Mortgage Brokers have an increasingly important role in the mortgage industry's distribution channels, and lenders are trying to improve the structure of broker commissions in order to improve loan profitability within this sector. Despite advances in technology and the proliferation of internet and telephone capability in financial services, the proverbial "high street branch" has a very important part to play given the size of the financial transactions involved and the preference that consumer's have for face-to-face contact. Increasingly sophisticated customer requirements, and the desire to contain costs and add efficiency has brought about much {{change in the}} mortgage process. Increasingly, the need to push more of the mortgage processing work closer to the initial contact points with the customer in order to turn information into electronic formats that can be quickly dispersed to other parties, and the desire to quicken funding decisions has taken precedence over having a sequential set of stages in the securitisation value chain of events. The complexity and fragmentation of the Australian securitisation market is fuelling opportunities as well as challenges for its members and participants. [...] Technology in the securitisation industry 10 years ago was largely centralised and based on in-house systems that were designed {{to meet the needs of}} one party. Things have changed since then as technology in the securitisation industry is being driven by the extensive changes taking place at an industry level. Increased competition, value chain fragmentation, demand for improved and increased services, increasingly complex financing structures, and more regulated lending practices are all contributing to the changes in technology use. [...] The use of integrated technology that is delivered in modules is becoming more important given the need to meet demand quickly, provide electronic data exchange with different stakeholders and provide an efficient service. The fragmentation of the industry means that participants do not have to build end-to-end market solutions to operate in the industry but can instead concentrate on their own area as long as they can link to other parties in the industry. However, industry participants increasingly have to make choices when deciding on their technology strategy and when making decisions as to whether to use technology to outpace, keep up or stay behind the rest of the industry. [...] Traditionally the Trustee role has been carried by professional Corporate Trustees that were valued for their independence and specialist skills. The expansion and increased complexity of the securitisation market has allowed the Corporate Trustees to find commercial success and build a specialist outsourced administration service. [...] The unbundling of the securitisation value chain and the opening up of the administration services part of the market is creating opportunities for parties such as Corporate Trustees to provide more specialist administration services. Administration is no longer tied to securitisation funding, and improvements in technology have allowed Corporate Trustees to provide services that are more closely tied to the value chain. [...] Corporate Trustees have built up a range of securitisation and administration skills. These skills, along with investments in technology, can be positioned to also add on new administration services creating an attractive outsourcing option for asset funders and product manufacturers. The Corporate Trustee has a unique opportunity to build upon its current position in the securitisation industry, while balancing its fiduciary obligations, to meet the commercial demands that will exist. [...] The Corporate Trustee business model has played an important role in the Australian securitisation market since its inception. The majority of programs now use a Trust structure. [...] This research highlights that the current process around securitisation is complex and involves a number of manual steps. As part of the review of this process, this thesis aims to clarify the Trustee's role regarding the steps that should be taken during an on-going securitisation program. This thesis is divided into a number of sections covering the Trustee's legal obligations, the role of the Trustee, the securitisation distribution current process, the role of technology, options for the future, and concluding recommendations.

40|$|Securitisation theory {{serves as}} a useful {{corrective}} to the ‘climate determinism’ evident in mainstream debates on the security effects of climate change, but there are divergences within this approach over what constitutes ‘successful’ <b>securitisation.</b> <b>For</b> the Copenhagen School, climate change has not been securitised because relevant state actors do not yet accept that emergency measures are necessary to tackle ‘dangerous’ climate risks. In contrast, ‘sociological’ proponents of securitisation theory identify ‘successful’ securitisation evident from climate policies that would not otherwise have been undertaken without the political mobilisation of crisis narratives concerning threats to human and ecosystem health. These marked differences over climate change reflect, I argue, divergent spatialities deployed within securitisation theory. The Copenhagen School posits state-bounded territoriality as the power container dominating global security dynamics, viewing climate change as a weaker, deterritorial source of securitisation. Sociological approaches admit a wider set of security effects arising from the political mobilisation of climate threats because securitisation is claimed to emerge from diverse performative spaces. A critical application of securitisation theory to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict reveals insights from both strands on the outcomes of attempts to portray climate change as a regional security threat. However, I contend that the spatial analytics of securitisation theory miss vertical forms of power that, {{in the case of}} Israeli occupational practices, feature use of a climate threat scenario to reinforce processes of military-political dominatio...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. This {{research}} report studies {{the application of}} Edcon's Asset-Backed Securitisation of OntheCards Investments in the retail industry. Asset-Backed Securitisation is a new concept in South Africa that has been largely practised in the financial sector. The research investigates Edcon's ability to adapt and apply the onerous and rigorous Asset-Backed Securitisation process to achieve their strategic and financial objectives. As Asset-Backed Securitisation is a new concept in South Africa, which was traditionally applied in the financial sector, the application of this tool in the retail industry would require drastic changes to the business practice of Edcon's credit operations and their strategic evaluation process. The {{first part of the}} research therefore concentrated on the evolution and theory of strategy. This discussion focussed on the evolution of the strategic planning process and eventually concluded with developments in the resource based theory. Strategic frameworks and evaluation techniques were also presented and reviewed. As part of the literature review, the theory on Asset-Backed Securitisation was also presented and International and South African Perspectives were reviewed with respect to the market <b>for</b> Asset-Backed <b>Securitisation.</b> Drawing from the literature review on strategy, a strategic evaluation model was developed for the evaluation of Edcon's strategic control tool of OntheCards Investments, their Asset-Backed Securitisation. The evaluation of OntheCards Investments was focussed on the structure of OntheCards Investments with respect to the theory of Asset-Backed Securitisation, an analysis of Edcon prior to the OntheCards Investments which took the form of a PEST Analysis, SWOT Analysis, Porter's Five Forces Model and a Life Cycle Analysis. The evaluation was concluded by conducting a v situational analysis of Edcon after OntheCards Investments and an assessment of OntheCards Investments with respect to its acceptability and suitability to Edcon's business. The conclusion drawn from the study was that Edcon had stretch goals and aspirations in OntheCards Investments. Edcon identified the critical success factors for OntheCards Investment and actively achieved the improvement in their credit management operations, which has now yielded an extreme competitive advantage that will not be easily imitated by their competition without major capital investment...|$|R
40|$|Section 26 of the Constitution of South Africa Act 108 of 1996 {{provides}} that housing {{is a basic}} human right {{and that the government}} must take reasonable legislative and other measures to achieve the realisation of this right. A number of measures were taken to try to resolve this socio-economic issue. A number of housing institutions were established, various pieces of legislation were passed and housing subsidies were provided. However, housing backlogs remain a challenge. In March 1994 the housing backlog was estimated between 1, 3 and 1, 8 million units. When more than a million houses were provided by 2001, the housing backlog had increased to between 2 and 3 million houses. To date subsidies in excess of R 29 billion have been spent on housing provision. A study by the Department of Housing concluded that, at the current rate of increase of housing funding vis-a-vis the growing backlog and rapid urbanisation, the household backlog will not be changed in ten years' time. The United States of America (USA) had a similar low cost housing problem, but securitisation alleviated it with the participation of government agencies Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac. In South Africa, the NHFC tried to emulate the USA model by establishing Gateway Home Loans (Pty) Limited (Gateway) in 1999. Gateway, however, was not a success. This research investigates whether securitisation can be applied in South Africa to alleviate the low cost housing issue. The study finds that there is a credit availability gap for the low income sector earning less than R 8 000 per month because of the perceived risk of default and unwillingness by banks to lend to this sector. The increase in housing backlog that continues unabated, inadequate housing finance system to low income earners, the lessons learnt from the failure of Gateway, the success factors of the USA securitisation model and the sound and sophisticated South African financial system are the rationale <b>for</b> applying <b>securitisation.</b> A proposal of how to effectively apply securitisation to low cost housing in South Africa is provided with recommendations to revive the primary market. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} and analysed human trafficking {{as a security}} issue using South Africa and Mozambique as country case studies. Information gathered through documentary analysis methodology is relied upon to develop a conceptual framework of human trafficking and security. The link between trafficking and security is evaluated based on the conceptualisation of trafficking in the Palermo Protocol {{as well as the}} criteria for declaring social phenomena security threats, as articulated by the UN and several scholars. Through global and national overviews of human trafficking, its patterns, extent and enabling conditions are identified and analysed. In South Africa and Mozambique, human trafficking has domestic and international dimensions and is facilitated by several factors. However, factors facilitating domestic trafficking do not necessarily facilitate international trafficking in South Africa. The opposite is however, the case in the Mozambican context. An analysis of global, regional, and national counter trafficking measures, shows that the national security implications of human trafficking are not explicitly addressed. Trafficking involves national border violations; organised crime; corruption, and physical violence which have implications for security at all levels. Consequently, recommendations are made <b>for</b> the explicit <b>securitisation</b> of trafficking as well as the demonstration of sufficient political will to combat it. Regional and international co-operation is also considered necessary to combat trafficking, as well as prosecution of offenders and the introduction of poverty alleviating measures.

40|$|International audienceFinancialisation {{and housing}} are {{predominantly}} associated to mortgages <b>for</b> homeownership and <b>securitisation</b> techniques. This paper looks at how financial markets influence the development industry, its business strategies, {{and the nature}} and location of its products. Adopting a supply-side account, the paper inquires into the rising role of financial markets {{as a source of}} funding for a consolidating development industry and its influence on the geography of housing in Brazilian cities. It develops the concept of resonance by combining two yet unrelated strands of literature on the study of financial markets (cultural economy and conventionalist economics). Narratives co-authored by the stock market community and development firms management over each individual firm, and the discursively linked strategic moves of developers, are shown to resonate, at the meso-level of the industry, into shared social representations (or conventions) on how to best assess and interpret the value of development firms. Analysing the wave of Initial Public Offerings occurring in the mid 2000 s, the paper highlights that narratives of quick capital gains associated with the removal of the land banking bottleneck faced by developers supported a convention giving priority to the growth in total output, and contributed to the observed changes in the forms, scales and locations of housing projects in Brazilian cities. As discrepancies between the promises of returns for shareholders and actual financial results emerged, the growth convention unravelled, making way for other narratives and strategic moves to resonate anew and possibly change again the geographies of housin...|$|R
