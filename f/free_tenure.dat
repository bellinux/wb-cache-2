Typically, demesne accounted for roughly {{a third of}} the arable area, and villein holdings rather more; but some manors consisted solely of demesne, others solely of peasant holdings. The proportion of unfree and <b>free</b> <b>tenures</b> could likewise vary greatly, with more or less reliance on wage labour for agricultural work on the demesne.|$|R
5000|$|The {{feudal system}} in England {{gradually}} {{became more and}} more complex until eventually the process became cumbrous and services difficult to enforce. As a result, the statute of Quia Emptores was passed in 1290 to replace subinfeudation with substitution, so the subordinate tenant transferred their tenure rather than creating a new subordinate tenure. As tenancies came to an end, the number of layers in the feudal pyramid was reduced. The Tenures Abolition Act 1660 abolished knight service, converting all <b>free</b> <b>tenures</b> to socage tenure.|$|R

50|$|The land {{forfeited}} to the Conqueror was re-granted by {{him to be}} held by knight-service due to the king, not to the {{mesne lord}} as in European continental feudalism. In 1086 at the council of Salisbury all the landholders swore fealty to the crown. In the full vigour of feudalism the inhabitants of England were either free or not free. The free inhabitants held their lands either by <b>free</b> <b>tenure</b> or by a tenure which was originally that of a non-free inhabitant, but attached to land {{in the possession of}} a free man. <b>Free</b> <b>tenure</b> was either military tenure, called also tenure in chivalry, or socage (including burgage and petit serjeanty), or frankalmoin, by which ecclesiastical corporations generally held their land. The non-free inhabitants were called in the Domesday Book servi, cotarii, or bordarii, and later nativi or villani, the last name being applied to both free men and serfs. All these were in a more or less dependent condition. The free tenures all exist at the present day, though, as will appear later, the military tenures have shrunk into the unimportant and exceptional tenure of grand serjeanty. The non-free tenures are to a certain extent represented by copyhold.|$|E

Wells was recognised as a free borough by a Royal charter of King John in 1201. The city remained under episcopal control until its charter of incorporation from Queen Elizabeth I in 1589. City status was most recently confirmed by Queen Elizabeth II by letters patent issued under the Great Seal dated 1 April 1974, which granted city status specifically to the civil parish; on that date major local government reorganisation came into effect, which involved {{the abolition of the}} municipal borough of Wells.|$|R
5000|$|Seisin is {{believed}} to have been applicable only to freehold tenures, that is to say a tenure for a term of life, which was heritable, on condition of payment of the appropriate feudal relief to the overlord. A [...] "freeman" [...] was a man who held by freehold tenure, and thus freehold tenure was anciently said to be the only form of feudal land tenure worthy to be held by a <b>free</b> man. <b>Tenure,</b> and the variety thereof, was the very essence of feudal society and the stratification thereof, and the possession of a tenure (i.e., holding, from Latin teneo [...] "to hold") was legally established by the act of seisin.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the factors which can predict {{the probability of}} smallholder farmers residing in semi-aríd central Tanzania using various farming strategies to meet their household subsistence requirements(HSR). The synergy between the efficiency of these strategies and land degradation problems is established. The paper uses data collected from {{a random sample of}} 499 smallholder farmers in Dodoma region. The collected data are analysed using logistic regression method Results show that factors such as land (<b>free)</b> <b>tenure,</b> declining yield, SWC project activities, pest and disease problems, transport problem, Iack of fertilizer, lack of agro-chemicals, and shortage of labour have a positive and significant(p= 0. 1) influence on crop production strategies. Perception about soil erosion problem and rainfall uncertainty was not significant at p= 0. 1 level. Crop production strategies such as intercropping, plot diversity and area expansion are associated with increase in crop revenue at p= 0. 05 level of significance while in livestock production, semi-intensive grazing system was signifcant at p- 0. 1 level. On the other hand, use of fire, area expansion and dryIand preparation/planting are perceived to accelerate soil degradation problem. These three strategies present the decision synergies between the need for increasing production/revenue (efficiency) to meet HSR and the land degradation problems. The paper concludes that institutional support is required to ease these conflicting production strategies in smallholder farming environment...|$|E
40|$|The Arden area of north-west Warwickshire {{developed}} {{its regional}} personality {{during the early}} Middle Ages {{as the result of}} being by-passed by the main wave of Anglo-Saxon colonisation. From the eleventh to the early fourteenth centuries the area saw a vigorous colonising movement whose character was determined partially by the extent of early settlement, and hence the amount of woodland and waste surviving, and partially by seigniorial policy. This movement differed from the Anglo-Saxon colonisation, which led to the establishment of common open fields, in that clearing was a matter of private initiative and resulted in the creation of enclosed several ties. Manorial lords were compelled to offer some form of inducement to settlers, and this took the form of a less rigid application of the manorial regime, so that the typical tenure of Arden was free socage, and dues were largely rendered in cash. These concessions encouraged the movement of population into the area especially those manors where <b>free</b> <b>tenure</b> was predominant, and led indirectly to the appearance of a vigorous land market. The processes of fragmentation, agglomeration and exchange which resulted from this encouraged social mobility, and led to the emergence of sub-manors in the hands of wealthy free tenants, and to a {{reduction in the number of}} small independent freeholdings. While the economy of Arden was based upon true mixed fanning, it is likely that pastoralism produced much of the capital available to both lord and peasant...|$|E

50|$|It was {{the first}} {{rebellion}} of the paika (soldiers of Orissa) {{with the support of}} common people against the British Rule. The land revenue policy of the British was the primary cause of the rebellion in 1817. The rent <b>free</b> land <b>tenures</b> provided to the soldiers for their military service on a hereditary basis were taken away in the settlement by Major Fletcher as their service were not required anymore. This policy resulted in the deprivation of Bakshi Jagabandhu from his estates and forced him to depend on the voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda. This policy also affected the zamindars as well as ryots. Another important cause for that great event was the raise in salt price.As a result, Bakshi Jagabandhu led the tribals of Banapur and Ghumsur and bravely marched towards Khurda to fight against colonial power. The rebellion received extensive support from the common people. Even the Kandhas of Banapur became successful in their revolutionary activities. The rebellion was expanded throughout the state and continued for a quite long time. However, the less number of paika were unable to defend the well equipped British counterpart and receded back to the jungles. In this operation bands of paika were hunted down and many were brutally murdered.|$|R
40|$|Ghana {{has three}} {{dominant}} modes of housing tenure: owner occupancy, renting and rent free. Rent free {{has been a}} substantial tenure mode in Ghana over the years. It was the major type of tenure in the country before 1998 when it became the next major type of tenure after owning (GSS, 2005). This study aims at estimating the determinants of the housing tenure decisions in Ghana. it employed the multinomial logit model to achieve this objective. It was found that a household’s decision to rent is positively influenced by location in the forest and coastal ecological zones, urban location, a household head with basic education and the income of the household head. Location in the forest ecological zone, urban location, household heads with bachelor’s degrees and employed household heads are the main positive determinants {{of the decision to}} stay rent free. Rent <b>free,</b> as a <b>tenure</b> choice is substantial and serves young graduates; the state should therefore make deliberate efforts to sustain and maintain the extended family system, since it is the major provider of rent free housing units in Ghana 1...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose: To {{evaluate}} quantitatively {{the effect}} of six contemporary self-etching systems on dentin permeability {{by means of the}} electrochemical impedance technique and to correlate these results with their acidity. Methods: 36 1. 1 mm thick dentin disks were embedded in a hollow polyurethane resin cylinder. The system used was a "like" permeation cell: two electrodes immersed in a 10 (- 1) KCl solution were attached to a potentiostat. It was connected to a microcomputer controlled frequency response analyzer, and a 10 mV sinusoidal voltage signal over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 65 kHz was applied between the electrodes. The current passing through the dentin was measured to enable a calculation of impedance expressed in a complex number. To establish an evaluation of permeability variation, the resistance was noted for all specimens before and after the application of self-etching adhesive. A pH meter used with a combined glass-electrode measured the pH of all the systems. Results: The higher decrease of the resistance of dentin samples was obtained with Experimental (EXP), which presented no significant difference with Touch and Bond (TB), Etch and Prime 3. 0 (EP), and Etch <b>Free</b> <b>Tenure</b> (EF). These acidic monomers improved the dentin permeability respectively to 6. 7, 5. 1, 5. 0 and 5. 0 %. The lowest values were obtained with Clearfil SE Bond (SEB) (2. 0 %), which showed significant difference with all the other systems. Prompt L-Pop (PLP) with 4. 3 % showed significant difference with EXP and SEB and no significant difference with the three other systems. The pH and permeability variation were not systematically correlated...|$|E
40|$|Consultation {{practices}} with affected populations prior to hydro concessions often remained {{poor in the}} decade since the World Commission on Dams (WCD) although, {{in some cases the}} involvement of local people in the details of resettlement has improved. Numerous international and national actors, such as state agencies, multilateral banks, corporate shareholders, and pro-business media, support the development of dams, but intergovernmental agencies struggle to assure the protection of fundamental civil, human, and indigenous rights at the permitting and construction stages. We analyse two large-scale Panamanian dams with persistent disrespect for indigenous land <b>tenure.</b> <b>Free,</b> prior, and informed consent was sidestepped even though each dam required or will require Ngöbe, Emberá, or Kuna villages to relocate. When populations protested, additional human rights violations occurred, including state-sponsored violence. International bodies are slowly identifying and denouncing this abuse of power. Simultaneously, many nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) seek change in Panama consistent with WCD’s good-practice guidelines. A number of NGOs have tied hydro projects to unethical greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trade. As private and state institutions market formerly collective water and carbon resources for profit, these Panamanian cases have become central to a public debate over equitable and green hydro development.

500|$|In March 1869, President Grant made {{it known}} he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed, stating {{it was a}} [...] "stride toward a {{revolution}} in our <b>free</b> system". The <b>Tenure</b> of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867, sponsored by Radical Republicans, to curb {{the power of the}} President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments. The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868. [...] On March 5, 1869, a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act, but Senator Charles Sumner was opposed, unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments. Grant, to bolster the repeal effort, declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies, until the law was overturned, thus, agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law. Under national pressure for governmental reform, a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet, however, government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period. Grant, who did not desire a party split over the matter, signed the bill; afterwards, he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law. The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887. Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts, a practice known as nepotism.|$|R
50|$|After the 2005 {{season the}} Kickers were {{relegated to the}} USL Second Division. Jeffrey opted against re-signing with the Kickers, and instead signed a {{contract}} with the Toronto Lynx. Jeffrey made his Lynx debut on 4 June 2006 coming on as a substitute for Damien Pottinger in a match against the Virginia Beach Mariners. Initially he struggled to find his form and had a six-game goal drought. Soon after he would record his first goal on 21 July 2006 in a 1-1 draw against rivals Rochester Rhinos. He became an instant impact when he would score crucial match-winning goals for the Lynx. His was selected to the USL First Division First All-League team three times, as well as being named USL Player of the Week. He concluded the season as the team's leading goal scorer with nine goals. His efforts led the Lynx to a team-record undefeated streak at home to 10 games, and helped the Toronto club reach the finals of the Open Canada Cup in their debut season in the tournament. After the 2006 season the Lynx franchise dropped two divisions down to the USL Premier Development League, thus releasing Jeffrey from his Toronto contract. He signed with the newly expansion Carolina RailHawks as a <b>free</b> agent. Jeffrey's <b>tenure</b> with Carolina was rather a disappointment, where he failed to re-capture his goal scoring legacy which was known throughout his time in the USL First Division. He appeared in fourteen league games for the RailHawks without recording a single goal, which resulted in his being waived from the team.|$|R
3000|$|Land {{delivery}} systems in Ethiopia have undergone different land tenure systems. This {{has largely been}} {{a reflection of the}} prevailing land policy and land holding tenure systems of the country under different governance regimes. Notable examples include the <b>free</b> hold land <b>tenure</b> system (pre- 1975), public controlled permit system (1975 – 1992) and public lease hold system (1993 up to date). Besides, these there are also customary and informal land holding systems, which are commonly known in Ethiopia and other developing countries (Gondo 2009). The major formal land delivery system for residential housing and investment in Addis Ababa and other big cities is through the lease mechanism. But in some smaller towns it is on a rental bases. Land is a public property and an individual can enjoy only the use right of land under his/her possession. Thus, the means to acquire legally (formally) a plot of land for housing development, and investment purpose is dependent on the efficiency of lease policy application. Lease Proclamation No 172 / 2002, is the current active law regarding land provision, and indicates different ways how one can acquire a piece of land. These include auction, negotiation, lottery system and through an award system (ibid). In 1994, a new Ethiopian constitution was promulgated. The constitution retains state ownership of the land. Article 40; sub-section 3 of the constitution states that land “is exclusively vested in the state and in the peoples of Ethiopia. It further stipulates that ‘land is a common property of the nations, Nationalities and Peoples of Ethiopia and shall not be subject to sale or other means of exchange.” [...]...|$|R
