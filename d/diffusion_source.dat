In {{the context of}} this work boron- and phosphorus-doped silicate glass (BSG and PSG) as solid <b>diffusion</b> <b>sources</b> and phosphorus oxychloride (POCl 3) as gaseous precursor for phosphorus diffusion are investigated. The combination of solid and gaseous <b>diffusion</b> <b>sources</b> leads to a high flexibility in adjusting sheet resistances {{on the one hand and}} to a simplification of process flows on the other. In this work the sheet resistance of p+-doped areas is varied in the range of Rsh = 50 - 300 ohm/sq by varying composition and thickness of the solid <b>diffusion</b> <b>sources.</b> The deposition of these solid <b>diffusion</b> <b>sources</b> is carried out by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) using two different process equipments.

40|$|The global {{diffusion}} of epidemics, computer viruses, and rumors causes great damage to our society. It {{is critical to}} identify the <b>diffusion</b> <b>sources</b> and timely quarantine them. However, most methods proposed so far are unsuitable for <b>diffusion</b> with multiple <b>sources</b> {{because of the high}} computational cost and the complex spatiotemporal diffusion processes. In this paper, based on the knowledge of infected nodes and their connections, we propose a novel method to identify multiple <b>diffusion</b> <b>sources,</b> which can address three main issues in this area: 1) how many sources are there? 2) where did the diffusion emerge? and 3) when did the diffusion break out? We first derive an optimization formulation for multi-source identification problem. This is based on altering the original network into a new network concerning two key elements: 1) propagation probability and 2) the number of hops between nodes. Experiments demonstrate that the altered network can accurately reflect the complex diffusion processes with multiple sources. Second, we derive a fast method to optimize the formulation. It has been proved that the proposed method is convergent and the computational complexity is O(mn log α), where α = α (m,n) is the slowly growing inverse-Ackermann function, n is the number of infected nodes, and m is the number of edges connecting them. Finally, we introduce an efficient algorithm to estimate the spreading time and the number of <b>diffusion</b> <b>sources.</b> To evaluate the proposed method, we compare the proposed method with many competing methods in various real-world network topologies.

Interstitial Zn is stable at anion-surrounded tetrahedral site under pure Zn condition, while stable at cation-surrounded tetrahedral site under ZnGa alloy condition.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{locating}} multiple <b>diffusion</b> <b>sources</b> in networks with partial observations. We propose a new source localization algorithm, named Optimal-Jordan-Cover (OJC). The algorithm first extracts a subgraph using a candidate selection algorithm that selects source candidates {{based on the number}} of observed infected nodes in their neighborhoods. Then, in the extracted subgraph, OJC finds a set of nodes that "cover" all observed infected nodes with the minimum radius. The set of nodes is called the Jordan cover, and is regarded as the set of <b>diffusion</b> <b>sources.</b> Considering the heterogeneous susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) diffusion in the Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph, we prove that OJC can locate all sources with probability one asymptotically with partial observations. OJC is a polynomial-time algorithm in terms of network size. However, the computational complexity increases exponentially in $m,$ the number of sources. We further propose a low-complexity heuristic based on the K-Means for approximating the Jordan cover, named Approximate-Jordan-Cover (AJC). Simulations on random graphs and real networks demonstrate that both AJC and OJC significantly outperform other heuristic algorithms. Comment: 16 figure...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} estimating the MICs of fusidic acid and ciprofloxacin for bacterial isolates using series of antibiotic disk concentrations in diffusion tests, so-called M-tests. MethodsThirty Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis strains were tested for fusidic acid susceptibility Sixty-one clinical isolates of eight bacterial species were tested for ciprofloxacin susceptibility Disk diffusion was standardized according to the Swedish reference group for antibiotics (SRGA). For fusidic acid, a series of disks (1. 5, 5. 0, 15, 50 and 150 μg) was used. Ciprofloxacin was applied in four different <b>diffusion</b> <b>sources</b> (1, 3, 10 and 30 μg) on a single strip, the M-strip, and used. True MIC values were determined using the standardized agar dilution method according to the SRGA. Single-strain regression analysis (SRA) was employed to calculate critical concentration equivalents (Qzero). ResultsFusidic acid and ciprofloxacin critical concentrations were determined for the bacterial isolates. The mean conversion factors for Qzero to yield the true MIC were 2. 06 (range 0. 34 – 8. 9) for fusidic acid and 2. 05 (range 0. 37 – 8. 1) for ciprofloxacin. There was a correlation between true MIC values (all MICs expressed as 2 log + 9) and the calculated MIC values (Qzero × conversion factor) for both fusidic acid (R = 0. 9822) and ciprofloxacin (R = 0. 9696).
