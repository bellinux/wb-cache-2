5|$|Like other {{transition}} metals, zirconium forms a {{wide range}} of inorganic compounds and coordination complexes. In general, these compounds are colourless <b>diamagnetic</b> solids wherein zirconium has the oxidation state +4. Far fewer Zr(III) compounds are known, and Zr(II) is very rare.|$|E
5|$|The A {{center is}} <b>diamagnetic,</b> but if ionized by UV light or deep acceptors, it {{produces}} an {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} spectrum W24, whose analysis unambiguously proves the N=N structure.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the other rare-earth metals, which usually have antiferromagnetic and/or ferromagnetic properties at low temperatures, ytterbium is paramagnetic at temperatures above 1.0 kelvin. However, the alpha allotrope is <b>diamagnetic.</b> With a melting point of 824°C and a boiling point of 1196°C, ytterbium has the smallest liquid range of all the metals.|$|E
5|$|In {{medicine}} and chemistry, SRI developed dry-powder drugs, laser photocoagulation (a treatment for some eye maladies), remote surgery (also known as telerobotic surgery), bio-agent detection using upconverting phosphor technology, the experimental anticancer drugs Tirapazamine and TAS-108, ammonium dinitramide (an environmentally benign oxidizer for safe and cost-effective disposal of hazardous materials), the electroactive polymer ("artificial muscle"), new uses for <b>diamagnetic</b> levitation, and the antimalarial drug Halofantrine.|$|E
5|$|No other metal is {{verified}} {{to be more}} naturally <b>diamagnetic</b> than bismuth. (Superdiamagnetism is {{a different}} physical phenomenon.) Of any metal, it {{has one of the}} lowest values of thermal conductivity (after manganese, and maybe neptunium and plutonium) and the highest Hall coefficient. It has a high electrical resistivity. When deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate, bismuth is a semiconductor, despite being a post-transition metal.|$|E
5|$|Some tetracoordinate nickel(II) complexes, e.g. bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel chloride, exist both in {{tetrahedral}} {{and square}} planar geometries. The tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic, whereas the square planar complexes are <b>diamagnetic.</b> In having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of octahedral complexes, they {{contrast with the}} divalent complexes of the heavier group 10 metals, palladium(II) and platinum(II), which form only square-planar geometry.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} oxide is TiO2, which exists in three important polymorphs; anatase, brookite, and rutile. All {{of these are}} white <b>diamagnetic</b> solids, although mineral samples can appear dark (see rutile). They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six oxide ligands that link to other Ti centers.|$|E
5|$|The three {{fluorides}} {{of chlorine}} form {{a subset of}} the interhalogen compounds, all of which are <b>diamagnetic.</b> Some cationic and anionic derivatives are known, such as , , , and Cl2F+. Some pseudohalides of chlorine are also known, such as cyanogen chloride (ClCN, linear), chlorine cyanate (ClNCO), chlorine thiocyanate (ClSCN, unlike its oxygen counterpart), and chlorine azide (ClN3).|$|E
5|$|Zinc and cadmium are {{electropositive}} while {{mercury is}} not. As a result, zinc and cadmium metal are good reducing agents. The elements of group 12 have an oxidation state of +2 {{in which the}} ions have the rather stable d10 electronic configuration, with a full sub-shell. However, mercury can easily be reduced to the +1 oxidation state; usually, as in the ion , two mercury(I) ions come {{together to form a}} metal-metal bond and a <b>diamagnetic</b> species. Cadmium can also form species such as 4− in which the metal's oxidation state is +1. Just as with mercury, the formation of a metal-metal bond results in a <b>diamagnetic</b> compound in which there are no unpaired electrons; thus, making the species very reactive. Zinc(I) is known only in the gas phase, in such compounds as linear Zn2Cl2, analogous to calomel.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a pentavalent post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge. Bismuth is the most naturally <b>diamagnetic</b> element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{complexes}} tend to {{be similar}} to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes {{tend to be}} rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate 5− and tellurate 5− complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow <b>diamagnetic</b> − is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.|$|E
5|$|Tetravalent thorium {{compounds}} {{are usually}} colourless or yellow, {{like those of}} silver or lead, as the Th4+ ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. Thorium chemistry is therefore largely that of an electropositive metal forming a single <b>diamagnetic</b> ion with a stable noble-gas configuration, indicating a similarity between thorium and the main group elements of the s-block. Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Zinc(I) {{compounds}} {{are rare}} and need bulky ligands {{to stabilize the}} low oxidation state. Most zinc(I) compounds contain formally the 2+ core, which {{is analogous to the}} 2+ dimeric cation present in mercury(I) compounds. The <b>diamagnetic</b> nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure. The first zinc(I) compound containing the Zn–Zn bond, (η5-C5Me5)2Zn2, is also the first dimetallocene. The 2+ ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc metal and zinc(II), and has been obtained only a yellow glass only by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the great}} {{reactivity}} of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless <b>diamagnetic</b> gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210°C and boils at −196°C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, {{but it will}} nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N triple bond. Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's chemical inertness.|$|E
5|$|Low {{atomic number}} also makes {{beryllium}} relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, {{it is used}} to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the Tevatron and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its <b>diamagnetic</b> nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} a {{practical}} realization based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by <b>diamagnetic</b> levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are <b>diamagnetic</b> and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is <b>diamagnetic,</b> like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I−. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion + is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form +; silver salts are dissolved in photography due {{to the formation of}} the thiosulfate complex 3−; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex −. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C≡N→Ag–C≡N→}; silver thiocyanate has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine complexes +.|$|E
5|$|Magnetism as a {{property}} of matter {{has been known}} in China since 4000 BC. However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started {{with the development of}} electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and <b>diamagnetic</b> based on their response to magnetization. Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in ferromagnetic materials. In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets. The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired magnetization. The Ising model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous magnetization cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on antiferromagnetism led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices.|$|E
5|$|Rhodocene {{exists as}} , a {{paramagnetic}} 19-valence electron radical monomer only {{at or below}} −196°C (liquid nitrogen temperatures) or above 150°C in the gas phase. It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered metallocene sandwich structure. At room temperature (25°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms 2, a <b>diamagnetic</b> 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure. Electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point {{to the presence of}} an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a high order axis of symmetry (Cn, n>2) with a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical sandwich structure of a metallocene although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry. The dimerisation is a redox process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the monomer has a rhodium(II) centre. Rhodium typically occupies oxidation states +I or +III in its stable compounds.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, <b>diamagnetic</b> metal, {{though most}} common {{commercial}} grades {{of the metal}} have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150°C. Above 210°C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5°C) and boiling points (907°C). The melting point is the lowest of all the d-block metals aside from mercury and cadmium; for this, among other reasons, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are often {{not considered to be}} transition metals {{like the rest of the}} d-block metals are.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diamagnetic</b> plasma can {{generate}} {{its own internal}} magnetic field. This can reject an externally applied magnetic field, making it <b>diamagnetic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike the copper(II) derivative, copper(I) acetate is {{colourless}} and <b>diamagnetic.</b>|$|E
25|$|With one {{unpaired}} electron μeff values range from 1.8 to 2.5 μB and with two {{unpaired electron}}s the range is 3.18 to 3.3 μB. Note that low-spin complexes of Fe2+ and Co3+ are <b>diamagnetic.</b> Another group of complexes that are <b>diamagnetic</b> are square-planar complexes of d8 ions such as Ni2+ and Rh+ and Au3+.|$|E
25|$|Conversely a lower {{chemical}} shift {{is called a}} <b>diamagnetic</b> shift, and is upfield and more shielded.|$|E
25|$|Ozone is <b>diamagnetic,</b> {{which means}} that its {{electrons}} are all paired. In contrast, O2 is paramagnetic, containing two unpaired electrons.|$|E
25|$|Compounds {{which are}} {{expected}} to be <b>diamagnetic</b> may exhibit this kind of weak paramagnetism. It arises from a second-order Zeeman effect in which additional splitting, proportional to the square of the field strength, occurs. It is difficult to observe as the compound inevitably also interacts with the magnetic field in the <b>diamagnetic</b> sense. Nevertheless, data are available for the permanganate ion. It is easier to observe in compounds of the heavier elements, such as uranyl compounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{deep green}} dihafnium product is <b>diamagnetic.</b> X-ray {{crystallography}} {{shows that the}} complex adopts an edge-shared bioctahedral structure, {{very similar to the}} Zr analogue.|$|E
25|$|The protons in {{aromatic}} compounds are shifted downfield {{even further}} with a signal for benzene at 7.73ppm {{as a consequence}} of a <b>diamagnetic</b> ring current.|$|E
25|$|Reduction {{factors are}} {{particularly}} useful for describing experimental results, such as EPR and optical spectra, of paramagnetic impurities in semiconducting, dielectric, <b>diamagnetic</b> and ferrimagnetic hosts.|$|E
25|$|Low-spin Fe2+ binds to singlet oxygen. Both low-spin {{iron and}} singlet oxygen are <b>diamagnetic.</b> However, the singlet form of oxygen is the higher-energy {{form of the}} molecule.|$|E
25|$|When a {{large number}} of crystallographic defects bind these planes together, {{graphite}} loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known as pyrolytic graphite. It is also highly anisotropic, and <b>diamagnetic,</b> thus it will float in mid-air above a strong magnet. If it is made in a fluidized bed at 1000–1300°C then it is isotropic turbostratic, and is used in blood contacting devices like mechanical heart valves and is called pyrolytic carbon, and is not <b>diamagnetic.</b> Pyrolytic graphite, and pyrolytic carbon are often confused but are very different materials.|$|E
25|$|Generally, strong delocalization in a solid due {{to large}} overlap with {{neighboring}} wave functions {{means that there}} will be a large Fermi velocity; this means that the number of electrons in a band is less sensitive to shifts in that band's energy, implying a weak magnetism. This is why s- and p-type metals are typically either Pauli-paramagnetic or as in the case of gold even <b>diamagnetic.</b> In the latter case the <b>diamagnetic</b> contribution from the closed shell inner electrons simply wins from the weak paramagnetic term of the almost free electrons.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that all}} {{materials}} undergo this orbital response. However, in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances, the <b>diamagnetic</b> effect is {{overwhelmed by the}} much stronger effects caused by the unpaired electrons.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Harold Grad {{theorized that}} a high-beta plasma {{pressure}} {{combined with a}} cusped magnetic field would improve plasma confinement. A <b>diamagnetic</b> plasma rejects the external fields and plugs the cusps. This system would be a much better trap.|$|E
25|$|Anisotropic induced {{magnetic}} field effects {{are the result}} of a local induced {{magnetic field}} experienced by a nucleus resulting from circulating electrons that can either be paramagnetic when it is parallel to the applied field or <b>diamagnetic</b> when it is opposed to it. It is observed in alkenes where the double bond is oriented perpendicular to the external field with pi electrons likewise circulating at right angles. The induced magnetic field lines are parallel to the external field at the location of the alkene protons which therefore shift downfield to a 4.5ppm to 7.5ppm range. The three-dimensional space where a <b>diamagnetic</b> shift is called the shielding zone with a cone-like shape aligned with the external field.|$|E
