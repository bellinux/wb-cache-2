50|$|There is a {{physical}} quantity closely linked to free energy (<b>free</b> <b>enthalpy),</b> with a unit of entropy and isomorphic to negentropy known in statistics and information theory. In 1873, Willard Gibbs created a diagram illustrating the concept of free energy corresponding to <b>free</b> <b>enthalpy.</b> On the diagram {{one can see the}} quantity called capacity for entropy. This quantity is the amount of entropy that may be increased without changing an internal energy or increasing its volume. In other words, it is a difference between maximum possible, under assumed conditions, entropy and its actual entropy. It corresponds exactly to the definition of negentropy adopted in statistics and information theory. A similar physical quantity was introduced in 1869 by Massieu for the isothermal process (both quantities differs just with a figure sign) and then Planck for the isothermal-isobaric process. More recently, the Massieu-Planck thermodynamic potential, known also as free entropy, has been shown to play a great role in the so-called entropic formulation of statistical mechanics, applied among the others in molecular biology and thermodynamic non-equilibrium processes.|$|E

5000|$|The formal {{thermodynamic}} {{criterion of}} a given monomer polymerizability is related to {{a sign of the}} <b>free</b> <b>enthalpy</b> (Gibbs free energy) of polymerization:where x and y indicate monomer and polymer states, respectively (x and/or y = l (liquid), g (gaseous), c (amorphous solid), c’ (crystalline solid), s (solution)), ΔHp(xy) and ΔSp(xy) are the corresponding enthalpy (SI unit: joule per kelvin) and entropy (SI unit: joule) of polymerization, and T is the absolute temperature (SI unit: kelvin).The <b>free</b> <b>enthalpy</b> of polymerization (ΔGp) may be expressed as a sum of standard enthalpy of polymerization (ΔGp°) and a term related to instantaneous monomer molecules and growing macromolecules concentrations: where R is the gas constant, M is the monomer, (m)i is the monomer in an initial state, and m* is the active monomer.Following Flory-Huggins solution theory that the reactivity of an active center, located at a macromolecule of a sufficiently long macromolecular chain, does not depend on its degree of polymerization (DPi), and taking in to account that ΔGp° = ΔHp° - TΔSp° (where ΔHp° and ΔSp° indicate a standard polymerization enthalpy and entropy, respectively), we obtain: At equilibrium (ΔGp = 0), when polymerization is complete the monomer concentration (Meq) assumes a value determined by standard polymerization parameters (ΔHp° and ΔSp°) and polymerization temperature:Polymerzation is possible only when M0 > Meq. Eventually, at or above the so-called ceiling temperature (Tc), at which Meq = M0, formation of the high polymer does not occur. For example, tetrahydrofuran (THF) cannot be polymerized above Tc = 84 °C, nor cyclo-octasulfur (S8) below Tf = 159 °C. [...] However, for many monomers, Tc and Tf, for polymerization in the bulk, are well above or below the operable polymerization temperatures, respectively.The polymerization of a majority of monomers is accompanied by an entropy decrease, due mostly to the loss in the translational degrees of freedom. In this situation, polymerization is thermodynamically allowed only when the enthalpic contribution into ΔGp prevails (thus, when ΔHp° < 0 and ΔSp° < 0, the inequality |ΔHp| > -TΔSp is required). Therefore, the higher the ring strain, the lower the resulting monomer concentration at equilibrium.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{coupling}} to fructose transport in Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides {{is achieved}} by phosphorylation of the membrane-spanning fructose-specific carrier protein, EIIFru. The phosphoryl group of phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred to EIIFru via the cytoplasmic component SF (soluble factor). The standard <b>free</b> <b>enthalpy</b> of hydrolysis of the two phosphorylated proteins has been estimated from isotope exchange measurements in chemical equilibrium. The ΔG° for SF-P is - 60. 5 kJ/mol. The standard <b>free</b> <b>enthalpy</b> for hydrolysis of EII-P is - 37. 9 kJ/mol, but - 45. 2 kJ/mol when SF is still complexed to it, as in the overall reaction. Therefore the standard <b>free</b> <b>enthalpy</b> of hydrolysis of SF · EII-P is 70 % of the standard <b>free</b> <b>enthalpy</b> of hydrolysis of P-enolpyruvate. The measurements reveal two regulation sites in the system. First, the phosphorylation of SF is inhibited by pyruvate when the concentration ratio of pyruvate/P-enolpyruvate becomes too high. Second, a low concentration of internal fructose prevents the phosphorylation of the carrier by the internal fructose- 1 -P pool when the concentration of the latter becomes too high or the phosphorylation rate by P-enolpyruvate too slow. Furthermore comparison of the isotope exchange and the overall phosphotransferase reaction kinetics leads {{to the conclusion that}} binding of fructose to the carrier is a slow step relative to the phosphoryl group transfer from EIIFru to fructose. ...|$|E

The conversion and thus the propensity of PrPC to adopt alternative folds leads to the species-specific propagation of the disease. High pressure is a powerful tool to study the physico-chemical properties of proteins {{as well as the}} dynamics and structure of folding intermediates. Results Conformational intermediates of the human prion protein huPrPC were characterized by a combination of hydrostatic pressure (up to 200 MPa) with two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. All pressure effects showed to be reversible and there is virtually no difference in the overall pressure response between the folded core of the N-terminal truncated huPrPC(121 – 230) and the full-length huPrPC(23 – 230). The only significant differences in the pressure response of full-length and truncated PrP suggest that E 168, H 187, T 192, E 207, E 211 and Y 226 are involved in a transient interaction with the unfolded N-terminus. High-pressure NMR spectroscopy indicates that the folded core of the human prion protein occurs in two structural states N 1 and N 2 in solution associated with rather small differences in <b>free</b> <b>enthalpies</b> (3. 0 kJ/mol). At atmospheric pressure approximately 29 % of the protein are already in the pressure favored conformation N 2.

They could represent preaggregation states of the protein that coexist at ambient pressure with a very small population of approximately 1. 2 % and less than 0. 1 %.
