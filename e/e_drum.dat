50|$|St. John's Church was {{organized}} on December 26, 1799. George Drum (the first) was {{a founding member}} of the church. By April 18, 1809, Rev. Frederick Van de Sloat wrote a constitution and by-laws for the government of the congregation. The subscribers to this document were George Drum, John Balliet Sr, Philip Woodring, Jacob Speth, George Wenner, S. Earles, Jacob Balliet, Peter Hill, John Balliet Jr, Peter Scheide, Michael Beishline, Jacob Drumheller, A. Maurer, P. Ruth, J. Fuse, J. Wenner, H. Maurer, George Beishline, and Michael Bitterle. One of the founders, Jacob Drumheller (in the Drum family tree), built the first building in what became Hazleton, Pennsylvania in 1809. Many founding members of the Drum family have their final resting place at St. John's Cemetery, including the original George Drum and wife Anna Margaret Woodring; Philip Drum and second wife Magadalena, Jacob Drum and wife Susan Mochamaer, Abraham Drum and wife Magdalene, John Drum and wife Anna Marie, and Isaac Drum. Present day descendants are also buried at St. Johns such as Edward T. Drum (Corporal — Sergeant j in WW II, d. 1995 & father of Gary <b>E.</b> <b>Drum,</b> Richard, & Nancy). Edward is the 3rd great grandson of George Drum Sr.. St. Johns has become the family's primary cemetery for the past 215 years.|$|E
40|$|Metal wires of Pb and FeSi_ B_ were {{produced}} by the In-Rotating-Water Spinning Method. The locus of molten jet in the water layer was measured from the photograph {{for a variety of}} spinning conditions, i. <b>e.</b> <b>drum</b> velocity, jet ejection velocity, incidence angle and nozzle diameter. It was compared with the locus predicted with taking into account of various forces acting on the jet in the water. Experimentally obtained locus agreed well with the prediction for Fe_ B_ but disagree for Pb when marked ripples were formed on the wire surface...|$|E
40|$|The WIPP TruDock {{crane system}} {{located in the}} Waste Handling Building was {{identified}} in the WIPP Safety Analysis Report (SAR), November 1995, as a potential accident concern due to failures which {{could result in a}} dropped load. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the frequency of failure of the TruDock crane system resulting in a dropped load and subsequent loss of primary containment, i. <b>e.</b> <b>drum</b> failure. The frequency of dropped loads was estimated to be 9. 81 E- 03 /year or approximately one every 102 years (or, for the 25 % contingency, 7. 36 E- 03 /year or approximately one every 136 years). The dominant accident contributor was the failure of the cable/hook assemblies, based on failure data obtained from NUREG- 0612, as analyzed by PLG, Inc. The WIPP crane system undergoes a rigorous test and maintenance program, crane operation is discontinued following any abnormality, and the crane operator and load spotter are required to be trained in safe crane operation, therefore it is felt that the WIPP crane performance will exceed the data presented in NUREG- 0612 and the estimated failure frequency is felt to be conservative...|$|E
