5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon <b>is</b> <b>full,</b> but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon <b>is</b> <b>full</b> to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E

5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution {{is likely to be}} overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E
5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} trips {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when the bike is withdrawn from a dock to when it is returned. (If a destination station <b>is</b> <b>full,</b> riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E
5|$|Black {{returns to}} Seattle, researching Gehenna Industries from his home. He uncovers a {{warehouse}} address {{belonging to the}} cult, which Atkins investigates. The warehouse <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of cached weaponry, stockpiled for the cult's doomsday predictions. The cult's leader lures Atkins into the industrial microwave which {{has been used to}} immolate the victims, but the police arrive in time to save him, having been tipped off by Black that Atkins may be in danger. The weapons stockpile allows the police to bring down the cult, but Black is certain that their influence is still a threat.|$|E

5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch <b>is</b> <b>full,</b> it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
5|$|Cascioferro's life <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of {{myth and}} mystery. He became a legend {{even when he}} was alive, and that legend is {{partially}} responsible for creating the image of the gallant gentleman capomafia (Mafia boss). He is widely considered to have been responsible for the 1909 murder of Joseph Petrosino, head of the New York City police department's Italian Squad. However, he was never convicted of the crime.|$|E
5|$|Codex Boreelianus, Codex Boreelianus Rheno-Trajectinus (full name), {{designated}} by Fe or 09 in the Gregory-Aland numbering and ε 86 in von Soden numbering, is a 9th (or 10th) century uncial manuscript {{of the four}} Gospels in Greek. The manuscript, written on parchment, <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of lacunae (or gaps), many of which arose between 1751 and 1830. The codex was named Boreelianus after Johannes Boreel (1577–1629), who brought it from the East.|$|E

5|$|Crossing the Water <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of {{perfectly}} realised works. Its most striking impression is of a front-rank {{artist in the}} process of discovering her true power. Such is Plath's control that the book possesses a singularity and certainty which should make it as celebrated as The Colossus or Ariel.|$|E
5|$|Featuring {{a number}} of erudite characters, The Elegance of the Hedgehog <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of allusions to {{literary}} works, music, films, and paintings. It incorporates themes relating to philosophy, class consciousness, and personal conflict. The events and ideas of the novel are presented through the thoughts and reactions, interleaved throughout the novel, of two narrators, Renée and Paloma. The changes of narrator are marked by switches of typeface. In the case of Paloma, the narration {{takes the form of}} her written journal entries and other philosophical reflections; Renée's story is also told in the first person but more novelistically and in the present tense.|$|E
5|$|Glenn (Steven Yeun), at {{the urging}} of Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn), finally tells the group that the Greene family's barn <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of walkers. The group {{inspects}} the barn, and Shane (Jon Bernthal) believes they should clear the barn, but Rick (Andrew Lincoln) believes they need to get Hershel (Scott Wilson)'s blessing since they are still guests on his property. Shane criticizes Rick for continuing the seemingly pointless search for Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, infuriating Daryl (Norman Reedus).|$|E

50|$|However, {{studies show}} that two-thirds of primes of the form 40k+n, where n ∈ {7, 11, 17, 19, 21, 23, 29, 33} <b>are</b> <b>full</b> reptend primes. For some sequences, the {{preponderance}} of <b>full</b> reptend primes <b>is</b> much greater. For instance, 285 of the 295 primes of form 120k+23 below 100000 <b>are</b> <b>full</b> reptend primes, with 20903 being the first that <b>is</b> not <b>full</b> reptend.|$|R
5|$|In {{the prose}} section {{at the end}} of Lokasenna, the gods catch Loki and bind him with the innards of his son Nari, while they turn his son Narfi into a wolf. Skaði places a venomous snake above Loki's face. Venom drips from the snake and Loki's wife Sigyn sits and holds a basin beneath the serpent, {{catching}} the venom. When the basin <b>is</b> <b>full,</b> Sigyn must empty it, and during that time the snake venom falls onto Loki's face, causing him to writhe in a tremendous fury, so much so that all earthquakes stem from Loki's writhings.|$|E
5|$|Lately, Cookie {{has also}} taught {{children}} {{the importance of}} eating a balanced diet. This doesn't mean that Cookie rounds out his diet with plates, trucks, ukuleles, and other objects the munching monster {{has been known to}} devour. This means that Cookie now eats a fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set a good example for viewers at home. And Cookie doesn't mind a bit. Sure he loves cookies, but he likes the act of eating in general. As long as his mouth <b>is</b> <b>full,</b> his heart is happy.|$|E
5|$|Phips finally sailed for England on November 17. Increase Mather {{was asked}} to go along in support but decided against it, citing the {{difficulty}} of the journey, though his diary from the time <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of yearning to return to England. They were still friendly, but it seems their coalition and partnership was in tatters.|$|E
30|$|Several {{important}} aspects critical to Billie’s understanding of empty, full and half <b>full</b> <b>were</b> {{identified in this}} task. He was able to match the words half full {{with the image of}} a half full bottle. He could match the full bottle with the word full by seeing the item, however Billie saw that two bottles <b>were</b> <b>full</b> stating “both bottles <b>are</b> <b>full</b> and no bottle is empty”. Whilst Billie was able to identify the “half” shaded area in the half <b>full</b> bottle, he <b>was</b> not able to differentiate which bottles <b>was</b> <b>full</b> and empty using the shading as a guide.|$|R

5|$|Poe eschewed the {{scientific}} method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. Even so, Eureka <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.|$|E
5|$|Regularity {{and order}} are common {{features}} in Toraja wood carving (see table below), {{as well as}} abstracts and geometrical designs. Nature is frequently {{used as the basis}} of Toraja's ornaments, because nature <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of abstractions and geometries with regularities and ordering. Toraja's ornaments have been studied in ethnomathematics to reveal their mathematical structure, but Torajans base this art only on approximations. To create an ornament, bamboo sticks are used as a geometrical tool.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{asserted}} that the film's music mainly lifted {{to the success of}} Bandslam from reviews, especially the ska version of Everything I Own, that the film <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of unexpected pleasures set to a surprisingly retro soundtrack. Similarly, Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter emphasized the effect of the film's music-driven comedy set against the backdrop of a high school battle of the bands competition which manages {{to come up with a}} fresh backbeat for the familiar alienated teen refrain, boosted by a talented cast and authentic soundtrack.|$|E
