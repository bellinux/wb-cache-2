25|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), {{which oversees}} the {{regulation}} of antimicrobial agents and materials in that country, found that copper alloys kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. Copper and copper alloys are unique classes of solid materials as no other solid touch surfaces have permission in the U.S. to make human health claims (EPA public health registrations were previously restricted only to liquid and gaseous products). The EPA has granted antimicrobial registration status to 355 different copper alloy compositions. In healthcare applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, intravenous poles, computer keyboards, etc. In public facility applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include health club equipment, elevator equipment, shopping cart handles, etc. In residential building applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include kitchen surfaces, bedrails, <b>footboards,</b> door push plates, towel bars, toilet hardware, wall tiles, etc. In mass transit facilities, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include handrails, stair rails grab bars, chairs, benches, etc. A comprehensive list of copper alloy surface products that have been granted antimicrobial registration status with public health claims by the EPA can be found here: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products.|$|E
2500|$|A {{pilot was}} usually {{fixed to the}} front end of locomotives, {{although}} in European and a few other railway systems including New South Wales, they were considered unnecessary. Plough-shaped, sometimes called [...] "cow catchers", they were quite large and were designed to remove obstacles from the track such as cattle, bison, other animals or tree limbs. Though unable to [...] "catch" [...] stray cattle, these distinctive items remained on locomotives until the end of steam. Switching engines usually replaced the pilot with small steps, known as <b>footboards.</b> Many systems used the pilot and other design features to produce a distinctive appearance.|$|E
2500|$|EMD's diesel {{program was}} well {{underway}} {{in the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, thanks {{to the success of}} the company's FT demonstrations across the country. [...] While the F-units in production were great for moving trains over the railroad, their full-width carbody made it difficult for locomotive crews to see to the rear of the locomotive. This was considered a worthwhile sacrifice for a mainline locomotive, which was expected to do little switch work, since the full width carbody type was considered much more handsome and stylish, if lacking in the utility of the more functional looking switch engines, with their square lines, walkways and handrails, and narrow cowling covering their mechanical parts. [...] The F-units also lacked locations for brakemen or switchmen to stand and ride short distances while performing switching duties, such as the fore and aft platforms, <b>footboards</b> and handrails provided on diesel switchers, which were too small and slow for road service. [...] The F-units did have grab irons and stirrup steps, but these features were a hindrance in locations with tight clearances.|$|E

60|$|Two months later, as the Deputy had foretold, Nature {{began to}} audit her {{accounts}} {{with a red}} pencil. On {{the heels of the}} spring-reapings came a cry for bread, and the Government, which had decreed that no man should die of want, sent wheat. Then came the cholera from all four quarters of the compass. It struck a pilgrim-gathering of half a million at a sacred shrine. Many died at the feet of their god; the others broke and ran over the face of the land carrying the pestilence with them. It smote a walled city and killed two hundred a day. The people crowded the trains, hanging on to the <b>footboards</b> and squatting on the roofs of the carriages, and the cholera followed them, for at each station they dragged out the dead and the dying. They died by the roadside, and the horses of the Englishmen shied at the corpses in the grass. The rains did not come, and the earth turned to iron lest man should escape death by hiding in her. The English sent their wives away to the hills and went about their work, coming forward as they were bidden to fill the gaps in the fighting-line. Holden, sick with fear of losing his chiefest treasure on earth, had done his best to persuade Ameera to go away with her mother to the Himalayas.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} a system to prevent {{accidents}} occurring due to <b>footboard</b> travelling in buses. Tragedies resulting from <b>footboard</b> travelling in buses {{are one of the}} prominent examples of road accidents. A 16 year old student was travelling on the <b>footboard</b> of an over crowded MTC (Metropolitan Transport Corporation) bus at Velachery, Chennai, in September, 2010. The youngster was crushed to death under the wheels of the bus when he slipped and fell down. In another incident, a speeding bus, having passengers hanging on the <b>footboard,</b> was hit by a lorry on Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Chennai, in December, 2012. Four students were fatally caught between the bus and the lorry. The basic principle behind the working of the proposed system is to stop the bus from moving when someone stands on the <b>footboard.</b> Even though automatic doors are available, the negligence of the bus drivers to close the door before starting the bus makes the automatic doors moot. But the system ensures that the bus does not move unless the foot board has no passengers and more importantly, only when the doors are closed. In this way, human interference is completely removed there by reducing the number of deaths drastically...|$|R
