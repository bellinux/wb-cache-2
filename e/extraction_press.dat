40|$|The {{changes in}} the {{concentration}} of pigments in the skin and the three pulp sections of the Persea americana (Hass var.) and the extracted oil up to 13 days after harvest at 20 °C were identified and quantified by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). In the fresh tissue, seven pigments identified belonging to the carotenoid family were lutein, β-carotene, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin and α-carotene. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, pheophytin a and pheophytin b, chlorophyllide a and chlorophyllide b were identified and measured. In the oil extracted using Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE), lutein and antheraxanthin were identified. Neoxanthin, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin were not present. The [β-carotene and α-carotene were not tested due to the limitation of the method used in the oil determination. Chlorophyllide a and chlorophyllide b were absent. In the pulp starting from the dark pulp adjacent to the skin towards the stone, the carotenoid and chlorophyll concentrations in the fresh tissue and the extracted oil both showed a decreasing pattern. The highest oil yield {{was found to be}} between days 6 and day 8 after harvest. The pigment composition patterns of the avocado fresh tissue correspond to that of the extracted oil. There was an on-going increase in the concentration of the total anthocyanins in the avocado skin. The major anthocyanin identified was cyanidin 3 -O-glucoside. Cold pressed avocado oil in the laboratory and in a commercial factory with different levels of skin included during the malaxing were produced. The peroxide value, free fatty acid value, fatty acid composition and antifungal diene were measured to determine the quality of avocado oil with different levels of skin. These showed that the addition of skin had no effect on the quality of oil produced. The addition of skin during cold <b>pressed</b> <b>extraction</b> increased the pigment levels. The stability of factory cold pressed avocado oil with added skin was investigated using accelerated shelf life testing. The addition of skin during avocado oil production in the factory shortened the shelf life. Storage of avocado oil under dark and at lower temperatures (≤ 20 °C) provided greater stability for avocado oil pigments. The levels of antifungal diene in the avocado oil were undetectable. The comprehensive data regarding pigment composition obtained in this research may be of used in food technology, nutrition, postharvest management and gene technology.

In 1992 and 2004 a total of 38 producers were interviewed. Seeds of two species (Carapa procera D. C. and Carapa guianensis Aubl.) were used for oil extraction. The complex process requires about two months and can be divided into three stages: 1. seed collection by gathering and storing good seed (3 - 5 days). 2. "seed cake" preparation by cooking the seeds in boiling water (1 - 3 hours), followed by a second storage period (up to 20 days), completed by removing the seed coat and kneading the seed mass; 3. Oil extraction (up to 30 days) by collecting the oil dripping from the "seed cake" placed on an inclined plate. Oil extracted in the shade was considered of better quality than in the sun, but the process needed more time. A second <b>extraction</b> with the <b>press</b> ("tipiti") used for manioc flour was rarely used. Comparing the methods of the producers, some minor variations were observed apparent consequences in yield as well as quality. The first and second stages of the process involved the collaboration of relatives and/or neighbors, whereas the last stage was executed by only one woman. Transmission of traditional knowledge is passed from generation to generation by orality and observation. This study revealed that young persons no longer participated. This may cause, in the near future a loss of knowledge and skill in performance for crabwood seed oil extraction by the traditional method...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Beauty Leaf tree (Calophyllum inophyllum) is a {{potential}} source of non-edible vegetable oil for producing future generation biodiesel because {{of its ability to}} grow {{in a wide range of}} climate conditions, easy cultivation, high fruit production rate, and the high oil content in the seed. This plant naturally occurs in the coastal areas of Queensland and the Northern Territory in Australia, and is also widespread in south-east Asia, India and Sri Lanka. Although Beauty Leaf is traditionally used as a source of timber and orientation plant, its potential as a source of second generation biodiesel is yet to be exploited. In this study, the extraction process from the Beauty Leaf oil seed has been optimised in terms of seed preparation, moisture content and oil extraction methods. The two methods that have been considered to extract oil from the seed kernel are mechanical oil extraction using an electric powered screw press, and chemical oil extraction using n- hexane as an oil solvent. The study found that seed preparation has a significant impact on oil yields, especially in the screw <b>press</b> <b>extraction</b> method. Kernels prepared to 15 % moisture content provided the highest oil yields for both extraction methods. Mechanical extraction using the screw press can produce oil from correctly prepared product at a low cost, however overall this method is ineffective with relatively low oil yields. Chemical extraction was found to be a very effective method for oil extraction for its consistence performance and high oil yield, but cost of production was relatively higher due to the high cost of solvent. However, a solvent recycle system can be implemented to reduce the production cost of Beauty Leaf biodiesel. The findings of this study are expected to serve as the basis from which industrial scale biodiesel production from Beauty Leaf can be made...|$|R
40|$|Fish is an {{important}} source of protein providing essential amino acids. Imported fish oil are expensive, scarce and sometimes unavailable. However, extraction of oil from indigenous fish species will provide cheap, abundant and readily available product. This study therefore, aimed at the extraction of fish oil from Brycinus nurse. A total of 1368 g of B. nurse was procured from Lake Alau, Borno State. The fish were divided into four samples A, B, C and D respectively. Sample A was oven dried for a period of 60 minutes, at maximum temperature of 70 oC, sample B for 90 minutes at a maximum temperature of 96 oC, sample C for 60 minutes at maximum of 96 oC, and sample D for 90 minutes at a maximum temperature of 70 oC. After oven drying, the samples were immediately transferred to mechanical workshop for oil <b>extraction</b> using hydraulic <b>press.</b> The characterization and the quality of fish oil were measured using the acid value, saponification value and relative density. Results showed that the fish oil from samples A, B, C, and D had acid value of 3. 57 mg/KOH, 3. 59 mgKOH, 2. 9 mg/KOH, and 2. 75 mg/KOH respectively, the saponification value of 82. 8 mg/KOH/g, 94. 42 mg/KOH/g, 82. 8 mg/KOH/g, and 70 mg/KOH/g respectively while the relative density was found to be 0. 04305 for sample A, 0. 04301 for sample B, sample C 0. 0433 and sample D 0. 04307. It can be concluded that the fish oil values falls within the acceptable standard value which are suitable for application in pharmaceutical and food industries. Therefore, Brycinus nurse has the potential of producing fish oil for domestic and industrial use...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the evolutions of {{the different}} needs related to the food and non food uses of conventional oil crops (palm, cotton, groundnuts), immerging and marketable oil culture (shea) {{as well as the}} domestic oil cultures (Canarium, safou). Africa accounts for about 6. 5 % of the total World production of palm oil. In the last few years palm oil has witnessed an evolution in Africa through the diversification of its uses. A lot has also been done on the use of palm oil as bio-fuels. The production of cotton seed oil has equally witnessed changes from <b>press</b> <b>extraction</b> followed by solvent extraction to direct extraction with pure solvents followed by neutralisation in an appropriate medium as major innovations. West Africa produces about 50 % of the total groundnuts production in Africa. Small scale processing of groundnuts is more popular than industrial processing. This is justified by the diverse uses {{of the different}} groundnut byproducts. The most remarkable innovations concern the emerging oil cultures such as shea butter. In fact the incorporation of 5 % shea butter in chocolate formulations has given an added value to shea. Techniques have been put in place for improving on the production methods and quality of the butter. The evolution in this sector is better illustrated by the putting in place of an indirect solar dryer and a vertical manual screw press. The big handicap that slows down evolution remains {{at the level of the}} transfer of technology to the rural milieu. Problems on the transfer preservation of Canarium were resolved by preserving them in appropriate media and conditions. Dried safou fruits can now be found in the market. This illustrates the appropriation of technology by small and medium sized enterprises...|$|R
