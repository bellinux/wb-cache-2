40|$|This paper {{describes}} a torque-vectoring (TV) algorithm {{for the control}} of the <b>hitch</b> <b>angle</b> of an articulated vehicle. The <b>hitch</b> <b>angle</b> control function prevents trailer oscillations and instability during extreme cornering maneuvers. The proposed control variable is a weighted combination of terms accounting for the yaw rate, sideslip angle and <b>hitch</b> <b>angle</b> of the articulated vehicle. The novel control variable formulation results in a single-input single-output (SISO) feedback controller. In the specific application a simple proportional integral (PI) controller with gain scheduling on vehicle velocity is developed. The TV system is implemented and experimentally tested on a fully electric vehicle with four on-board drivetrains, towing a single-axle passive trailer. Sinusoidal steer test results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the behavior of the articulated vehicle, and justify further research on the topic of <b>hitch</b> <b>angle</b> control through TV...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case study of {{reinforcement}} learning on a real robot that learns how to back up a trailer and discuss the lessons learned about the importance of proper experimental procedure and design. We identify areas of particular concern to the experimental robotics community at large. In particular, we address concerns pertinent to robotics simulation research, implementing learning algorithms on real robotic hardware, and the diculties involved with transferring research between the two. 1 Introduction The project we describe in this case study uses a connectionist reinforcement learning scheme to learn to solve a control problem. The specic control problem is learning how to back a cab and trailer rig to a target location by steering the front wheels of the cab. The inputs into the robot consist of the <b>hitch</b> <b>angle</b> as well as the angle of the rear trailer to the target. The output is the direction to turn the steering mechanism. This system uses laterally connected articia [...] ...|$|E
40|$|An optimal {{reconfiguration}} {{control scheme}} based on control allocation (CA) is proposed to stabilize the yaw dynamics of the tractor-semitrailer vehicle. The proposed control scheme is a two-level structure consisting of an upper level of sliding mode yaw moment controller (SMYC) and a lower optimal brake force distributor (BFD). The upper SMYC is designed to follow the tractor yaw rate and {{the combination of the}} <b>hitch</b> <b>angle</b> and trailer slip angle and outputs the corrective yaw moment, respectively, for the tractor and the trailer. The optimal brake force allocation and reconfigurable control problem is transformed to a problem of error minimization and control minimization combination formulated by constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) optimization and further solved with active set (AS) algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the CA technique-based optimal reconfigurable control is rather effective for the tractor-semitrailer vehicle to enhance the yaw stability performance and the reliability in case of actuator failure thanks to the multiple-axle structure enriching the alternatives of possible actuator combinations in CA optimization...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{control scheme}} is {{proposed}} to improve the yaw stability of a tractor semitrailer vehicle in critical situations. The control scheme is a two-layer structure consisting of an upper yaw moment controller and a lower brake force distributor. The tractor and the trailer are, respectively, stabilized by two independent fuzzy logic based yaw moment controllers. The controllers for the tractor and the trailer are, respectively, designed to track the reference yaw rate of the tractor and the <b>hitch</b> <b>angle</b> between the tractor and the trailer while considering the variation of the hitch angular rate at the same time. The corrective yaw moments determined by the corresponding upper fuzzy yaw moment controllers are realized by active wheel braking. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated by simulations on a nonlinear vehicle model. The results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme is robust and effective in stabilizing the severe instabilities such as jackknife and trailer oscillation in the chosen simulation scenarios. It is believed that this control scheme is robust to the variation of road adhesion conditions...|$|E
40|$|Driving {{vehicles}} {{with one or}} more passive trailers has difficulties in both forward and backward motion due to inter-unit collisions, jackknife, and lack of visibility. Consequently, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for multi-trailer combinations can be beneficial to accident avoidance as well as to driver comfort. The ADAS proposed in this paper aims to prevent unsafe steering commands by means of a haptic handwheel. Furthermore, when driving in reverse, the steering-wheel and pedals can be used as if the vehicle was driven {{from the back of the}} last trailer with visual aid from a rear-view camera. This solution, which can be implemented in drive-by-wire {{vehicles with}} <b>hitch</b> <b>angle</b> sensors, profits from two methods previously developed by the authors: safe steering by applying a curvature limitation to the leading unit, and a virtual tractor concept for backward motion that includes the complex case of set-point propagation through on-axle hitches. The paper addresses system requirements and provides implementation details to tele-operate two different off- and on-axle combinations of a tracked mobile robot pulling and pushing two dissimilar trailers...|$|E
40|$|Dangerous goods vehicles, in {{particular}} those carrying fluid loads, {{have been identified}} as needing to meet stringent performance requirements within the Performance Based Standards (PBS) developed by the National Roads and Transport Commission in Australia. The opportunity to control the lateral dynamics of these multiply-articulated vehicles with active steering systems deployed on the trailers has been identified by a number of groups worldwide, but research into the dynamics, and modern control strategies to modify these dynamics, is sparse. RABiT at the University of Melbourne identified a need to address the gaps in this knowledge and has proposed a prototype vehicle with trailer steer control that could gain unrestricted route access under PBS with significant mass increases when compared to current, similarly configured vehicles. This paper illustrates the modelling approach taken {{for the development of a}} trailer steer control algorithm, in which the <b>hitch</b> <b>angle</b> between successive articulated units is allowed to be large (in contrast to most previous work where small angle assumptions are made). It is shown by comparison with simulations performed with a complex, nonlinear 3 D mode...|$|E
40|$|Articulated {{vehicles}} {{are widely used}} in the economically vital cargo industry as they provide a greater maneuverability than their rigid counterparts. Hence, autonomous driving systems for articulated vehicles have become the subject of intense research in the robotic community. This thesis analyzes the reverse motion of an articulated vehicle, namely a tractor-trailer with one on-axle hitched semitrailer, and develops a full autonomous driving system that enables reverse parking {{in the presence of}} static obstacles. The motion controller used in the autonomous driving system is based on a two-level feedback control system, with a path stabilization controller in the first level and a <b>hitch</b> <b>angle</b> controller in the second level. The path planner used is a modified RRT planner where the Dubins path has been incorporated in order to enable the planning towards a goal pose rather than merely a goal region. The modifications made have resulted in several improvements, such as more accurate planning and higher computational efficiency. Using a 1 : 32 scale remote controlled tractor-trailer, and a Qualisys motion capture system for pose estimation, the autonomous driving system was successfully implemented and validated...|$|E
