5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later {{explained that he was}} deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E
5|$|Ste told Amy's father Mike to {{look after}} Lucas and Leah in the {{aftermath}} of the baby plot because he didn't think he was a good father. Richardson reported that he enjoyed working with Jude and Jessica Croft-Lane, the young actors who played Lucas and Leah. He reported that Jude was camera shy and liked to play with camera equipment during filming and that he told Croft-Lane that his name was actually Ste. Richardson concluded the storyline was different and he felt <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> chance to showcase his acting abilities.|$|E

That {{election was}} a turning point in Miller's career, arguing <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> desire to prove himself a cultural conservative. One cited piece of evidence is that in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, he gradually shifted from being pro-choice to pro-life.|$|E

Both parents served as cooks and housekeepers for director Brian De Palma. Milla's father was convicted and imprisoned for participating in an illegal operation concerning medical insurance; {{he was given a}} 20-year sentence in 1994, but was released in 1999 after serving five years. According to Jovovich, [...] "Prison was good for him. He's become a much better person. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> chance to stop and think." ...|$|E
500|$|On Inflikted, Max was the group's {{songwriter}} and lyricist. At {{the time}} of the album recording, he was watching the same four movies almost every day: Apocalypse Now, City of God, A Clockwork Orange, and La Haine. Max revealed to Revolver that he wanted to do something different, and <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> lot of ideas.

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 744, he met Li Bai (Li Po) for the first time, and the two poets formed a friendship. David Young {{describes}} this as [...] "the most significant formative element in Du Fu's artistic development" [...] because <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> living example of the reclusive poet-scholar life {{to which he was}} attracted after his failure in the civil service exam. The relationship was somewhat one-sided, however. Du Fu was by some years the younger, while Li Bai was already a poetic star. We have twelve poems to or about Li Bai from the younger poet, but only one in the other direction. They met again only once, in 745.|$|E
500|$|In 1874 Fauré {{moved from}} Saint-Sulpice to the Église de la Madeleine, acting as deputy for the {{principal}} organist, Saint-Saëns, during the latter's many absences on tour. Some admirers of Fauré's music have expressed regret {{that although he}} played the organ professionally for four decades, he left no solo compositions for the instrument. He was renowned for his improvisations, and Saint-Saëns said of {{him that he was}} [...] "a first class organist when he wanted to be". Fauré preferred the piano to the organ, which he played only because <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> regular income. Duchen speculates that he positively disliked the organ, possibly because [...] "for a composer of such delicacy of nuance, and such sensuality, the organ was simply not subtle enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Ed Wood: Burton {{approached}} Depp and [...] "within 10 {{minutes of}} hearing about the project, I was committed," [...] the actor remembers. At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking. By accepting this part, <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> [...] "chance to stretch out and have some fun", and working with Martin Landau, [...] "rejuvenated my love for acting". Depp was already familiar with some of Wood's films through John Waters, who had shown him Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda. To {{get a handle on}} how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that [...] "he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood." [...] Depp also borrowed some of Kasem's cadence and [...] "that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice".|$|E

500|$|On April 15, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln {{called for}} 50,000 volunteers {{to fight to}} {{preserve}} the Union. [...] The following day, Bosbyshell joined the Washington Artillerists, a local militia company, which quickly set out for Washington. [...] En route, the company had to march {{through the streets of}} Baltimore on April 17. [...] A hostile crowd of Confederate sympathizers gathered; according to accounts in his lifetime, he was struck by a missile variously described as a stone or a brick. Although <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> large bruise and momentarily stunned him, the object drew no blood; Private Bosbyshell was purportedly the first man wounded in the Union cause, while an African-American servant, hit a few minutes later by a missile which broke the skin, was deemed the first man to have shed his blood for the Union. [...] However, official records do not list Bosbyshell among the casualties of the Baltimore riots.|$|E
500|$|Martin Conway {{describes}} {{the portrayal of}} a dignified man marked by a grave expression and deep [...] "furrows ploughed by seventy years of labour and sorrow". Conway believed {{the strength of the}} portrait is in part achieved through Dürer's ability to convey this hardship, {{while at the same time}} presenting a man still imbued with traces of pride, and possessing [...] "a kind old face". Noting the obvious affection between the father and son as well as the half smile of the older man, he wonders if that grin might have been born of Albrecht the Elder's satisfaction that his toil has been rewarded by a son of such talent, who was now about to set out on the world for his wanderjahr. A contributing factor to this pride is that Albrecht the Elder trained his son in his own profession, as a jeweller, but at one point came to regret the choice of apprenticeship as the younger man was so obviously suited to drawing and painting. However, his son learned many skills during that period and <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> discipline with his hands that became a defining factor of his work, especially in his ability as an engraver.|$|E
500|$|By mid-2000s, the Ballymun towers were in {{the process}} of being torn down, and the Ballymun area was the target of a €1.8billion {{regeneration}} scheme intended to create a self-sustaining community of 30,000 people that would be more successful than the original 1960s plan. [...] Despite their failure as housing, the towers had left a long cultural legacy, of which [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was the first and perhaps best-known exemplar; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin. [...] Former towers residents were not always happy with the song. [...] Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time. [...] But she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media. [...] She thus wrote, [...] "regardless of what U2 say in their song, 'Running to Stand Still', there was certainly more than one way out." [...] In a newspaper interview, Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect: [...] "It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture an unemployed person, living alone in a flat in Ballymun, listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying." [...] She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself, and said, [...] "Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> sort of street-cred to associate himself with the estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice, safe, respectable Cedarwood Road in Glasnevin." ...|$|E

500|$|While Sinatra never {{formally}} {{learned how}} to read music, he had a fine, natural understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities {{in all aspects of}} music. He did, however, learn to follow a lead sheet during a performance by [...] "carefully following the patterns and groupings of notes arranged on the page" [...] and made his own notations to the music, using his ear to detect semi-tonal differences. Granata states that some of the most accomplished classically trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding, and remarked that Sinatra had a [...] "sixth sense", which [...] "demonstrated unusual proficiency when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within the orchestra". Sinatra was an aficionado of classical music, and would often request classical strains in his music, inspired by composers such as Puccini and Impressionist masters. His personal favorite was Ralph Vaughan Williams. [...] He would insist on always recording live with the band because <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> [...] "certain feeling" [...] to perform live surrounded by musicians. By the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an air check of some compositions by Alec Wilder which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: [...] "Air for Oboe", [...] "Air for English Horn", [...] "Air for Flute", [...] "Air for Bassoon", [...] "Slow Dance" [...] and [...] "Theme and Variations". The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present. At one recording session with arranger Claus Ogerman and an orchestra, Sinatra heard [...] "a couple of little strangers" [...] in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors. Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist {{and the author of the}} words to the Jobim melody [...] "This Happy Madness", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on Sinatra & Company (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.|$|E

2500|$|He {{joined the}} Royal Navy because <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> chance {{to leave home}} {{four or five years}} earlier than the Army.
