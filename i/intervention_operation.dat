40|$|One of {{the great}} unknowns in {{international}} finance is {{the process by which}} new information influences exchange rate behavior. This paper focuses on one important source of information to the foreign exchange markets, the <b>intervention</b> <b>operations</b> of the G- 3 central banks. Previous studies using daily and weekly foreign exchange rate data suggest that central bank <b>intervention</b> <b>operations</b> can influence both the level and variance of exchange rates, but little is known about how exactly traders learn of these operations and whether intra-daily market conditions influence the effectiveness of central bank interventions. This paper uses high-frequency data {{to examine the relationship between}} the efficacy of <b>intervention</b> <b>operations</b> and the 'state of the market' at the moment that the operation is made public to traders. The results indicate that some traders know that a central bank is intervening at least one hour prior to the public release of the information in newswire reports. Also, the evidence suggests that the timing of <b>intervention</b> <b>operations</b> matter <b>interventions</b> that occur during heavy trading volume and that are closely timed to scheduled macro announcements are the most likely to have large effects.

40|$|The {{scale of}} {{unilateral}} and coordinated {{intervention in the}} foreign exchange market by the G- 5 countries has become considerably larger {{over the last few}} years, following a period in which official U. S. policy was opposed to intervention. This paper examines market responses to official sterilized central bank intervention policy over the period 1985 through 1987. The efficacy of sterilized intervention is hypothesized to depend on the market's belief that central banks both have "inside" information about future monetary policy and the incentive to reveal that information truthfully through intervention signals. Central banks may agree to coordinate their <b>intervention</b> <b>operations</b> in order to influence the market's perception of the relative importance and credibility of own signals. Market responses to intervention over the period 1985 through 1987 are examined econometrically using heretofore unavailable daily data on G- 3 unilateral and coordinated <b>intervention</b> <b>operations.</b> The empirical evidence indicates that: (1) even though daily intervention data are not published, market participants were generally able to comtemporaneously observe the source and magnitude of central bank <b>intervention</b> <b>operations,</b> (2) unilateral <b>intervention</b> significantly influenced market expectations in some periods, and (3) coordinated intervention had a significantly different and longer-term influence on market expectations than did unilateral intervention over the three year period examined. ...|$|R

5000|$|Increasing bank reserve {{requirements}} and sterilization: some countries pursue a {{fixed exchange rate}} policy. In the face of large net capital inflow, those countries would intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent exchange rate appreciation. Then sterilize the monetary impact of intervention through open market operations and through increasing bank reserves requirements. For example, when hot money originated from the U.S. enters China, investors would sell US dollars and buy Chinese yuan in the foreign exchange market. This would put upward pressure {{on the value of}} the yuan. In order to prevent the appreciation of the Chinese currency, the central bank of China print yuan to buy US dollars. This would increase money supply in China, which would in turn cause inflation. Then, the central bank of China has to increase bank {{reserve requirements}} or issue Chinese government bonds to bring back the money that it has previously released into the market in the exchange rate <b>intervention</b> <b>operation.</b> However, like other approaches, this approach has limitations. The first, the central bank can't keep increasing bank reserves, because doing so would negatively affect bank's profitability. The second, in the emerging market economies, the domestic financial market is not deep enough for open market operations to be effective.|$|E
50|$|When the Nixon shock {{happened}} in August 1971, BOJ should have appreciated the currency {{in order to}} avoid inflation. However, they still kept the fixed exchange rate as 360Yen/$ for two weeks, so it caused excess liquidity. In addition, they persisted with the Smithsonian rate (308Yen/$), and continued monetary easing until 1973. This created a greater than 10% inflation rate at that time. In order to control the stagflation, they raised the official bank rate from 7% to 9% and gradually skyrocketing prices ended in 1978. In 1979, when the energy crisis happened, they raised the official bank rate rapidly. BOJ succeeded in a quick economic recovery. After overcoming the crisis, they reduced the official bank rate. In 1980, BOJ reduced the official bank rate from 9.0% to 8.25% in August, to 7.25% in November, and to 5.5% in December in 1981. Reaganomics was set in America, and USD became strong. However, Japan tried to make fiscal reconstruction at that time, so they did not stop their financial regulation. In 1985, the agreement of G5 nations, known as the Plaza agreement, USD slipped down and Yen/USD changed from 240yen/$ to 200yen/$ at the end of 1985. Even in 1986, USD continued to fall and reached 160yen/$. In order to escape deflation, BOJ cut the official bank rate from 5% to 4.5% in January, to 4.0% in March, to 3.5% in April, 3.0% in November. At the same time, the government tried to raise the demand in Japan in 1985, and did economy policy in 1986. However, the market was confused about the rapid fall of USD. After Louvre Accord in February 1987, BOJ decreased the official bank rate from 3% to 2.5%, but JPN/USD was 140yen/$ at that time and reached 125yen/$ in the end of 1987. BOJ kept the official bank rate at 2.5% until May in 1989. The financial and fiscal regulation led to a widespread over-valuing of real estate and investments and Japan faced a bubble at that time.After 1990, the stock market and real asset market fell, at that time BOJ regulated markets until 1991 in order to end the bubble. In 1994, a terrible earthquake happened and Japanese yen became weaker and weaker. JPM/USD reached 80yen/$, so BOJ had to reduce the office bank rate to 0.5% and Japanese yen recovered. The long deflation for 20 years started at that time. In 1999, BOJ started zero-interest-rate policy, but they ended it despite government opposition when the IT bubble {{happened in}} 2000. However, Japan faced economic bubble burst in 2001, BOJ adopted the balance of current account as the main operating target for the adjustment of the financial market in March 2001 (quantitative relaxation policy), shifting from the zero-interest-rate policy. From 2003 to 2004, Japanese government did exchange <b>intervention</b> <b>operation</b> in huge amount, and the economy recovered a lot. In March 2006, BOJ finished qualitative easing, and finished the zero-interest-rate policy in June and raised to 0.25%. In 2008, the financial crisis happened, and Japanese economy turned to bad again. BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate to 0.3% and adopted the supplemental balance of current account policy. In December 2008, BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate again to 0.1% and they started to buy Japanese Government Bond (JGB).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Gene Expression Programming (GEP) is a {{powerful}} evolutionary method for knowledge discovery and model learning, which simulates the process of natural evolution, and has the phenomena of low converging speed and readily being premature. After the birth of human society, the evolution processes of nature world and human show a rising acceleration characteristic under the artificial intervention. Inspired by this, this paper proposes a double system gene expression programming (DS-GEP), which consists of natural evolution system and artificial intervention system. The artificial intervention system includes individual <b>intervention</b> <b>operation</b> and population <b>intervention</b> <b>operation.</b> The individual <b>intervention</b> <b>operation</b> aims to repair the unfeasible genes in individuals with superior genes from gene pool. The population <b>intervention</b> <b>operation</b> uses extinction/restart strategy to form new population with high diversity after the evolution has fallen into stagnation. To validate the superiority of DS-GEP, DS-GEP and the standard GEP and an improved GEP in the relevant literatures are compared as regards enough function finding problems. The test results show that DS-GEP can overcome the stagnation and premature convergence phenomenon effectively during the evolutionary process, and promises competitive performance.

Using daily exchange rate and official intervention data from January 1984 to December 2001, this paper examines what effects, if any, foreign exchange operations by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have had on the level and volatility of the Australian dollar exchange rate. First, using an event study we {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} intervention by examining its direct effect on the level of the exchange rate. We find that over the period 1997 - 2001, the RBA has had some success in its <b>intervention</b> <b>operations,</b> by moderating the depreciating tendency of the Australian dollar.

40|$|Foreign {{exchange}} intervention operations are a controversial policy option for central banks. In one view, intervention {{policy is not}} only ineffective in influencing the level or volatility of exchange rates, but the policy is also dangerous, because it can interfere with a central bank’s monetary policy objectives.
