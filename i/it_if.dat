5|$|After {{the family}} obtains the CCOD, they usually engage a funeral {{director}} (also {{known as an}} undertaker) who collects the body, embalms <b>it</b> <b>if</b> necessary, and delivers it to the wake.

The funeral director also helps to make arrangements for the wake and funeral, according to the religious beliefs and wishes of the family.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> warning colouration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage, it would never last in the species long enough to become beneficial.|$|E

50|$|That is, {{the only}} general {{way to know}} for sure if a given program will halt on a {{particular}} input in all cases is simply to run <b>it</b> and see <b>if</b> <b>it</b> halts. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> does halt, then you know <b>it</b> halts. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> doesn't halt, however, you may never know <b>if</b> <b>it</b> will eventually halt. The language consisting of all Turing machine descriptions paired with all possible input streams on which those Turing machines will eventually halt, is not recursive. The halting problem is therefore called non-computable or undecidable.|$|R

5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering <b>it</b> <b>if</b> dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at {{a high risk of}} drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E

5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores <b>it</b> <b>if</b> the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the capture rate, making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a capture rate of its own as well.|$|E

5|$|Cooperative {{multitasking}} {{made its}} Macintosh debut in March 1985 {{with a program}} called Switcher by Andy Hertzfeld, which allowed the user to launch multiple applications and switch between them. Many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher. Also, Switcher did not display windows of other applications beside the selected one. It was not included with the operating system, but was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called MultiFinder instead, which was much more mature and widely used in System 6. MultiFinder could be enabled or disabled, with a reboot. If disabled, the Finder would quit when the user launched another application, thus freeing RAM for <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> enabled, the system behaved as in the nowadays familiar multitasking tradition, with the desktop and windows of other applications in the screen's background.|$|E
5|$|Despite the warlike {{customs of}} the Vikings, {{there was an}} element of fear {{surrounding}} death and what belonged to <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> the deceased was a revenant or draugr, such a sight was frightful and ominous and usually it was interpreted {{as a sign that}} additional family members would die. It was first and foremost in times of starvation, when communities were struck with a series of misfortunes, that rumours about revenants began to flourish. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The dead person had to die anew; a stake could be put through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living.|$|E
