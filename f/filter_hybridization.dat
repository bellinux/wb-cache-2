The inversion thus defines an ancient evolutionary split within the family and suggests that the Barnadesiinae represents the most primitive lineage in the Asteraceae. These results also indicate that the tribe Mutisieae is not monophyletic, since any common ancestor to its four subtribes is also shared by other tribes in the family.

40|$|Previous work {{suggested}} that the tufA gene, encoding protein synthesis elongation factor Tu, was transferred from the chloroplast to the nucleus within the green algal lineage giving rise to land plants. In this report we investigate the timing and mode of transfer by examining chloroplast and nuclear DNA from the three major classes of green algae, with emphasis on the class Charophyceae, the proposed sister group to land plants. <b>Filter</b> <b>hybridizations</b> reveal a chloroplast tufA gene in all Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae and in some but not all Charophyceae.

The method has been applied to human skeletal muscle, where the analysis of the transcription profile is particularly difficult for the presence of several very abundant transcripts. To detect and quantify high-level mRNAs, the first 1054 ESTs were obtained from randomly selected clones. The 10 most abundant transcripts accounted for > 45 % of the clones.

Initial characterizations of this library by colony <b>filter</b> <b>hybridizations</b> have led to the identification of a previously undetected M. musculus minor satellite as well as to clones containing M. musculus major satellite sequences. This new satellite is repeated 10 - 20 times less than the major satellite in the M. musculus genome. It has a repeat length of 130 nucleotides compared with the M. musculus major satellite with a repeat length of 234 nucleotides. Sequence analysis of the minor satellite has shown that it has a 29 base pair region with extensive homology to one of the major satellite repeating subunits. We also show by in situ hybridization that this minor satellite sequence is located at the centromeres and possibly the arms of at least half the M musculus chromosomes. Sequences related to the minor satellite have been found in the DNA of a related Mus species, Mus spretus, and may represent the major satellite of that species...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{conditions}} for the screening of cervical scrapes for human papillomavirus (HPV) were investigated by using <b>filter</b> in situ <b>hybridization.</b> Since integrated and episomal HPV can be found, cell lines containing viral DNA in an integrated form (HPV in CaSki) or in an episomal state (BK virus-induced hamster tumor cells) were used for optimization experiments. An increase in sensitivity was achieved by alkaline denaturation and neutralization before the specimens were spotted onto the membrane. This increase was 5 -fold for the episomal virus and 16 -fold for the integrated virus in the model system, as compared with other methods. To evaluate this method on clinical material, 1, 963 cervical scrapes were screened {{for the presence of}} HPV 6 / 11 and HPV 16. Nineteen scrapes were positive for HPV 6 / 11 or HPV 16; and in 1, 810 scrapes, no HPV 6 / 11 or HPV 16 could be detected by the modified <b>filter</b> in situ <b>hybridization</b> technique.

There is hope that the application of molecular detection methods such as indirect immunofluorescence or in situ hybridization (ISH) will allow for more rapid and accurate identification. Here we describe a B. forsythus-specific probe (BFV 530), complementary to 16 S rRNA, which correctly identified all B. forsythus isolates as confirmed by biochemical, protein, or fatty acid analysis. To assess whether this probe might be suitable for direct identification of B. forsythus in clinical specimens, a total of 92 subgingival plaque samples were analyzed.

40|$|Several plant {{mitochondrial}} genomes contain repeated sequences {{that are}} postulated to be sites of homologous intragenomic recombination (1 - 3). In this report, {{we have used}} <b>filter</b> <b>hybridizations</b> to investigate sequence relationships between the cloned mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) recombination repeats from turnip, spinach and maize and total mtDNA isolated from thirteen species of angiosperms. We find that strong sequence homologies exist between the spinach and turnip recombination repeats and essentially all other mitochondrial genomes tested, whereas a major maize recombination repeat does not hybridize to any other mtDNA. The sequences homologous to the turnip repeat {{do not appear to}} function in recombination in any other genome, whereas the spinach repeat hybridizes to reiterated sequences within the mitochondrial genomes of wheat and two species of pokeweed that do appear to be sites of recombination. Thus, although intragenomic recombination is a widespread phenomenon in plant mitochondria, it appears that different sequences either serve as substrates for this function in different species, or else surround a relatively short common recombination site which does not cross-hybridize under our experimental conditions. Identified gene sequences from maize mtDNA were used in heterologous hybridizations to show that the repeated sequences implicated in recombination in turnip and spinach/pokeweed/wheat mitochondria include, or are closely linked to genes for subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase and 26 S rRNA, respectively. Together with previous studies indicating that the 18 S rRNA gene in wheat mtDNA is contained within a recombination repeat (3), these results imply an unexpectedly frequent association between recombination repeats and plant mitochondrial genes...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of Agrobacterium tumefaciens mutants with Tn 5 insertions in chromosomal DNA {{showed that the}} chromosome of A. tumefaciens codes for a specific ability of this bacterium to attach to plant cells. This ability is associated with tumorigenesis by A. tumefaciens, the ability of avirulent A. tumefaciens to inhibit tumorigenesis, {{and the ability to}} adsorb certain phages. A second class of chromosomal mutations affects tumorigenesis without altering the ability to attach to plant cells. The attachment of A. tumefaciens to plant cells was assayed by mixing radiolabeled bacteria with suspensions of tobacco tissue culture cells or freshly isolated Zinnia leaf mesophyll cells. Under the conditions of this assay, an avirulent Ti plasmid-cured strain attached to the same extent as the same strain containing pTiB 6806. Six of eight avirulent mutants with Tn 5 insertions in chromosomal DNA showed defective attachment, whereas two retained wild-type attachment ability. In contrast to the strains showing wild-type attachment, the attachment-defective mutants failed to inhibit tumorigenesis when inoculated onto Jerusalem artichoke slices before inoculation of a virulent strain and also showed a loss of sensitivity to two Agrobacterium phages. The loss of phage sensitivity appeared to be due to a loss of ability to adsorb the phages. Staining with Calcofluor indicated that the mutants retained the ability to synthesize cellulose fibrils, which have been implicated in the attachment process.

This study investigated whether simian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA sequences can be detected in specimens from pediatric patients affected by severe postengraftment HC. METHODS: The clinical diagnosis of HC was made in 7 of 28 BMT children. DNA from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) and urine sediment cells and supernatants was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), AV, BKV, JC virus (JCV), and SV 40.

Four of these fragments, three from pPP 6520 and one from pPP 6525 of strain PP 652, hybridized strongly to plasmid DNA from a closely-related pathovar, P. syringae pv. glycinea. BamHI fragment 8, which is involved in the integration of pMC 7105 into the host chromosome, contains a repeat sequence that was present on all the plasmids except pPP 6120 (6. 8 kbp), pPP 6310 (40 kbp), and pPP 6520 (45 kbp). Every plasmid but pPP 6520 had fragments that showed weak hybridization to the small plasmid, pPP 6120. This homology suggests that a second repetitive sequence is common to these plasmids. The large plasmids (148 to 151 kbp) were essentially identical to pMC 7105. The intermediate plasmids (122 to 128 kbp) appeared to be derived mainly from pMC 7105 or a related plasmid, whereas the smaller plasmids (6. 8 to 45 kbp) appear to have been derived in part from sequences not present in pMC 7105...|$|R
