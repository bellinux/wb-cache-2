50|$|Although {{the opening}} {{time of a}} bash valve is fixed, imprecisely {{controlled}} and always occurs near top dead centre, {{this is not a}} major drawback for a steam engine. A more important requirement is the ability to accurately control the closing time of the valve, and for its duration to be adjustable in order to 'drive' the engine, according to varying load. Some designs of uniflow engine have used a combined mechanical and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>valve</b> to do this. The valve is opened mechanically, then held by an electromagnet. This requires less electrical power to merely hold the valve than to open it. A patent for such an engine was granted to Sturtevant in 1968.|$|E
