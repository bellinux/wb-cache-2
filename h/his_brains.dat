25|$|Soon after, Captain Britain {{learned of}} Betsy's {{activities}} with X-Force through their bond {{and decided to}} retrieve her to Otherworld, where Jamie Braddock was revealed to be alive, and punish Fantomex for his crimes. Betsy took up the Lady Briton mantle to rescue Fantomex and was ultimately forced to kill Jamie {{in order to prevent}} his future self from destroying the multiverse. X-Force faced a new Brotherhood of Mutants, of which the Shadow King was a member. Psylocke imprisoned his psyche for good into Omega White, whose ability was to eat psychic energy. After this last mission, X-Force disbanded for good and Fantomex, who had been keeping a relationship with Betsy, but died {{at the hands of the}} Brotherhood, was resurrected in three different bodies for each of <b>his</b> <b>brains.</b>|$|E

[...] The settlers cut Yagan's head from his body, and skinned his back to obtain his tribal markings as a trophy. They buried the bodies a short distance away.|$|E

In The Jewish Chronicle he wrote in 1932, [...] "In every country you can find rabid people who have a phobia against Jews, Jesuits, Armenians, Negroes, Freemasons, Irishmen, or simply foreigners as such.

When they return, Alton receives a message from Elaine, who will arrive in thirty minutes, which worries them both.|$|E
500|$|Cagney's {{next film}} was Mister Roberts, {{directed}} by John Ford and slated to star Spencer Tracy. [...] Tracy's involvement ensured that Cagney accepted a supporting role, {{although in the}} end, Tracy did not take part. Cagney had worked with Ford before on What Price Glory?, and they had gotten along fairly well. However, as soon as Ford met Cagney at the airport, the director warned him that they would [...] "tangle asses", which caught Cagney by surprise. He later said, [...] "I would have kicked <b>his</b> <b>brains</b> out. He was so goddamned mean to everybody. He was truly a nasty old man." [...] The next day, Cagney was slightly late on set, incensing Ford. Cagney cut short his imminent tirade, saying [...] "When I started this picture, you said that we would tangle asses before this was over. I'm ready now – are you?" [...] Ford walked away, {{and they had no}} more problems, though Cagney never particularly liked Ford.|$|E
500|$|The head wounds are {{consistent}} with a 1485 poem by Guto'r Glyn in which a Welsh knight, Sir Rhys ap Thomas killed Richard and [...] "shaved the boar's head". It had been {{thought that this was}} a figurative description of Richard being decapitated, but the skeleton's head had clearly not been severed. Guto's description may instead be a literal account of the injuries that Richard suffered, as the blows sustained to the head would have sliced away much of his scalp and hair and slivers of bone. Other contemporary sources refer explicitly to head injuries and the weapons used to kill Richard; the French chronicler Jean Molinet wrote that [...] "one of the Welshmen then came after him, and struck him dead with a halberd", and the Ballad of Lady Bessie recorded that [...] "they struck his bascinet to his head until <b>his</b> <b>brains</b> came out with blood." [...] Such accounts would certainly fit the damage inflicted on the skull.|$|E

500|$|Anthony, {{along with}} brother Tyler, were {{announced}} as new characters in May 2011, played by Lapinskas and Discipline respectively, although Tyler made his debut {{at an earlier}} date. Described as someone who [...] "will rely on <b>his</b> <b>brains</b> and natural wit to find a more sensitive solution to any conflict", it is found out that Anthony has a gambling problem before his character arrived in Walford, which is later a focus {{of one of the}} storylines. Lapinskas said of his relationship with half-brother Michael that Anthony [...] "idolises" [...] him, and that Michael [...] "corrupted" [...] Anthony. When Eddie leaves, Anthony takes charge of his antiques business. Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said that the Moon brothers would bring a new element to the show. Inside Soap held a poll to see which of the new Moon family members, Eddie, Tyler or Anthony, its readers were most looking forward to seeing; Anthony came third with 12per cent of the vote. Lapinskas quit the show in May 2012. He left EastEnders on 30 August 2012.|$|E
500|$|When Kirk and Spock are {{traveling}} {{on a public}} bus, they encounter a punk rocker blaring his music on a boom box, to the discomfort of everyone around him. Spock takes matters {{into his own hands}} and performs a Vulcan nerve pinch. Part of the inspiration for the scene came from Nimoy's personal experiences with a similar character on the streets of New York; [...] " [...] by the arrogance of it, the aggressiveness of it, and I thought if I was Spock I'd pinch <b>his</b> <b>brains</b> out!" [...] On learning about the scene, Kirk Thatcher, an associate producer on the film, convinced Nimoy to let him play the role; Thatcher shaved his hair into a mohawk and bought clothes to complete the part. Credited as [...] "punk on bus", Thatcher (along with sound designer Mark Mangini) also wrote and recorded [...] "I Hate You", the song in the scene, and it was his idea to have the punk—rendered unconscious by the pinch—hit the stereo and turn it off with his face.|$|E

500|$|Cobby {{shot down}} three German {{aircraft}} on 28June and was recommended for a bar to his DFC, highlighting his then-current tally of 15 victories. On 15July 1918, he and another pilot dived on five Pfalz scouts near Armentières, Cobby accounting {{for two of}} the enemy aircraft and his companion for one. The Australians were then pursued by four Fokker Triplanes but managed to evade their attackers. This action earned Cobby a recommendation for a second bar to his DFC, the citation noting that he had scored 21 kills to date and had [...] "succeeded in destroying so many machines by hard work and by using <b>his</b> <b>brains,</b> as well as by courage and brilliant flying". The two bars to his DFC were gazetted on the same day, 21September. On 16August, Cobby led a bombing raid against the German airfield at Haubourdin, near Lille, the largest aerial assault by Allied forces up until then, resulting in 37 enemy aircraft being destroyed. The following day he led a similar attack on Lomme airfield and was recommended for the Distinguished Service Order as a result. Gazetted on 2November, the citation for the award declared that [...] "The success of these two raids was largely due to the determined and skilful leadership of this officer".|$|E

[...] "He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ... Peggy says, 'Forget this. I'm Peggy Carter. I'm going to do something else.' I think that's the difference between the two of them." [...] Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, [...] "I think there’s definitely a situation where … if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It’s like if your new girlfriend dated Ryan Gosling. It’s going to make you sweat a bit." [...] For the second season, Gjokaj said, [...] "you’ll see him deal with actually being part of the machine. Not trying to get [...] the machine, but being the boss. The first season was him trying to be listened to, and now he’s being listened to by a lot of people." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Sousa wears [...] "sweater vests under his sport coats and pleated pants".|$|E
500|$|Moran {{cared for}} Poe at the for-profit Washington College Hospital on Broadway and Fayette Street. He was denied any {{visitors}} and was confined in a prison-like room with barred windows {{in a section}} of the building reserved for drunk people. Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name [...] "Reynolds" [...] on the night before his death, though no one has ever been able to identify the person to whom he referred. One possibility is that he was recalling an encounter with Jeremiah N. Reynolds, a newspaper editor and explorer who may have inspired the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. Another possibility is Henry R. Reynolds, one of the judges overseeing the Fourth Ward Polls at Ryan's Tavern, who may have met Poe on Election Day. Poe may have instead been calling for [...] "Herring", as the author had an uncle-in-law in Baltimore named Henry Herring. In later testimonies Moran avoided reference to Reynolds but mentioned a visit by a [...] "Misses Herring". He also claimed he attempted to cheer up Poe during {{one of the few times}} Poe was awake. When Moran told his patient that he would soon be enjoying the company of friends, Poe allegedly replied that [...] "the best thing his friend could do would be to blow out <b>his</b> <b>brains</b> with a pistol".|$|E
