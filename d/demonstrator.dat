5|$|Devoting himself {{largely to}} {{scientific}} study, Dudley received a B. S. {{degree from the}} University of Cincinnati in 1880, after becoming a <b>demonstrator</b> of chemistry at Miami Medical College the previous year. He was appointed professor of analytic chemistry at Miami in 1880, and received an honorary M.D. degree in 1885.|$|E
5|$|From 1883-1884, Thompson {{stayed in}} Cambridge as {{so-called}} Junior <b>Demonstrator</b> in physiology, teaching students. In 1884, {{he was appointed}} Professor of Biology (later Natural History) at University College, Dundee, a post he held for 32 years. One of his first tasks {{was to create a}} Zoology Museum for teaching and research, now named after him.|$|E
25|$|At about 5.30 pm, the {{demonstration}} {{started to move}} down Jagtvej towards the neighborhood of Frederiksberg. The demonstration had only moved about 300 meters when the police moved in and blocked it. The police surrounded the <b>demonstrators</b> with armoured cars. Loudspeakers then declared {{the demonstration}} illegal and ordered the <b>demonstrators</b> to disperse. The <b>demonstrators</b> responded by bombarding the police with fireworks, cobblestones, and bottles filled with paint. The police used armoured cars to split {{the main body of}} <b>demonstrators</b> into smaller groups. The <b>demonstrators</b> then moved downtown and vandalized a number of shops. The police used tear gas to disperse the <b>demonstrators.</b> By {{the end of the day}} the police had arrested 300 <b>demonstrators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} police crackdown, Bahrain Defense Force tanks {{occupied}} Pearl Roundabout to stop <b>demonstrators</b> from occupying the area. [...] Some <b>demonstrators</b> who {{stayed close to}} Salmaniya Hospital where injured <b>demonstrators</b> were being assisted tried to retake Pearl Roundabout and headed towards the area. <b>Demonstrators</b> were shot by forces camping in Pearl Roundabout.|$|R
50|$|<b>Demonstrators</b> {{greeted the}} Springboks {{when they arrived}} in Brisbane on 22 July 1971. Approximately 300 <b>demonstrators</b> were present, and {{the same number of}} police. While police {{assaulted}} some <b>demonstrators</b> during this first demonstration, it was the demonstration on 24 July that was the most volatile. The number of police had increased to around 500, with country police brought in to add to the numbers. When police commissioner Ray Whitrod gave the order for the police to move forward, intending to move <b>demonstrators</b> from the road, police charged. <b>Demonstrators</b> were forced to move by police who tackled and hit them with batons. Mass arrests of <b>demonstrators</b> also resulted from these demonstrations.|$|R
5|$|Su-37: Technology <b>demonstrator,</b> {{converted}} from the eleventh developmental Su-27M (T10M-11). The Su-37 featured a digital fly-by-wire flight-control system, a glass cockpit, the N011M radar, and AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. The aircraft was later fitted with standard-production AL-31F engines, and had its flight-control system and cockpit systems revised.|$|E
5|$|After Crawford graduated, Professor A. J. Herbertson {{offered him}} {{a job as a}} junior <b>demonstrator</b> in the university's {{geography}} department. Crawford agreed, and served in the teaching position over the ensuing year. Through Herbertson, Crawford was introduced to the geographer Patrick Geddes. Crawford then decided to focus his attentions on archaeology rather than geography even though few professional positions in the field existed in Britain at the time. Looking elsewhere for archaeological employment, he unsuccessfully applied for a Craven Fellowship and for a post at Bombay Museum.|$|E
5|$|Gripen NG: {{improved}} version following on {{from the}} Gripen Demo technology <b>demonstrator.</b> Changes from the JAS 39C/D include the more powerful F414G engine, Raven ES-05 AESA radar, increased fuel capacity and payload, two additional hardpoints, and other improvements. These improvements have reportedly increased the Gripen NG costs to an estimated 24,000 Swiss Francs (US$27,000) per hour, and increased the flyaway cost to 100 million Swiss Francs (US$113M).|$|E
50|$|When {{the police}} {{advanced}} {{to meet the}} <b>demonstrators,</b> one of the marchers fired a shot. The police charged and a general brawl ensued in which two policemen and fifteen German <b>demonstrators</b> were wounded, one fatally.Over 60 <b>demonstrators</b> were arrested.|$|R

5|$|Martin {{was awarded}} the Fred Knight Research Scholarship in 1923, which allowed him to {{continue}} his research with Laby. He earned extra money as a <b>demonstrator</b> in the Department of Natural Philosophy, and he lectured in the evenings at the Working Men's College. Laby nominated him for an 1851 Research Fellowship and a free trip to England to study physics under Ernest Rutherford at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed Senior Prom was a {{classified}} black program {{conducted by the}} United States Air Force {{in conjunction with the}} Lockheed Corporation's Skunk Works for the development and testing of a cruise missile using stealth technology. Based on the company's Have Blue <b>demonstrator,</b> the six Senior Prom vehicles proved successful in testing conducted at Area 51 in the late 1970s; despite this, the aircraft was not selected to enter production, and the program was terminated in the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} demonstration {{was recorded}} at 05:30 in the mainly Shia village of Nuwaidrat, where 300 people {{are said to}} have participated. The rally was led by Shia political activist Abdulwahhab Hussain.

50|$|Sublieutenant Steinhäuser, who had {{orders to}} stop the <b>demonstrators,</b> ordered his patrol to give warning shots and then to shoot {{directly}} into the <b>demonstrators.</b> Seven men were killed and 29 were seriously injured. Some <b>demonstrators</b> also opened fire. Steinhäuser was severely injured by rifle-butt blows and shots, but contrary to later statements, he was not killed. After this incident, commonly viewed {{as the starting point}} of the German revolution, the <b>demonstrators</b> dispersed and the patrol withdrew.|$|R
50|$|On November 16, {{hundreds}} of <b>demonstrators,</b> {{many of whom}} were California college students, marched through downtown San Francisco to protest the continuing tuition and fee hikes proposed and approved by the University of California Regents. Along the way, about 200 <b>demonstrators</b> staged a sit-in at a Bank of America branch. The bank was chosen because UC Regent Monica Lozano is on the bank's board of directors. Some <b>demonstrators</b> jumped on desks and wrote on the wall in chalk. One man was seen urinating in the corner. Roughly 100 <b>demonstrators</b> remained in the branch, set up a tent, sat down, and linked arms. 95 <b>demonstrators</b> were arrested for trespassing.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the debate, {{several hundred}} <b>demonstrators</b> {{gathered}} {{close to the}} Arnolfini, including anti-capitalist groups, Palestine groups and some English Defence League members. Between six and nine <b>demonstrators</b> were arrested before the debate for public order offences, as <b>demonstrators</b> clashed with Avon and Somerset Police with shields and horse-mounted officers.|$|R
5|$|Today's lecture {{will include}} a {{repetition}} of a demonstration which failed last time. A large dog, stretched on its back on an operation board, is carried into the lecture-room by the <b>demonstrator</b> and the laboratory attendant. Its legs are fixed to the board, its head is firmly held in the usual manner, and it is tightly muzzled.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not designed to be a technology <b>demonstrator,</b> unlike its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|HB1001 {{made its}} first flight on 1December1977 {{at the hands of}} Lockheed test pilot, Bill Park. He would fly the next four sorties, all chased by a T-38 piloted by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ken Dyson. Dyson, an F-15 Eagle pilot, was {{previously}} approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976. He made his first flight on HB1001 on 17January1978, chased by Park. In fact, the two would be the only test pilots of Have Blue, alternating between the <b>demonstrator</b> and the chase plane. Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW system. At the same time, they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft's behavior.|$|E

5|$|In February 1966, Sukarno {{promoted}} Suharto to lieutenant-general (and to full {{general in}} July 1966). The {{killing of a}} student <b>demonstrator</b> and Sukarno's order for the disbandment of KAMI in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around Merdeka Palace during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to Bogor Palace (60km away) by helicopter. Three Suhartoist generals, Major-General Basuki Rahmat, Brigadier-General M Jusuf, and Brigadier-General Amirmachmud went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they Persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see Supersemar) that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 was an American single-seat, {{twin-engine}} fighter aircraft technology <b>demonstrator</b> {{designed for}} the United States Air Force (USAF). The design was a finalist in the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter competition, and two prototypes were built for the demonstration/validation phase of the competition. The YF-22 won the contest against the Northrop YF-23, and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The YF-22 has similar aerodynamic layout and configuration as the F-22, but with differences in the position and design of the cockpit, tail fins and wings, and in internal structural layout.|$|E
5|$|The player {{would sit}} at the stand and press the buttons to make their moves, while one panel of lights showed {{the state of the}} game, and another showed the computer's {{calculations}} during its move. The computer could be set to make its calculations at various speeds, slowing down so that the <b>demonstrator</b> could describe exactly what the computer was doing in real time. A visual guide attached to the Nimrod explained what the computer was doing during its turn, as well as showing possible game states and how they would be represented by the lights. Signs stating which player's turn it was and whether one or the other had won would light up as appropriate during gameplay.|$|E
50|$|August 5, 2009, Kurdish <b>demonstrators</b> {{clashed with}} police in Diyarbakir, {{injuring}} one policeman as police were pelted with molotov cocktails and stones. 11 <b>demonstrators</b> were arrested.|$|R

25|$|After {{the violent}} crash, the <b>demonstrators</b> returned; {{the siege of}} the {{parliament}} was given up in the evening. Yet <b>demonstrators</b> started the siege of police headquarters near the Government House. The <b>demonstrators</b> called for the counter-attack on police force, then new clash erupted, causing {{the death of a}} female protester and injury of several protesters. The PAD leaders called the <b>demonstrators</b> to return to the Government House and limit the protest only at their 'stronghold', at the House, avoid using violence. Then calm returned to Bangkok.|$|R
5|$|With the {{prospect}} of no operational aircraft being available to fulfill the RAF's strike role, BAC decided to revamp the AFVG design, eliminating the carrier capabilities that were no longer necessary, into a larger, more strike-oriented variable geometry aircraft. Holding contracts were issued to BAC to support the project, which had been re-designated as the United Kingdom Variable Geometry (UKVG) aircraft. In November 1967, BAC issued a brochure on the UKVG proposal; various proposals would be issued to cover {{the use of multiple}} different engines. The quick production of a <b>demonstrator</b> aircraft, powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce/MAN Turbo RB153 turbofan engines, was also mooted.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, {{in the face}} of the {{emerging}} Cold War scenario, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. By this time, it had also become apparent that newly developed jet propulsion would form the future of fighter aircraft development. Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. Hawker Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the <b>demonstrator</b> failed to interest them. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, both features that rapidly became obsolete.|$|E
5|$|In 17 April 2015, Airbus Group {{distributed}} {{a project}} presentation video, {{made by the}} communication agency Clipatize, on its YouTube channel. In 25 September 2015, Toulouse métropole broadcasts a promotional video on its YouTube channel. Toulouse metropolis is presented as an attractive ecosystem, able to build the future and highlights its visibility internationally. The Air-Cobot <b>demonstrator</b> was chosen to illustrate the robotics research of this metropolis. Located at Laboratoire d'analyse et d'architecture des systèmes during development, researchers or engineers working on the project regularly present a demonstration to visitors (external researchers, industrial partners, or students); it was also demonstrated {{to the general public}} during the 2015 Feast of Science. Airbus Group, in 17 February 2016, broadcast a YouTube video presentation of its vision of the hangar of the future in which it plans to use Air-Cobot.|$|E
2500|$|Clashes {{continued}} {{for two hours}} until police forces and the Republican Guard began firing bullets into the air {{in an attempt to}} stave off and scare away the <b>demonstrators.</b> Live fire was at some point used against <b>demonstrators</b> in the crowd, killing three <b>demonstrators</b> on the spot and injuring another who died after a week-long coma. After the <b>demonstrators</b> began running away from the main square, hundreds were rounded up by plainclothes police as well as riot police.
