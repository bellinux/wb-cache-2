5|$|Ibn Bajjah (Avempace, c. 1085–1138) {{proposed}} {{that for every}} force there is a reaction force. While he did not specify that these forces be equal, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{an early version of}} Newton's third law of motion.|$|E

50|$|A {{reference}} frame {{can be treated}} in the formalism of quantum theory, and, in this case, such is referred as a quantum {{reference frame}}. Despite different name and treatment, a quantum reference frame still share much of the notions with a reference frame in classical mechanics. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> defined with the same definition. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> always associated to some physical system. And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> always relational.|$|R

5|$|Of {{the roughly}} eight parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet has survived. The others were likely all made extinct by a {{combination}} of excessive hunting and deforestation by humans. Leguat stated that Newton's parakeet was abundant during his stay. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> common when Tafforet visited in 1726, but when Alexandre Pingré mentioned it in 1761, he noted that the bird had become scarce. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> present on southern islets off Rodrigues (Isle Gombrani), along with the Rodrigues parrot. After this point, much of Rodrigues was severely deforested and used for livestock.|$|E
5|$|The campaigning {{season was}} by now well-advanced, as Julian {{had spent a}} {{considerable}} time restoring Saverne. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> summer, as the weather was hot and wheat was ripe in the fields. It was therefore probably August.|$|E

It differs from the actual indigenous Norman dialects of the islands.|$|R

The advance warning time was believed to have prevented many deaths; however, the population was considered complacent with the warning, causing additional damage when they executed improper preparations, such as securing windows.|$|E

5|$|At landfall, Fern had {{weakened}} to {{a strong}} tropical storm as it moved further inland. Because the center of Fern was elongated, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> able to receive moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and as a result, weakening was slow. Between September 10 and September 11, Fern bypassed Corpus Christi, Texas, before dissipating as a tropical depression after crossing the Rio Grande into northern Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Back in England, 256 Operation Mallard gliders {{carrying}} the remaining men and equipment of the 6th Airborne Division took off. Fifteen squadrons of fighter aircraft were deployed by the RAF to escort the gliders and towing aircraft. The force crossed the English channel unhindered, and arrived in Normandy at 21:00. As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> daylight, previous navigation problems that had affected the earlier operations were absent. As the gliders approached the two landing areas {{they met with}} anti-aircraft fire from German defenders on the ground.|$|E
