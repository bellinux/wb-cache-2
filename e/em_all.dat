2500|$|In June 2014, FEMM premiered their sixth single [...] "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" [...] onto YouTube, and {{released}} it {{a month later}} on July 30 through iTunes Store. The song was critically acclaimed from many music critics, many whom praised the song's commercial nature and lyrical message. An accompanying music video was shot for the single; its features FEMM singing and twerking in an overlapped lyric video. The video received {{a large amount of}} favourable feedback, and attracted large attention from several online figures including American blogger and journalist Perez Hilton, American YouTube star Miles Jai, among others. Due to its increasing popularity, the song was featured on the Twerk' <b>em</b> <b>All</b> compilation in July that same year, and gained more international fans from all over the world. In November 2015, [...] "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" [...] surpassed one million views on YouTube; this marks FEMM's highest viewed and first video to reach the one million mark.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{concerns}} {{the use of}} Sequential Monte Carlo methods (SMC) for smoothing in general state space models. A well known problem when applying the standard SMC technique in the smoothing mode is that the resampling mechanism introduces degeneracy of the approximation in the path-space. However, when performing maximum likelihood estimation via the <b>EM</b> algorithm, <b>all</b> involved functionals will be of additive form for a large subclass of models. To cope with the problem in this case, a modification, relying on forgetting properties of the filtering dynamics, of the standard method is proposed. In this setting, {{the quality of the}} produced estimates is investigated both theoretically and through simulations. 1...|$|R

An inductive process is de ned as {{a sequence of}} versions of a theory generated by alternatively applying the inductive inference rules and the revision rule. An inductive procedure is constructed. It takes a sequence EM of instances of a given model M and a given formal theory as its inputs, and generates the inductive processes. It is proved that if <b>EM</b> contains <b>all</b> instances of the model M, then every inductive sequence generated by the procedure is convergent. Its limit is the set of all true statements of the model M...|$|R
