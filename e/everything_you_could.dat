500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Perfect Dark Zero was divided but generally positive, garnering a Metacritic aggregated review score of 81 out of 100 respectively. Writing for GameSpot, Greg Kasavin felt that Perfect Dark Zero [...] "champions the Xbox 360 with its excellent assortment of single and multiplayer game types, {{as well as}} its incredible good looks and dynamic, intense action." [...] He concluded that the game [...] "delivers just about <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hope for from a first-person shooter." [...] Charles Onyett of IGN praised the game's replay value, but also criticised single-player aspects such as the weak artificial intelligence of enemies, commenting that [...] "they never display any advanced assault tactics." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee {{stated the}} song was {{inspired}} by and talked about her relationship with the band's fans, and the realization that following a music career [...] "is what I'm supposed to do". She also explained that the theme of {{the song was}} freedom, saying that the song's lyric [...] "Remember who you really are" [...] was [...] "exactly <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> assume it means". Another inspiration for the song came from Lee's life, [...] "That song is me talking to myself about not being afraid and coming back to this thing and living the life I was born to live. Sometimes, it takes a lot to do this. And I do love it very much, but there is always that fear of putting yourself under the microscope." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, they ranked it as {{the eighth}} {{greatest}} Nintendo game, saying it [...] "had <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> want—heroes, world-shattering events, magic, mindless evil—plus Interceptor the wonder dog!" [...] In 1996, Next Generation said the scene in which Terra cares for a village of orphaned children [...] "can perhaps be safely named as the series' finest hour ... no other game series has tackled such big issues, or reached such a level of emotional depth and complexity." [...] In 2010, Nintendo Power listed the ending to Final Fantasy VI {{as one of the}} best finales, citing the great character moments that cement them as some of the most memorable Final Fantasy protagonists ever; they also listed the opera scene as being a demonstration of how touching and emotional role-playing games can be.|$|E

500|$|Other {{media outlets}} {{received}} the broadcast more positively. Film critic John Hartl of The Seattle Times {{noted that the}} ceremony [...] "was well-paced and filled with comics and comic film clips." [...] He also complimented producer Goldwyn for hiring comics including host Chase and presenters such as Rodney Dangerfield for helping [...] "to keep the show light and funny." [...] The New York Times columnist Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "This was the trimmest, most varied and best-paced program in years." [...] She also commented that without the witty banter of hosts Hogan and Chase, [...] "The show would have seemed notably lacking in luster." [...] Television editor Michael Burkett of the Orange County Register commented, [...] "Monday night's 59th installment was very nearly <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have wished it to be: quite entertaining, relatively fast-moving, unusually short on tastelessness and tackiness drenched in nostalgia, and featuring enough superbly chosen film clips for a monster round of Visual Trivial Pursuit.|$|E
500|$|Gerstmann {{called the}} quality FMV [...] "a small victory {{in a larger}} conflict", saying the game had [...] "too many little {{problems}} to recommend it" [...] and that it [...] "simply doesn't play {{as well as the}} old 16-bit Strike games." [...] Sega Saturn Magazine called it a [...] "worthy addition" [...] to the series and also noted improvements to the Saturn version. GameFan said the game [...] "is <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> wish for from a 32bit Strike" [...] and that [...] "it plays brilliantly, and exercises both your trigger finger and grey matter." [...] The magazine later reflected that the Saturn version was somewhat better but nevertheless very similar to the PlayStation original. It recommended the game to Strike fans but felt it would be an [...] "in at the deep end" [...] introduction for newcomers to the series. Edge summarised: [...] "this is a fairly well-engineered continuation of the four-year-old Strike series", which retains the gameplay of the original but updates the graphics to true 3D. GamePro felt the game might be too slow for fans of faster paced action games, but recommended it for players of previous instalments in the series. Allgame later felt: [...] "The series peaked with the release of Soviet Strike." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{opted not}} to hire A-list celebrities to voice the film's main characters. Afterwards, the {{directors}} continued to audition hundreds of young actresses {{in the hopes of}} finding Rapunzel's voice, among them Broadway performer Idina Menzel, but none sounded quite right until they finally discovered singer and actress Mandy Moore. Describing the opportunity to voice a Disney character as [...] "the ultimate fantasy", Moore was a long-time fan of Disney films. Initially, knowledge that the role was being heavily sought after at the time deterred her from auditioning in favor of avoiding disappointment. Once she made up her mind to audition, Moore [...] "chased after" [...] the role, auditioning for it twice. Because the film is a musical requiring its cast to provide both their characters' speaking and singing voices, all candidates were asked to perform one song of their choice in the style of a singer-songwriter; Moore, a professional singer herself, auditioned with Joni Mitchell's [...] "Help Me". Child actress Delaney Rose Stein was eventually cast as a young version Rapunzel. According to co-director Byron Howard, Moore [...] "has this great soul to her voice" [...] as well as [...] "this down-to-earth, girl-next-door quality that makes her <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hope for in a Disney heroine." ...|$|E

500|$|British {{newspapers}} The Guardian and The Times both {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars. The Times James Bone said that it [...] "boasts the same sly cultural references and flashes of brilliance that have earned the television series a following that ranges from tots to comparative literature PhDs". The Guardians Peter Bradshaw stated that it [...] "gives you <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> possibly want" [...] and that he thought, [...] "Eighty-five minutes [...] not long enough to do justice to 17 years of comedy genius". Ed Gonzalez praised the film for its political message, likening the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon at the beginning to President Schwarzenegger's situation later on, as well as the film's visual gags. Randy Shulman praised the cast, and described them as having [...] "elevated their vocal work to a craft that goes way beyond simple line readings", and particularly praised Kavner who he said [...] "gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever". Roger Ebert gave a positive review, but admitted he was [...] "generally [...] a fan of movies spun off from TV animation". He called it [...] "radical and simple at the same time, subversive and good-hearted, offensive without really meaning to be". Richard Corliss of Time said that the film [...] "doesn't try to be ruder or kinkier, just bigger and better".|$|E
500|$|The Legendary Axe {{received}} positive coverage {{upon its}} release. It was previewed by various video gaming magazines before its release. A preview from Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game [...] "a definite 10" [...] and [...] "one {{of the best}} video games we've ever played". In {{an overview of the}} PC Engine, VideoGames & Computer Entertainment referred to the game as [...] "characteristic of the PC Engine's advanced sound, graphics and game play". A later preview from the same magazine said {{that it was one of}} the console's better games, and they applauded the arcade-like graphics and gameplay. They said that everyone who owned the console should own the game and that it was an [...] "excellent showcase of the game system's capabilities". It was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly in September1989. In the review, Steve Harris said it was one of his favorite games, praising its theme, graphics, sound, and execution; he added that its features were unsurpassed by any video game at the time. Ed Semrad used this game to criticize Rastan, saying The Legendary Axe [...] "is how [...] should have been done". He added that it should be the first game TurboGrafx-16 owners should buy. Donn Nauert called the game one of the best adventure games seen at the time and echoed Harris' praises. Jim Allee repeated Semrad's observation that the game is Rastan but with better graphics; he praised its detailed sprites, the diverse music and gameplay, and difficulty level and concluded that it [...] "is <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> want in a game". Later in that issue Nauert presented a partial walkthrough of the game, where he further praised the game for breathing new life into the platformer genre. An abridged walkthough was published in VideoGames & Computer Entertainment in November1989.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{halves of}} the fifth season {{received}} overwhelming critical acclaim. Following {{the end of the}} series, critic Nick Harley summarized his commendation of the show: [...] "Expertly written, virtuosic with its direction, and flawlessly performed, Breaking Bad is <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> want in a drama. Critics will spend the next decade dissecting and arguing about what made it great, but the reasons are endless and already well documented." [...] During the final season, the show also received praise from George R. R. Martin, author of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, particularly the episode [...] "Ozymandias"; Martin commented that [...] "Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros." [...] In his review of the second half of season 5, Seth Amitin of IGN stated, [...] "This final batch of Breaking Bad {{is one of the best}} run of episodes TV has ever offered," [...] and praised [...] "Ozymandias" [...] in particular, referring to it as [...] "maybe the best episode of TV [...] ever seen." [...] Jonah Goldberg of National Review called it [...] "the best show currently on television, and perhaps even the best ever." [...] The veteran actor Sir Anthony Hopkins wrote a letter of praise to Bryan Cranston, telling him that his [...] "performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen– ever." [...] He lauded the rest of the cast and crew as well. The letter first appeared on Steven Michael Quezada's (who portrayed DEA Agent Steven Gomez) Facebook page, and in spite of it being taken down, the letter soon went viral. In 2013, Guinness World Records named Breaking Bad the highest-rated TV series of all time, citing its season 5 Metacritic score of 99 out of 100.|$|E

There was {{a lot of things that}} became very corporate about it. And that was just-it is so hard to do with skating. There were so many things we couldn't justify. So we decided to break off and start out own magazine, The Skateboard Mag, in 2004.|$|R
