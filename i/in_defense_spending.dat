5|$|The region {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair, General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place.

5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} {{that a strong}} conservative would run in the 1980 Republican primary, Mathias did not face any major opposition for his seat. He easily won his party's nomination, and was re-elected by a substantial margin in November. His Democratic counterpart in the election, Edward T. Conroy, positioned himself as more conservative than Mathias. Conroy also made national defense the primary issue of his campaign, where he accused Mathias of being weak. Mathias countered, stating he had voted for over $1.1 trillion <b>in</b> <b>defense</b> <b>spending</b> during {{his career in the}} Senate. By winning easy re-election, Mathias became the first Maryland Republican to win election to a third Senate term, and also the only Republican to win the city of Baltimore up to that point. He also secured support from several precincts of Baltimore's Democratic political machine, and several labor unions.|$|E

25|$|Schlesinger devoted much {{attention}} to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, citing the need to strengthen its conventional capabilities. He rejected the old assumption that NATO did not need a direct counter to Warsaw Pact conventional forces because it could rely on tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, noting that the approximate nuclear parity between the United States and the Soviets in the 1970s made this stand inappropriate. He rejected the argument that NATO could not afford a conventional counterweight to Warsaw Pact forces. In his discussions with NATO leaders, Schlesinger promoted the concept of burden-sharing, stressing the troubles that the United States faced in the mid-1970s because of an unfavorable balance of international payments. He urged qualitative improvements in NATO forces, including equipment standardization, and an increase <b>in</b> <b>defense</b> <b>spending</b> by NATO governments of up to five percent of their gross national product.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 2011, Obama {{announced}} that he would seek re-election in the 2012 presidential election. Obama did not face any significant rivals for the 2012 Democratic nomination. Obama's Republican opponent in the general election, former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, advocated for lower taxes, spending cuts, an increase <b>in</b> <b>defense</b> <b>spending,</b> and a repeal of Obamacare (which was ironically based on a Massachusetts healthcare plan developed under Romney). Obama's campaign was based in Chicago and run by many former members of the White House staff and members of the successful 2008 campaign. Obama won re-election with 332 (out of a total of 538) electoral votes and 51.1% of the popular vote, making him the first person since Dwight Eisenhower to twice win 51 percent of the vote. According to exit polls, Obama won a majority of the vote from women, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, people under 45, people making less than $50,000 per year, people inhabiting large or mid-sized cities, liberals, moderates, the unmarried, gays, and people with no college education, some college education, or graduate degrees.

500|$|Reagan {{implemented}} policies {{based on}} supply-side economics, advocating a laissez-faire philosophy and free-market fiscal policy, seeking {{to stimulate the}} economy with large, across-the-board tax cuts. He also supported returning the United States to some sort of gold standard, and successfully urged Congress to establish the U.S. Gold Commission to study how one could be implemented. Citing the economic theories of Arthur Laffer, Reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base, offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation, a theory that entered political discussion as the Laffer curve. Reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success, and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt. His policy of [...] "peace through strength" [...] resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40% real increase <b>in</b> <b>defense</b> <b>spending</b> between 1981 and 1985.|$|E
500|$|A {{competing}} plan, called The Path to Prosperity, {{was announced}} by House Republicans, led by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, on April 5, 2011.

The plan would make no further reduction <b>in</b> <b>defense</b> <b>spending</b> beyond the Obama administration's plan, but would make major changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, which was expected to pass more {{of the cost of}} these programs onto individuals. [...] It would also cut energy research and other applied research and development. This plan was criticized by Democrats for disproportionately cutting programs which benefit the disadvantaged and stifling innovation, while not cutting defense spending further and containing deep tax cuts.

500|$|Unlike {{his more}} stridently [...] "non-interventionist" [...] father, Paul concedes {{a role for}} American armed forces abroad, {{including}} permanent foreign military bases.

Dick Cheney, John McCain and Rick Perry have responded by calling Paul an isolationist, but Paul has pointed to opinion polls of likely GOP primary voters as support for his position. Paul stated: [...] "I personally believe that this group [...] would not be in Iraq and would not be as powerful had we not been supplying their allies in the war [...]" [...] Paul then supported airstrikes against ISIS, but questioned the constitutionality of Obama's unilateral actions without a clear congressional mandate. Paul has stated concerns about arms sent to Syrian rebels that wind up in unfriendly hands. In 2015, Paul called for a defense budget of $697 billion in 2016.

500|$|Upon {{assuming}} {{the presidency in}} January 1961, John F.

[...] In making his case for a test ban, Kennedy drew a direct link between continued testing and nuclear proliferation, calling it the [...] "'Nth-country' problem." [...] While a candidate, Kennedy had argued, [...] "For once China, or France, or Sweden, or half a dozen other nations successfully test an atomic bomb, the security of both Russians and Americans is dangerously weakened." [...] He had also claimed that renewed testing would be [...] "damaging to the American image" [...] and might threaten the [...] "existence of human life." [...] On the campaign trail, Kennedy's test-ban proposal consisted of a continued US testing moratorium, expanded efforts to reach a comprehensive agreement, limit any future tests to those minimizing fallout, and expand research on fallout. Notably, early in his term, Kennedy also presided over a significant increase <b>in</b> <b>defense</b> <b>spending,</b> which was reciprocated by the Soviet Union shortly thereafter, thus placing the test-ban negotiations {{in the context of an}} accelerating arms race.|$|E

[...] Obama criticized the Republican plan for enriching the wealthy through tax cuts while placing a greater economic burden on the elderly through Medicare cuts. [...] Obama's plan was criticized by Republicans for its large cuts <b>in</b> <b>defense</b> <b>spending</b> and for its lack of specific detail. On June 23, at a hearing of the Budget Committee, CBO director Douglas Elmendorf was asked what his agency made of the proposals in that presidential address. “We don’t estimate speeches,” he said. “We need much more specificity than was provided in that speech." [...] A motion to proceed on a Republican-sponsored bill meant to represent the original Obama administration budget proposal was defeated in the Senate by a margin of 0–97 votes on May 25, 2011; the lack of Democratic support was said to have been because the original budget had been superseded by Obama's April speech.|$|E
