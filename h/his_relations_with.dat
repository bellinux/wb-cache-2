5|$|In May 1982, the FAN {{started a}} final offensive, passing {{unhindered}} by the peacekeepers in Ati and Mongo. Goukouni, increasingly angered with the IAF's refusal to fight Habré, made {{an attempt to}} restore <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Libya, and reached Tripoli on 23 May. Gaddafi, however, burned by his experience the previous year, proclaimed Libya neutral in the civil war.|$|E
5|$|Aqil's {{closeness}} {{with the}} Europeans disturbed the Ottomans. <b>His</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the kaimakam of Acre, who in 1863 was Hasan Effendi, were also deteriorating. Since {{his return to}} Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting foot in the city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the kaimakam on his behalf. Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local peasantry. Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who could pay for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, Christians and Jews.|$|E
5|$|Champollion, {{a liberal}} and {{progressive}} minded man, {{lived in a}} period of political turmoil in France which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic wars he was able to avoid conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His own actions, sometimes brash and reckless, did not help his case. <b>His</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from the scientific community.|$|E

5|$|In 1374, Tvrtko married Dorothea, {{daughter}} of Tsar Ivan Stratsimir of Bulgaria. The marriage was likely arranged by Louis, who had kept Dorothea {{and her sister}} as honored hostages at his court to ensure Ivan Stratsimir's loyalty. The bride was Orthodox, but the marriage was celebrated in the Catholic rite by Tvrtko's old enemy Peter, Bishop of Bosnia, to whom Tvrtko then awarded large tracts of land. Tvrtko thereby solidified <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the Roman Catholic Church and earned recognition from Pope Gregory XI.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Muller {{travelled}} to South Africa, {{where he}} visited Cape Town, the Orange Free State, and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. In Pretoria {{he attended the}} inauguration of President Kruger and in Bloemfontein he struck up a friendship with the newly elected President M.T. Steyn and his family. He also renewed <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> other leading statesmen, like former President F.W. Reitz, government secretary P.J. Blignaut, {{and chairman of the}} Volksraad C.H. Wessels. In Cape Town, he was granted an audience with High Commissioner Sir Alfred Milner.|$|E
5|$|Nigel {{also served}} as a royal justice under Henry II. Although <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the {{government}} had improved, <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the monks of his cathedral chapter, which had never been good, continued to be marked by quarrels. In 1156, the English Pope Adrian IV threatened to suspend Nigel from office unless the bishop restored all the lands that had belonged to the church when Nigel became bishop. The restitution was hampered by the absence of the king from England, and the dispute dragged on until finally it was resolved by Nigel pledging in front of Theobald of Bec, Archbishop of Canterbury, to restore the lands. By 1158, Nigel had managed to restore enough possessions that Adrian relaxed the conditions. Even this did not end the quarrels with the monks, as Nigel then named a married clerk as sacrist of Ely, an action which was condemned by Thomas Becket, the new Archbishop of Canterbury. Nigel did manage to secure a reduction in the assessment of knight's fees due from the diocese, from the 60fees that were due under Henry I, to 40 in 1166.|$|E

The Dudleys' domestic life is partly documented in the Earl's accounts; Lettice Dudley financed her personal expenses and servants out of her revenue as Dowager Countess of Essex, remaining largely excluded from society life.|$|E
5|$|The revisionist {{perspective}} has subsequently {{been supported}} by his children, Maxim and Galina, and many Russian musicians.

Other prominent revisionists are Ian MacDonald, whose book The New Shostakovich put forward further revisionist interpretations of his music, and Elizabeth Wilson, whose Shostakovich: A Life Remembered provides testimony from many of the composer's acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|Two of the book's major {{topics are}} the strains in Blair's {{relationship}} with Brown after Blair allegedly reneged on the pair's 1994 agreement {{to step down}} as Prime Minister much earlier, and his controversial decision {{to participate in the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair discusses Labour's future after the 2010 general election, <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the Royal Family, and how he came to respect President George W. Bush. Reviews were mixed; some criticised Blair's writing style, but others called it candid.|$|E

5|$|Why Æthelberht {{chose to}} convert to Christianity is uncertain. Bede {{suggests}} that the king converted strictly for religious reasons, but most modern historians see other motives behind Æthelberht's decision. Certainly, given Kent's close contacts with Gaul, {{it is possible that}} Æthelberht sought baptism in order to smooth <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the Merovingian kingdoms, or to align himself with one of the factions then contending in Gaul. Another consideration may have been that new methods of administration often followed conversion, whether directly from the newly introduced church or indirectly from other Christian kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's {{four-year}} term as county executive saw a moderately progressive administration, {{which included the}} building of new schools, increases to teachers' salaries, reorganization of the police department, and improvements to the water and sewer systems. His anti-discrimination bill passed, {{and gave him a}} reputation as a liberal, but its impact was limited in a county where the population was 97 percent white. <b>His</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the increasingly militant civil rights movement were sometimes troubled. In a number of desegregation disputes involving private property, Agnew appeared to prioritize law and order, showing a particular aversion to any kind of demonstration. His reaction to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Alabama, in which four children died, was to refuse to attend a memorial service at a Baltimore church, and to denounce a planned demonstration in support of the victims.|$|E
5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E

5|$|During 1790–1791 he {{accompanied}} Zamoyski's {{family on}} a trip abroad, and continued {{to serve as an}} adviser to the family, although <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the sons (Aleksander August Zamoyski, Stanisław Kostka Zamoyski) had become strained; he would eventually align himself with the daughter of the family, Anna Zamoyska (Anna Jadwiga Sapieżyna). He supported the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising, a failed attempt to liberate Commonwealth from foreign influence following the events of the 1793 Second Partition of Poland, donating money to the insurgents' cause. Upon the defeat of the Uprising, he accompanied the family on their trip to Vienna. He also made some successful financial investments, including in the stock market. He then served as an economic adviser for the Zamoyski and the Sapieha families, invested in their estates, and lent them money.|$|E
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|His reign was troubled, being {{marked by}} {{conflicts}} {{with some of}} his brothers, antagonism with the various branches of the Buyids for influence in Baghdad, and attacks by the Byzantine Empire under John I Tzimiskes. <b>His</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the Buyid emir of Iraq, 'Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar, were initially hostile, but the two later concluded an alliance. In 978, the Jazira was occupied by the Buyids of Shiraz under 'Adud al-Dawla, and he fled to the Fatimid-controlled parts of Syria, where he tried to secure the governorship of Damascus, and became involved in local rivalries which resulted in his defeat in battle and execution on 29 August 979.|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> Temenggong Daing Ibrahim {{remained}} strained; in 1860, Sultan Ali {{allowed a}} Bugis adventurer, Suliwatang, the chiefs of Rembau and Sungei Ujong {{to settle in}} Muar and prepare themselves for an attack on Johor. Such bad blood between the Sultan and Temenggong Daing Ibrahim passed down to the Temenggong's son, Abu Bakar, who succeeded his father after the former died in 1862. Shortly after Abu Bakar became the Temenggong of Johor, he {{sent a letter to}} Sultan Ali to reassert of Johor's sovereignty over Segamat. Continued disputes over the sovereignty of Segamat led to an outbreak of a war between the Temenggong's men with the Sultan's. Eleven years later in 1873, attempts made by Suliwatang to collect custom taxes from inhabitants at the Muar estuary led to further conflict with Abu Bakar's (who became Maharaja in 1868) men.|$|E

He also edited a school magazine, The Wyvern. His lifestyle at Eton brought him into conflict with his housemaster, E. V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and <b>his</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> women. Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to remove him from Eton a term early for a crammer course to gain entry to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst.
