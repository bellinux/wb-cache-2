25|$|On September 14, 2000, Microsoft {{released}} Windows ME (Millennium Edition), {{the last}} DOS-based version of Windows. Windows ME incorporated visual interface enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows 2000, had faster boot times than previous versions (which however, required {{the removal of}} the ability to access a real mode DOS environment, removing compatibility with some older programs), expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media Player 7, Windows Movie Maker, and the Windows Image Acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system utilities such as System <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> and System Restore, and updated home networking tools. However, Windows ME was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support. PC World considered Windows ME {{to be one of the}} worst operating systems Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product of all time.|$|E
50|$|All Windows NT-based {{operating}} systems since Windows 2000 introduced real-time <b>file</b> <b>protection,</b> called Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> (WFP).|$|E

50|$|Windows Resource Protection is {{a feature}} in Windows Vista that replaces Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection.</b> It protects {{registry}} keys and folders {{in addition to}} critical system files. The way it protects resources differs entirely from the method used by Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection.</b>|$|E
5000|$|System File Protection: First {{introduced}} with Windows 2000 (as Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection),</b> {{and expanding}} on the capabilities introduced with System File Checker in Windows 98, System <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> aimed to protect system files from modification and corruption silently and automatically. When the <b>file</b> <b>protection</b> is in effect, replacing or deleting a system file causes Windows ME to silently restore the original copy. The original {{is taken from}} a hard drive backup folder (...) or from the Windows ME installation CD, if the cached copy of files on the hard disk has been deleted. If no installation CD is in the drive, a dialog box alerts the user about the problem and requests that the CD be inserted. System <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> is a different technology from System Restore {{and should not be}} confused with the latter. System Restore maintains a broad set of changed files including added applications and user configuration data stored repeatedly at specific points in time restored by the user, whereas System <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> protects operating system files with no user input.|$|E

5000|$|Use {{a version}} of Windows that {{includes}} Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection.</b> Windows Me and Windows 2000, both released in 2000, support this form of system <b>file</b> <b>protection,</b> as do Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Its replacement, Windows Resource Protection, was introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, and uses a different method of protecting system files from being changed.|$|E
50|$|Windows Resource Protection applies stricter {{measures}} to protect files. As a result, Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> is not available under Windows Vista. In order to replace any single protected file, Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> had to be disabled completely; Windows Resource Protection works on a per-item basis by setting ACLs. Therefore, by taking ownership of any single item, that particular item can be replaced, while other items remain protected.|$|E

50|$|Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> (WFP), a {{sub-system}} {{included in}} Microsoft Windows operating {{systems of the}} Windows 2000 and Windows XP era, aims to prevent programs from replacing critical Windows system files. Protecting core system files mitigates problems such as DLL hell with programs and the operating system. Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 include WFP {{under the name of}} Windows File Protection; Windows Me includes it as System <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> (SFP).|$|E
50|$|SFC did {{not appear}} on Windows ME, as it was {{replaced}} with System <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> (SFP). Similar to WFP, SFP offered real-time protection.|$|E
50|$|System File Checker {{was first}} {{introduced}} on Windows 98 as a GUI utility. It offered scanning and restoration of corrupted system files by matching the version number against a database containing the original version number of the files in a fresh Windows 98 installation. This method of <b>file</b> <b>protection</b> was basic. It determined system files by file extension and file path. It was able to restore files from the installation media or a source specified by the user. Windows 98 did not offer real-time system <b>file</b> <b>protection</b> beyond file attributes; therefore, no preventive or reactive measure was available.|$|E

5000|$|Note {{that the}} non-use of ACLs in Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> was a design choice: Not only did it allow {{operation}} on non-NTFS systems, but it prevented those same [...] "bad" [...] installers from failing completely from a file access error.|$|E
50|$|Windows Vista {{and later}} Windows systems {{do not include}} Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection,</b> but they include Windows Resource Protection which protects files using ACLs. Windows Resource Protection aims to protect core {{registry}} keys and values and prevent potentially damaging system configuration changes, besides operating system files.|$|E
50|$|The System File Checker (SFC) {{also comes}} with Windows 2000. It is a command line utility that scans system files and verifies whether they were signed by Microsoft and works in {{conjunction}} with the Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> mechanism. It can also repopulate and repair all the files in the Dllcache folder.|$|E

50|$|Third-party {{applications}} cannot stomp on OS files {{unless they}} bundle legitimate Windows updates with their installer, {{or if they}} disable the Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> service during installation, and on Windows Vista or later also take ownership of system files and grant themselves access. The SFC utility could revert these changes at any time.|$|E

50|$|System File Checker checks {{installed}} {{versions of}} system files {{to ensure they}} were the same version as the one installed with Windows 98 or newer. Corrupt or older versions are replaced by the correct versions. This tool was introduced to resolve the DLL hell issue and was replaced in Windows ME by System <b>File</b> <b>Protection.</b>|$|E
