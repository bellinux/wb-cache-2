5000|$|<b>Graphomania</b> (from Greek γραφειν — writing, and μανία — insanity), {{also known}} as scribomania, refers to an obsessive impulse to write. When used in a {{specifically}} psychiatric context, it labels a morbid mental condition which results in writing rambling and confused statements, often degenerating into a meaningless succession of words or even nonsense and called then graphorrhea (cf. hypergraphia). The term 'graphomania' {{has been used in}} early 19th century by Esquirol and later by Eugen Bleuler, becoming more or less usual [...] <b>Graphomania</b> is near condition to typomania - obsessiveness with seeing one's name in publication or with writing for being published, excessive symbolism or typology.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, Colquhoun's {{works were}} {{experiments}} to explore consciousness and the subconscious. She did this by using recognised {{methods such as}} decalcomania, fumage, frottage and collage. Colquhoun went further, developing new techniques such as superautomatism, stillomanay, parsemage, and entoptic <b>graphomania</b> writing about them in her article The mantic stain.|$|E
5000|$|Dolfi or Dolphi Trost (1916 in Brăila [...] - [...] 1966 in Chicago, Illinois) was a Romanian surrealist poet, artist, and theorist, and the {{instigator}} of entopic <b>graphomania.</b> Together with Gherasim Luca, he was {{the author}} of Dialectique de la dialectique (1945). He also authored a work entitled Le même du même.|$|E
5000|$|Some Romanian surrealists {{invented a}} number of surrealist {{techniques}} (such as cubomania, entoptic <b>graphomania,</b> {{and the movement of}} liquid down a vertical surface) that purported to take automatism to an absurd point, and the name given, [...] "surautomatism", implies that the methods [...] "go beyond" [...] automatism, but this position is controversial.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its obvious meaning of writing that is illegibile or for whatever other reason cannot be made out by the reader, indecipherable writing refers {{to a set of}} automatic techniques, most developed by Romanian surrealists and falling under the heading of surautomatism. Examples include entoptic <b>graphomania,</b> fumage and the movement of liquid down a vertical surface.|$|E
5000|$|Outside the {{psychiatric}} definitions of <b>graphomania</b> and related conditions, {{the word is}} used more broadly to label the urge and need to write excessively, whether professional or not. Max Nordau, in his attack to {{what he saw as}} degenerate art, frequently used the term 'graphomania' to label the production of the artists he condemned (most notably Richard Wagner or the French symbolist poets [...] ) ...|$|E
5000|$|Entopic <b>graphomania</b> is a surrealist and {{automatic}} method of drawing in which dots are {{made at the}} sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines are then made between the dots; these can be either [...] "curved lines... or straight lines.". Ithell Colquhoun described its results as [...] "the most austere kind of geometric abstraction." [...] It is to be distinguished from [...] "entoptic" [...] methods of drawing or art-making, inspired by entoptic phenomena.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{categories}} of drawing, including figure drawing, cartooning, doodling, free hand and shading. There are also many drawing methods, such as line drawing, stippling, shading, the surrealist method of entopic <b>graphomania</b> (in which dots are {{made at the}} sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines are then made between the dots), and tracing (drawing on a translucent paper, such as tracing paper, around the outline of preexisting shapes that show through the paper).|$|E
5000|$|Vision dans le cristal. Oniromancie obsessionelle. Et neuf graphomanies entoptiques. is a 1945 book by Romanian Dolfi Trost. The book forms {{part of his}} surrealist art theory, {{specifically}} on the area of entopic <b>graphomania,</b> a surrealist technique invented by the author. As the title suggests, it contains the first nine examples of the technique. This method of [...] "indecipherable writing" [...] was supposedly an example of [...] "surautomatism", the controversial theory put forward by Trost and Gherashim Luca in which surrealist methods would be practiced that [...] "went beyond" [...] automatism.|$|E
5000|$|Count Dmitry Ivanovich Khvostov (граф Дми́трий Ива́нович Хвосто́в, [...] - [...] ), was a Russian poet, {{representing}} the late period of classicism in Russian literature. Count Khvostov, {{as he was}} widely known, was an exceedingly prolific author of poems, fables, epigrams, etc., invariably archaic and pompous, making him {{an easy target for}} humourists and fellow poets (Pushkin among them) who ridiculed him relentelessly. In modern times much has been done to separate the comical myth from Khvostov's real legacy (with some fake 'Khvostovism' exposed) and give credit to an extraordinary poetry enthusiast (who was also an avid literary researcher and archivist), but the stereotype prevails and the name of Count Khvostov remains synonymous in Russia with wanton <b>graphomania</b> and self-important pomposity.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of our thesis Graphomania: {{learning}} function plots (hereinafter <b>Graphomania)</b> we present profesional applications of our current problem space and a drawing graphs of functions, manipulation of the current features: zoom in, zoom out, translate = pan add vertical poles and horizontal and oblique asymptotes in the following programs: (1) Draw Function Graphs (rechneronline. de/function-graphs/), (2) Derive (mathematical assistant for your PC, version 6. 10), (3) GeoGebra 4. 2 (geogebra. org), (4) Mathematica online (wolframalpha. com), (5) Fooplot(plot. com). Thesis (with that we mean the text) is made with LATEXlanguage, in the environment Kile 2. 1. 0 (Kubuntu 12. 04 LTS and 13. 04). In the second part, we will first present the technology Scallable Vector Graphics Version 1. 1 Second Edition (SE) - hereinafter referred to SVG. We will mention support between browsers on Linux, why SVG is an XML document, its origins, and why HTML 5 version put turbo boosts in usage of SVG language. Below we present latest version of <b>Graphomania,</b> what allows us version 3, all of the features of smart and adjustable grid, smart zoom in and out, restore the initial settings, display with manual setting of poles, horizontal asymptote and oblique asymptote. Towards the end of production <b>Graphomania</b> we added three color modes: basic, high contrast and black and white (for easier printing). Then we added an experimental classroom, which helps build mental world of student for drawing graphs and also high school student is the one for which is <b>Graphomania</b> (already since version 1) meant. Finally, we will secondary pupil donate some balloons to be placed on the value of graph features, save the completed work function graph in the database to which access will have his or hers teacher of mathematics...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} varied phenomena of “automatic writing” in Victorian Gothic fiction, reading the genre’s {{fascination with the}} irrepressible signifying practices {{of the body in}} light of the medical, criminological and scientific discourses that underwrite the “scriptural economy” of the late nineteenth century with their own arsenal of automatic writing machines. I have titled the project 2 ̆ 2 <b>Graphomania,</b> 2 ̆ 2 and I consider the term a keyword of late-Victorian culture—one that names a distinctly Victorian pathology of compulsive writing, but that alludes also to the widespread epistemic hope that writing could render objectively the internal and subjective experiences of individuals. In a chapter devoted to Victorian <b>graphomania</b> and the three studies that follow (graphology in Jekyll and Hyde, retinal photography in The Beetle, and phonography in Dracula), the project is particularly interested in convergences and correspondences between graphical machines and human bodies. In this study, Victorian technology and Gothic literature emerge as twin registers of the divided self, joined in their shared strategy of externalizing conflicts traditionally understood as invisible processes, but also in the consequent tendency of each uncanny text to expose its ghostly remainders and excesses in {{the process of trying to}} contain them...|$|E
