5|$|Both Mulder and Joan follow Jeraldine to Hong Kong, where Mulder {{learns that}} she is a {{middleman}} selling government secrets. Mulder tracks down Jeraldine and handcuffs himself to her. Arriving at her office, Mulder finds Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) waiting inside, having been selling the contents of the digital tape. Krycek escapes through a window while Jeraldine is shot by a group of men coming down the hallway. Mulder unlocks the handcuffs and escapes. Meanwhile, Joan walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> and encounters the men, creating a flash that causes them all to suffer from the radiation burns.|$|E
5|$|In late 1976, Bakshi {{learned that}} John Boorman was {{contracted}} to direct {{an adaptation of}} The Lord of the Rings, in which J. R. R. Tolkien's three-volume novel would be condensed into a single film. Bakshi arranged a meeting with Mike Medavoy, United Artists' head of production, who agreed to let Bakshi direct {{in exchange for the}} $3 million that had been spent on Boorman's screenplay. <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> from Medavoy was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Dan Melnick, who interrupted a meeting with Peter Bogdanovich when he learned that Bakshi wanted to discuss acquiring the rights to The Lord of the Rings. Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote a check to cover MGM's debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget for the first of what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two. Before production began, Bakshi and Zaentz insisted that the Tolkien estate receive residuals from the film.|$|E
5|$|On her own Tara finds a spell to {{help the}} town get its voices back, and goes out {{to show it to}} Willow. On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen {{floating}} toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E

5|$|The {{challenge}} with Kibble balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> to the Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|E
5|$|The widowed Gudrun now marries Brynhild's brother, king Atli, but as {{the years}} pass by her {{memories}} of Sigurd do not fade, and she longs for vengeance. She reminds Atli of Fafnir's hoard and urges him to win it for himself. Atli invites the surviving Niblung brothers to a feast, and when they arrive he threatens them with death {{if they do not}} give him the treasure. Gunnar and Hogni defy him to do his worst, and a battle breaks out in Atli's hall. The Niblung brothers are overwhelmed by superior force, tied up and killed. Atli holds a victory-feast, {{at the end of which}} he and all his court lie sleeping drunkenly in the hall. Gudrun, having lost everyone she loves, burns <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> kills Atli with a sword-thrust, and throws herself from a cliff to her death.|$|E
25|$|One day, Léon meets Mathilda Lando (Portman), {{a lonely}} 12-year-old girl. Mathilda {{lives with her}} {{dysfunctional}} family in an apartment <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> and has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls. Mathilda's abusive father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to stash cocaine in his apartment. After they discover he has been cutting the cocaine to keep for himself, DEAagents storm the building, led by sharply dressed drug addict Norman Stansfield (Oldman). During the raid, Stansfield quickly becomes unhinged and murders Mathilda's entire family while she is out shopping for groceries. When Mathilda returns, she realizes what has happened {{just in time to}} continue <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> to Léon's apartment, who hesitantly gives her shelter.|$|E

25|$|The second {{hall was}} closed for remodelling in 1935, as it was {{difficult}} for all of the audience to see the orchestra performing. It re-opened the following December. Though much of Bristol was bombed during the Battle of Britain, the Colston Hall survived most of World War II. On 5 February 1945, a discarded cigarette started a large fire that burned <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> for a second time. The organ was destroyed, and the main auditorium was reduced to pieces of charred wood and hot metal.|$|E

25|$|In August 1982, Atlanta {{police officer}} Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a {{citation}} for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle {{into the brush}} along Monroe Ave, thereby observing him violating the city’s ordinance that prohibits drinking in public. Due to a clerical error, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying the $50 fine, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's apartment three weeks later to serve the now-invalid warrant. Hardwick’s roommate was sleeping {{on the couch in}} the living room. The roommate invited officers in and directed them <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> to Hardwick’s room.

25|$|Hearing her screams {{from behind}} the door, Teresa (Jenna Dewan Tatum) is spotted by Bloody Face who kicks {{open the door and}} attacks her. Grabbing her, Bloody Face then throws Teresa against a wall, {{knocking}} her unconscious. Bloody Face prepares to kill Teresa when Leo (Adam Levine), in an attempt to save her life, throws himself into Bloody Face's way, knocking both of them onto the floor and Bloody Face unconscious. While Teresa regains consciousness, Leo kicks the murder weapon away from Bloody Face towards Teresa. Grabbing the weapon, Teresa violently stabs Bloody Face. They attempt to run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> to escape and another Bloody Face on the other end stops them. In disbelief, they turn around to see a third Bloody Face, who fatally shoots them. The two Bloody Faces removed their masks and discuss the recent events, with one appearing nervous of their crime.

25|$|In June 2015, the CBC {{reported}} {{some information}} from the OPP report. The CBC reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was hit 31 times by police including a shot {{to the back of}} the head by RCMP Constable Curtis Barrett after which the RCMP stopped firing. He was then hand-cuffed although he was already dead. Vickers himself shot 15 times. After entering the Centre Block, there was an exchange of gunfire between Zehaf-Bibeau and House of Commons Security Corporal Malo. Zehaf-Bibeau then ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Honour. House of Commons Security Constable Louis Letourneau shot at Zehaf-Bibeau 15 times, hitting him once, an event recorded on Centre Block security video. Four RCMP officers advanced on Zehaf-Bibeau, who took one more shot, narrowly missing RCMP Constable Barrett, then started a barrage at Zehaf-Bibeau. The OPP report concluded that the officers' actions were all justified. The OPP report also contained the information that it was determined that Zehaf-Bibeau shot Corporal Cirillo three times in the back at the War Memorial, not twice as was previously reported.|$|E

25|$|As smoke {{began to}} escape the Zebra Room and drift <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> toward other banquet rooms, patrons and {{employees}} in the rooms nearest to the Zebra Room smelled it. The employees began to verbally urge room occupants to leave the building; however, as the sprawling complex lacked an audible fire alarm, those in further-flung rooms {{had no way to}} know that there was a fire in the building until an employee walked the length of the building alerting them. Fire investigators later estimated that, once through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, the fire took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. By the time busboy Walter Bailey arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around a thousand people to make their way through the room's small number of exits. As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those {{on the second floor of}} the building.|$|E
