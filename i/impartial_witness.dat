6000|$|There is a still greater {{advantage}} in the French [...] "method." [...] By giving a witness free rein in expression of his personal opinions and feelings {{we should be able}} to calculate his frame of mind, his good or ill will to the prosecution or defense and, therefore, to a certain extent his credibility. In our courts he is able by a little solemn perjury to conceal all this, even from himself, and pose as an <b>impartial</b> <b>witness,</b> when in truth, with regard to the accused, he is full of rancor or reeking with compassion.|$|E
6000|$|At this period, {{between the}} years 1866 and 1874, when he unwillingly went abroad for a twelvemonth, Lowell {{was seen in}} very few Cambridge houses, and in still fewer Boston houses. He was not an unsocial man, but he was most {{distinctly}} not a society man. He loved chiefly the companionship of books, and of men who loved books; but of women generally he had an amusing diffidence; he revered them and honored them, but he would rather not have had them about. This is over-saying it, of course, {{but the truth is}} in what I say. There was never a more devoted husband, and he was content to let his devotion to the sex end with that. He especially could not abide difference of opinion in women; he valued their taste, their wit, their humor, but he would have none of their reason. I was by one day when he was arguing a point with one of his nieces, and after it had gone on for some time, and the <b>impartial</b> <b>witness</b> must have owned that she was getting the better of him he closed the controversy by giving her a great kiss, with the words, [...] "You are a very good girl, my dear," [...] and practically putting her out of the room. As to women of the flirtatious type, he did not dislike them; no man, perhaps, does; but he feared them, and he said that with them there was but one way, and that was to run.|$|E

50|$|Notaries in {{the state}} of New Jersey serve as <b>impartial</b> <b>witnesses</b> to the signing of documents, attests to the {{signature}} on the document, and may also administer oaths and affirmations. Seals are not required; many people prefer them and as a result, most notaries have seals in addition to stamps. Notaries may administer oaths and affirmations to public officials and officers of various organizations. They may also administer oaths and affirmations in order to execute jurats for affidavits/verifications, and to swear in witnesses.|$|R
6000|$|As the Colonel {{had opened}} the question, I ventured to make a respectful remonstrance against the scheme. Vindictiveness {{on the part of}} a man so simple and generous, so fair and noble in all his {{dealings}} as Thomas Newcome, appeared in my mind unworthy of him. Surely his kinsman had sorrow and humiliation enough already at home. Barnes's further punishment, we thought, might be left to time, to remorse, to the Judge of right and wrong; Who better understands than we can do, our causes and temptations towards evil actions, Who reserves the sentence for His own tribunal. But when angered, the best of us mistake our own motives, as we do those of the enemy who inflames us. What may be private revenge, we take to be indignant virtue and just revolt against wrong. The Colonel would not hear of counsels of moderation, such as I bore him from a sweet Christian pleader. [...] "Remorse!" [...] he cried out with a laugh, [...] "that villain will never feel it until he is tied up and whipped at the cart's tail! Time change that rogue! Unless he is wholesomely punished, he will grow a greater scoundrel every year. I am inclined to think, sir," [...] says he, his honest brows darkling as he looked towards me, [...] "that you too are spoiled by this wicked world, and these heartless, fashionable, fine people. You wish to live well with the enemy, and with us too, Pendennis. It can't be. He who is not with us is against us. I very much fear, sir, that the women, the women, you understand, have been talking you over. Do not let us speak any more about this subject, for I don't wish that my son, and my son's old friend, should have a quarrel." [...] His face became red, his voice quivered with agitation, and he looked with glances which I was pained to behold in those kind old eyes: not because his wrath and suspicion visited myself, but because an <b>impartial</b> <b>witness,</b> nay, a friend to Thomas Newcome in that family quarrel, I grieved to think that a generous heart was led astray, and to see a good man do wrong. So with no more thanks for his interference than a man usually gets who meddles in domestic strifes, the present luckless advocate ceased pleading.|$|E
6000|$|One {{sees the}} {{sanctuary}} where the great Caliph said his prayers, and the Koran written by Othman and stained with his blood was kept; but I know {{at least one}} traveler who saw it without sentiment or any sort of reverent emotion, though he had not {{the authority of the}} [...] "old rancid Christianity" [...] of a Castilian for withholding his homage. If people would be as sincere as other people would like them to be, I think no one would profess regret for the Arab civilization in the presence of its monuments. Those Moors were of a religion which revolts all the finer instincts and lifts the soul with no generous hopes; and the records of it have no appeal save to the love of mere beautiful decoration. Even here it mostly fails, to my thinking, and I say that for my part I found nothing so grand in the great mosaue of Cordova as the cathedral which rises in the heart of it. If Abderrahman boasted that he would rear a shrine to the joy of earthly life and the hope of an earthly heaven, in the place of the Christian temple which he would throw down, I should like to overhear what his disembodied spirit would have to say to the saint whose shrine he demolished. I think the saint would have the better of him in any contention for their respective faiths, and could easily convince the <b>impartial</b> <b>witness</b> that his religion then abiding in medieval gloom was of promise for the future which Islam can never be. Yet it cannot be denied that when Abderraham built his mosque the Arabs of Cordova were a finer and wiser people than the Christians who dwelt in intellectual darkness among them, with an ideal of gloom and self-denial and a zeal for aimless martyrdom which must have been very hard for a gentleman and scholar to bear. Gentlemen and scholars were what the Arabs of the Western Caliphate seem to have become, with a primacy in medicine and mathematics beyond the learning of all other Europe in their day. They were tolerant skeptics in matters of religion; polite agnostics, who disliked extremely the passion of some Christians dwelling among them for getting themselves put to death, as they did, for insulting the popularly accepted Mohammedan creed. Probably people of culture in Cordova were quite of Abderrahman's mind in wishing to substitute the temple of a cheerfuler ideal for the shrine of the medieval Christianity which he destroyed; though they might have had their reserves as to the taste in which his mosque was completed. If they recognized it as a concession to the general preference, they could do so without the discomfort which they must have suffered when some new horde of Berbers, full of faith and fight, came over from Africa to push back the encroaching Spanish frontier, and give the local Christians as much martyrdom as they wanted.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, a {{notary public}} {{is a person}} {{appointed}} by a state government (e.g., the governor, lieutenant governor, state secretary, {{or in some cases}} the state legislature) and whose primary role is to serve the public as an <b>impartial</b> <b>witness</b> when important documents are signed. Since the notary is a state officer, a notary's duties may vary widely from state to state and in most cases bars a notary from acting outside their home state unless they also have a commission there as well.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Post-Dispatch of St. Louis, [...] "All the <b>impartial</b> <b>witnesses</b> {{agree that}} the police were either {{indifferent}} or encouraged the barbarities, and that the major part of the National Guard was indifferent or inactive. No organized effort was made to protect the Negroes or disperse the murdering groups. The lack of frenzy and of a large infuriated mob made the task easy. Ten determined officers could have prevented most of the outrages. One hundred men acting with authority and vigor might have prevented any outrage." ...|$|R

Indeed, the fact of her abduction (to use a Scottish law term) was completely proved by <b>impartial</b> <b>witnesses.</b> The unhappy woman admitted that she had pretended acquiescence in her fate on several occasions, because she dared not trust such as offered to assist her to escape, not even the sheriff-substitute.|$|R

The Clouds, {{produced}} in 423 BCE, portrays Socrates and his assistant Chaerephon {{as a pair of}} charlatans operating a pseudo-scientific school in Athens. Chaerephon is represented in The Clouds as pale and malnourished, a [...] "living corpse", and it is sometimes inferred that he must have been a thin, unhealthy looking fellow in real life. [...] In The Wasps Chaerephon, or some visual caricature of him, has a brief, non-speaking role as an <b>impartial</b> <b>witness.</b> In The Birds he is nicknamed [...] "the bat", possibly alluding to nocturnal habits, a bony appearance, or a sudden, excitable nature (as suggested in Plato's works, below).|$|E
50|$|Most {{common law}} systems have {{what is called}} in the United States a notary public, a public {{official}} who notarizes legal documents and who can also administer and take oaths and affirmations, among other tasks. In the United States, a signing agent, {{also known as a}} loan signing agent, is a notary public who specializes in notarizing mortgage and real estate documents. Although notaries public are public officials, they are not paid by the government; they may obtain income by charging fees, provide free services in connection with other employment (for example, bank employees), or provide free services for the public good. Documents are notarized to deter fraud and to ensure they are properly executed. An <b>impartial</b> <b>witness</b> (the Notary) identifies signers to screen out impostors and to make sure they have entered into agreements knowingly and willingly. Loan documents including deeds, affidavits, contracts, powers of attorney are very common documents needing notarization.|$|E

40|$|Consenting to {{participate}} in a clinical research study after being properly and correctly informed upholds the basic ethical principle of “autonomy” in human research.

30|$|Although trained {{forensic}} examiners outperform novices {{in tests}} of unfamiliar face matching, their abilities {{are called upon}} only in limited circumstances, and with minimal time pressure. More often, unfamiliar face-to-photo matching occurs under highly variable conditions, including supermarkets, border control and airport security, and in financial transactions. The people making these matching decisions are also highly variable, with individual differences in age, race, cognitive capacities, training, and on-the-job experience. The present research examined individual differences in age and occupational experience, comparing participants who are personally responsible for verifying identity during financial or legal transactions to a control sample of undergraduate students. The primary population of interest included professional notaries in the United States, individuals who are appointed by their state governments to act as <b>impartial</b> <b>witnesses</b> when important financial and legal documents are signed (e.g., property deeds, powers of attorney). In addition to ensuring that proper procedures are followed, including that all signers engage by their own free will, notaries serve {{a major role in}} fraud prevention by verifying signers’ identities. The present research addressed several questions about individual differences in unfamiliar face ID by (1) comparing professional notaries and bank tellers (who are also often tasked with unfamiliar face matching) to novices and (2) correlating performance with occupational experience measures, including weekly identity verifications and years of on-the-job experience.|$|R
