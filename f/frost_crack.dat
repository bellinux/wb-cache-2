50|$|<b>Frost</b> <b>crack</b> and sun scald are {{examples}} of damage found on tree bark which trees can repair to a degree, depending on the severity.|$|E
50|$|Even {{those plants}} that {{tolerate}} frost may be damaged once temperatures drop even lower (below -4 C). Hardy perennials, such as Hosta, become dormant {{after the first}} frosts and regrow when spring arrives. The entire visible plant may turn completely brown until the spring warmth, or may drop all of its leaves and flowers, leaving the stem and stalk only. Evergreen plants, such as pine trees, withstand frost although all or most growth stops. <b>Frost</b> <b>crack</b> is a bark defect caused {{by a combination of}} low temperatures and heat from the winter sun.|$|E
50|$|Frost cracks are {{frequently}} {{the result of}} some sort of weakness in the bark which occurred to the tree earlier. In late winter and early spring, water in the phloem, known as the inner bark and in the xylem, known as the wood, expands and contracts under often significantly fluctuating temperatures. Wood that is in some way damaged does not contract to the same degree as healthy wood. Rapid expansion and contraction of water within the wood and bark, particularly under rapidly falling night temperatures, can result in a <b>frost</b> <b>crack,</b> often accompanied by a loud explosive report.|$|E

40|$|Rivers cut {{vertically}} and laterally into bedrock. However, {{control on}} the width of bedrock rivers is an unsolved problem. In alpine settings, <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> {{is one of the}} mechanisms that break down bedrock. Segregation ice drives growth of ice lenses within rock masses. When the temperature of the rock is within the "frost cracking window" of - 3 to - 8 ??C, ice lenses can attract liquid water. Expanding ice lenses can exert sufficient pressure to fracture the rock. We hypothesize that alpine rivers may promote segregation ice growth at the river margin by supplying water, but also may inhibit <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> by supplying heat. We find support for this hypothesis in data collected along the Tuolumne and Mokelumne rivers in the Sierra Nevada, California. A ID heat flow model predicts that <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> should occur above 2325 masl in this area. To test for a river effect, I measured fracture density along the Tuolumne River at 2600 masl, finding that density at the river margin is significantly greater than on adjacent hillslopes in the Cathedral Peak granodiorite. We then deployed data loggers on the Mokelumne River (at 2490 masl) over the winter of 2013 / 2014 to record water, surface and subsurface rock temperatures at varying depths and distances from the river. Temperatures within the <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> window were only recorded at a distance of 5 m from the river, suggesting an insulating effect from the river and snow cover. Rock temperature 1 m deep equilibrated at 2 ??C. This result requires subsurface heat flow into the model space. Ongoing work includes terrestrial LiDAR scans to detect erosion of the river bank at the Mokelumne site, and further development of a 2 D heat flow model to predict subsurface rock temperatures for varying surface boundary conditions and channel morphology. We expect that further analysis will reveal systematic relationships between the surface boundary conditions and rock temperature at depth, enabling predictive modeling of <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> intensity at the river margin...|$|R

The features and {{processes in the}} Arctic Coastal Plain, a zone of continuous permafrost, are stressed in this paper. The evidence for and mechanisms of the geomorphic cycle are discussed starting with <b>frost</b> <b>cracks.</b> <b>Frost</b> <b>cracks</b> may form polygonal ground which leads to low-centered ice wedge polygons in areas having ice-rich permafrost.

50|$|Although frost cracks may be up {{to several}} metres long, these cracks usually only become {{apparent}} in early spring; they are often found on the southwest side of the tree.

The wood beneath the <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> is rarely damaged. The cracks usually originate at the base of the trunk and extends from a metre to several metres upwards.

40|$|<b>Frost</b> <b>crack</b> {{represents}} one of the main defects which affect European beech wood quality. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to improve the knowledge regarding both the impact of <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> on European beech wood quality and the <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> characteristics which affect wood quality. In order to do this, nineteen European beech trunks with <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> have been studied. Each trunk has been cross-cut every 1 meter and the characteristics of <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> and <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> star-shaped heart have been measured in each cross-cut section. The defects which accompany <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> have also been identified in each cross-cut section. Moreover, the possibility of determining these defects using the IML RESIF 500 – S Resistograph has been tested. The research has emphasized the existence of statistical correlations between <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> star-shaped heart expansion, <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> rib prominence and <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> length. These correlations are expressed by multiple linear regressions. The presence of defects which affect wood structure leading to a decrease in penetration resistance can be determined accurately with the resistograph. Decay (in frost cracks older than 8 years) and ring shake have been identified as the most frequent defects which accompany <b>frost</b> <b>crack.</b> The measurements made on the frost cracks studied have been gathered in a graph which shows <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> impact on European beech wood quality. The results obtained lead to the improvement of the criteria of European beech wood quality assessment by expanding the already existent knowledge and by identifying new aspects which may complete standing wood quality determination and sorting methods...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Field {{observations}} in the Mackenzie Delta area largely substantiate Lachenbruch's theoretical considerations of thermal contraction crack development. <b>Frost</b> <b>crack</b> patterns, representing the incipient stage of tundra polygons, were observed on both bare and vegetated surfaces of low alluvial flats and sandspits of three islands.

40|$|In the Southern Alps, New Zealand, large {{gradients}} in precipitation (< 1 to 12 m year− 1) {{and rock}} uplift (< 1 to 10 mm year− 1) produce distinct post-glacial geomorphic domains in which landslide-driven sediment production dominates in the wet, rapid-uplift western region, and rockfall controls erosion in the drier, low-uplift eastern region. Because the western region accounts for < 25 % {{of the active}} orogen, the dynamics of erosion in the extensive eastern region are of equal importance in estimating the relative balance of uplift and erosion across the Southern Alps. Here, we assess the efficacy of <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> as the primary rockfall mechanism in the eastern Southern Alps using air photo and topographic analysis of scree slopes, cosmogenic radionuclide dating of headwalls, paleo-climate data, and a numerical model of headwall temperature. Currently, active scree slopes occur at a relatively uniform mean elevation (1450 m) and their distribution is independent of hillslope aspect and rock type, consistent {{with the notion that}} <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> (which is maximized between − 3 and − 8 °C) may control rockfall erosion. Headwall erosion rates of 0. 3 to 0. 9 mm year− 1, measured using in-situ 10 Be and 26 Al in the Cragieburn Range, confirm that rockfall erosion is active in the late Holocene at rates that roughly balance rock uplift. Models of the predicted depth of frost activity are consistent with the scale of fractures and scree blocks in our field sites. Also, vegetated, paleo-scree slopes are ubiquitous at elevations lower than active scree slopes, consistent with the notion that lower temperatures during the last glacial advance induced pervasive rockfall erosion due to <b>frost</b> <b>cracking.</b> Our modeling suggests temporally-averaged peak <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> intensity occurs at 2300 m a. s. l., the approximate elevation of the highest peaks in the central Southern Alps, suggesting that the height of these peaks may be limited by a “frost buzzsaw. ...|$|R

40|$|Water-bearing rocks {{exposed to}} {{freezing}} temperature can {{be subjected to}} freeze–thaw cycles leading to crack initiation and propagation, which are the main causes of frost damage to rocks. Based on the Griffith theory of brittle fracture mechanics, the crack initiation criterion, propagation direction, and crack length under freezing pressure and far-field stress are analyzed. Furthermore, a calculation method is proposed for the stress intensity factor (SIF) of the crack tip under non-uniformly distributed freezing pressure. The formulae for the crack/fracture propagation direction and length of the wing crack under freezing pressure are obtained, and the mechanism for coalescence of adjacent cracks is investigated. In addition, the necessary conditions for different coalescence modes of cracks are studied. Using the topology theory, a new algorithm for <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> propagation is proposed, which has the capability to define the crack growth path and identify and update the cracked elements. A model that incorporates multiple cracks is built by ANSYS and then imported into FLAC 3 D.

40|$|A joint German-Russian project (Polygons in tundra wetlands: {{state and}} {{dynamics}} under climate variability in Polar Regions) started in 2010. The {{first part of}} field research during the 2011 field campaign in the lower Indigirka River (70 °N, 147 °E) and the lower (68 °N; 161 °E). After one month of field work the author has completed sediment samples from typical polygonal ponds on different evolution levels. Eight polygonal ponds and three thermokarst lakes were drilled. Total number of samples is 170. The first task was to capture {{a certain number of}} sedimental samples. The analysis of potential indicator organisms in ponds and cryosols in a wider area and the monitoring of species dynamics in ponds at selected locations was completed by further on-site measurements (e. g. temperature, pH, conductivity, acidity, alkalinity, oxygen) and hydrochemical (major ion concentrations), sedimentological (CNS, grain size) and stable isotope lab analyses (δD, δ 18 O, δ 13 C) in order to record the life conditions of indicator species during the open water period. These analyses were performed by the involved institutions in Germany. The morphometric description (size, depth, bathymetry, type) of the polygons aims to establish the relationships of these parameters with precipitation and permafrost dynamics during summer. Simple, but stable sensors connected with long-term data loggers (one year records) were installed in selected polygon ponds in the Chokurdakh and the Chersky study areas. These instruments have to be extra purchased by this project. Physico-chemical field data from the study sites was compared and correlated with climate data of the respective climate stations (e. g. air temperature, precipitation, radiation). Summer precipitation was quantified and sampled since it is – next to ice melting - the main source of water in polygon ponds during summer, determining their hydrochemical and stable isotope properties. Compilation of sedimental samples gave data about polygonal ponds with different evolution levels and age. Ponds aggregated to two kinds: First ponds have a good well-marked wall borderline. They are ponds with flat ground and no deep water level. Another pond group is classified by rotted walls, high water level and the absence of the most part of sediment accumulation. It means that degradation processes of polygonal pond flowing fast enough on this allas territory. Radiocarbon dating will approve time line of evolution ponds from regular-shaped structure to deep water-filled <b>frost</b> <b>crack.</b> Based on the experience from the fieldwork in 2011 in the Indigirka lowland, the expedition continues in 2012 in the lower Kolyma River region...|$|E
40|$|Ice wedges are {{the most}} {{abundant}} type of ground ice in the ice-rich permafrost deposits of the Northeast Siberian Arctic. They are formed by the periodic repetition of frost cracking and subsequent crack filling in spring, mostly by melt water of winter snow. Ices wedges can be studied by means of stable-water isotopes. Their isotopic composition is directly linked to atmospheric precipitation (i. e. winter snow) and, therefore, indicative of past winter climate conditions even though also genetic aspects, i. e. sublimation, melting and refreezing in the snowpack and the <b>frost</b> <b>crack,</b> {{have to be taken}} into account. Here we present stable-water isotope data of ice wedges at the Oyogos Yar coast of the Dmitry Laptev Strait (72. 7 °N, 143. 5 °E). The ice wedges from different stratigraphic units comprising pre-Eemian sediments, Middle Weichselian Ice Complex (Yedoma) sediments and Holocene themokarst (Alas) sediments were studied and sampled in 2002 and 2007. Stable-water isotopes were measured in the stable-isotope lab of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam, Germany. Ice wedge stable-water isotope data indicate substantial variations in Northeast Siberian Arctic winter climate conditions (δ 18 O) as well as shifts in the moisture generation and transport patterns (d excess) during the Late Quaternary, in particular between Glacial and Interglacial but also during the last centuries. Ice wedges of the pre-Eemian Kuchchugui and Bychchaguy Suites exhibit mean δ 18 O values of about - 30 ‰ and - 34 ‰, respectively, indicating cold to extreme cold winter temperatures. The latter represents the coldest conditions found in ice wedges at the Oyogos Yar coast. Mean d-excess values are about 3 ‰ and 6 ‰, respectively. Small ice wedges in Eemian sediments show distinctly warmer mean δ 18 O values of about - 24 ‰ and mean d-excess values of about 4 ‰. However, probably they represent younger epigenetically grown ice wedges with an isotopic composition that might be influenced by sediment-ice interaction. Huge syngenetic ice wedges of the Weichselian Yedoma Suite are characterized by mean δ 18 O values of - 29 ‰ to - 33 ‰ and mean d-excess values around 6 ‰ in different altitude levels, reflecting cold to extreme cold winter temperatures. On top of the Ice Complex as well as in a thermokarst depression, formed during the Late Glacial, Holocene ice wedges could be found. They have been grown predominantly in the Middle and Late Holocene and exhibit mean δ 18 O values of about - 25 ‰ and mean d-excess values of 8 ‰, mirroring distinctly warmer winter temperatures in the Holocene. Recent ice wedges grown in the last decades are characterized by mean δ 18 O values of about - 22 ‰ and mean-d excess values of 8 ‰, testifying the recent winter warming in the Arctic. ...|$|E
40|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of bacteria preserved within an ice wedge from the Fox permafrost tunnel was undertaken by cultivation and molecular techniques. The radiocarbon {{age of the}} ice wedge was determined. Our {{results suggest that the}} bacteria in the ice wedge adapted to the frozen conditions have survived for 25, 000 years. Ice wedges are wedge-shaped ancient ice (Fig. 1 A) and are among the most common features in permafrost regions, in-cluding northern and central Alaska (7). They grow as a result of repeated cycles of <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> followed by the infiltration of snow, meltwater, soil, and other material into open <b>frost</b> <b>cracks</b> (17). Material incorporated into the ice wedge quickly becomes frozen, and the ice and the ice in soil and organic particles are thus preserved in a frozen state.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of past temperatures with ground ice, especially with ice wedges is possible, but {{reduced by the}} missing correlation of ice veins to the exact year of their formation. Therefore, we performed recent cryogenesis tracer experiments on Samoylov Island, Northern Siberia, to calibrate a stable isotope thermometer for ice wedges. In 2002, a low centre polygon (20 m in diameter) was selected showing clearly visible (several mm wide) frost cracks and a well-developed relief between polygon wall and centre. Here, coloured Lycopodium spores, (each year a different colour) have been applied in autumn to a polygon with recent ice-wedge growth (between 2002 and 2009) to trace ground ice formed in the considered years. The spores should to be transported with snow/snowmelt into the open <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> in spring. In 2010, 13 permafrost cores {{were taken from the}} ice-wedge polygon. In the cold laboratory, these ground-ice cores have been processed and individual ice veins have been sampled for spore identification and stable isotope analyses. Single ice veins were melted and examined under the light microscope for spores. All spores colours could be recovered, with red spores (2002) being most abundant followed by green (2003) and violet (2004). An overall decrease in spore abundance is probably related to changing hydrological conditions and polygon degradation. Additionally, frost cracking experiments (breaking cables) were installed to the polygon, intended to break when a sudden rupture (i. e. a frost cracking event) takes place. Data loggers detected the precise moments of cracking on Samoylov Island generally occurring between November, 8 and February, 10 (N= 12). The stable isotope composition of every single melted ice vein has been analysed with a Picarro L 2120 i water isotope analyser and, if spores were present, attributed to the respective year of formation. However, attribution to the year of formation is complicated by eventual occurrence of more than one colour in a sample, which has been assessed by statistical methods. The isotope composition of single ice veins could be measured {{for the first time in}} high resolution with a Picarro laser-optical spectrometer and showed no significant isotope fractionation during freezing. The combination with meteorological data allows correlating the local temperature with the δ 18 O of ice-wedge ice formed in a discrete year. The δ 18 O and δD values of recent ice veins correspond roughly to the LMWL in Tiksi (δD= 7. 57 δ 18 O– 6. 8), indicative for meteoric precipitation stored in ice wedges. However, the broad scatter of the data shows large inter-annual and seasonal variability of the frost cracking process. A first comparison with meteorological data indicates that December temperatures may best explain the variability in recent ice wedge isotope composition. ...|$|E

In this contribution we present stable-water isotope data of ice wedges from the Oyogos Yar coast of the Dmitry Laptev Strait (72. 7 °N, 143. 5 °E). Ice wedges and surrounding sediments were studied and sampled in 2002 and 2007. Ice-wedge stable-water isotopes were analyzed in the stable-isotope lab of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam, Germany. Sediments and ice wedges were dated using (a) OSL dating, (b) 36 Cl/Cl dating (Blinov et al., 2009), (c) radiocarbon dating as well as (d) stratigraphic correlation based on ice-wedge stable isotopes. Based on our chronology the studied ice wedges correspond to different stratigraphic units of the Late Quaternary. These are (1) an Ice Complex of MIS 5 age (Wetterich et al., in press), (2) Early Weichselian (MIS 4 to MIS 3) flood plain deposits, (3) the Middle Weichselian Yedoma Ice Complex of MIS 3 age and (d) Holocene themokarst deposits (Opel et al., 2011). Ice wedge stable-water isotope data indicate substantial variations in Northeast Siberian Arctic winter climate conditions (δ 18 O) as well as shifts in the moisture generation and transport patterns (d excess) during the Late Quaternary, in particular between Glacial and Interglacial but also over the last centuries. An ice wedge of the MIS 5 Ice Complex exhibits mean δ 18 O and d excess values of - 33 ‰ and 7 ‰, respectively, representing very cold winter temperatures. Small multi-stage ice wedges corresponding to the MIS 4 to MIS 3 flood plain deposits showed two clusters of isotope values: (1) in their lower parts, i. e. composite sand-ice wedges or “polosatics”, δ 18 O values of - 31 to - 28 ‰ (d excess of 0 - 5 ‰) and (2) in their upper parts (classical ice wedge) δ 18 O values of - 34 ‰ (d excess of 5 ‰), reflecting rather different formation conditions than climate differences under very cold climate conditions. The huge syngenetic ice wedges of the Weichselian Yedoma Ice Complex (MIS 3) are characterized by mean δ 18 O values of - 33 ‰ to - 29 ‰ and mean d-excess values between 4 and 8 ‰ corresponding to different altitude levels and reflecting cold to very cold winter temperatures. On top of the Ice Complex as well as in a thermokarst depression of Late Glacial origin, Holocene ice wedges could be found. They have been grown predominantly in the Middle to Late Holocene and exhibit mean δ 18 O values of about - 25 ‰ and mean d-excess values of 8 ‰, mirroring distinctly warmer winter temperatures in the Holocene. Recently grown (modern) ice wedges of the last decades are characterized by mean δ 18 O values of about - 21 ‰ and mean d excess values of 8 ‰, testifying the recent winter warming in the Arctic.

Whereas the glacial fingerprint is easily distinguished by its characteristic fjords and U-shaped valleys, the periglacial fingerprint is more subtle but potentially prevails in some mid- to high-latitude landscapes. Previous models have advocated a frost-driven control on debris production at steep headwalls and glacial valley sides. Here we investigate the important role that periglacial processes also play in less steep parts of mountain landscapes. Understanding the influences of frost-driven processes in low-relief areas requires a focus on the consequences of an accreting soil mantle, which characterises such surfaces. We present a new model that quantifies two key physical processes: <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> and <b>frost</b> creep, as a function of both temperature and sediment thickness. Our results yield new insights into how climate and sediment transport properties combine to scale the intensity of periglacial processes. The thickness of the soil mantle strongly modulates the relation between climate and the intensity of mechanical weathering and sediment flux. Our results also point to an offset between the conditions that promote <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> and those that promote frost creep, indicating that a stable climate can provide optimal conditions for only one of those processes at a time. Finally, quantifying these relations also opens up the possibility of including periglacial processes in large-scale, long-term landscape evolution models, as demonstrated in a companion paper...|$|R
40|$|Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) seed origins {{from the}} Baltic {{countries}} and from Finland were compared {{in terms of}} growth, wood density, bark thickness and the incidence of darkened core wood, <b>frost</b> <b>cracks</b> and decay, {{and the effect of}} seed origin latitude was examined in two Finnish provenance trials. The material consisted of 21 stand and single tree origins ranging from latitudes 54 ° to 63 °N from the Baltic countries and Finland. The trials, measured at the age of 22 years, were located at Tuusula (60 ° 21 ´N), southern Finland and at Viitasaari (63 ° 11 ´N), central Finland. The Baltic origins were superior to the Finnish ones in the southern trial regarding height, whereas in central Finland the Finnish origins grew better. There was no consistent difference between the Baltic and the Finnish group of origins in wood density. Bark thickness decreased with increasing seed origin latitude. The Baltic origins had significantly thicker bark than the Finnish origins. A moderate positive correlation was detected between the seed origin latitude and the incidence of darkened core wood in the southern trial, where the darkened core wood was more common in the Finnish origins than in the Baltic ones. The highest proportion of trees with <b>frost</b> <b>cracks</b> was detected in the south-western Latvian origins growing in central Finland. Seed transfers from the Baltic would have an increasing effect on the bark thickness of birch logs, but no or only minor effects on wood density. Based on our results, {{there is no reason to}} recommend the use of nonnative Baltic seed origins in Finland instead of the native locally adapted seed sources...|$|R
40|$|At {{the northernmost}} point of Alaska, the Barrow area {{is one of}} the best-studied arctic regions, {{including}} permafrost research. However, stable isotope techniques have been used only sparsely, especially to characterise different types of ground ice. The application of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes for palaeoclimate studies in ice wedge ice is useful for reconstructing winter temperatures, whereas pollen reflect summer conditions. Ice wedges are principally formed by repeated <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> and percolation of meltwater of winter snow into <b>frost</b> <b>cracks,</b> forming ice veins, containing - under certain circumstances - the winter signal of the year of its formation. A small permafrost tunnel was excavated in the early 1960 s by a CRREL team lead by one of the authors (Brown). The excavation into a massive complex of vertically foliated ice is at the 3 - 6 m depth and is 9 m long. The tunnel was reopened in 2003 and sampled in 2004 by the Potsdam team for stable isotopes, sedimentological, palynological and microbiological analyses. Since in the 1960 s neither AMS dating techniques nor stable isotope studies were readily available, the first step in our current investigations was to refine the age estimate of the site in order to improve our understanding of the genesis of the buried ice within the tunnel. Detailed results of geochronological, sedimentological and micropalaeontological studies reflect different stages of Late Pleistocene and Holocene palaeoenvironmental evolution. Isotope geochemistry indicates the intersection of two, isotopically different, ice wedges representing different phases of the regional climatic history, which extend to the Late Glacial Maximum. This is revealed by a new AMS date of 20, 000 years at the lateral contact of the wedge and the surrounding sediments. A case study for the boundary top of ice wedge - sediment will demonstrate the importance of exchange processes, which may alter the original stable isotope signal...|$|R
