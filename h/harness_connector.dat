50|$|The 40TES and 41TES are {{upgraded}} replacement {{versions of}} the 41TE, which were first introduced with the 2007 Chrysler Sebring. The 40TES is used with the 2.4 L GEMA I4 engine while the 41TES is used with the 2.7 L EER V6. The difference between the TES and TE is the TES has a shallower bell housing, and the torque converter is more compact. This was done for the revised packaging of the 2007 Sebring's engine compartment. The 40TES and 41TES are also known As VLP, (Variable Line Pressure) Transmissions. A pressure sensor and line pressure solenoid {{was added to the}} valve body in addition to the solenoid pack that bolts to the outside of the case. this resulted in an additional <b>harness</b> <b>connector</b> coming thru the case near the manual linkage.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, {{the sensor}} may become burnt or worn out - or just die {{of old age}} at high mileage. One likely cause of {{crankshaft}} position sensor failure is exposure to extreme heat. Others are vibration causing a wire to fracture or corrosion on the pins of <b>harness</b> <b>connectors.</b> Many modern crankshaft sensors are sealed units and therefore will not be damaged by water or other fluids. When it goes wrong, it stops transmitting the signal which contains the vital data for the ignition and other parts in the system.|$|R

40|$|The MuCell ® {{injection}} molding process is being applied by the world’s leading electronic connector manufacturers as a core plastics manufacturing technology to obtain (1) faster product development capability, (2) operating and capital cost savings and (3) productivity improvements. The MuCell {{injection molding}} process results in electronic connector components that have less residual stress, superior conformance to mold dimensions, and improved dimensional stability at extreme operating and soldering temperatures compared to conventionally molded parts. The MuCell microcellular foam injection molding process uses supercritical fluids (SCF) of inert gases, (nitrogen or carbon dioxide) to create evenly distributed and uniformly sized microscopic cells throughout a polymer. The MuCell process enhances thin-wall connector design, improves processing efficiency, and reduces product costs. Driven by compelling cost savings opportunities, {{a transition from}} conventional molding to MuCell microcellular foam processing is occurring within an extensive range of connection systems including wiring <b>harness</b> <b>connectors,</b> electronic control module headers, IC sockets including DIMM, DDR DIMM, and RIMM, fine pitch connectors, board level connectors, and PCMCIA connectors, and DIN connectors. The MuCell process has been deployed worldwide across an extensive range of automotive, business machinery, and industrial markets as a strategic cost savings technology...|$|R
50|$|In {{automotive}} applications the titania sensor, {{unlike the}} zirconia sensor, {{does not require}} a reference sample of atmospheric air to operate properly. This makes the sensor assembly easier to design against water contamination. While most automotive sensors are submersible, zirconia-based sensors require a very small supply of reference air from the atmosphere. In theory, the sensor wire <b>harness</b> and <b>connector</b> are sealed. Air that leaches through the wire harness to the sensor is assumed to come from an open point in the harness - usually the ECU which is housed in an enclosed space like the trunk or vehicle interior.|$|R
5000|$|The {{high voltage}} also enables a bus {{topology}} in which panels are {{connected in parallel}} rather than in series. A parallel architecture allows {{a greater number of}} panels to be connected on a single cable run (which can include more than 100 thin-film panels), an increase over conventional series-string design. [...] Furthermore, eIQ Energy's Parallel Solar architecture eliminates the need for a return line, and because each vBoost comes with an integrated wiring <b>harness</b> and <b>connector,</b> the only on-site wiring needed is from the first vBoost to the combiner box and from the combiner box to the inverter.|$|R
40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} considerations {{for the design}} of wiring for the Lunar Module. Included are a review of the choice of conductors and insulations, the wire splicing (i. e., crimping, and soldering), the wire connectors, and the fabrication of the wire harnesses. The problems in fabrication include the wires being the wrong length, the damage due to the sharp edges, the requried use of temproary protective covers and inadequate training. The problems in the wire harness installation include damge from sharp eges, work on adjacent <b>harnesses,</b> <b>connector</b> damage, and breaking wires. Engineering suggestions from the Apollo-era in reference to the conductors that are reviewed include: the use of plated conductors, and the use of alloys for stronger wiring. In refernce to insulation, the suggestions from Apollo era include the use of polymer tape-wrap wire insulation due to the light weight, however, other types of modern insulation might be more cost-effective. In reference to wire splices and terminal boards the suggestions from the Apollo Era include the use of crimp splices as superior to solder splices, joining multiple wire to a common point using modular plug-ins might be more reliable, but are heavier than crimp splicing. For connectors, the lessons from the Apollo era indicate that a rear environmental seal that does not require additional potting is preferred, and pins should be crimped or welded to the incoming wires and be removable {{from the rear of the}} connector...|$|R

Light weight, immunity to EMI, fire safety, high bandwidth, and high signal fidelity have already made photonics in general and fiber optics in particular an extremely attractive medium for communication purposes. With the fiber optics serving as a central nervous system of the vehicle, generation, detection, and processing of the signal occurs at the peripherals that include smart structures and devices. Due to their interdisciplinary nature, photonic technologies cover such diverse areas as optical sensors and actuators, embedded and distributed sensors, sensing schemes and architectures, <b>harnesses</b> and <b>connectors,</b> signal processing and algorithms.

5000|$|In World War II, paratroopers {{most often}} used parachutes of a {{circular}} or round design. These parachutes could be steered to a small degree by pulling on the risers (four straps connecting the paratrooper's <b>harness</b> to the <b>connectors)</b> and suspension lines which attach to the parachute canopy itself. German paratroopers, whose harnesses had only a single riser attached at the back, could not manipulate their parachutes in such a manner. Today, paratroopers still use round parachutes, or round parachutes modified as to be more fully controlled with toggles. The parachutes are usually deployed by a static line. Mobility of the parachutes is often deliberately limited to prevent scattering of the troops when a large number parachute together. Some military exhibition units and special forces units use [...] "ram-air" [...] parachutes, which offer {{a high degree of}} maneuverability and are deployed manually (without a static line) from the desired altitude.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{results and}} conclusions {{on a survey}} on the implementation and reliability aspects of CubeSat bus interfaces, {{with an emphasis on}} the data bus and power distribution. It provides recommendations for a future CubeSat bus standard. The survey is based on a literature study and a questionnaire representing 60 launched CubeSats and 44 to be launched CubeSats. It is found that the bus interfaces are not the main driver for mission failures. However, it is concluded that the Inter Integrated Circuit (I 2 C) data bus, as implemented in a great majority of the CubeSats, caused some catastrophic satellite failures and a vast amount of bus lockups. The power distribution may lead to catastrophic failures if the power lines are not protected against overcurrent. A connector and wiring standard widely implemented in CubeSats is based on the PC/ 104 standard. Most participants find the 104 pin connector of this standard too large. For a future CubeSat bus interface standard, it is recommended to implement a reliable data bus, a power distribution with overcurrent protection and a wiring <b>harness</b> with smaller <b>connectors</b> compared with PC/ 104.

40|$|This paper {{covers the}} {{development}} of a distributed high temperature electronics demonstrator for integration with sensor elements to provide digital outputs that can be used by the FADEC (Full Authority Digital Electronic Control) system or the EHMS (Engine Health Monitoring System) on an aircraft engine. This distributed electronics demonstrator eliminates the need for the FADEC or EHMS to process the sensor signal, which will assist in making the overall system more accurate and efficient in processing only digital signals. This will offer weight savings in cables, <b>harnesses</b> and <b>connector</b> pin reduction. The design concept was to take the output from several on-engine sensors, cany out the signal conditioning, multiplexing, analogue to digital conversion and data transmission through a serial data bus. The unit has to meet the environmental requirements of DO- 160 with the need to operate at 200 °C, with short term operation at temperatures up to 250 °C. The work undertaken has been to design an ASIC based on 1. 0 μm Silicon on Insulator (SOI) device technology incorporating sensor signal conditioning electronics for sensors including resistance temperature probes, strain gauges, thermocouples, torque and frequency inputs. The ASIC contains analogue multiplexers, temperature stable voltage band-gap reference and bias circuits, ADC, BIST, core logic, DIN inputs and two parallel ARINC 429 serial databuses. The ASIC was tested and showed to be functional up to a maximum temperature of 275 ° C. The ASIC has been integr ated with other high temperature components including voltage regulators, a crystal oscillator, precision resistors, silicon capacitors within a hermetic hybrid package. The hybrid circuit has been assembled within a stainless steel enclosure with high temperature connectors. The high temperature electronics demonstrator has been shown to operate from - 4 (fC to + 250 °C. This work has been carried out under the EU Clean Sky HIGHTECSproject with the Project being led by Turbomeca (Fr) and carried out by GE Aviation Systems (UK), GE Research -Munich (D) and Oxford University (UK) ...|$|R
