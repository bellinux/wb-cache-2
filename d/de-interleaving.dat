40|$|<b>De-interleaving</b> is a {{critical}} function in Electronic Warfare (EW) that has not received much attention in the literature regarding on-line Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) application. In ELINT, on-line analysis is important {{in order to allow}} for efficient data collection and for support of operational decisions. This dissertation proposed a <b>de-interleaving</b> solution for use with ELINT/Electronic-Support-Measures (ESM) receivers for purposes of ELINT with on-line application. The proposed solution does not require complex integration with existing EW systems or modifications to their sub-systems. Before proposing the solution, on-line <b>de-interleaving</b> algorithms were surveyed. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a clustering algorithm that has not been used before in de-interleaving; in this dissertation, it has proved to be effective. DBSCAN was thus selected as a component of the proposed <b>de-interleaving</b> solution due to its advantages over other surveyed algorithms. The proposed solution relies primarily on the parameters of Angle of Arrival (AOA), Radio Frequency (RF), and Time of Arrival (TOA). The time parameter was utilized in resolving RF agility. The solution is a system that is composed of different building blocks. The solution handles complex radar environments that include agility in RF, Pulse Width (PW), and Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI) ...|$|E

This itself gives a compression of three times. One of the famous color filter array is called Bayers’s pattern. The concept of GPPM tree in data mining used for compressing RGB image is applied for CFA image.

30|$|As {{becomes clear}} from the example program for the simple case of a matrix {{interleaving}} function, at least 3 VLIW slots are required to maximize instruction-level parallelism. More complex iVAG programs make use of all 4 VLIW slots. An example for DVB-T symbol <b>de-interleaving</b> is given by Algorithm 3.|$|E
30|$|The {{capability}} of our architecture to interleave data while writing to and while {{reading from the}} memory further extends the mapping possibilities. For example, the DVB-T inner de-interleaver comprises a symbol de-interleaver followed by a bit de-interleaver. The iVAG implementation takes care of both <b>de-interleaving</b> steps in a single iteration over the CRM. As a result, the symbol de-interleaver is implemented by iVAG write programs and the bit de-interleaver by iVAG read programs.|$|E
30|$|The symbol de-interleaver for DVB-T is {{implemented}} by a write program {{so that the}} bit de-interleaver can be implemented while reading, as mentioned earlier. In DVB-T Symbol <b>de-interleaving</b> addresses are generated by stepping through the states of an LFSR, while for each step bit-permuting the state value and filtering out values above a certain threshold. The resulting values are used as symbol indices, where depending on the mode 2 to 6 soft bits (addresses) {{are associated with a}} symbol. Because the symbol de-interleaver alternates its <b>de-interleaving</b> pattern, each OFDM symbol (regular versus inverse), on-the-fly LFSR-based address generation (as presented in Algorithm 3), can only be adopted by the symbol de-interleaver implementation for the writing of the odd OFDM symbols. For the even OFDM symbols the inverse interleaving function is required. The functional composition of the symbol de-interleaver's LFSR-function and the subsequent filter-function (only 6048 of the 8192 LFSR outputs are valid) is noninvertible. Therefore, a LUT is used that stores the inverse function. The symbol de-interleaver of the DVB-SH implementation is treated in the same way. The only difference is that it is followed by a depuncturing step instead of a bit de-interleaver.|$|E
30|$|The {{received}} {{symbols are}} <b>de-interleaved</b> at the QAM level, and next {{fed into the}} soft demapper, which computes the APP values of all GF(q) symbols in the codeword. The computation of the APP values in the non-binary case is much heavier than {{in the case of}} binary transmission for two reasons: first, each GF(q) coded symbol calls for the computation of (q - 1) APP values, and second the computation of each APP value turns out to be particularly complicated whenever one GF(q) symbol is spread across different QAM symbols (see Section 3 for more details). The APP values are fed into the non-binary FEC decoder, and the decoded GF symbols are finally converted into bits to represent the received binary message.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the heart}} of a Sirius {{receiver}} is a custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip called the Baseband Integrated Circuit currently the STA240, which is produced by STMicroelectronics. The chip contains embedded ARM7TDMI and ARM946E-S microprocessors synthesized from IP cores. Every baseband has a unique Electronic Serial Number (or Sirius ID). Another major section of a Sirius receiver is the tuner. The tuner is also a custom ASIC, the STA210. The tuner connects to the antenna, and receives the incoming satellite and terrestrial signals at 2.315GHz and downconverts them to intermediate frequency signals at around 75MHz. The strength of the signals is approximately −50dBm in clear-sky conditions. The IF signals are fed to the STA240, which are digitized, demodulated, error-corrected, <b>de-interleaved,</b> and decrypted using specialized circuits on the chip. The baseband processor utilizes a 16 MB SDRAM memory to buffer four seconds of one of the satellite signals in order to bring it into time coincidence with the other for Maximal-ratio combining. On newer receivers with a [...] "pause" [...] feature, a dual-port PSRAM is employed to store up to 60 minutes of the selected channel. The baseband processor outputs digital audio over a Serial Peripheral Interface, which is fed to a D/A converter to produce the analog audio signal. The front-end of a Sirius receiver is called the head unit, required to display descriptive text (such as the category, channel, artist, and song name) and provide controls to the user. This is implemented by the third-party designers of Sirius-ready receivers, using a microprocessor of their choice.|$|R
3000|$|The {{support for}} partial address {{generation}} ("Filter Output Address" [...] in Table 8) {{is also used}} extensively. In DVB-T symbol <b>de-interleaving</b> for instance, it is not feasible to generate complete vectors of addresses. The pseudo random nature of the LFSR and range filter {{and the number of}} soft bits per symbol (which is not a multiple of 8 and therefore hard to vectorize) require a separation of address generation and address filtering concerns to allow for more efficient vector implementation.|$|E
30|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the performance of}} a wireless video communication system operating over a fading channel, under both an end-to-end delay constraint and a bandwidth constraint. We showed that the main delay components in the system include the queuing delay in the source encoder output buffer, the delay caused by interleaving and <b>de-interleaving,</b> and the delay caused by channel decoding. The relationship among these three components, restricted by the delay constraint, was derived mathematically. We then focused on the delay partitioning between the source encoding and the interleaving.|$|E
30|$|Another unique {{capability}} of our architecture {{is that it}} supports conflict resolution of read accesses. As mentioned before, conflict resolution is essential when handling streams at high-speed. Read-access conflict resolution allows data interleaving during memory read-out at high-speed. Being able to both write data interleaved to and read data interleaved from the memory allows implementation of two interleaving functions in a single iteration over the memory. Also complex interleavers or demultiplex/interleave scenarios can be supported at high-speeds. The use case of 4 simultaneous DVB-T radios significantly benefits from this capability, combining symbol and bit <b>de-interleaving.</b>|$|E
