50|$|Hybrid LC filter {{is a kind}} of {{electrical}} LC filter, which typically contains two conductive <b>foil</b> <b>layers,</b> separated by an insulation material and coiled on a core. Layers are typically made of copper or aluminum. One layer, which is placed between the voltage source, such as inverter, and a load, is called “the main foil”; this layer forms filter inductance. Another foil, called “the auxiliary foil”, is connected to a neutral potential (e.g. earth), forming the useful capacitance between foils. This way the self-capacitance of the main foil is crucially decreased. Filter is characterized by improved high-frequency performance (working frequency range is at least up to tens of MHz). The mutual inductance between <b>foil</b> <b>layers</b> is rather large, coupling factor is typically about 0.95-0.99. Higher the mutual inductance provided, better the damping properties of the hybrid LC filter.|$|R

The gaps are smaller when using a foil (solid metal) shield, {{but there is still}} a seam running the length of the cable. Foil becomes increasingly rigid with increasing thickness, so a thin <b>foil</b> <b>layer</b> is often surrounded by a layer of braided metal, which offers greater flexibility for a given cross-section.|$|E
50|$|Reflective foil, bubble foil insulations, and radiant {{barriers}} are noted {{for their ability}} to reflect unwanted solar radiation in hot climates, when applied properly. Reflective foils are fabricated from aluminum foils with a variety of backings such as roofing paper, craft paper, plastic film, polyethylene bubbles, or cardboard. Reflective bubble foil is basically a plastic bubble wrap sheet with a reflective <b>foil</b> <b>layer</b> and belongs to a class of insulation products known as radiant foils. Reflective bubble/foil insulations are primarily radiant barriers, and reflective insulation systems work by reducing radiant heat gain. To be effective, the reflective surface must face an air space, also dust accumulation on the reflective surface will reduce its reflective capability. The radiant barrier should be installed in a manner to minimize dust accumulation on the reflective surface.|$|E

50|$|A liquid {{packaging}} board {{might be}} up to five plies and is formed on a multi-ply paper machine with online coating. The most common is to use three plies with a basis weight of about 300 g/m2. The base or middle ply is normally made of pulp from bleached or unbleached chemical pulp, CTMP or broke (waste paper from a paper machine). CTMP gives more bulk and stiffness. The top ply (inside) is made of bleached chemical pulp. The barrier coating depend of the application and might be applied on both sides. When induction welding is employed an aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>layer</b> is used for barrier protection and for heating. The {{back side of the}} board is the printing side and might have an extra ply made from chemical pulp of quality that is suitable for the printing applications. Liquid packages are normally heat sealed.|$|E
50|$|The closure is {{supplied}} to the bottler with an aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>layer</b> liner already inserted. Although {{there are various}} liners to choose from, a typical induction liner is multi-layered. The top layer is a paper pulp that is generally spot-glued to the cap. The next layer is wax {{that is used to}} bond a layer of aluminum foil to the pulp. The bottom layer is a polymer film laminated to the foil. After the cap or closure is applied, the container passes under an induction coil, which emits an oscillating electromagnetic field. As the container passes under the induction coil (sealing head) the conductive aluminum foil liner begins to heat due to eddy currents. The heat melts the wax, which is absorbed into the pulp backing and releases the foil from the cap. The polymer film also heats and flows onto the lip of the container. When cooled, the polymer creates a bond with the container resulting in a hermetically sealed product. Neither the container nor its contents are negatively affected; The heat generated does not harm the contents.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of shock-induced radiation from oxides, silicates and metals of geophysical interest constrain the shock-compressed temperature of these materials. In these experiments, a projectile impacts a target {{consisting of a}} metal driver plate, a metal film or <b>foil</b> <b>layer,</b> and a transparent window. We investigate {{the relationship between the}} temperature inferred from the observed radiation, and the temperatures of different high-pressures states (e. g. shocked state) of the shock-compressed film (or foil) and window. Deviations of the temperature in each target component away from that of their respective shock-compressed states occur because of (1) shock-impedance mismatch between target components, (2) thermal mismatch between target components, (3) surface roughness at target interfaces, and (4) conduction within and between target components. In particular, conduction may affect the temperature of the film/foil material at the film/foil-window interface, a major thermal radiation source in the target, on the time scale of the experiments. To be observed, radiation from sources at the film/foil-window interface or in the shocked window material must propagate through (1) the shocked window material, (2) the shock front, (3) the unshocked window material, and (4) the unshocked window free surface. Consequently, the observed intensity of target radiation sources is affected by the optical properties of each region. In particular, the source radiation intensity may be greatly reduced due to absorption in the shocked and/or unshocked window material, and/or only partial transmission through the film/foil-window interface, shock front and/or unshocked window free surface. To illustrate various aspects of the model, we apply it to radiation data from targets composed of an Fe driver plate, and Fe film or <b>foil</b> <b>layer,</b> and either an Al_ 2 O_ 3 or LiF window layer...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} requirements to existing heat-insulation layers in enclosure structures of wall panels has been carried out, a general principles on development of thermal insulation systems, substantiation on the necessity {{to develop a new}} wall panel design with improved thermal characteristics. The proposed design of the wall panel differs from the existing one in the fact that its external layer is made of protective sheets being perforated in their top and bottom parts with perforated aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>layer</b> placed on them. Air layer performs function of one of thermal insulation layers, and the second layer is made up in the form of several micro-modular sub-layers which are divided by perforated aluminum foil and a grid. An inner concrete layer is also separated from micro-modular layers by aluminum foil. Protective sheets and the grid can be made of aluminum or polyethylene. The arrangement of hollow micro-modular cells in the zone of negative temperatures prevents condensate accumulation. The arrangement of the perforated aluminum foil layers between micro- modular layers leads to increase in thermal resistance of the panel due to decrease of a radiant component in presence of several screens and does not interfere with a vapor permeability of thermal insulation layers from micro-modules. At the same time placement of a non-perforated <b>foil</b> <b>layer</b> on an inside panel layer interferes with penetration of water vapor from rooms in micro-modular thermal insulation layers. Technological principles lie in the arrangement of perforation slots in the top and bottom zones of protective sheets that allows to delete excess moisture from thermal insulation layers and air layer and also leads to improvement of thermo-technical characteristics, durability and reliability in construction operation as a whole. The executed calculations of heat and humidity fields in external enclosure structures confirm advantages of the presented technical solution. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effectiveness}} of residual stress on forming copper patterns of {{printed circuit board}} was investigated during applied thermal conditions. Generally, the electrolytic copper foil showed a compressive residual stress about- 55 ~- 60 MPa as received, which easily caused to form copper patterns irregularly when the pattern was etched finely. The compressive residual stress was relaxed with applying heat-treatment for a few hours. However, we observed that the compressed residual stress of copper foil tended to be relaxed, constant, and compressed again during heat-treatment process, which is mainly considered as that the grain of copper is grown restrictively within a Cu thin <b>foil</b> <b>layer.</b> We suggested a quantitative method for controlling grain size, grain distribution and relaxing stress of copper foil, which was very helpful for increasing an etching factor to decrease pattern width...|$|E
40|$|Foil gas {{bearings}} are self-acting hydrodynamic bearings {{made from}} sheet metal foils comprised {{of at least}} two layers. The innermost top <b>foil</b> <b>layer</b> traps a gas pressure film that supports a load while a layer or layers underneath provide an elastic foundation. Foil bearings are used in many lightly loaded, high-speed turbo-machines such as compressors used for aircraft pressurization, and small micro-turbines. Foil gas bearings provide a means to eliminate the oil system leading to reduced weight and enhanced temperature capability. The general lack of familiarity of the foil bearing design and manufacturing process has hindered their widespread dissemination. This paper reviews the publicly available literature to demonstrate the design, fabrication and performance testing of both first and second generation bump style foil bearings.

Several damage metrics were identified and evaluated. Damage metrics related to the extent of substructure damage were seen to produce misleading results, however damage metrics related to the degree of dispersion of the hypervelocity particle produced results that corresponded to physical intuition.

40|$|New {{technologies}} {{are needed to}} survive the temperatures, radiation, and hypervelocity particles that exploration spacecraft encounter. Multilayer insulations (MLIs) have been used on many spacecraft as thermal insulation. Other materials and composites {{have been used as}} micrometeorite shielding or radiation shielding. However, no material composite has been developed and employed as a combined thermal insulation, micrometeorite, and radiation shielding. By replacing the scrims that have been used to separate the <b>foil</b> <b>layers</b> in MLIs with various aerogels, and by using a variety of different metal foils, the overall protective performance of MLIs can be greatly expanded to act as thermal insulation, radiation shielding, and hypervelocity particle shielding. Aerogels are highly porous, low-density solids that are produced by the gelation of metal alkoxides and supercritical drying. Aerogels have been flown in NASA missions as a hypervelocity particle capture medium (Stardust) and as thermal insulation (2003 MER). Composite aerogel multifoil protective shielding would be used to provide thermal insulation, while also shielding spacecraft or components from radiation and hypervelocity particle impacts. Multiple <b>layers</b> of <b>foil</b> separated by aerogel would act as a thermal barrier by preventing the transport of heat energy through the composite. The silica aerogel would act as a convective and conductive thermal barrier, while the titania powder and metal foils would absorb and reflect the radiative heat.

The metal <b>foil</b> <b>layers</b> would slow and break up the impacting particles, while the aerogel layers would convert the kinetic energy of the particles to thermal and mechanical energy and stop the particles...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{micro filter}} system (sensor filter) has been {{developed}} that automatically detects its current loading status by an online measuring technique.

The capacitive detection of the filtrate (cells or particles) is possible via the alteration of the permittivity of the fluid upstream the filter at the "upper" interdigital capacitor. The "lower" interdigital capacitor downstream the filter serves to compensate temperature and/or conductivity variations of the fluid itself. The functionality of the sensor filter was examined using a special designed measurement chamber with solutions of polystyrene beads and yeast (Sac charomyces cerevisiae). In doing so the sensor filter system was characterized and the loading process was measured capacitively. Finally the results were confirmed qualitatively using different theoretical calculation models...|$|E
