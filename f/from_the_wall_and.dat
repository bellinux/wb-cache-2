These include the arcading in the Lady Chapel at Ely, which also has the widest vault in England, the pulpitum screen at Lincoln and richly decorated doorways at Ely and Rochester. Characteristic of this period of Gothic is elaborate lierne vaulting in which the main ribs are connected by intermediate ribs which do not spring <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> so are not major structural members. The vaults of Bristol are the most famous examples of this style, which {{can also be seen}} at York.|$|E

25|$|On {{their way}} south the Byzantine forces hit a muddy river which was {{difficult}} to cross. As they {{could not find a}} ford quickly enough, many Byzantines fell into the river. The first stalled in the mud with their horses and were trampled by those who came next. The river was filled with so many dead that the chasing Bulgarians easily passed over them and continued the pursuit. Those who passed through the river reached the wooden wall which was high and thick. The Byzantines left their horses and began climbing the wall with hands and legs and hung over the other side. The Bulgarians had dug a deep moat from the inner side and when the Byzantine soldiers were getting across the ramparts, they fell from the high wall, breaking their limbs. Some of them died instantly, others hobbled some time before falling to the ground and dying from thirst and hunger. The Byzantine troops burned the wall at several places but as they were rushing to get across it, they too fell into the moat along with the burning parts of the palisade. Almost everyone perished; some were killed by the sword, others drowned in the river or were mortally injured after falling <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> some of them died in the fire. Among the nobles killed were the patricians Theodosios Salibaras and Sisinnios Triphyllios; the strategos of the Anatolics Romanos and the strategos of Thrace; as well as the commanders of the Excubitors and Vigla tagmata.|$|E

Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home the point that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: [...] "I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery... The songs are poor in general... Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate." [...] Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as {{a return to the}} band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: [...] "Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all."

500|$|... "Ali's Smile" [...] by William Burroughs is a {{short story}} {{originally}} published by Unicorn in 1971 and later republished in Burroughs's collection of short stories, Exterminator! (1973). At {{the opening of the}} story, Clinch Smith, a former colonial official, is living in an English town overshadowed by a giant slag heap. He is upset when he receives a letter from a Scientologist friend saying that he will [...] "disconnect" [...] from Smith, describing him as a [...] "suppressive person". A kris hanging on the wall of his room reminds Smith of Ali, whom he had met 30 years ago in Malaya. Ali had been put under a latah spell by an old woman, forcing him to dance in the marketplace. Smith rescued Ali, making the young man his houseboy. Ali returned to the market, however, and ran amok, killing several of the women with the kris. Smith was forced to shoot Ali, and kept the kris as a souvenir. Back in the present, Smith feels compelled to take the kris <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> goes to town, where there is a fight going on between hippies and locals, with members of Scientology's Sea Org in the crowd as well. Smith goes on a killing spree with the kris, which seems to have a life of its own. He stabs Lord Westfield, a Home Office official who has asked a private investigator to infiltrate a Scientology organization, a woman, and several Sea Org members, and then a bystander shoots him dead. Police and more combatants prepare to join the fight. As they do so, the slag heap collapses and buries everyone. At the end, the [...] "ghost face" [...] of Ali smiles over all.|$|E

2500|$|Casals {{was born}} in El Vendrell, Catalonia, Spain. His father, Carles Casals i Ribes (1852–1908), was a parish organist and choirmaster. He gave Casals {{instruction}} in piano, songwriting, violin, and organ. He was also a very strict disciplinarian. When Casals was young his father would pull the piano out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> have him and his brother, Artur, stand behind it and name the notes and the scales {{that his father was}} playing. At the age of four Casals could play the violin, piano and flute; at the age of six he played the violin well enough to perform a solo in public. His first encounter with a cello-like instrument was from witnessing a local traveling Catalan musician, who played a cello-strung broom handle. Upon request, his father built him a crude cello, using a gourd as a sound-box. When Casals was eleven, he first heard the real cello performed by a group of traveling musicians, and decided to dedicate himself to the instrument.|$|E

2500|$|During {{turns and}} during the finish, both hands must {{simultaneously}} touch the wall while the swimmer remains swimming face down. The swimmer touches the wall with both hands while bending the elbows slightly. The bent elbows allow the swimmer to push himself or herself away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> turn sideways. One hand leaves the wall to be moved to the front underwater. At {{the same time the}} legs are pulled closer and moved underneath of the body towards the wall. The second hand leaves the wall to be moved to the front over water. It is commonly referred to as an [...] "over/under turn" [...] or an [...] "open turn". The legs touch the wall and the hands are at the front. The swimmer sinks under water and lies on the breast, or nearly so. Then the swimmer pushes off the wall, keeping a streamline position with the hands to the front. Similar to the start, the swimmer is allowed to swim 15m underwater before the head must break the surface. Most swimmers dolphin kick after an initial gliding phase.|$|E
2500|$|... "But the Persians {{were deeply}} vexed at the outcome and sent forth another {{horseman}} {{for the same}} purpose, a manly fellow and well favoured as to bodily size, but not a youth, {{for some of the}} hair on his head already shewed grey. This horseman came up along the hostile army, and, brandishing vehemently the whip with which he was accustomed to strike his horse, he summoned to battle whoever among the Romans was willing. And when no one went out against him, Andreas, without attracting the notice of anyone, once more came forth, although he had been forbidden to do so by Hermogenes. So both rushed madly upon each other with their spears, and the weapons, driven against their corselets, were turned aside with mighty force, and the horses, striking together their heads, fell themselves and threw off their riders. And both the two men, falling very close to each other, made great haste to rise to their feet, but the Persian was not able to do this easily because his size was against him, while Andreas, anticipating him (for his practice in the wrestling school gave him this advantage), smote him as he was rising on his knee, and as he fell again to the ground dispatched him. Then a roar went up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> from the Roman army as great, if not greater, than before; and the Persians broke their phalanx and withdrew to Ammodios, while the Romans, raising the paean, went inside the fortifications; for already it was growing dark.

2500|$|Several {{attempts}} by Muslims to capture this citadel in some single combats failed. [...] The first {{attempt was made}} by Abu Bakr who took the banner and fought, {{but was unable to}} succeed. [...] Umar, then charged ahead and fought more vigorously than Abu Bakr, but still failed. [...] That night Muhammad proclaimed, [...] "By God, tomorrow I shall give it [...] to a man who loves God and His Messenger, whom God and His Messenger love. Allah will bestow victory upon him." [...] That morning, the Quraysh were wondering who should have the honor to carry the banner, but Muhammad called out for Ali ibn Abi Țalib. [...] All this time, Ali, son-in-law and cousin of Muhammad, was ill and could not participate in the failed attempts. Ali came to Muhammad, who cured him of his ophthalmia, an inhibitive inflammation of the eyes, by spitting in Ali's eye. The apostle sent him with his flag and Ali, with new vigor, set out to meet the enemy, bearing the banner of Muhammad. When he got near the fort the garrison came out and he fought them. During the battle, a Jew struck him so that his shield fell from his hand and Ali lost his shield. In need of a substitute, he picked up a door <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> used it to defend himself. The door was said to be so heavy that it took eight men to replace it on its hinges. In some Shi'ite sources it is also said that, when the time came to breach the fortress, he threw the door down as a bridge to allow his army to pass into the citadel and conquer the final threshold. The Apostle revived their (his followers) faith by the example of Ali, on whom he bestowed the surname of [...] "the Lion of God" [...] (Asadullah).|$|E
