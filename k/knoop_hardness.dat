50|$|Beginning in 1990, a great {{interest}} {{has been put}} in studying the possibility to synthesize dense B-C-N phases. They {{are expected to be}} thermally and chemically more stable than diamond, and harder than c-BN, and would therefore be excellent materials for high speed cutting and polishing of ferrous alloys. These characteristic properties are attributed to the diamond-like structure combined with the sp3 σ-bonds among carbon and the heteroatoms. BCxNy thin films were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition in 1972. However, data on the attempted synthesis of B-C-N dense phases reported by different authors have been contradictory. It is unclear whether the synthesis products are diamond-like solid solutions between carbon and boron nitride or just mechanical mixtures of highly dispersed diamond and c-BN. In 2001, a diamond-like-structured c-BC2N was synthesized at pressures >18 GPa and temperatures >2,200 K by a direct solid-state phase transition of graphite-like (BN)0.48C0.52. The reported Vickers and <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardnesses</b> were intermediate between diamond and c-BN, making the new phase the second hardest known material.

40|$|Background: For a full {{understanding}} of the mechanical properties of a material, it is essential to understand the defect structures and associated properties and microhardness indentation is a technique that can aid this understanding. Results: The Vickers hardness on (010), { 011 } and { 110 } faces lay in the range of 304 - 363 MPa. The <b>Knoop</b> <b>Hardnesses</b> on the same faces lay in the range 314 - 482 MPa. From etching of three indented surfaces, the preferred slip planes have been identified as (001) and (101). For a dislocation glide, the most likely configuration for dislocation movement on the (001) planes is (001) [100] (|b| = 0. 65 nm) and for the (101) plane as (101) 101 ~(|b| = 1. 084 nm) although (101) [010] (|b| = 1. 105 nm) is possible. Tensile testing showed that at a stress value of 2. 3 MPa primary twinning occurred and grew with increasing stress. When the stress was relaxed, the twins decreased in size, but did not disappear. The twinning shear strain was calculated to be 0. 353 for the (101) twin plane. Conclusions: HMX is considered to be brittle, compared to other secondary explosives. Comparing HMX with a range of organic solids, the values for hardness numbers {{are similar to those of}} other brittle systems.

5000|$|The {{hardness}} of {{a material}} {{can be measured}} in many ways. The <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> test, a method of microindention hardness, is the most reproducible for dense ceramics. The Vickers hardness test and superficial Rockwell scales (e.g., 45N) can also be used, but tend to cause more surface damage than Knoop. The Brinell test is suitable for ductile metals, but not ceramics. In the Knoop test, a diamond indenter in the shape of an elongated pyramid is forced into a polished (but not etched) surface under a predetermined load, typically 500 or 1000 g. The load is held for some amount of time, say 10 s, and the indenter is retracted. The indention long diagonal (d, μm, in Fig. 4) is measured under a microscope, and the <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> (HK) is calculated from the load (P, g) and the square of the diagonal length in the equations below. The constants account for the projected area of the indenter and unit conversion factors. Most oxide ceramics have a <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> in the range of 1000 - 1500 kgf/mm2 (10 [...] - [...] 15 GPa), and many carbides are over 2000 (20 GPa).

40|$|The {{superiority of}} superaustenitic {{stainless}} steel (SASS) {{lies in its}} good weldability and great resistance to stress corrosion and pitting, because of its higher chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen contents, when compared to general stainless steels. However, some of its applications are limited by very poor wear behavior. Plasma-nitriding is a very effective treatment for producing wear resistant and hard surface layers on stainless steels without compromising the corrosion resistance. In this work, UNS S 31254 SASS samples were plasma-nitrided at three different temperatures (400, 450, and 500 degrees C), under a pressure of 500 Pa, for 5 h, in order to verify {{the influence of the}} temperature on the morphology, wear, and corrosion behavior of the modified surface layers. The plasma-nitrided samples were analyzed by means of optical microscopy, micro-hardness. X-ray diffraction, wear, and corrosion tests. Wear tests were conducted in a fixed ball micro-wear machine and corrosion behavior was carried out in natural sea water by means of potentiodynamic polarization curves. For the sample which was plasma-nitrided at 400 degrees C, only the expanded austenite phase was observed, and for the treatments performed at 450 and 500 degrees C, chromium nitrides (CrN and Cr(2) N) were formed in addition to the expanded austenite. Wear volume and <b>Knoop</b> surface <b>hardness</b> increased as the plasma-nitriding temperature increased. Higher wear rates were observed at high temperatures, probably due to the increment on layer fragility. The sample modified at 400 degrees C exhibited the best corrosion behavior among all the plasma-nitriding conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Rebinder effect, or the {{dependence}} of the hardness of a ceramic material on its environment, was investigated for aluminum oxide and silicon nitride in aqueous environments of varying pH. Significant Rebinder effects were found for both materials. A maximum in <b>hardness</b> (<b>Knoop</b> microhardness) was found at the pH of zero zeta potential (surface charge). Observations were consistent with a mechanism for the Rebinder effect, proposed by Westwood, (Westwood, A. R. C. and Goldheim, D. L., J. Appl. Phys., 39 [7] 3401 – 3405 (1968)) in which hardness is governed by dislocation motion. ^ Prior attempts to apply the Rebinder effect have considered the low speed process of drilling.

This work extends the application of the Rebinder effect to grinding, a high speed process. Although grinding forces were measured, the focus of this study was on part quality improvement rather than a reduction in energy consumption. Grinding forces, surface finish, and post grinding flexural strength were shown to be dependent on coolant pH in the grinding of alumina. These data are consistent with mechanisms involving brittle/ductile or brittle/brittle (e. g. intergranular → transgranular) transitions depending on the aggressiveness of the grinding parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the deformation and fracture behaviour of ceramic materials is of considerable importance {{in the development of}} ceramics as reliable structural materials. Of particular interest is how such behaviour is influenced by the microstructure, for example in multiphase materials such as composites. With this in mind a study was made of a variety of ceramics and ceramic composites at temperatures between 20 and 1500 °C. The fracture toughnesses of alumina and a variety of alumina based composites, containing SiC whiskers and particles of TiC, B 4 C and Ti(C,N), have been measured. Quantitative characterization of the crack profiles showed that crack deflection does not enhance toughening in these composites and the fracture toughness of the particulate composites was lower than that of alumina. The higher toughness of the SiC whisker composite was shown {{to be the result of}} a change in fracture mode from intergranular for unreinforced alumina to transgranular for the whisker composites. A variation in toughness with crack propagation direction was successfully predicted in terms of a crack deflection model in a composite with uniform whisker distribution. The fracture behaviour of the SiC whisker reinforced alumina was studied at temperatures up to 1400 °C in air and up to 1320 °C in vacuum. At temperatures below 1200 °C in air and 1100 °C in vacuum the material fractured in a linear elastic mode. Above these temperatures a rising R-curve and stable crack growth was observed and the fracture toughness rose substantially. The toughness enhancement was shown to be due mainly to such processes as crack deflection, crack branching, microcrack zone formation and crack tip blunting rather than any temperature-related increase in intrinsic fracture resistance of the material. In air, the fracture mechanisms were influenced by the formation of a glass phase. The fracture toughness of a hot pressed Si 3 N 4 containing 10 vol. % SiC whiskers was studied at temperatures between 20 and 1400 oC, and the crack propagation rates were measured for cyclic and static loading at 1300 and 1400 °C. A maximum in fracture toughness observed at 1300 °C is concluded to be due to crack shielding and crack morphology rather than a change in intrinsic toughness. Stable crack growth was shown to occur during the high temperature fracture toughness tests. The present material exhibited crack growth rates, da/dt, that increased with increasing frequency. This is explained by ligaments of the base material bridging the crack. The tensile creep behaviour of a sintered alumina was studied at temperatures between 1150 and 1350 °C and stresses between 4 and 67 MPa. The stress exponent was 1. 3 and the activation energy for creep was 620 kJ/mol. Grain boundary sliding accompanied by diffusion creep (Nabarro-Herring) and cavitation are suggested as the dominating creep mechanisms under the present test conditions. Nucleation, growth and coalescence of cavities is suggested as the failure mechanism at lower loads while microcrack growth determines failure at higher loads. The <b>knoop</b> indentation <b>hardness</b> in SiC whisker reinforced alumina was shown to fall with increasing temperature up to 1365 °C, and SiC whiskers was shown to harden alumina at temperatures above 600 °C. In pin-on-plate sliding friction in vacuum, the coefficient of friction (µ) decreases almost continuously with temperature. Stick-slip becomes significant above 900 °C and this is considered to reflect a tendency to increased adhesion. Formation of graphite, combined with very smooth wear track due to extensive plastic deformation of the surface, serves to keep µ low at temperatures above 900 °C. The tribological behaviour of the composite under these conditions was determined more by chemical effects than the micromechanical behaviour...|$|R

The composite resins were bulk-inserted and polymerized using different light-curing units and times: conventional QTH (quartz-tungsten-halogen; 700 mW/cm²; 20 s, 30 s and 40 s); LED (light-emitting diode; 440 mW/cm²; 20 s, 30 s and 40 s); PAC (xenon plasma arc; 1700 mW/cm²; 3 s, 4. 5 s and 6 s). The specimens were stored at 37 °C for 24 h prior to sectioning for <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> assessment. Three measurements were obtained for each depth: top surface, 1 mm and 2 mm. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test (p 0. 05) were found for QTH. <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> values decreased with the increase of depth. The increase of energy density produced composites with higher <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> means using LED and PAC...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to study the {{influence}} of curing tip distance on <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> values, at different depths, of two composites, Z 100 and Silux Plus. Specimens (5 mm in diameter and 2. 5 mm in height) were prepared in a copper mold, covered with mylar strip and polymerized for 40 s, at 3 tip-to-composite surface distances: 0 mm (surface contact), 6 and 12 mm, utilizing an XL 3000 curing unit, with 750 mW/cm 2 power. The specimens were then stored at 37 degrees C for 24 h. <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> values were measured using a microhardness tester, with a load of 50 g for 30 s for each indentation. Four specimens were made for each distance and composite and eighteen indentations were made of each specimen. The results were submitted to analysis of variance and Tukey test at 5 % significance level. The results indicated that 1) composite Z 100 : the larger the curing tip distance in relation to the composite, the lower the <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> values; 2) Silux Plus: increasing the curing tip distance did not produce a statistically significant difference in the <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> values; however, at 6 and 12 mm, the deeper layers showed lower <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> values in relation to the surface; 3) Z 100 : statistically superior in relation to Silux Plus at all three curing tip distances and at all depths (P < 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|The sensitivities of Fourier {{transform}} infrared spectroscopy, <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness,</b> water sorption, and resin leaching {{were compared}} {{for their ability}} to distinguish differences between composite samples cured through different thicknesses of overlying resin. The method developed allowed samples of light-cured composite to be made with controlled conversion for parameter testing, and eliminated effects of resin lost to slurry during polishing or an increase in conversion as a result of heat generated during grinding. Sensitivity to differences was greatest and equal for FTIR spectroscopy and <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness,</b> while resin leaching proved to have moderate sensitivity, and water sorption none. The ability of these parameters to predict monomer conversion as measured by FTIR spectroscopy was also determined. <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> proved the best conversion predictor, resin leaching the next best, and water sorption the worst. Water sorption values did not vary with changes in specimen conversion...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The lack of {{evidence}} regarding the best available material for restoring occlusal-proximal cavities in primary teeth leads {{to the development of}} new restorative material, with nanoparticles, in order to enhance mechanical properties, resulting in increased restoration longevity. Aim. To evaluate the <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> and bond strength of nanoparticles material glass carbomer cement (CAR) and high-viscosity glass ionomer cement (GIC) in sound and caries-affected dentin. Methods. Forty bovine incisors were selected and assigned into four groups (n= 10) : SGIC, sound dentin and GIC; SCAR, sound dentin and CAR; CGIC, caries-affected dentin and GIC; and CCAR, caries-affected dentin and CAR. All groups were submitted to microshear bond strength (MPa). <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> was also performed. Bond strength values were subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey test. <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> data were subjected to one-way ANOVA. Results. GIC presented higher <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> (P< 0. 001) and bond strength (P= 0. 027) than CAR. Also, both materials showed better performance in sound than in caries-affected substrates (P= 0. 001). The interaction between factors was not statistically different (P= 0. 494). Conclusion. Despite nanoparticles, CAR shows inferior performance as compared to GIC for the two properties tested in vitro. Moreover, sound dentin results in better bonding performance of both restorative materials evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{combustion}} thermal spraying parameters namely combustion pressure, feeding rate, and carrier gas on the wear resistance, friction coefficient, and <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films were investigated. The PET coatings {{were characterized by}} measuring the wear coefficients by calowear-type testing, the friction coefficients by a pin-on-disk test, and <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness.</b> The abrasive wear and friction coefficients of the coatings were compared with the values of a post consumer PET bottle chip reference sample. The structural characteristics of the coatings were investigated by X ray diffraction. Statistical analysis of the results allowed for the systematic characterization {{of the influence of}} the process variables mentioned above on the coating wear, friction, and microhardness values. Specifically, this study shows that the process parameters affect the wear coefficient and <b>Knoop</b> <b>hardness</b> significantly, but not the friction coefficient.
