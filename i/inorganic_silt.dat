Rates of oxygen consumption were not significantly affected by changes in seston concentration, whereas clearance rates gradually declined with increasing particle concentration. Pseudofaeces production was initiated at relatively low seston concentrations (< 5 mg l- 1). Marked seasonal changes were recorded {{in the composition of}} suspended particulates (seston) in an estuary in south-west England. Total seston was sampled at frequent intervals throughout an annual cycle and analysed in terms of: particle size-frequency distributions, total dry weight (mg l- 1), inorganic content, chlorophyll a, carbohydrate, protein and lipid. The particulate carbohydrate, protein and lipid content provided an estimate of the food content of the seston. The results are discussed in terms of the “food available” to a nonselective suspension feeder, such as M. edulis, during a seasonal cycle.

Independent chronological control was obtained by AMS radiocarbon dating of organic sediments in {{the upper part of the}} sequence and OSL dating of <b>inorganic</b> <b>silts</b> in the lower part, with a unique tie point provided by the ca 26. 5 cal ka Kawakawa Tephra. As was probably a common occurrence in this region, the basin developed as a moraine-dammed proglacial lake and remained lacustrine until the early Holocene, when a peat bog developed. Survival of the depositional site through subsequent multiple ice advances, unusual in a glaciated landscape, was probably assisted by lateral displacement of the basin relative to its source area, across the Alpine Fault. There is good correspondence between inferred periods of substantial treeline depression in the pollen profile and the record for ice advance in this region. More cooling events are evident in the pollen record, however, presumably due to the fragmentary nature of glacial geomorphology. The pollen record also shows broad consistency with the MIS record and hence with the Milankovitch orbital forcing model, but with some departures, including an early onset to the last glacial maximum (LGM). Several sub-Milankovitch scale events are also evident, including a mid-LGM warming and Lateglacial reversals during both the last and the penultimate deglaciation...|$|R

Geotechnical tests undertaken include particle size distribution, specific gravity, Atterberg limits, compaction, consolidation, hydraulic conductivity, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), field vane shear, direct shear and triaxial shear tests. The geotechnical tests indicated that biosolids are equivalent to organic fine-grained soils of medium to high plasticity with high moisture content and liquid limit values. Consolidation tests indicate that biosolids have similar consolidation characteristics to that of organic soils. Shear strength tests on compacted biosolids samples indicated relatively high internal friction angles, {{comparable to that of}} <b>inorganic</b> <b>silts.</b> Compacted biosolids samples exhibit a modest cohesion comparable to organic clays. CBR tests results indicate high deformation potential of biosolids.

With regards to contaminants containing nitrogen, phosphorus and total organic carbon, the biosolids were found to require special protection, in the event there is potential leaching/flow to adjoining water bodies. The geotechnical testing results indicate that untreated biosolids have insufficient bearing capacity to enable its usage as a fill material.

40|$|Occurrence of {{floods in}} the Kashmir valley in September 2014 {{compelled}} the Govt. of Jammu and Kashmir {{to take the}} necessary steps {{in order to avoid}} the similar situation in near future. Eventually the Govt. decided to start dredging of Jhelum and its spill channel, in order to increase their capacity. As a result, a large quantity of dredged material will be obtained and there should be a proper plan in advance for the utilization of such a large quantity of dredged material. Dredged material can no longer be thrown away as a waste material. The use of dredged material can be made in the development of numerous development projects which can reduce the exploitation of primary resources needed for construction activities. But before putting the dredged material to some constructional use, it is essential to carry out investigation for its characterization and only then it can be utilized judiciously, depending on its geotechnical merit. In the present study, samples were retrieved from four locations of the Jhelum flood spill channel bed. Experimental investigations were carried out to determine the various geotechnical parameters related to the physical and engineering properties of the material. The material was classified using Indian Standard Classification System. It had been observed that the material available at these locations was predominantly fine grained <b>inorganic</b> <b>silt,</b> clayey silt with little amount of fine sand and some traces of organic matter.

In this paper the results of a experimental investigation, carried out to analyse the influence of the compaction technique on the pre-failure behaviour of a clayey silt, will be reported. The soil tested is a medium plasticity <b>inorganic</b> <b>silt</b> used to construct an experimental embankment on Po river. Soil specimens have been prepared at different molding water contents. For each water content soil specimens have been compacted at the same dry density by dynamic (Proctor standard) and kneading (Harvard) compaction methods. The compaction curve obtained by the Proctor standard technique (ASTM D 698 - 91) has been used as reference energy curve. All the compacted specimens have been saturated at constant volume and then tested: monotonic cyclic and dynamic torsional shear tests have been carried out using a RCTS apparatus, always following the same stress history. Results have been analysed in terms of shear stiffness, damping ratio and their variation with confining stress and strain level. The experimental data obtained show that, for the Proctor compaction technique, specimens compacted at optimum water content show higher shear moduli than those compacted on both dry and wet side of optimum. The opposite behaviour has been observed in the case of the specimens compacted by the Harvard method. It seems that different moisture contents lead to different structures while different compaction techniques induce different anisotropy...|$|E
40|$|Lime sludge, an inert {{material}} mostly composed of calcium carbonate, {{is the result}} of softening hard water for distribution as drinking water. A large city such as Des Moines, Iowa, produces about 30, 700 tons of lime sludge (dry weight basis) annually (Jones et al., 2005). Eight Iowa cities representing, according to the United States (U. S.) Census Bureau, 23 % of the state’s population of 3 million, were surveyed. They estimated that they collectively produce 64, 470 tons of lime sludge (dry weight basis) per year, and they currently have 371, 800 tons (dry weight basis) stockpiled. Recently, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources directed those cities using lime softening in drinking water treatment to stop digging new lagoons to dispose of lime sludge. Five Iowa cities with stockpiles of lime sludge funded this research. The research goal was to find useful and economical alternatives for the use of lime sludge. Feasibility studies tested the efficacy of using lime sludge in cement production, power plant SOx treatment, dust control on gravel roads, wastewater neutralization, and in-fill materials for road construction. Applications using lime sludge in cement production, power plant SOx treatment, and wastewater neutralization, and as a fill material for road construction showed positive results, but the dust control application did not. Since the fill material application showed the most promise in accomplishing the project’s goal within the time limits of this research project, it was chosen for further investigation. Lime sludge is classified as <b>inorganic</b> <b>silt</b> with low plasticity. Since it only has an unconfined compressive strength of approximately 110 kPa, mixtures with fly ash and cement were developed to obtain higher strengths. When fly ash was added at a rate of 50 % of the dry weight of the lime sludge, the unconfined strength increased to 1600 kPa. Further, friction angles and California Bearing Ratios were higher than those published for soils of the same classification. However, the mixtures do not perform well in durability tests. The mixtures tested did not survive 12 cycles of freezing and thawing and wetting and drying without excessive mass and volume loss. Thus, these mixtures must be placed at depths below the freezing line in the soil profile. The results demonstrated that chemically stabilized lime sludge is able to contribute bulk volume to embankments in road construction projects...|$|E

40|$|Collapsible soils covers {{naturally}} over 10 % of the earth’s surface. This {{makes it}} a global problem and {{it is essential that}} engineers identify and control collapsibility prior to construction. Hence in this thesis, a study on identification, evaluation and control of soil collapsibility is undertaken. Four geologically different soils have been tested at five compactive variables from optimum moisture content (OMC). The soils tested include: Brown inorganic silty clay of low plasticity (A); White <b>inorganic</b> <b>silt</b> with slight plasticity (B); Red inorganic clay of intermediate plasticity (C); and Brown sand-clay mixtures with inorganic clay of low plasticity (D). The soils were each compacted at moisture variations 60 % - 80 %, 80 % - 95 %, 95 % - 105 %, 110 % - 125 % and 125 % - 150 % respectively representing ‘Low Dry OMC’, ‘High Dry OMC’, ‘At OMC’, ‘Low Wet OMC’ and ‘High Wet OMC’. The major causes of collapsibility of soil and the geomorphological processes that gives the pedogenesis of collapsible soils, is highlighted and great emphasis is placed on the adverse effect of collapsible soils. The experimental results from particle size distribution, Atterberg, compaction, triaxial and double oedometer tests showed that the soil’s percentage fine with the fines material (silt or clay), coefficient of uniformity, optimum moisture content, Atterberg limits, and stress-strain properties affect the metastability of the soils and they can be compared to the soil’s collapse potential when pressures and moisture content are applied on the soils. Results obtained showed that the soil’s collapse potential is directly proportional to 1) percentage fines, 2) the difference between the silt and clay percentage, 3) the Atterberg limits (liquid limit, plastic limit and plasticity index), and 4) internal friction angle; and inversely proportional to 1) coefficient of uniformity, 2) initial moisture content, 3) cohesion and finally 4) peak deviator stress. Each soil’s geological property proved to have an adverse effect on the metastability of the soils especially the dry of optimum moisture content. The most interesting results were obtained from the oedometer test. Results of the critical pressure varied with each soil and their compactive variable; Most of the soils at their ‘dry OMC’ had the highest collapse potential. In general, the lower the critical pressure the higher the collapse potential of the soil. The experimental data obtained herein were checked with the past research collapse indexes and found the results agreeing with just two research work out of eighteen examinations. Finally models for identifying soil collapsibility are generated with relationship between parameters from sieve, Atterberg, proctor compaction and triaxial. Laboratory data and data from twelve research work were used to verify the models and they show that the models work. After the verification of these formulas with past research data collected, the best models were three compactive variable models. The models give a collapsibility index in terms of percentage fines, initial moisture content, initial degree of saturation and initial dry density...|$|E

The essential difference between the suspension and the soil is that effective stresses exist in the soil. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} effective stress behaviour during the sedimentation and consolidation processes. Chapters two and three are a description of the equipment and experimental procedures used to determine void ratio changes, pore pressures and effective stresses during this soil formation process. The density measuring technique developed, using an X-ray source and a scintillation counter, is described in some detail. An experiment consists of monitoring the sedimentation, form an initially uniform suspension, of an <b>inorganic</b> clayey <b>silt</b> in a 102 mm I. D. column. Experimental results are presented and discussed in the next two chapters. Some novel aspects of stress/strain behaviour (in one dimensional consolidation) are revealed. In particular an intermediate zone is identified, which has properties between those of a suspension and a soil in the traditional sense. This zone does have effective stresses, but the effective stress/void ratio relationship is not unique. Theoretical consideration of settling suspensions and soil consolidation is covered in chapter six, forming an introduction to the next chapter, where a large strain soil consolidation theory is modified and applied to the intermediate zone. Differences between the theory and experimental results largely reflect the inaccuracies resulting from the simplifying assumptions necessary to keep the mathematics simple. The expulsion of pore water, rather than soil compressibility, is the major factor in determining consolidation behaviour of the intermediate phase. Finally, some recommendations are made as to how to continue the study and on applications to real problems such as dredging, pollution and land reclamation...|$|R

A number of series of conventional and long-term consolidation tests up to 70 days on natural undisturbed samples are described and reported. These samples are taken from different soil layers in a basement excavation in Puxi area in Shanghai. The main objectives of these tests are to investigate the compressibility, especially the secondary compression of Shanghai clay and to compare the measured results with those of other typical natural clays worldwide. Experimental results reveal that the compression index Cc of Shanghai clay is relatively small ranging from 0. 43 to 0. 50. The coefficient of the secondary compression Cα is found to be almost constant when the vertical consolidation pressure is smaller than or close to the preconsolidation pressure, while Cα decreases significantly with time when the consolidation pressure is beyond the preconsolidation pressure.

Unprecedented pressures on soil from degradation and urbanization are threatening agro-ecological balances and food security. It {{is important that we}} learn more about soil to sustainably manage and preserve it for future generations. To this end, we developed and analyzed a global soil visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectral library. It is currently the largest and most diverse database of its kind. We show that the information encoded in the spectra can describe soil composition and be associated to land cover and its global geographic distribution, which acts as a surrogate for global climate variability. We also show the usefulness of the global spectra for predicting soil attributes such as soil organic and <b>inorganic</b> carbon, clay, <b>silt,</b> sand and iron contents, cation exchange capacity, and pH. Using wavelets to treat the spectra, which were recorded in different laboratories using different spectrometers and methods, helped to improve the spectroscopic modelling. We found that modelling a diverse set of spectra with a machine learning algorithm can find the local relationships in the data to produce accurate predictions of soil properties. The spectroscopic models that we derived are parsimonious and robust, and using them we derived a harmonized global soil attribute dataset, which might serve to facilitate research on soil at the global scale. This spectroscopic approach should help to deal with the shortage of data on soil to better understand it and to meet the growing demand for information to assess and monitor soil at scales ranging from regional to global. New contributions to the library are encouraged so that this work and our collaboration might progress to develop a dynamic and easily updatable database with better global coverage. We hope that this work will reinvigorate our community's discussion towards larger, more coordinated collaborations. We also hope that use of the database will deepen our understanding of soil so that we might sustainably manage it and extend the research outcomes of the soil, earth and environmental sciences towards applications that we have not yet dreamed of. </p...|$|R

It was observed from this experiment that vegetative growth and plant biomass were positively affected when plants grown under all different media concentration than control. However, the comparative performance of all potting combination showed that T 8 (silt+leaf compost+perlite) and T 7 (silt+leaf compost+coconut compost) were approved to be most suitable mixture which significantly improve the overall growth and biomass of Caladium. Soilless potting substrates are commonly used for better seedling growth and quick germination in greenhouse bedding and potted plants (Baiyeri 2003; Younis et al. 2008). From this experiment, it was perceived that potting media {{with a combination of}} organic (leaf manure) and <b>inorganic</b> (perlite) with <b>silt</b> reduced the mean germination time and showed fast bulb growth compared to other media combinations and control treatment. It can be concluded that the combinations of the above growing media are best because different media are rich in different nutrients and multi-nutrient substrates are good for the soil chemical, physical and biological properties. In different plant species early sprouting depends upon the air, water content and temperature of the medium (Guerin et al. 2001). Similar findings were observed by Shah et al. (2006) where FYM, leaf compost and silt at 1 : 1 : 1 ratio as growing substrate for Ficus binnendijkii c.v. Amstel Queen gave highest sprouting percentage. Results are also in accordance with the outcomes of Riaz et al. (2008) who observed the early seedling germination in Zinnia elegans under influence of silt, compost, and leaf manure media. It is suggested to use balanced potting substrates for ornamental plants in order to get maximum plant height. All potting media combinations showed highly significant effect for this growth character. The highest stimulatory effect and the maximum enhancement in plant height was noticed in pots mixed with silt, perlite, and leaf manure in 1 : 1 : 1 ratio as a potting media (Table  1). This combination performed best because in this combination pH and amount of nitrogen was optimum, these finding are in relation with the findings of Grassoti et al. (2003), they found that Lilium as a cut flower give maximum plant height when different media were used as potting substrate. Results also showed that different media with different combinations have more effects on plant height. Treder (2008) also confirmed the above findings where plants attained maximum height when grown in media containing perlite.|$|R
