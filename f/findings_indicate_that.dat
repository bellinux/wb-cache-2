5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the <b>findings</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. These <b>findings</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar and closely related species. It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E

Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E

In 2008, a finding of approximately 28 Stone Age handaxes in material from the bottom of the North Sea strengthened the evidence of human settlements in the area.|$|E
25|$|Large {{differences}} in spatial impairment are {{found among the}} dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Lesions to the ventral hippocampus {{have no effect on}} spatial memory, while the dorsal hippocampus is required for retrieval, processing short-term memory and transferring memory from the short term to longer delay periods. Infusion of amphetamine into the dorsal hippocampus has also been shown to enhance memory for spatial locations learned previously. These <b>findings</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> there is a functional dissociation between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} in California {{examined}} {{the amount of}} child play that occurred {{on the streets of}} neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and culs-de-sac. The <b>findings</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the open grid streets showed substantially lower play activity than the cul-de-sac street type. Culs-de-sac reduce perceived danger from traffic thereby encouraging more outdoor play. It pointed the way toward the development of hybrid street network patterns that improve pedestrian movement but restrict cut-through driving. Similar studies in Europe and most recently in Australia found that children's outdoor play is significantly reduced on through roads where traffic is, or perceived by parents to be, a risk.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the management of}} conflict between reality and suggestion during hypnosis. The eight experiments conducted for this thesis {{investigated the}} social, motivational, and cognitive factors that mediate participants? response to conflict during a negative visual hallucination. Chapter 1 reviews the relevant literature and presents {{the rationale for the}} program of research. Chapter 2 presents Experiments 1 and 2, which explored hypnotic participants? capacity to manage conflict under different conditions. The <b>findings</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> cognitive and behavioural strategies that allow participants to avoid conflict are useful, but not essential, in managing hypnotic conflict. Chapter 3 presents Experiment 3, which developed a paradigm that allowed conflict to be manipulated in a way that minimised response cues. The <b>findings</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> gradually and unobtrusively modifying a stimulus influenced participants? responses even though participants did not <b>indicate</b> any knowledge <b>that</b> the stimulus was manipulated. Chapter 4 presents Experiment 4, which investigated the relevance of hypnotisability and hypnosis to conflict management. The <b>findings</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> hypnosis provides a context in which hypnotisable participants are able to maintain their belief despite demanding levels of conflict. Chapter 5 presents Experiments 5 and 6, which focused on the role of social demands in participants? response to hypnotic conflict. The <b>findings</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> demand characteristics shape participants? interpretation of the appropriate response to conflict during an hypnotic suggestion. Chapter 6 presents Experiments 7 and 8, which addressed the relevance of cognitive processes to hypnotic conflict management. The <b>findings</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> participants used cognitive strategies to manage conflict that were appropriate to the suggestion, degree of conflict, and their individual abilities. Overall, the <b>findings</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> hypnotic participants? management of conflict involves motivated, strategic responding so as to maintain a belief that events are as communicated by the hypnotist. These issues are discussed within a theoretical perspective that is presented in Chapter 7. This perspective emphasises the hypnotisability of participants, the role of hypnotic induction, participants? interpretation of the desired response, the belief that participants develop in the reality of the suggested events, and the readiness of participants to employ conflict management strategies that produce the appropriate outcome...|$|R
500|$|Despite a {{demonstrated}} {{appearance of}} blunted affect, recent <b>findings</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> many individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia are emotionally responsive, particularly to stressful or negative stimuli, {{and that such}} sensitivity may cause vulnerability to symptoms or to the disorder.

The use of [...] "safety behaviors" [...] (acts such as gestures or the use of words in specific contexts) to avoid or neutralize imagined threats may actually contribute to the chronicity of delusions. Further evidence for the role of psychological mechanisms comes from the effects of psychotherapies on symptoms of schizophrenia.|$|E

2500|$|Previously, {{scientists}} {{have suggested that}} Camarasaurus and other sauropods may have swallowed gastroliths (stones) to help grind the food in the stomach, regurgitating or passing them when they became too smooth. More recent analysis, however, of the evidence for stomach stones suggests {{this was not the}} case. The strong, robust teeth of Camarasaurus were more developed than those of most sauropods and were replaced on average every 62 days (M.

Other <b>findings</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> Camarasaurus preferred [...] vegetation different from other sauropods, allowing them to share the same environment without competing.|$|E

The <b>findings</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> heavy metals such as mercury, arsenic, and lead, {{have been identified in}} the coastal zone of the Caribbean Sea.

2500|$|A 2014 {{study found}} {{evidence}} for methane cycling below the ice sheet of the Russell Glacier, based on subglacial drainage samples which {{were dominated by}} Proteobacteria. During the study, the most widespread surface melt on record for the past 120 years was observed in Greenland; [...] on 12 July 2012, unfrozen water was present on almost the entire ice sheet surface (98.6%). The <b>findings</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> methanotrophs {{could serve as a}} biological methane sink in the subglacial ecosystem, and the region was, at least during the sample time, a source of atmospheric methane. Scaled dissolved methane flux during the 4 months of the summer melt season was estimated at 990 Mg CH4. Because the Russell-Leverett Glacier is representative of similar Greenland outlet glaciers, the researchers concluded that the Greenland Ice Sheet may represent a significant global methane source. A study in 2016 concluded that methane clathrates may exist below Greenland's and Antarctica's ice sheets, based on past evidence.|$|E
