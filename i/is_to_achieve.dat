5|$|Even after {{complete}} remission is achieved, leukemic cells likely remain in numbers {{too small to}} be detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given, almost all people with AML will eventually relapse. Therefore, more therapy is necessary to eliminate nondetectable disease and prevent relapse— that <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a cure.|$|E
5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of induction therapy <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of Celestial Master {{belief is that}} there is an energy source known as qi, that is born from the Dao and is the source of life all things. The human body contains spirits that need to be nourished by the proper balance of qi. There are three types of qi: yin qi, yang qi and blended qi, which is mixed yin/yang qi. The goal of a Daoist <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> transcendence to a higher plane. In order to do this, they must preserve and harmonize their internal spirits. Only through meditation that guides qi correctly throughout the body, can the spirits be harmonized correctly. While it is known that the Celestial Masters meditated in order to obtain qi, there is no surviving evidence that describes their meditation practices.|$|E

5|$|Operational design {{management}} involves {{the management of}} individual design projects and design teams. Its goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> the objectives set by strategic {{design management}}. Success of good design management can be measured by {{evaluating the quality of}} operational design management outcomes. It includes the selection and management of design suppliers and encompasses the documentation, supervision, and evaluation of design processes and results. It deals with personal leadership, emotional intelligence, and the cooperation with and management of internal communications. Regular management functions, tools, and concepts can often be applied to the management of design on the operational level. It is implemented to achieve specific design objectives and manage the judgment of design proposals. It can help to build brand equity through the consistent creation and implementation of high-quality design solutions that best fit the brand identity and desired consumer experience, in the most efficient way. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this role: operational design manager, senior designer, team leader, visual communication manager, corporate design coordinator, and others.|$|E

Its purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> architectural and urban design excellence.|$|E
25|$|Steroid receptors have {{similarities}} {{in terms of}} gene sequences and protein structures, leading often to functional crosstalk among steroid receptors.

25|$|The Carnot {{cycle is}} the most {{efficient}} possible engine, {{not only because of}} the (trivial) absence of friction and other incidental wasteful processes; the main reason is that it assumes no conduction of heat between parts of the engine at different temperatures.

While specialisation and revealed comparative and competitive indices point to complementarities between trade patterns among the ASEAN member countries, intra-ASEAN trade in agriculture is quite small. However, integration could address this problem.|$|E

Examples of ball tampering would include a fielder applying a substance, such as lip balm or sweetened saliva, to shine one side of the ball or pick the seam of the ball to encourage more swing. Conversely, roughening one side of the ball by use of an abrasive or cutting surface (such as boot spikes or bottle caps) is also ball tampering.|$|E
