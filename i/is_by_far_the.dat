5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation {{in the production of}} liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E
