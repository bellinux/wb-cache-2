5|$|This {{aircraft}} was given J57-P-43W engines {{with a larger}} capacity water injection system to provide greater thrust than previous models.

5|$|Additional takes of {{the song}} were {{recorded}} at De Lane Lea Studios on December 21, 1966, which closely followed the earlier arrangement. However, both Hendrix and Redding <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> missed notes and the takes were not used, except for a backing track that Hendrix later overdubbed at the Olympic Studios on March 29 or early April 1967.|$|E
5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop {{became interested in the}} possibilities of the instrument, hoping it would allow them to increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as being}} a small producer, VAT <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> {{unreliable}} deliveries and quality problems caused by the component suppliers. Semi-finished lorries often waited outside the factory for engines or other key components. The British diesel engines suffered from more quality problems compared with their Swedish and German competitors. The company's owners became increasingly reluctant to fund the unprofitable business.|$|E
5|$|British {{discipline}} of the First World War was not especially severe compared to most other armies of the time (e.g. the Russians and Italians). The French admitted to only 133 executions and the Germans 48, but these figures may not be reliable as both armies <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> discipline.|$|E
5|$|Initially Broccoli and Saltzman {{had wanted}} to produce the eighth Bond novel, 1961's Thunderball, as the first film, {{but there was an}} ongoing legal dispute between the screenplay's co-author, Kevin McClory and Ian Fleming. As a result, Broccoli and Saltzman chose Dr. No: the timing was apposite, with claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> rockets going astray.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Dakar on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at Dakar, Cape Verde and Gibraltar; the Allies {{believed that this}} area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through. As such, the Brazilian unit's mission was to patrol for mines laid by German minelaying submarines {{and to make sure}} that convoys passing through would be safe. Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> their condensers, a matter which was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.|$|E
5|$|Co-writer Glen Morgan felt {{doing an}} episode on vampires was a mistake, {{and said that}} they were also criticized for having Mulder fall for Kristen. Co-writer James Wong was also disappointed, saying that the script was a lot better than the show and that the episode was {{weakened}} when Fox censors <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the episode. Actor David Duchovny thought the episode had style, but suffered some lapses in logic, including the scene where Kristen shaves Mulder before the two kiss.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} this interaction, Presley and Jackson spoke on the telephone almost every day, forging a strong friendship. The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered from the real world, both felt they had missed out on a normal childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having {{spent most of their}} lives feeling exploited by them, and both <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E
5|$|Klaus Dodds {{has noted}} {{that there is a}} geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Monica Grey played Paula Quatermass; she {{was chosen}} by BBC {{management}} rather than the production team, as she was {{the wife of the}} BBC's head of radio drama, Val Gielgud. As Hugh Griffith also <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> some of his technical dialogue, Grey learned his lines as well as her own, in case she needed to step in and assist him during the live performance. Dillon was played by John Stone; Stone too had a long career as a supporting actor in a range of British television series, and in 1956 had a small role in the film X the Unknown, which Hammer Film Productions had intended as a sequel to their version of The Quatermass Experiment, until Kneale denied them the rights to use the character.|$|E

5|$|Montana Moon (1930), {{an uneasy}} mix of Western clichés and music, teamed her with John Mack Brown and Ricardo Cortez. Although the film <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> censors, {{it was a}} major success {{at the time of its}} release. Our Blushing Brides (1930), co-starring Robert Montgomery and Anita Page, was the final {{installment}} in the so-called Our Dancing Daughters franchise. It was a greater successboth critically and financiallythan her previous talkies, and became one of her personal favorites.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An electrical short, it was discovered, could melt a small hole in the casing, which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E
5|$|Originally from southwestern Ohio, Larson {{used his}} cash {{winnings}} for taxes {{and real estate}} investments. However, he also <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the law and was involved in illegal schemes. As a result, Larson lost all of his winnings within {{two years of the}} show's taping and moved to Florida, where he later died of throat cancer at the age of 49. Since his death in 1999, Larson's game has re-aired on TV at various times and inspired the 2003 Game Show Network documentary Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal.|$|E

5|$|Peckham also <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> his {{subordinate}} Thomas Bek, who was Bishop of St David's in Wales. Bek {{tried to}} revive {{a scheme to}} make St David's independent from Canterbury, and to elevate it to metropolitan status. This had originally been put forth by Gerald of Wales around 1200, but had been defeated {{by the actions of}} Hubert Walter, then the Archbishop of Canterbury. Bek did not manage even the four-year fight that Gerald had managed, for Peckham routed him quickly.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. All teams, including Mercedes used the softer tyre compound during the first session (Q1). Jenson Button, who <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> his car all during practice, was unable to set a time when his car broke down on his out lap. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, with Valtteri Bottas in second. Along with Button, both Manor Marussia cars were eliminated in Q1, as well as Daniil Kvyat– who made a mistake during his final lap– and Pastor Maldonado. Fernando Alonso was the first driver to reach a second qualifying session for McLaren {{over the course of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for the Di6 called for the first delivery in February 1995. Several components were to be manufactured by NSB, including the fuel tanks, sandboxes, engine frames, alternators and some components for the bogies. The first locomotive was delivered on 7 March 1996, but quickly proved to not meet the specifications in the contract. In particular, the locomotives had too high fuel consumption and the bogies had faults, as they had too high track forces. Both of these issues were difficult to solve. The Di6 also <b>had</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> overheating, in particular in the main alternators, the oil cooler and the brakes. The on-board computer failed when the outdoor temperature fell too low.|$|E
