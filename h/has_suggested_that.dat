50|$|In Thought and Change in View Harman {{argued that}} intuitions about {{knowledge}} {{are useful in}} thinking about inference. More recently, he and Brett Sherman <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> knowledge can rest on assumptions that are not themselves known.

5|$|Since its {{original}} discovery in the rabbit hippocampus, LTP {{has been observed}} {{in a variety of}} other neural structures, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, amygdala, and many others.

5|$|According to author Pauline Frommer, Dot {{has been}} {{embraced by the}} viewing British {{population}} as a cultural archetype.

5|$|Advocates {{for higher}} levels of {{selection}} (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober) {{suggest that there are}} many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain. The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene, has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being excessively reductionist; she <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the popularity of Dawkins's work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{its regular}} antenna-like {{structure}} and upright {{position on the}} seafloor {{at a depth of}} 3904 m, some proponents of fringe and UFO-related theories including Bruce Cathie <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> it might be an extraterrestrial artifact. Other authorities <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the object photographed by the Eltanin was an unusual carnivorous sponge, Chondrocladia concrescens (formerly Cladorhiza concrescens).|$|R
5000|$|Researchers {{from the}} 19th century <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> in the 9th century Svealand, which they claimed was the {{historical}} core region of Sweden, expanded southwards, conquering Gothia. Little is known however {{from this time}} and more contemporary researchers <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Gothia {{might as well have}} been the core region, or the two region were joined through a union.|$|R

5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant {{to be affected}} by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached object is accepted in recent publications.|$|E
5|$|Author Marilyn Cannaday <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Doc Savage, {{the pulp}} hero from the 1930s and 1940s, {{was based in}} part on Savage's life, or at least his name. Though he never met Savage, Henry Ralston, one of men who created the pulp character, joined Street and Smith {{publishers}} one year after a collection of Savage's short stories were published.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{most other}} {{important}} crops, {{little is known}} about the domestication, dispersal and cultivation history of the cowpea. Although there is no archaeological evidence for early cowpea cultivation the centre of diversity of the cultivated cowpea is West Africa, leading an early consensus that this is the likely centre of origin and place of early domestication. New research using molecular markers <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> domestication may have instead occurred in East Africa and currently both theories carry equal weight.|$|E

5|$|Corythosaurus is {{currently}} {{classified as a}} hadrosaurid, in the subfamily Lambeosaurinae. It is related to other hadrosaurs such as Hypacrosaurus, Lambeosaurus and Olorotitan, {{with the exception of}} Olorotitan they all share similar looking skulls and crests. However, research published in 2003 <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> even though it possesses a unique crest, Olorotitan is Corythosaurus closest known relative. Benson et al. (2012) found that Corythosaurus was closely related to Velafrons, Nipponosaurus, and Hypacrosaurus, and said that they formed a group of fan-crested lambeosaurines.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> since the right's status {{is not likely to be}} brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.|$|E
5|$|Hume <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the Mascarene parrots have {{a common}} origin in the {{radiation}} of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this theory on morphological features {{and the fact that}} Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.|$|E
