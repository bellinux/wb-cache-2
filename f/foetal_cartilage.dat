40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{were prepared}} that recognize different age-related epitopes on proteoglycan subunits of high buoyant density isolated from human epiphysial and articular cartilages. Antibody EFG- 4 (IgG 1) recognizes a proteinase-sensitive segment {{associated with the}} core protein. Antibody BCD- 4 (IgG 1) reacts with keratan sulphate bound to core protein. Both epitopes are minimally expressed in <b>foetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> and increase with age after birth to become maximally expressed in adult cartilage by about 30 years of age. In contrast, monoclonal antibody alpha HFPG- 846 (IgM) recognizes a core-protein-related epitope that is maximally expressed in young <b>foetal</b> <b>cartilage,</b> declines up to birth and thereafter and is almost absent after about 30 years of age. Antibody alpha HFPG- 846 was used to isolate by immuno-affinity chromatography two subpopulations of proteoglycan subunits from a 16 -year-old-human cartilage proteoglycan subunit preparation. Only the antibody-unbound population showed a significant reaction with antibodies EGF- 4 and BCD- 4. The amino acid and carbohydrate compositions of these proteoglycan fractions were different, and one (antibody-bound) resembled those of foetal and the other (antibody-unbound) resembled those of adult proteoglycans isolated from 24 - 27 -week-old-foetal and 52 - 56 -year-old-adult cartilage respectively. These observations demonstrate that human cartilages contain at least two chemically and immunochemically distinct populations of proteoglycans, the proportions and content of which are age-dependent. It is likely that these populations represent the products of different genes, though their heterogeneity may be compounded by the result of different post-translation modifications...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{cartilage}} lesions in osteoarthritis {{and following}} traumatic injury has important consequences on the weight bearing and articulation of joints, has severe {{impact on the}} quality of life of affected individuals and is of significant socioeconomic impact. Hyaline cartilage is a highly specialised tissue with a limited ability to self repair. Development of three-dimensional scaffolds which maintain the correct chondrocyte phenotype during expansion of cells in-vitro and their application in regenerative strategies for cartilage repair is therefore a major research objective of many laboratories. This study examined the matrix components elaborated by cultured <b>foetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> rudiment cells, a mixture of chondroblasts/chondroprogenitor cells and committed chondrocytes, in monolayer, cell pellet cultures and in the synthetic scaffolds sodium alginate and polyglycolic acid (PGA). The ability of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) - 2 and FGF- 18 to promote chondrogenesis in pellet cultures was also examined. While the scaffolds did not completely replicate the matrix organisation evident in native cartilage, type II collagen and aggrecan were nevertheless prominent matrix components. FGF- 2 and FGF- 18 further promoted the production of cartilage-specific matrix components in pellet culture as FGF- 18 stimulated the production of type X collagen and perlecan and may be indicative of a more terminally differentiated phenotype induced in the rudiment cells with this growth factor...|$|E
40|$|Adult {{articular}} cartilage (AC) has a well described multizonal collagen structure. Knowledge of foetal AC organisation and development {{may provide a}} prototype for cartilage repair strategies, and improve understanding of structural changes in developmental diseases such as osteochondrosis (OC). The objective {{of this study was}} to describe normal development of the spatial architecture of the collagen network of equine AC using 1. 5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and polarised light microscopy (PLM), at sites employed for cartilage repair studies or susceptible to OC. T 2 -weighted fast-spin echo (FSE) sequences and PLM assessment were performed on distal femoral epiphyses of equine foetuses, foals and adults. Both MRI and PLM revealed an early progressive collagen network zonal organisation of the femoral epiphyses, beginning at 4 months of gestation. PLM revealed that the collagen network of equine foetal AC prior to birth was already organised into an evident anisotropic layered structure that included the appearance of a dense tangential zone in the superficial AC in the youngest specimens, with the progressive development of an underlying transitional zone. A third, increasingly birefringent, radial layer developed in the AC from 6 months of gestation. Four laminae were observed on the MR images in the last third of gestation. These included not only the AC but also the superficial growth plate of the epiphysis. These findings provide novel data on normal equine <b>foetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> collagen development, and may serve as a template for cartilage repair studies in this species or a model for developmental studies of OC...|$|E

40|$|Analysis of the {{knee-joint}} cartilage of pigs at five ages (namely foetuses {{from the}} second half of pregnancy and animals 10 weeks, 25 weeks, 3 years and 5 years old) showed that the composition approached that of adult cartilage by 25 weeks of age, the most marked differences being between foetal and 10 week-old cartilage. Protein–polysaccharides were extracted sequentially, first by brief low-speed homogenization with iso-osmotic sodium acetate, then by two extractions with 2 m-CaCl 2 for 24 h with gentle agitation interspersed with brief low-speed homogenization and agitation for another 24 h. About half of the protein–polysaccharides were removed from <b>foetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> by the first extraction and the remainder by the second. The proportion in the first extract declined sharply with the age of the animal, but that in the first CaCl 2 extract was similar at all ages other than 10 weeks. The amount left in the residue increased approximately with the collagen content from about one-fifth at 10 weeks of age to one-third in adult and old cartilage. The proportion of medium-sized protein–polysaccharides in the extracts changed little with age after birth, but the glucosamine content increased about fivefold and the protein content almost doubled between 10 weeks and 5 years of age. Other analytical values changed little. These results cannot be explained solely by changes in the proportion of `link-glycoprotein' in the protein–polysaccharides. Since major changes in most parameters had taken place by 25 weeks of age, the first weeks after birth may be a critical period for cartilage development in the pig...|$|E
40|$|The chondroitin {{sulphate}} epitope 846 of aggrecan is abundant in <b>foetal</b> <b>cartilage,</b> barely detectable in normal adult cartilage, but reappears in the cartilage and body fluids of arthritic patients. This epitope {{has been proposed}} to be a marker of aggrecan synthesis during new cartilage formation and repair. The {{purpose of the present}} studies was to investigate, in vitro, whether the epitope was truly reflective of aggrecan synthesis, and to understand its role in the cartilage repair process. Foetal bovine chondrocyte cultures were established to study aggrecan synthesis in order to investigate whether the epitope 846 was present on these molecules. These studies showed that the epitope was indeed present on the newly synthesised aggrecan molecules and that these were preferentially retained within the extracellular matrix. The larger size and higher epitope density of the matrix molecules, compared to those molecules which were released into culture medium, suggested a role for the 846 -epitope bearing molecules in the formation of new cartilage and during repair. Normal adult articular cartilage cultures were established to investigate whether the epitope could be synthesised by this tissue under conditions where the tissue had been stimulated to repair a damaged matrix, by trypsin-treatment of the cartilage. In these studies, an increase in abundance of the epitope on newly synthesised proteoglycans was observed, further indicating a role for the epitope-bearing molecules in cartilage repair. Explant cultures of osteoarthritic cartilage demonstrated that the release of the 846 -bearing molecules from the cartilage was accompanied by the release of some of the newly synthesised 35 S-sulphate labelled proteoglycans from the cartilage, and that these molecules contained, in part at least, the epitope. In addition, the release of 846 -bearing molecules from the cartilage into culture medium or synovial fluid was reflective of the epitope content of the tissue. The str...|$|E
40|$|Notch {{signalling}} and its downstream mediators, the helix-loop-helix (HLH) {{family of}} transcription factors, {{are characterized by}} {{a broad spectrum of}} functions, from cell proliferation and differentiation to apoptosis. The aim of this thesis was to investigate if the Notch signalling pathway controls chondrogenesis. Further, we wanted to investigate the role of Notch signalling in osteoarthritis (OA) and Notch as a marker for chondroprogenitor cells. We found that chondrocytes during chondrogenesis in vitro differentiate towards a hyaline cartilage-like phenotype in a process mimicking <b>foetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> development. Since this process during development starts with condensation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), it is of interest to study whether adult MSCs also possesses the ability to differentiate towards the chondrogenic lineage. MSCs and articular chondrocytes differentiated towards different cartilage phenotypes, hyaline and hypertrophic respectively. Several HLH genes, including HES 1, HES 5, ID 1, and Dec 1, were differentially expressed between chondrocytes and MSCs as well as during differentiation, thus being potential regulators of chondrogenesis. We then focused our attention on one of these genes, the at the time unknown human HES 5 gene and showed that the expression of HES 5 was regulated by Notch signalling. Transcription of several Notch receptors, their ligands, and HES 5, were significantly reduced during chondrogenesis. Transfection of HES 5 to ATDC 5 cells demonstrated that HES 5 especially regulates genes controlling the early stages of chondrogenesis. Transgenic mice lacking both the HES 1 and the HES 5 genes displayed no apparent defects in their formation of cartilage and long bones, which probably is explained by functional redundancy between the genes belonging to the family of HES genes. Although Notch 1 is considered a marker for progenitor cells in several tissues as well as in cartilage from young donors, we found no evidence for Notch 1 as a marker for chondroprogenitors in adult cartilage. Since chondrocytes in patients with OA are in another phenotypical state than chondrocytes from a healthy joint, we then investigated whether these cells had an aberrant Notch signalling. An abundant expression of HES 5, Notch 1, and Jagged 1 were detected in OA cartilage. Microarray analysis revealed that activated Notch signalling induces and represses genes that could potentially contribute to the OA phenotype. TNF-á or IL- 1 â significantly repressed transcription of several Notch markers but did not affect the cellular localization of Notch intracellular domain 1 (NICD 1). The increased production of cytokines characteristic for OA thus does not explain the abundant expression of Notch 1, Jagged 1, or HES 5 detected in OA. Cytokines repressed HES 5 transcription via induction of NFkB rather than the canonical NICD pathway. The results presented in this thesis thus show that Notch signalling influences several different chondrogenic processes...|$|E
40|$|Chondrocyte {{hypertrophy}} makes {{important contributions}} to bone development and growth. We have investigated {{a number of}} novel cartilage genes identified in a recent transcriptomic study {{to determine whether they}} are differentially expressed between different zones of equine <b>foetal</b> growth <b>cartilage.</b> Twelve genes (ATP 6 V 0 D 2, BAK 1, DDX 5, GNB 1, PIP 4 K 2 A, RAP 1 B, RPS 7, SRSF 3, SUB 1, TMSB 4, TPI 1 and WSB 2) were found to be more highly expressed in the zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes than in the reserve or proliferative zones, whereas FOXA 3 and SERPINA 1 were expressed at lower levels in the hypertrophic zone than in the reserve zone. ATP 6 V 0 D 2, which encodes vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) V 0 subunit d 2 (ATP 6 V 0 D 2), was selected for further study. Immunohistochemical analysis of ATP 6 V 0 D 2 in growth cartilage showed stronger staining in hypertrophic than in reserve zone or proliferative chondrocytes. Expression of ATP 6 V 0 D 2 mRNA and protein was up-regulated in the mouse chondrocytic ATDC 5 cell line by conditions inducing expression of hypertrophy-associated genes including Col 10 a 1 and Mmp 13 (differentiation medium). In ATDC 5 cells cultured in control medium, knockdown of Atp 6 v 0 d 2 or inhibition of V-ATPase activity using bafilomycin A 1 caused a decrease in Col 2 a 1 expression, and in cells cultured in differentiation medium the two treatments caused a decrease in nuclear area. Inhibition of V-ATPase, but not Atp 6 v 0 d 2 knockdown, prevented the upregulation of Col 10 a 1, Mmp 13 and Vegf by differentiation medium, while Atp 6 v 0 d 2 knockdown, but not inhibition of V-ATPase, caused {{an increase in the number}} of ATDC 5 cells cultured in differentiation medium. These observations identify ATP 6 V 0 D 2 as a novel chondrocyte hypertrophy-associated gene. The results are consistent with roles for V-ATPase, both ATP 6 V 0 D 2 -dependent and -independent, in supporting chondrocyte differentiation and hypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} aryl and alkyl O-beta-D-xylosides and their analogues with S, NH or CH 2 in the glycosidic linkage were {{prepared}} and examined {{for their ability}} to act as artificial chain initiators of chondroitin (dermatan) sulphate synthesis in embryonic chick <b>cartilage,</b> <b>foetal</b> rat skin and 6 -week-old-rat aorta under conditions where normal protein-core synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. For all these tissues in culture, phenyl O-beta-D-xyloside and phenyl beta-D-thioxyloside were clearly more effective than the corresponding N-xyloside and homo-C-xyloside. Introduction of a carboxy group to the para position of their aglycone yielded derivatives with far lower initiator activity. In a concentration range lower than 0. 1 mM, the effectiveness of alkyl beta-D-thioxyloside was greatly influenced by the carbon number (n) of the alkyl group and was at a maximum at n = 7 or 8 for the cartilage, at n = 5 for the skin and at n = 4 for the aorta. In the beta-xyloside-treated cartilages, the average length of newly formed chondroitin sulphate chains reflected the chain-initiator activity of added xyloside, i. e. the higher the initiator activity, the shorter the average chain length. In the skin and aorta, none of the drugs could relieve the inhibition of heparan sulphate synthesis caused by cycloheximide. Fertilized hens' eggs were each injected on day 9 with 9. 2 mumol of beta-xyloside and the skeletal systems of embryos were examined a week later. The embryos treated with beta-xylosides of relatively high initiator activity showed a 30 - 40 % decrease in the overall growth rate of skeletons, whereas those treated with beta-xylosides of low initiator activity showed little or no decrease in the growth rate. The results are consistent with the notion that the observed change in skeletal morphology results mainly, if not completely, from beta-xyloside-induced synthesis of core-protein-free chondroitin sulphate, and further suggest that a procedure employing a series of beta-xyloside homologues with various initiator activities will furnish an easily applied criterion on which to test the specificity of xyloside action on biological processes...|$|R
