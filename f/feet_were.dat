5|$|Pule fled to Barrio Gibanga in Sariaya but was {{captured}} by Colonel Huet's forces the following evening. On November 4, 1841, after a summary trial held at the modern-day Casa Comunidad, he was executed by firing squad {{in the town of}} Tayabas at age 27. The authorities had his body quartered. His dismembered head, hands, and <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> exhibited throughout Tayabas province.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the first episodes was negative, with many reviewers not liking the characters and finding the comedy drama format unusual. As the series progressed, critics' opinions became more positive; the production values rated highly and the fantasy scenes, which became a hallmark of Cold <b>Feet,</b> <b>were</b> well received. An average of eight million viewers watched the series each week. The following year it won awards from the Royal Television Society, the Broadcasting Press Guild and the British Comedy Awards. It was also nominated for the Rose d'Or and a Banff Rockie Award. All six episodes have been released on VHS, DVD and internet media formats.|$|E
5|$|During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, {{parts and}} {{remnants}} of the storm reached Presque Isle. The park was closed in preparation of the storm and waves for 14 – 18 <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> called for, along with high winds. The storm {{was expected to be}} severe, but luckily was not. Only 8 foot waves were recorded and not as high of winds either. The park made it out with only minor flooding, a few downed trees, and the loss of power at the park marina.|$|E
50|$|A {{memorial}} to Michael <b>Foot</b> <b>is</b> situated in Freedom Fields Park in Plymouth, Devon. <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> born in Plymouth, {{and served as}} member of parliament for Plymouth Devonport between 1945 and 1955. The memorial stands opposite the house where <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> born.|$|R
25|$|Paul <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> married twice, to Monica (née Beckinsale, 1962–70) and Rose (Roseanne, née Harvey, 1971–93) {{and had a}} {{long-term}} relationship with Clare Fermont. He had three sons (the two eldest from his first marriage) and a daughter from these three relationships: John <b>Foot</b> <b>is</b> an academic and writer specialising in Italy, Matt <b>Foot</b> <b>is</b> a solicitor, and Tom <b>Foot</b> <b>is</b> a journalist. With Fermont, Foot had a daughter, Kate.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> usually dislocated medially (80%) and superiorly, {{which occurs}} when the <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> plantar flexed and inverted.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character and good or bad luck. Horses with white socks on their <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> considered to have good or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show good or bad luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E
5|$|Makeup artist Baker {{provided}} the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and his hands and <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> fitted with liquid substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and soles of the <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> involved {{in the majority of}} cases. Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E
5000|$|In this example, {{the first}} and second <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> dactyls; their first syllables, [...] "Ar" [...] and [...] "rum" [...] respectively, contain short vowels, but count as long because the vowels are both {{followed}} by two consonants. The third and fourth <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> spondees, the first of which is divided by the main caesura of the verse. The fifth <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> a dactyl, as is nearly always the case. The final <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> a spondee.|$|R
50|$|One <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> {{placed in}} front of the other so that the heel of the front <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> near the arch.|$|R
5000|$|His left <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> forward. In the {{original}} cover, McCartney's right <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> forward, {{out of step}} with the other Beatles.|$|R
5|$|The {{person was}} first whipped, or beaten, with virgis sanguinis ("blood-colored rods", probably), {{and his head}} was clad/covered in a bag made of a wolf's hide. On his <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into the sack was also an {{assortment}} of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, a monkey and a dog. The sack was put on a cart, and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, the sack with its inhabitants was thrown into the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{walk back}} to Bear Valley was very slow; at one point, Reed sent ahead {{two of the men}} to {{retrieve}} the first cache of food, expecting the third relief to come at any moment, a small party led by Selim E. Woodworth. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner's <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to get up and move, not having eaten for days. The relief party {{had no choice but to}} leave without them.|$|E
5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E
5000|$|In the Philippines, chicken <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> {{marinated in}} a mixture of calamansi, spices and brown sugar before being grilled.

50|$|In 2005, Nevinny {{underwent}} major surgery. Nevinny's left <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> amputated {{because of}} gangrene. In 2006, his second <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> amputated, as the illness progressed.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of fourth position: open and closed. In both cases, one <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed {{approximately}} twelve inches in front of the other. In open fourth position the heels are aligned, while in closed fourth position the heel of the front <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> aligned with the toe of the back <b>foot.</b> There <b>are</b> two variations of each type of fourth position, determined by which <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> in front.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed front edge and a shallow, triangular keel. The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> as long as the small third finger.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, {{due to a}} pre-match stipulation, to hit {{each other in the}} face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling tights to reveal their buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> on the ropes. Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended to faint, which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing water on her, but he hit Michaels as well. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being left behind by both men, Sherri screamed and cried as she walked backstage.|$|E
5|$|Lex Luger was {{accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by four women with revealing outfits {{as he prepared to}} face Mr. Perfect. The match began with technical wrestling, and Perfect tried to injure Luger's knee while Luger worked on Perfect's back. Perfect took control of the match with a powerslam and tried to pin Luger after performing a dropkick from the top rope. Luger's foot was on the ropes, however, so the referee halted the three-count and continued the match. Luger gained momentum and pinned Perfect; Perfect's <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> on the rope, but the referee did not see them. Luger continued to attack Perfect after the match and hit him with his forearm, which contains a steel plate {{as the result of a}} legitimate motorcycle accident. When Perfect got up, he chased Luger but was attacked by Shawn Michaels backstage.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, many prosodists divide a {{line into}} feet—the minimal {{repeated}} units—using the pipe symbol (|). When <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> thus designated, words that span <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> divided without hyphens, and any punctuation that occurs at a <b>foot</b> break <b>is</b> typically omitted.|$|R
5000|$|If both <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> off {{the floor}} and the player lands on both feet simultaneously, the moment one <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> lifted, the other foot becomes the pivot foot.|$|R
5000|$|A Russian pivot turn, as {{described}} by Bessie and May Evans, is performed as follows. The right <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed flat and the left <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed with the toe by the right heel and the left heel raised and this relative position basically maintained during the turning. The turn starts with the right foot raised from the floor. While continuously revolving, on each strong beat (downbeat) the right <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> stepped flat and on each weak beat (upbeat) the left <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> stepped on the ball (by the right heel).|$|R
5|$|On the bird's {{forehead}} was a {{naked and}} pale chalky-blue frontal shield. This {{was surrounded by}} short, velvety black feathers that extended {{from the base of}} the bill to the area just below and in front of the eye, while the area below the eye was a pinkish wash. The bird's chin and throat were sparsely covered with black, velvety feathers, while the neck was a slaty-blue that transitioned into a brownish-grey breast. The abdomen and undertail-coverts were a rich orange, while the undertail was a blackish-grey. The wing was slaty with a hint of brown at its base and became a warm, dark brown by the wingtips; the underwing was brown. The back was grey and transitioned into a browner rump, while the uppertail-coverts were a dark sooty-grey with blackish tips. The tail, which was short and rounded, was a very dark indigo that had a slightly purple iridescent sheen. The bill was bicoloured; the upper mandible was chalky-blue with a black tip while the lower mandible was red. The plumage of the juvenile is unknown. The bird's <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> a dull purplish-red and unfeathered up to the heel, while the iris was a dark brown.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys antillarum was a {{medium-sized}} rodent, about {{as large as}} O.couesi. According to Thomas's description, the upperparts were reddish, slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head. The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The small ears were black on the outer and yellow {{on the inner side}} and the upper surfaces of the hands and <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> whitish. The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below. Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more reddish, but their color may have been altered because they had been preserved in alcohol. Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below. Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens with examples of the reddish Florida subspecies of the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris natator, for Ray and found that they were more reddish than even the most strongly colored animals from Florida.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E
50|$|What is the due of a {{king who}} is always in {{residence}} {{at the head of}} his tuath? Seven score feet of perfect <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> the measure of his stockade on every side.

5|$|The bones {{found on}} 25 August were {{uncovered}} on 4 September and the grave soil dug back further {{over the next}} two days. The <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> missing, and the skull was found in an unusual propped-up position, consistent with the body being put into a grave that was slightly too small. The spine was curved in an S-shape. No sign of a coffin was found; the skeleton's posture suggested the body had not been put in a shroud, but had been hurriedly dumped into the grave and buried. As the bones were lifted from the ground, a piece of rusted iron was found underneath the vertebrae. The skeleton's hands were in an unusual position, crossed over the right hip, suggesting they were tied together at the time of burial, although this could not be established definitively. After the exhumation, work continued in the trenches over the following week, before the site was covered with soil to protect it from damage and re-surfaced to restore the car park and playground to their former condition.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E
5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} the event on Raw was between WWE Champion John Cena and The Great Khali. This was a rematch of their {{encounter}} at Judgment Day, the pay-per-view two weeks before One Night Stand. At the event, Cena defeated Khali by forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU. When Khali submitted to the STFU, however, his <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> underneath the bottom rope, meaning Cena should have broken the submission hold. Referee Mike Chioda was focusing on Khali's arm and did not see Khali's feet underneath the bottom rope. The following night on Raw, believing he should not have lost the match, Khali challenged Cena to a Pinfalls Count Anywhere match. After Cena's acceptance, Khali Chokeslamed Cena. Heading into One Night Stand, Khali Chokebombed Cena again to win a non-title match against Cena on the June 2 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|E
