5|$|Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. Turboprop options were also considered, but they were so new that Bristol could not <b>guarantee</b> <b>the</b> performance specifications.|$|E

The allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat of the Allies to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely the allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would <b>guarantee</b> <b>the</b> security of the Peloponnese.

5|$|Houlding died in 1902, and in 1905 the {{ownership}} of the club was restructured. Of the existing 3,000 shares, 2,000 were held by the Houlding family.

The family offered {{to give up the}} 2,000 shares and wipe out the debt, if the club relieved them of the bank loan <b>guarantee.</b> <b>The</b> board agreed, and a new share issue was released in 1906 with 15,000 shares available for £1 each.

5|$|In QFT, {{the demand}} for {{relativistic}} invariance enters, among other ways in that the S-matrix necessarily must be Poincaré invariant.

5|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1766. During the Sejm in October of that year, Poniatowski {{attempted}} to push a radical reform, restricting the disastrous liberum veto policy. He was opposed by conservatives such as Michał Wielhorski, who were supported by the Prussian and Russian ambassadors, who threatened war if the reform was passed. The dissidents, supported by the Russians, formed a confederation, the Radom Confederation. Abandoned by the Familia, Poniatowski's reforms failed to pass at the Repnin Sejm, named after Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin, who promised to <b>guarantee</b> <b>the</b> Golden Liberties of the Polish nobility, enshrined in the Cardinal Laws, with all the might of the Russian Empire.|$|E

She reacted by expelling the foreigners from the island and subjecting all the implicated Merina officers to the tangena ordeal in which they were forced to swallow a poison to determine their guilt or innocence. Rainilaiarivony and his brother were excepted from this and remained, like her son Radama, in the queen's confidence for the few remaining years of her life.|$|E
