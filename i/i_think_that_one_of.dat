2500|$|On June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn {{deposition}} as {{a character}} witness for Alger Hiss, a former State Department official who was later {{found to be a}} spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the legal division of the AAA in 1933, and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950 Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson's deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by Senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to [...] "inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as 'soft on communism'." [...] In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson's [...] "defense of Hiss" [...] reflected such [...] "poor judgment" [...] on his part that [...] "doubt was cast about Adlai's capacity to govern." [...] In a 1952 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying [...] "I'm a lawyer. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most fundamental responsibilities...particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, {{and it will be a}} very unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public life, is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity." ...|$|E

He also has produced a strong body of documentary and street photography that reflects his having studied with Diane Arbus {{and worked in the}} studio of Richard Avedon.” About the project, Selkirk {{said in an interview with}} the Los Angeles Review of Books, [...] "Motherhood leaves its mark.

40|$|That’s {{special in}} Polish {{sociology}} of literature, {{that so many}} priests take part in modem Polish literary life. Scientific men arc interest in “ the priests poetry”, {{but some of them}} think, that only a part of these poems are special. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most interesting poets is Jerzy Szymik. He creates religious art. In my essay I tried to show, how personal his poems are. In his books people can see all the sides of existencia! roles of the humans. Jerzy Szymik and his soul means: “ family man”, priest, human from Śląsk, European, “human of the books” and “human of the words”. The last aspect has realised in two ways - religious and as a poet. All these aspects join each other. Together - there are the truthes about human life. The most important element for Szymik is belief in miracle - Goddes soul in human body.

40|$|I don 2 ̆ 7 t see any {{solution}} in sight for fruit {{damage caused by}} birds. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons {{is that there has}} been very little research done concerning the relationship between birds and fruit crops. Probably the reason is that those birds responsible are protected species, and they are highly desirable birds {{in the eyes of the}} public. For instance, one of the species that is responsible for heavy losses in fruit crops is the robin. It is the state bird in Michigan, yet it causes a number of problems there each year. Another problem is that growing fruit isn 2 ̆ 7 t as common as grain production. Wherever you do have fruit in any concentration, the losses are severe in most cases. Every district in which I 2 ̆ 7 ve been stationed I 2 ̆ 7 ve run into this kind of problem. I 2 ̆ 7 ve seen it in New England, the Southeast, and now the Midwest. Each time the question is: 2 ̆ 2 How do I keep birds from eating cherries, blueberries, grapes, and so forth. 2 ̆ 2 And I just don 2 ̆ 7 t know. For the most part the problem is birds eating ripe fruit. In two instances, I 2 ̆ 7 ve seen large roosts of starlings in apple orchards, contaminating fruit through their roosting habits. In Massachusetts, we had trouble with grouse damaging apple orchards by eating the fruit buds. Many of the state game departments would love to have this problem. For the most part my comments will be limited to those experiences which I 2 ̆ 7 ve had in Maine, Massachusetts, South Carolina, Michigan, and Ohio. My first association with bird damage concerned seagulls eating blueberries. I ran into seagulls eating cranberries, and recently I hear that they have been caught eating tomatoes. These gull problems took place in Maine. In Massachusetts I had experience with songbirds taking blueberries and peaches; in South Carolina it was starlings in grapes; Ohio has had problems with songbirds in blueberries, cherries, and grapes, and Michigan, again, songbirds in cherries and blueberries...|$|E
40|$|When {{pondering the}} {{question}} of future research needs in biology didactics <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my previous research threads and one current are extra important, both concern secondary classrooms. The previous research methodology includes collaboration with practicing teachers {{with the aim of}} investigating and developing teachers’ professional knowledge in terms of PCK, pedagogical content knowledge - but in action. This means that it is the classroom practice that is foregrounded and “enacted PCK” not beliefs or theoretical knowledge about how to teach. Inspired by design-based research and Japanese lesson studies I have lead groups of biology teachers when they plan, enact and asses teaching about specific objects of learning. For example, “gene to expression”, “what constitutes a scientific theory” or “circulation of food and oxygen in the human body”. The point of departure is that improvement is more sustainable if enacted in teachers own authentic practice, in collaboration with their colleagues and the researchers {{have to be prepared to}} share their competence in areas that matter for the teachers. Currently I am engaged in SALT (Science and Literacy Teaching) which is a “content and language integrated learning project”, funded by the Swedish research council where we investigate the development of students’ scientific knowledge when introducing selected literacy aspects. We work in collaboration with teachers in multicultural classrooms and develop literacy strategies such as reading and writing in science. However, literacy in science classroom includes models, graphs, formulas and other representations that are mathematical, visual and verbal. Representations that often are displayed and produced with digital media and especially we focus important semantic patterns in biology, for example casual explanations, levels of organization, modeling etc. Future research need to keep on investigating the multimodal ways that biology is communicated with. Biology classrooms has always made use of drawings, animations and physical models but now we need more attention towards digital animations and models and how they give new affordances and hinders. Examples of affordances might be more convenient and easier-made teaching materials, while examples of new challenges are that pseudo-science is faster spread and the correspondence between important semantic patterns in biology and the digital representation might be blurred; the need of a scaffolding teacher is still important. Another pressing, but more regional issue concerns the large cohorts of new arrivals of refuges, for example in Sweden and Germany (and of course Greece but with somewhat more severe societal implications) and their future education. My hypothesis is that more focus on integrating content and language would be beneficial for newcomers who in many cases have conceptual knowledge, but expressed in other languages that Swedish. However, this has to be regarded as question which needs empirical research. Both examples of “future needs of research” will in my opinion are best conducted in collaboration with teachers in their authentic classroom practice – research with teachers and not on teachers...|$|E
