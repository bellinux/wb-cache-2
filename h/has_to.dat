The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E

5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark {{and have an}} intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the season}} tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden <b>has</b> <b>to</b> have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber <b>has</b> <b>to</b> have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark <b>has</b> <b>to</b> have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E

5|$|So {{direction}} 0 {{indicates the}} worm continues to travel straight ahead, direction 1 indicates the worm {{will make a}} right turn of 60° and similarly for the other directions. The worm cannot travel in direction 3 {{because that is the}} gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 the first time it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make a choice, in direction 0 the next time it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make a choice and so on. If there is only one available gridline, the worm {{has no choice but to}} take it and this is usually not explicitly listed.|$|E
