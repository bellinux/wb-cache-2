40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of a model to analize <b>direct</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>cost</b> per student at the class level in Years 11 and 12, the final 2 years of secondary schooling in Victoria, Australia. Cost per student was modelled as a function of class size, teacher time developed to that class and teacher earnings. Class sizes were found to vary by subject or learning area and the school's total student enrolment in Years 11 and 12. The proportion of a class-teacher's total work time that is devoted to activities related directly to teaching the class was found to vary with the class was found to vary with the class teachers' sex, their appointment fraction {{and whether or not they}} had higher duties. It also varied with the class size, the enrolment in Years 11 and 12, and the learning area. Earnings were found to vary with the sex of the teacher, whether or not they had higher duties and the learning area they taught in, and to a smaller extent with the enrolment in Years 11 and 12. The model provides predictions for class size and unit cost for each learning area for various levels of enrolment in Years 11 and 12. Predictions of cost per student for foreign-language classes were almost twice as much as that for English classes, and mathematics classes had the lowest cost per student. ...|$|E

40|$|Method {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the teaching of language. It is a planned and systematic effort of the teacher for establishing sequence in the various parts of the <b>teaching.</b> The <b>direct</b> method, as its name suggests, is teaching the foreign language without the interference of mother tongue. It is also called "natural method" because the students learn the foreign language in the same way as they learn their mother tongue. In this method, not the word but the sentence is the unit of the grammar, while the traditional method aims at teaching English by word-to-word translation in mother tongue. The child begins to develop his vocabulary from a single word. The Solomon four-group design was used for the treatment of the data. The students of Federal Government boy's secondary schools of Islamabad were the population of the study. In this design: Subjects were randomly assigned to four groups. Two groups received the experimental treatment (T) One experimental group received a pretest (O 1). Two groups (control) received treatment (C). One control group received a pretest (O 3). All four groups received posttests (O 2 O 4 O 5 O 6) Intelligence test was administered to determine the level of each student before treatment and to equalize the students of four groups. Experimental groups were taught by direct method while the Control groups were taught by traditional method for a period of three months. At the end of the treatment, a posttest was administered and scores of pre-test, posttest and intelligence test served as data of the study. Applying t-test and analysis of variance tested to know the significance of difference between the scores of groups at 0. 05 levels. The main objectives of the study were: (a) to determine the role of <b>direct</b> <b>teaching</b> in the academic achievement of student in English at secondary level, (b) to determine whether the <b>direct</b> <b>teaching</b> method is more effective than traditional method in teaching of English, (c) to examine the effects of <b>direct</b> <b>teaching</b> on the academic achievement of high achievers and low achievers, (d) to investigate whether the students can retain the learning for a longer time when taught through direct method, (e) to give recommendations for improvement of suitable method of teaching English at secondary level. To achieve the objectives of the study, null hypotheses were formulated and tested. Obtained data was analyzed, interpreted and concluded that <b>direct</b> <b>teaching</b> method was more effective as a teaching-learning technique for English as compared to traditional teaching method. Students in the <b>direct</b> <b>teaching</b> method outscored than students working in traditional learning situation. Low achievers in <b>direct</b> <b>teaching</b> showed significant superiority over low achievers learning English by the traditional method. Thus <b>direct</b> <b>teaching</b> was found to be more effective method for teaching English to the low achievers as compared to traditional method of teaching. High achievers, whether they were taught English by direct method or traditional method, retained learnt material at the same rate.

The Effectiveness of Story Circle Method in Teaching Reading Viewed From Students’ Risk Taking Behavior (An Experimental Study on the Seventh Grade Students of SMP Kristen Satya Wacana Salatiga in the Academic Year of 2013 / 2014). First Consultant: Dr. Abdul Asib, M. Pd.; Second Consultant: Dra. Dewi Rochsantiningsih, M. Ed. Ph. D. Thesis. Surakarta. English Education Department of Graduate School, Sebelas Maret University of Surakarta. 2014. The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to find out: (1) whether Story Circle Method is better than <b>Direct</b> <b>Teaching</b> Method for teaching reading skill; (2) whether students having high level of Risk Taking Behavior have better reading skill than those having low level of Risk Taking Behavior; (3) {{whether there is an}} interaction between the methods of teaching and students‘ Risk Taking Behavior in teaching reading. The independent variables in this research are teaching methods (Story Circle Method and <b>Direct</b> <b>Teaching</b> Method) in teaching reading and the attributive variable is risk taking behavior while the dependent variable is reading skill. The researcher conducted the research in the first semester of the seventh grader students of SMP Kristen Satya Wacana, Salatiga in the academic year of 2013 / 2014. There are two classes in this research, the experimental class (VIIC) and the control class (VIIB). In this case, the technique used to obtain the sample was cluster random sampling. The techniques of collecting data were a non-test (a questionnaire for Risk Taking Behavior) and a test (reading test of descriptive text). The questionnaire and the reading test were valid and reliable after they were tried out. In this research, the data of reading test were analyzed by using multifactor analysis of variance 2 x 2. Then, it was analyzed by using Tukey test. It was used to reveal the significant difference between the teaching methods. The results of the research reveals that: First, Story Circle Method is more effective than <b>Direct</b> <b>Teaching</b> Method for teaching reading. Second, students having high level of Risk Taking Behavior have better reading skill than the students having low level of Risk Taking Behavior. Third, there is an interaction between the methods used and students‘ Risk Taking Behavior in teaching reading: (1) Story Circle Method is more effective than <b>Direct</b> <b>Teaching</b> Method in teaching reading for students having high level of Risk Taking Behavior; (2) <b>Direct</b> <b>Teaching</b> Method is more effective than Story Circle in teaching Reading for students having low level of Risk Taking Behavior. Dealing with the result above, it is expected that teachers can choose the method he/she uses properly to teach reading in order to improve the students’ skill of reading by considering students’ level of risk taking behavior.

40|$|This {{research}} concerns <b>teaching</b> <b>cost</b> as {{an integral}} design determinant during architectural foundation design education. It is an assumption of this research that most design {{students are encouraged to}} provide unique but often costly solutions without regard for the reality of financial limitations. Despite its importance, this issue has yet to be systematically investigated. This study suggests ways to improve and strengthen architectural foundation design education with learning objectives that include cost {{as an integral}} design determinant. Critical design methods and approaches in <b>teaching</b> <b>cost</b> considerations during foundation design education was developed for students to interpret indicators and integrate them with other design considerations. Furthermore, this study assessed the effectiveness of indicators and the integrative quality of students? design to improve the value of cost determinism {{as a part of the}} foundation design curriculum. The U. S. -based architecture educators and design professionals were surveyed to investigate their perspectives and methods of <b>teaching</b> <b>cost</b> conscious and economic design concepts in foundation design education. Individual interviews were accompanied to determine and define cost indicators responding to fundamental building elements. Finally, a quasi-experiment was conducted in order to compare an existing second-year design course with a newly developed course with an aim to enhance students? understanding of cost conscious design in architectural foundation education. The survey result suggests that a gap exists in foundation design education with respect to cost as an integral design determinant. The key informant interviews further iii confirm that there is a gap in architectural education pertaining to the topic of cost as a fundamental design determinant, and identified the importance of teaching the topic in architectural foundation design education. Cost indicators that affect construction cost were defined as they are appropriate to the second-year design students. Cost indicators were used as a device in this experiment to test and measure the effectiveness of cost indicators. As a result, this study found the impact and appropriateness of learning cost as a fundamental design determinant compared to the existing second-year design studio course. This research implies that <b>teaching</b> <b>cost</b> as an integral design determinant in foundation design studio courses is an effective educational method to improving students? perspective of cost. The implications of cost indicators and understanding of cost as a design determinant should help young designers produce and appreciate realistic design. This study should be of particular interest to design instructors and educators, as well as affordable housing design and construction practitioners...|$|R

Questions are important communication tools that are used by the teacher for various purposes and underpin different visions of what it means to teach mathematics.

The paper constitutes a reflection on teachers´ questioning within an inquiry-based approach to teaching mathematics, based on available research and illustrated by classroom episodes of three basic education teachers. Our reflection has led us to advocate the central role of the teacher’s questions in inquiry-based mathematics teaching, having two main goals: (i) verification of knowledge, a questioning goal that is common to the <b>direct</b> <b>teaching</b> approach; and (ii) development of knowledge, a questioning goal that is specific to inquiry-based teaching. These two goals are attained using three types of questions which may be present in all phases of an inquiry-based lesson, albeit with different weights according to the lesson phases and the teacher’s own goals.
