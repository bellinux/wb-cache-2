The growth <b>in</b> <b>day</b> schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools. It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education {{as a result of their}} transition into the public school system.|$|E

5|$|House sparrows can {{breed in}} the {{breeding}} season immediately following their hatching, and sometimes {{attempt to do}} so. Some birds breeding {{for the first time}} in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage. Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, as older birds breed earlier in the breeding season, and fledge more young. As the breeding season approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes <b>in</b> <b>day</b> length lead males to start calling by nesting sites. The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.|$|E

50|$|As a Bishop, Seybert was {{required}} to travel extensively throughout the expanding Church, both in general ministry {{as well as to}} preside at all Conferences. He traveled by carriage where roads were passable. Where there were no roads, he traveled on horseback, and sometimes walked. His travels ranged from New York, to New Jersey, to the Shenandoah Valley, to southwestern Pennsylvania, as far west as St. Louis, eastern Iowa, northern Illinois, Milwaukee, Detroit, Waterloo in Canada, Buffalo, and the Mohawk Valley. In one year (1850), for example, he traveled 106 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania, 50 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> New York, 60 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Ohio, 11 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Michigan, 34 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Indiana, 81 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Illinois, 14 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Wisconsin, 6 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Maryland, and 3 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Canada (for a total of 365 <b>days).</b> Although <b>in</b> later years he could have traveled by train, Bishop Seybert continued his previous methods of travel because it allowed him to minister to people in need all along his route.|$|R

Johnson struggled to score, while Tallon did so freely in the last hour. After Johnson fell for four at 7/246, Lindwall then joined Tallon and the pair survived to the close of play. England were well placed when Australia ended at stumps on 7/258 with Tallon on 25. Tallon had dominated the scoring late <b>in</b> <b>day,</b> making 25 of the 33 runs added. The crowd was optimistic about England's position and some immediately camped outside the turnstiles upon leaving the ground.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} game modes <b>in</b> <b>Day</b> of Defeat: Source: {{territorial}} control and detonation. In territorial control maps, players must fight for control of all strategic points on the map. The strategic points take various forms, such as a destroyed tank in a street or fields and buildings, and are designated by a flag in its vicinity, which displays the army colors of the team who controls the point. Points are captured by {{a certain number of}} team members surrounding the point, with it either capturing instantly or after a couple of seconds. Players on the other side can disrupt a capture by placing themselves within the capture area during the process or by killing the enemy players at the point. The first side to hold all the points simultaneously wins the round.|$|E
5|$|Both factions <b>in</b> <b>Day</b> of Defeat: Source {{have access}} to six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes are armed with pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with rifle grenades, the assault classes are armed with a single fragmentation grenade and a smoke grenade for providing concealment, while support classes {{have access to}} two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen are armed with the M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and are designed for medium to long range combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes are designed for medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from long range, and are consequently armed with the Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with long range scopes. Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is armed with a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is armed with either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E
