5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, several sets of {{communication}} protocols <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> fill {{the gaps between}} the data-link layer and the application layer of the OSI reference model. These included Appletalk, IPX, and NetBIOS with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with MS-DOS users. TCP/IP existed at this point, but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities.|$|E

5|$|After 616, Rædwald, {{who ruled}} East Anglia {{during the first}} quarter of the seventh century, was the most {{powerful}} of the southern Anglo-Saxon kings. In the following decades, from the reign of Sigeberht onwards, East Anglia became increasingly dominated by Mercia. Raedwald's son Eorpwald was murdered by a pagan noble soon after he was baptised in around 627, after which East Anglia reverted into paganism for three years. In the void left by the death of Rædwald, the first overlord who originated north of the Thames, the pagan Penda of Mercia, <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> challenge the pre-eminence of the new overlord (or bretwalda), Edwin of Northumbria. The reversion of East Anglia to rule by Eorpwald's successor, the pagan Ricberht, possibly due to Mercian influence, temporarily overthrew an important pillar of Edwin's authority.|$|E
5|$|After World War I the Liberal Party {{began to}} disintegrate. As the Liberals {{splintered}} Labour <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> become {{the party of}} progressive politics in Scotland, gaining a solid following among working classes of the urban lowlands, {{and as a result}} the Unionists were able to gain most of the votes of the middle classes, who now feared Bolshevik revolution, setting the social and geographical electoral pattern in Scotland that would last until the late 20th century. With all the main parties committed to the Union new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the National Party of Scotland in 1928 and Scottish Party in 1930. They joined together to form the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934 with the goal of creating an independent Scotland, but it enjoyed little electoral success in the Westminster system.|$|E
5|$|Concerned that {{allegations}} of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue these associations, and later {{felt compelled to}} issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the Civil Rights movement and investigated the {{allegations of}} communist infiltration. When no evidence <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape {{over the next five}} years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the COINTELPRO program.|$|E

5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he {{took control of the}} country, as a conspiracy <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E
5|$|Eclogue 4, {{also known}} as the Fourth Eclogue is the name of a Latin poem by the Roman poet Virgil. Part of his first major work, the Eclogues, the piece was written around 40 BC, during a time of {{temporary}} stability following the Treaty of Brundisium; it was later published in and around the years 39–38 BC. The work describes the birth of a boy, a supposed savior, who once of age will become divine and eventually rule over the world. During late antiquity and the Middle Ages, a desire <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> view Virgil as a virtuous pagan, and as such, early Christians, such as Roman Emperor Constantine, early Christian theologian Lactantius, and St. Augustineto varying degreesreinterpreted the poem to be about the birth of Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|Geologically the Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{was once}} {{part of a large}} and shallow sea that covered most of southern California. As the San Joaquin Hills rose and river sediments were deposited, land gradually <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> form the present-day Orange County coast. Sulphur Creek is located in a crumpled, hilly area {{in the southern part of}} this range, formed differently from the continuous mountain chain to the north. Historically, being south of Aliso Creek, the Sulphur Creek watershed was part of the territory of the semi-nomadic Acjachemen Indian group, conquered by Spanish conquistadors in the 17th and 18th centuries and renamed the Juaneño by them.|$|E

5|$|The early Middle Ages were {{a period}} of climatic deterioration, with a drop in {{temperature}} {{and an increase in}} rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. Climate change had a major impact on agriculture in this period and terms <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> describe different quantities of land. In the period c. 1150 to 1300, warm dry summers and less severe winters allowed cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and made land more productive. Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying areas such as the Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. The main unit of land measurement in Scotland was the ploughgate, also known as the davoch and in Lennox as the arachor. It may have measured about , divided into 4 raths. The average amount of land used by a husbandman in Scotland might have been around 26 acres.|$|E
5|$|With the Emperor's {{withdrawal}} from the scene, local governors and magnates <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> claim power. Nine major contenders emerged, some claiming the imperial title for themselves, others, like Li Mi in Henan, contending themselves, for the time being, with more modest titles. Among the most well-positioned contenders was Li Yuan, Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan in the northwest (modern Shanxi). A scion of a noble family related to the Sui dynasty, and with a distinguished career behind him, Li Yuan was an obvious candidate for the throne. His province possessed excellent natural defences, a heavily militarized population and was located near the capitals of Daxingcheng (Chang'an) and Luoyang.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Scotland's {{economic}} situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. This only {{began to change}} in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of North Sea oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. The discovery of the giant Forties oilfield in October 1970 signalled that Scotland was about to become a major oil producing nation, a view confirmed when Shell Expro discovered the giant Brent oilfield in the northern North Sea east of Shetland in 1971. Oil production started from the Argyll field (now Ardmore) in June 1975, followed by Forties in November of that year. Deindustrialisation took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or were completely closed down. A new service-oriented economy <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> replace traditional heavy industries. This included a resurgent financial services industry and the electronics manufacturing of Silicon Glen.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{the various}} {{proposed}} extensions of the IND Second System, the IND Culver subway was planned to facilitate a spur line to Bay Ridge, with {{a connection to the}} incomplete Staten Island Tunnel intended for the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. A 1931 proposal had the line travel south from Smith–Ninth Streets station through Red Hook and Gowanus to Saint George Terminal. A 1933 plan would have branched off between Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue, then ran down Second Avenue in Bay Ridge to the tunnel. Like other IND lines, this route would have been in direct competition with the then-privately operated Fourth Avenue Subway. The final proposal from the 1939 Second System plan proposed an extension down Fort Hamilton Parkway and/or Tenth Avenue towards the tunnel, with continued service to 86th Street in Bay Ridge near the BMT Fourth Avenue Line station. This route would have diverged near the Fort Hamilton Parkway and Church Avenue stations. In 1940, proposals <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> connect the IND with the BMT West End Line near its Fort Hamilton Parkway station; the 1946 Board of Transportation plans featured both the West End connection and the extension to 86th Street. None of these proposals were ever constructed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the centre}} of power, the kings {{employed}} a succession of clergy as chancellors, responsible for running the royal chancery, while the familia regis, the military household, <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> act as a bodyguard and military staff. England's bishops continued to form {{an important part in}} local administration, alongside the nobility. Henry I and Henry II both implemented significant legal reforms, extending and widening the scope of centralised, royal law; by the 1180s, the basis for the future English common law had largely been established, with a standing law court in Westminster—an early Common Bench—and travelling judges conducting eyres around the country. King John extended the royal role in delivering justice, and the extent of appropriate royal intervention was one of the issues addressed in the Magna Carta of 1215. The emerging legal system reinvigorated the institution of serfdom in the 13th century by drawing an increasingly sharp distinction between freemen and villeins.|$|E
5|$|Between 850 and 1100, the Empire {{developed}} a mixed {{relationship with the}} new state of the Kievan Rus', which had <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> the north across the Black Sea. This relationship would have long-lasting repercussions {{in the history of}} the East Slavs, and the Empire quickly became the main trading and cultural partner for Kiev. The Rus' launched their first attack against Constantinople in 860, pillaging the suburbs of the city. In 941, they appeared on the Asian shore of the Bosphorus, but this time they were crushed, an indication of the improvements in the Byzantine military position after 907, when only diplomacy had been able to push back the invaders. Basil II could not ignore the emerging power of the Rus', and, following the example of his predecessors, he used religion as a means for the achievement of political purposes. Rus'–Byzantine relations became closer following the marriage of Anna Porphyrogeneta to Vladimir the Great in 988, and the subsequent Christianisation of the Rus'. Byzantine priests, architects, and artists were invited to work on numerous cathedrals and churches around Rus', expanding Byzantine cultural influence even further, while numerous Rus' served in the Byzantine army as mercenaries, most notably as the famous Varangian Guard.|$|E

5|$|In 1294 Madog ap Llywelyn {{rebelled against}} English rule, {{the first major}} insurrection since the 1282 campaign. The Welsh appear to have risen up over the {{introduction}} of taxation and Madog had considerable popular support. In Glamorgan, Morgan ap Maredudd led the local uprising; Morgan had been dispossessed by de Clare in 1270 and saw this {{as a chance to}} regain his lands. Morgan attacked Caerphilly, burning half of the town, but failed to take the castle. In the spring of 1295 Edward pressed home a counter-attack in North Wales, putting down the uprising and arresting Madog. De Clare attacked Morgan's forces and retook the region between April and May, resulting in Morgan's surrender. De Clare died at the end of 1295, leaving Caerphilly Castle in a good condition, linked to the small town of Caerphilly which had <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> the south of it and a large deer park in the nearby Aber Valley.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, a {{thorough}} reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports {{reveals that the}} whole history of wild Murray cod between the mid–1800s and the mid–1900s was one of citizen agitation, government inaction, and ongoing stock decline. For decade after decade, riverside residents, commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, local fisheries inspectors, fish retailers, and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about the evidently, continuously declining Murray cod stocks, to be met in turn either with government denials, or conversely, with various ineffective inquiries into Murray cod stocks and fisheries, and various ineffective control measures. For decade after decade, debate about excessive fishing pressure, number of fishermen, number of nets, net mesh size, bag limits, minimum size limits and take of small cod, closed seasons and the taking of spawning cod full of eggs during spring, and other sundry issues, raged on and on without proper resolution, with fishing regulations either not amended, or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored, and with heavy commercial, recreational and illegal fishing pressure continuing unrelenting and unabated. The end result was a Murray cod population, initially unimaginably abundant, continually fished down and down and down without pause, until in the early to mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation (listed below) <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> drive the species even further into decline. All of these drivers of decline have left this iconic Australian fish in a perilous situation. There are now grave concerns for the long-term survival of wild Murray cod populations.|$|E
5|$|Several years prior, one of {{the most}} {{powerful}} men in the small island nation of Horai, Tenro Horai, discovered an incredible magical power deep within the ground that gave him god-like strength, the Ubusunagami Okinokai. Tenro and his followers used this power to conquer other nations. A rebel federation called Tenkaku <b>emerged</b> <b>to</b> challenge the Horai. They fought to free the world of Horai's conquests, but lost battle after battle. Eventually they were almost completely wiped out, except one young man survived named Shinra. Shinra set off to battle Horai again, but he was shot down and crashed in a remote village called Ikaruga. The village was inhabited by people exiled due to the Horai expansion.The village inhabitants saved Shinra from the plane wreckage and nursed him back to health. After healing, Shinra stated that he was still determined to continue the battle against Horai. The villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane they had built themselves called the Ikaruga. The ship was specially designed and hidden away in a secret underground location beneath the village. It was the first ship built to utilize and switch between two energy polarities, black and white.|$|E
