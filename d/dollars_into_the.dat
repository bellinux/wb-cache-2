5|$|The {{difference}} was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and the taxes and revenue it brought to Alaska. Alyeska {{and the oil}} companies injected billions of <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Alaska economy during the construction effort and the years afterward. In addition, the taxes paid by those companies altered the tax structure of the state. By 1982, {{five years after the}} pipeline started transporting oil, 86.5 percent of Alaska revenue came directly from the petroleum industry.|$|E

5|$|By 1924, the {{newspaper}} {{had a good}} circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured over a million <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> newspaper in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in {{the newspaper}}, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E
5|$|The program used import {{subsidies}} to pump US <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> South Vietnamese treasury. The regimes sold these dollars to business people who held licenses to import American goods. The businessmen bought the US {{dollars from the}} Saigon treasury with their South Vietnamese piasters at half the official exchange rate; they then used this cheaply acquired American currency to import US goods. This meant that American manufacturers would still get {{the same amount of}} US currency they would have received for selling their goods on the free market, while South Vietnamese importers could get twice as much goods for the same money. The piasters that the Saigon government collected from selling the US aid dollars were to be placed in a fund held by the National Bank of Vietnam, which was to be used to fund the expansion and training of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, national police and civil service.|$|E

25|$|UC Irvine is {{the last}} UC campus that {{subcontracts}} its food services.

This includes UCI's three dining halls (Brandywine, Pippin Commons, and Mesa Commons) and three on-campus restaurants (Phoenix Grille, B.C.'s Cavern on the Green, and Bistro by the Bridge). ASUCI, which is partially responsible for negotiating UCI's food services contract, has justified the decision to offer Aramark its business with the argument that Aramark has pledged to invest millions of <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> university's food service infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|The island's {{traditional}} {{economy was}} based around sugarcane plantations. By {{the middle of}} the twentieth century it remained one of the poorest in the Caribbean. In 1947 newly elected Puerto Rican governor Luis Muñoz Marín of the Popular Democratic Party along with the United States government began Operation Bootstrap, which invested millions of <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Puerto Rican to industrialize the island's economy. Based on 1930s New Deal economic relief reforms and infrastructure provided by the programs such as the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, Operation Bootstrap intended to move Puerto Rico away from its agrarian system and into an industrial economy. The government's Administration of Economic Development —today known as the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO)— encouraged the establishment of factories.|$|E
50|$|In retrospect, the nicely {{performing}} MV {{series was}} too little, too late. At {{a time when}} DG invested its last <b>dollar</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dying minicomputer segment, the microcomputer was rapidly making inroads to the lower-end market segment, {{and the introduction of}} the first workstations wiped out all 16-bit machines, once DG's best customer segment. While the MV series did stop the erosion of DG's customer base, this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow DG to develop their next generation. DG had also changed their marketing to focus on direct sales to Fortune 100 companies and thus alienated many resellers.|$|R

25|$|Since January 2002, the {{exchange}} rate fluctuated, up to a peak of four pesos to one dollar (that is, a 75% devaluation). The resulting export boom produced a massive inflow of <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Argentine economy, which helped lower their price. For a time the administration stated and maintained a strategy of keeping {{the exchange}} rate at between 2.90 and 3.10 pesos per US dollar, {{in order to maintain}} the competitiveness of exports and encourage import substitution by local industries. When necessary, the Central Bank issues pesos and buys dollars in the free market (sometimes large amounts, in the order of 10 to US$100 million per day) to keep the dollar price from dropping, and had amassed over US$27 billion in reserves before the US$9.81 billion payment to the International Monetary Fund in January 2006.|$|E
25|$|Using {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} her first three restaurants, Murphy invested one million <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> construction of her largest Candlelight restaurant in affluent Westchester County. Built on ten acres of land in Yonkers, with award-winning gardens a large parking lot and an artificial lake, the Westchester Candlelight was said to be the largest restaurant in the East. It seated almost a thousand customers while nearly as many were often waiting for tables. Serving was continuous, and 10,000 customers sometimes ate at the restaurant on a single day, according to Murphy. Engineered to maximize sales, the Westchester Candlelight invited diners enduring long waits to stroll its extensive gardens, browse at a gift shop featuring Patricia Murphy-branded fragrances, and buy drinks at the bar or flowers in the greenhouses. Charter buses from upstate New York and Pennsylvania arrived regularly with tour groups.|$|E
