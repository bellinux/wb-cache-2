The {{fatigue life}} {{study of the}} <b>hatch</b> <b>corner</b> plays very {{important}} roles in design of <b>hatch</b> <b>corner.</b> The target function is {{the gravity of the}} <b>hatch</b> <b>corner,</b> and the constraint function is fatigue accumulation damage in the present paper. The structure optimal design theory has been combined with the fatigue life assessment method, to assess a <b>hatch</b> <b>corner</b> fatigue life of a large bulk carrier, and to optimize the <b>hatch</b> <b>corner</b> based on meeting the fatigue life. The <b>hatch</b> <b>corner</b> has been optimized under meeting yield strength and buckling strength. The numerical results show that the optimum method is fit to optimize the <b>hatch</b> <b>corner...</b>|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} damage cause for bulk carrier ships is represented by high stress concentrations occurring in deck plating close to hatch corners in way of coaming stay. In this area many fractures are found during surveys which are generated mainly by three types of problems: • stress concentration in correspondence of deck large openings; • bad design of stays; • different thickness between transversal and external deck plates. The typical approach followed by IACS classification societies consists {{in a wide range}} of qualitative suggestion (transversal stiffening for transversal deck strip, elliptical <b>hatch</b> <b>corner</b> etc.) and a very simple formula providing the extra thickness of the <b>hatch</b> <b>corner</b> compulsory insert. This solution seems to be inadequate to face this phenomenon and a better knowledge is mandatory to understand which parameters are more influent on stress distribution and concentration. The purpose of the analysis herein presented is to identify most important parameters and to study their influence, in order to develop a more sophisticate procedure to be used in preliminary design stage. The investigation has been developed starting from the analysis of five different bulk carriers, selected on the basis of their geometric and structural properties, and modeled with FEM software Leonardo hull 3 D v. 2. 4. 1. The analysis has been divided into two sub-problems: • study of b/B ratio influence (hatch breadth versus ship breadth); • study of lw/b ratio influence (cross deck length versus hatch breadt) [...] Two different series of FEM models have been realized: Global models of the hull extended to a portion of three cargo holds; Simplified models with increasing refinement degree. All global models have a relatively coarse mesh and are loaded with a wide number of loading condition (homogeneous, heavy and light ballast, alternate ore) corresponding to relevant RINA load cases in order to maximize the effects. For what simplified models are concerned four different types of models have been analysed: a) The first model consists in a simple plate with a rectangular opening and two longitudinal box structures simulating the wing tanks. All the parts of the model have a constant thickness. b) A second series of models has then been created, similar to the first one, adding a coaming around the hatch opening. As in the first case the thickness has been maintained constant. c) The third series is similar to the first one but the thicknesses of the lateral deck strip and of the cross deck have different values, according to the real case. d) The fourth series is similar to the second one. Again deck plates have different thicknesses. For all the models the results have been processed to calculate stress concentration factors “k” (defined as longitudinal stress close to <b>hatch</b> <b>corner</b> versus theoretical hull girder stress) for all selected loading conditions. From the “k” coefficients obtained for every model, a “stress concentration surface”, as a function of b/B and w/b, has been drawn and expressed by a simplified formula...|$|E
40|$|A common {{approach}} {{to investigate the}} response of a structural detail such as a <b>hatch</b> <b>corner</b> is to compute the seakeeping loads using a linear 3 D Boundary Element Method (BEM) and transfer the seakeeping loads to a Finite Element (FE) model of the ship structure. This approach is suitable for computations of the fatigue loading of structural details near amidships because {{a majority of the}} fatigue loading will occur in mild sea-states where the loading may be assumed linear. However, the linear seakeeping model may not hold when one investigates the ultimate response of the local bow structure of a ship which is designed to remain operational in severe conditions, for example, a frigate. A linear seakeeping analysis will significantly underpredict the loading at the bow because both the impulsive slamming loads and the nonlinearities in the non-impulsive wave loads will contribute significant to the structural loading. The non-linear loads require one to first derive a short-term distribution of the local structural response before the ultimate value of the response can be derived. A method to compute the shortterm distribution of a structural detail is presented in this paper. The first step is to perform seakeeping analyses which includes slamming, non-linear Froude-Kryloff and hydrostatic loads. The short-term distribution of the total hydrodynamic loading at the structural detail is obtained by simulating the seakeeping response for several hours. The response of the local structure is computed for the most severe impacts found in the seakeeping simulation. The hydrodynamic loading, including the non-linear contributions...|$|E
40|$|Owing to {{the hull}} {{structure}} complexity and severe load conditions, bulk carrier ships {{are the subject}} of an intense research activity by Classification Societies and research centres. Many problems affecting this kind of vessel derive from loading and unloading operations, corrosion and fatigue phenomena and, sometimes, the age of the ship. For what the structural strength is concerned, one of the typical failure causes for bulk carriers is represented by high stress concentrations occurring in deck plating close to <b>hatch</b> <b>corners</b> in way of coaming stay. The aim of this work, performed in cooperation between the Registro Italiano Navale (RINA) and the Department of Naval Architecture and Ship Construction of the University of Genova, is to investigate the stress distribution close to <b>hatch</b> <b>corners</b> in a systematic way, in order to determine and quantify the influence of the selected parameters on this phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Liberty Ship Building Program in World War II set a record—a {{total of}} 2700 Liberty Ships {{were built in}} 6 years, {{in order to support}} the battle against Nazi-Germany. However, {{numerous}} vessels suffered sudden fracture, some of them being split in half. This paper demonstrates and investigation of the Liberty Ships failure and problems, which reveals that the failures are caused by a combination of three factors. The welds produced by largely unskilled work force contain crack type flaws. Beyond these cracks, another important reason for failure associated with welding is the hydrogen embitterment; most of the fractures initiate at deck square <b>hatch</b> <b>corners</b> where there is a stress concentration; and the ship steel has fairly poor Charpy-Impact tested fracture toughness. It has been admitted that, although the numerous catastrophic failures were a painful experience, the failures of the Liberty Ships caused significant progress in the study of fracture mechanics. Considering their effect, the Liberty Ships are still a success...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFatigue {{cracking}} {{is surely}} {{the more common}} failure mode of marine structures. The return experience shows that {{in the majority of}} the cases, cracks start at welded joints and so the verification methods developed since the 70 s deal with welded joints. More recent cases on FPSOs have shown that cracks can also start from non welded areas and the development of the ULCS (Ultra Large Container Ships) points out the necessity of methods for the <b>hatch</b> <b>corners</b> which are non welded areas. To provide a solution for the design of these ships Bureau Veritas developed a local stress S-N curve formulation including as-welded, non welded and improved welded details. The formulation is based on the accumulated knowledge in fatigue verification approaches since the 70 s, the marine return experience and the analysis of available published data. The paper presents the development of the formulation starting by the definition of a S-N curve for as-welded joints covering the low and high cycle domains, then the extension of to the stress release welded joints with different R levels and finally the generalisation to non welded and improved welded details. The non-welded detail S-N curves include the effects of the yield strength on the low cycles domain and of the mean stress level on the slope of the high cycles domain. The defined S-N curves are calibrated versus existing methods for welded joints and mechanical component fatigue verification and also versus test data. Finally, an illustration of a practical application on two ship deck details is given showing acceptable results...|$|R
40|$|Container ships {{operating}} in the North Atlantic have a challenging structural design with respect to fatigue. The container vessels are long and slender and they have large openings in the deck. The structural design, in a combination of high wave loads, makes the ship sensitive to fatigue cracks. The estimated fatigue life according to class rule procedures is too short to be realistic in several fatigue-critical locations of container vessels. The class rules mainly base their assumptions on stress-based approach, where high stress-concentration factors are commonly accepted. This {{could be one of}} the reasons why plastic deformation occurs locally in ship structures and fatigue cracks appear at an early stage. The objective with this study is to simulate numerically and assess the structural response of a container ship by assuming either linear material, or nonlinear, material response. In order to enable such a study, a hydrodynamic analysis is adopted to simulate the wave-induced structural loads, followed by a linear and nonlinear FE-analysis in order to obtain the structural strength. A long-term fatigue analysis is performed to obtain the critical locations in the ship. A script is created that makes it possible to change between a linear and nonlinear FE-solver. The results from the long-term fatigue analysis indicate that the critical locations exist in the <b>hatch</b> <b>corners,</b> forward engine room bulkhead and in the bilge region. However, the side shell on the port side was chosen for further study. The results from the nonlinear structural FEanalysis indicate that almost no plastic deformation will occur in the critical region of the side shell. Hence, the conclusion was made that a strain-based approach to fatigue is not necessary for this location. A linear structural FE-analysis with the effect from internal ballast water was studied. The results from the linear structural FE-analysis with the effect from internal ballast pressure showed only a small impact on the stress-levels. For future work it is recommended to study a local sub-model that is located in a region where higher stress concentrations are expected such as, for example, in the bilge region on the starboard side of the ship. The presence from welds and redistributio...|$|R

40|$|Torsion {{is highly}} {{important}} for large container carriers. In order {{to maximize the}} container capacity, a large deck area is essential, which often leads to a big bow are. To simplify loading and ooading, each cargo hold is equipped with huge hatch openings. These large deck openings, with slender longitudinal and transverse deck strips, will deform due to torsion in oblique seas, referred to as hatch opening distortions. This is regarded a vital strength aspect for container carriers. A master project is performed, in order to investigate how torsion contributes to extreme loading. Full scale measurements of a 8600 TEU container vessel, conducted by DNV GL, theoretical methods, and a global and a local Finite Element (FE) model {{have been used for}} this purpose. This was done, to get a greater knowledge of torsional behaviour of container carriers, which again can be used to document whether torsion should be included in ship design rules. The ship has been operating on two dierent trades. On Route 1, the vessel follows a relatively sheltered passage from Hamburg to Singapore, whereas the vessel crosses the North Pacic Ocean from Singapore to USA on Route 2. Results from a hydrodynamic analysis, and environmental data for each route, was used to calculate the long term distribution of longitudinal stresses in deck. Long term distribution of deck stresses veries that Route 2, which is known for more rough seas, gives the worst prediction of stresses. However, the measured stresses prove dierent. In order to nd out why measured stresses are higher for Route 1, although Route 2 has more rough seas, the vessel's operating speed was investigated. It was found that the vessel operates at higher speeds on Route 1, than on Route 2. With speed reduction, the ship resistance, and the risk for occurrence of high stresses due to wave induced vibrations, such as whipping, springing and torsional vibrations, is lowered. Additionally, no signicant routing has been observed on the rst route. On the second route, on the other hand, routing was found, i. e. the roughest seas have been avoided. This will again inuence and lower measured stresses. Speed reduction and routing are therefore important reasons why measured stresses are lower on Route 2, than Route 1, {{despite the fact that the}} wave environment is more rough on Route 2. Measurement data have been investigated to evaluate the degree of torsional vibrations present. During the day where most torsion is measured, the ratio of dynamic and wave stresses ~ 1. 10, which indicates that the ship does not experience signicant torsional vibrations. Thus, torsional vibrations are found to be of minor concern for the 8600 TEU vessel. Global FE-analyses of the container vessel have been performed, with respect to the yielding criteria for Ultimate Limit State, ULS, due to torsion. Additionally, since many modications were done in order to analyse the model, self-checks of the model with vertical and horizontal bending moments were carried out. A coarse mesh was used to obtain nominal stresses. Rule stresses with respect to ULS were found by applying torsional moments, calculated from ship rules. The results show that maximum measured stresses in the deck strip are approximately 0. 69 - 0. 74 of ULS rule stresses for Route 1 and 0. 63 - 0. 68 on Route 2, i. e. measured stresses are within the acceptance criteria for ULS, on both routes. Since local stresses may be included in the measurements, the same analysis of the transverse deck strip was performed with ne mesh. Local stresses, and thus measured stresses, were found to be about 10 - 15 % higher than nominal stresses. The local stresses in the measurements are most likely due to the fact that the sensors are located close to <b>hatch</b> <b>corners</b> and close to a weld between two deck plates, which are source to stress concentrations, i. e. hot spot stresses. The magnitude of the hatch opening distortion has been calculated from the global FE-model. It was found that hatch opening distortion, due to the maximum measured stress of 131 MPa (measured on Route 1), has a magnitude of 226 mm. In comparison, the expected hatch opening distortion due to estimated ULS stresses is 335 mm at the deck strip where the sensors are located. The largest ULS hatch opening distortion obtained is located further forward, at cargo hold 3, where the deformations reaches 411 mm. The calculations were also done simplied, with use of hand calculations, 3 D-Beam, and a deck strip model. This, to nd out if simplied and less time consuming methods can be used in later studies of hatch opening distortions, or if a global model must be used for this purpose. Values for hatch opening distortion for the simplied calculation methods are between 7 - 21 % lower than calculated from the global model. If further studies of other container ships gives the same relation between the simplied methods and the global model, simplied methods might be used, introducing a scaling factor...|$|R
