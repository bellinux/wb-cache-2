5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength to get the ball. Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul the Knicks, get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E

25|$|Nininger's {{strategy}} was to search for meteorites in the Great Plains of the United States, where the land was largely cultivated and the soil contained few rocks. Between the late 1920s and the 1950s, he traveled across the region, educating local people about what meteorites looked like and what to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> thought they had found one, for example, {{in the course of}} clearing a field. The result was the discovery of over 200 new meteorites, mostly stony types.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} U.S. {{medical school}} curriculum is four years long. Traditionally, {{the first two}} years are composed mainly of classroom basic science education, while the final two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. Today, clinical education is spread across all four years with the final year containing the most clinical rotation time. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published mandatory rules, obliging on all inpatient and outpatient teaching settings, laying down the guidelines for what medical students in the United States may <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have not completed a clerkship or sub-internship. These rules apply to when they are in the clinical setting in school, not when they are, for example, helping staff events or in other non-formal educational settings, even if they are helping provide certain clinical services along with nurses and the supervising physicians- for example, certain basic screening procedures. In the formal clinical setting in school, they can only assist with certain patient evaluation and management tasks, after the vital signs, chief complaint and the history of present illness have been discerned, but prior to the physical examination: reviewing the patient's signs and symptoms in each body system, and then reviewing the patient's personal medical, genetic, family, educational/occupational, and psychosocial history. The student's supervising physician (or another physician with supervisory privileges if the original doctor is no longer available, for some reason) must be in the room during the student's work, and must conduct this same assessment of the patient before performing the actual physical examination, and after finishing and conferring with the student, will review his or her notes and opinion, editing or correcting them if necessary, and will also have his or her own professional notes; both must then sign and date and I.D. the student's notes and the medical record. They may observe, but not perform, physical examinations, surgeries, endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, radiological or nuclear medicine procedures, oncology sessions, and obstetrics. The patient must give consent for their presence and participation in his or her care, even at a teaching facility. Depending on the time they have completed in school, their familiarity with the area of medicine and the procedure, and the presence of their supervisor, and any others needed, in the room or nearby, they may be allowed to conduct certain very minor tests associated with the physical examination, such as simple venipuncture blood draws, and electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms, for learning and experience purposes, especially when there is no intern or resident available.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Rich Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by David LaChapelle and features a pirate theme. The video, inspired by an early-1980s Vivienne Westwood advertising campaign, opens with four Japanese schoolgirls playing with a toy pirate ship and two Bratz dolls of Stefani and Eve, while the girls discuss what they would <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were a [...] "rich girl". The video features several sequences. Stefani is first shown below {{the deck of a}} pirate ship, dancing on a table and singing to the song. She is surrounded by pirates and [...] and is soon joined by Eve, wearing an eyepatch. In the surreal style of LaChapelle, the pirate crew has distorted features, and a leaked casting call commented, [...] "I need the freaks on this one." [...] Above deck Stefani, the Harajuku Girls, Eve, and more pirates dance on the deck and rigging. Stefani is also seen dancing with the Harajuku Girls in a treasure trove, often carrying a sword, and swinging from an anchor. When the girls dunk the toy ship in a fish tank, the galleon engages in cannon fire, causing Stefani and the pirates to fall all over the ship, and Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are soon shipwrecked.|$|E

2500|$|The team – {{known as}} the [...] "Busby Babes" [...] for their youth – reached the semi-finals, beaten there by the {{eventual}} winners, Real Madrid. Winning the First Division title again that season meant qualification for the 1957–58 tournament, and their cup run in 1956–57 meant they {{were one of the}} favourites to win.

2500|$|The film's shaky camera {{style of}} cinematography, dubbed [...] "La Shakily Queasy-Cam" [...] by Roger Ebert, caused some viewers (particularly in darkened movie theaters) to {{experience}} motion sickness, including nausea and a temporary loss of balance. Audience members prone to migraines have cited {{the film as}} a trigger. Some theaters showing the film, such as AMC Theatres, provided posted and verbal warnings, informing viewers about the filming style of Cloverfield, while other theatres like Pacific Theatres just verbally warned customers in detail {{at the box office}} about experiencing motion sickness upon viewing the film and what to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had to step out and vomit.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{criticism}} came in November 2007, when Bono's various charity campaigns {{were targeted}} by Jobs Selasie, head of African Aid Action. Selasie claimed that these charities had increased corruption and dependency in Africa because {{they failed to}} work with African entrepreneurs and grassroots organisations, and as a result, Africa has become more dependent on international handouts. Bono responded to his critics in Times Online on 19 February 2006, calling them [...] "cranks carping from the sidelines. A lot of them wouldn't know what to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were on the field.

2500|$|He {{returned}} to California via the Persian Gulf, Turkey, Sri Lanka and various Pacific Islands, in 1958, voyaging as a crewman {{in the engine}} room on the oil freighter Sappa Creek, and took up residence at Marin-an again. He turned one room into a zendo, with about six regular participants. In early June, he met the poet Joanne Kyger. She became his girlfriend, and eventually his wife. [...] In 1959, he shipped for Japan again, where he rented a cottage outside Kyoto. [...] He became the first foreign disciple of Oda Sesso Roshi, the new abbot of Daitoku-ji. [...] He married Kyger on February 28, 1960, immediately after her arrival, which Sasaki insisted they <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were to live together and {{be associated with the}} First Zen Institute of America. Snyder and Joanne Kyger were married from 1960 to 1965.|$|E
2500|$|Colin McGinn, {{an author}} and {{philosophy}} professor at the University of Miami, wrote in The New York Times that machines might eventually exhibit external behavior at a human-level, {{but it would be}} impossible to know if they have an [...] "inner subjective experience" [...] as people <b>do.</b> <b>If</b> <b>they</b> do not, then [...] "uploading" [...] someone into a computer is equivalent to letting their mind [...] "evaporate into thin air," [...] he argues. McGinn is skeptical of the Turing test, claiming it smacks of the long abandoned doctrine of behaviorism, and agreeing with the validity of Searle's [...] "quite devastating" [...] Chinese room argument. He believes minds do compute, but that it does not follow that computation alone can create a mind, instead he says minds have phenomenological properties, perhaps originating from organic tissue. Therefore, he insists that neither silicon chips nor any future technology Kurzweil mentions will ever be conscious.|$|E
2500|$|A siege {{may lead}} to a last stand by the {{defenders}} (see for example the Battle of the Alamo). Last stands at the end of sieges became less common after the Hague Conventions came in force. Before the 20th century, if a besieged garrison refused any offered terms of surrender and the attackers subsequently breached the defences, the defenders were only given quarter at the discretion of the attackers, something they were not likely to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> perceived that by holding out, with no hope of relief, the defenders had needlessly squandered lives. Under the laws of war as they are now [...] "...it is especially forbidden - ... To kill or wound an enemy who, having laid down his arms, or having no longer means of defence, has surrendered at discretion; [...] To declare that no quarter will be given ...", it is unlawful for an attacking force to kill a garrison if they attempt to surrender even if it is during the final assault on a fortified position.|$|E
