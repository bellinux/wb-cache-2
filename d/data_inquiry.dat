40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} computer literacy dimensions (computer general knowledge, documents and documentations, communication and surfing as well as <b>data</b> <b>inquiry),</b> computer use and academic qualification as independent variables predicted primary school teachers’ attitude towards the integration of Personal Response System in English as a second language (ESL) classroom. Seventeen (17) Nigerian primary school teachers trained on why and how to effectively use Personal Response System (PRS) in ESL classrooms was the sample for the study. Data for the study were gathered through the use of Clickers Attitude Questionnaire (CAQ), Teachers’ Computer Literacy Questionnaire (TCLQ) and Computer Use Questionnaire (CUQ). Descriptive statistics such as simple percentage, mean and standard deviation, and inferential statistics such as Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, and Multiple regression were used for data analysis at 0. 05 significance level. The results show that the teachers’ computer literacy was more in the areas of documents and documentation as well as communication and surfing than in general knowledge and <b>data</b> <b>inquiry.</b> Further findings of the study indicated that general computer knowledge, documents and documentation, communication and surfing, and <b>data</b> <b>inquiry</b> combined to contribute to the prediction of teachers’ attitude towards the integration of PRS. Relatively, documents and documentation dimension was the potent predictor, while <b>data</b> <b>inquiry</b> was not a significant predictor of the outcome variable. Similarly, computer use, computer literacy and academic qualification jointly contributed to the prediction of the teachers’ attitude towards the integration of PRS in ESL classroom. Meanwhile, computer use made the most significant contribution to the prediction of teachers’ attitude towards PRS integration, while academic qualification did not make any significant contribution to the teachers’ attitude towards the integration of PRS in ESL classroom...|$|E
