When asked whether she prefers singing or acting, Milian said that [...] "they're both my passion. But, honestly, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose,</b> it would probably be my music.

500|$|Fifth-year senior Turner {{entered the}} 2009 {{season as the}} uncontested starter at quarterback {{for the first time}} in his career. He was backed-up by sophomore Jamarr Robinson and true freshmen C. J. Brown and Danny O'Brien. Turner's {{seniority}} was called critical for the performance of the team's relatively youthful offensive line. Head coach Friedgen said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> between a veteran offensive line and an inexperienced quarterback, or an inexperienced line with a veteran quarterback, I think I'd go with the veteran quarterback." [...] Upon the conclusion of preseason camp, the coaching staff praised his progress, particularly his game-planning, for which he had been criticized in the past. Turner said, [...] "Mentally, I am way further ahead than where I was last year." [...] Physically, he dropped 16 pounds by adding muscle and losing body fat, and weighed 220 pounds before the start of the season. Offensive coordinator Franklin said, [...] "You look at him, he was kind of mushy last year. You look at him now and he's muscular and shaped. He looks more athletic." ...|$|E

Jennifer, now possessed by a demon and subsequently altered into a succubus, sets out on a bloody rampage in which she devours boys, and {{it is up to}} Needy to stop her. In sort of a reversal aspect of how puberty changes a girl's life, Jennifer must consume the blood of others once a month or she becomes weak and plain-looking. [...] "It's a meek shall inherit the Earth sort of thing. I think it's always really satisfying and cathartic to see a character that was previously bullied become super human", said Cody. Cody said the script is not a reflection of any part of her own life, but that she is more like character Needy. [...] "I would say I was more of a Needy than a Jennifer. I was never an Alpha female, and I've never gotten off with bullying other people", she said.

[...] His first major speech on defence on 7 February 1934 stressed the need to rebuild the Royal Air Force and to create a Ministry of Defence; his second, on 13 July urged a renewed role for the League of Nations. These three topics remained his themes until early 1936.
