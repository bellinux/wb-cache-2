40|$|In this small-scale, {{qualitative}} study, {{the experiences}} of nine teachers who support learners identified with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties (SEBD) in mainstream primary schools are considered. A narrative approach enabled teachers to share their complex portrayals of practices and feelings about their roles. Perspectives on models of disability and disability rights, performativity, professional identity for teachers, and SEBD, have informed analysis {{and understanding of the}} stories teachers told. The study explores how the relationship between teachers’ professional identity and well-being and the expectations imposed upon them in a neoliberal influenced education system brings about pressures and concerns. Attempts by the teachers to achieve a balance between what they feel they ought to do (to meet policy expectations) and what they feel they should do (to meet the entitlements of children) has led to excessive workloads and complex emotional responses. Reflections on the way these teachers constructed discourses about why some children exhibit disruptive and challenging behaviours provide an understanding of how their negotiation of this challenging context impacts on the relationships they form with the children. The findings suggest that teachers experience confusion due to the complexities and contradictions they are faced with when trying to support learners identified with SEBD in an education system which incorporates policies guided by different models of disability. The study concludes by suggesting that teachers’ critical reflection on the discourses they have constructed in relation to models of disability could bring about a new way of shaping their practice. It is argued that a rights-based approach to teaching children who exhibit challenging, disruptive and concerning behaviours would <b>emancipate</b> <b>children</b> from the restrictive views and beliefs teachers seem to have developed. Approaches which focus on children’s rights to inclusive learning opportunities, which reflect their entitlement to an education, would go some way to addressing the confusion, contradiction and pressures these teachers described...|$|R

50|$|Reports on the California {{state level}} have been {{published}} studying the fate of foster <b>children</b> <b>emancipating</b> into adulthood, where outcomes are problematical. CAI has been promoting {{a solution to the}} fate of <b>emancipating</b> foster <b>children,</b> called the “Transition Life Coach” (TLC) plan. CAI argues that it recognizes that the median age of self-sufficiency in the U.S, is not 21 years of age, but 26. The TLC plan creates a “trust instrument” funded at the median level of parental support for children (approximately $50,000 for self-sufficiency). The court, who has been the legal parent of the foster child would continue to have a presence in each youth's life. A trustee, called a “Transition Life Coach” (a name selected by foster kids), would provide personal mentoring and write checks under a plan developed with the youth, and monitored by the court. CAI argues that this method allows major input from the child, and is personal. The “coach” (trustee) will often be someone known to the youth, or someone trained to guide him or her, with each having no {{more than one or two}} to assist. CAI has written reports and conducted an economic study indicating that the long run consequences would involve public money savings. And CAI has succeeded in amending California law to allow these trusts to be formed by dependency court judges for any foster youth to achieve self-sufficiency without age or other limitation. Nevertheless, no county in California or any other state has to date implemented the proposal, nor has any effectuated a pilot project to date.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{number of}} {{children}} and adolescents admitted in Dar es Salaam juvenile centres due to misbehaviour and criminal offences has risen from 20 to 30 per month. Increasing aberrant behaviours in children have been linked to mental disorders. Assessment of presence mental health disorders as the main cause of these behaviours would be important to restore mental health of children and assist the system to impose a fair trial. Objective This study aimed to determine the presence of mental disorders and associated factors among children and adolescents within Dar es Salaam juvenile systems and explore factors that may affect their mental health while in juvenile home. Methods The mixed research method was used to estimate prevalence of mental disorders by a cross-sectional study and a qualitative method was applied to evaluate mental disorders according to DSM IV TR criteria. Results The overall prevalence of mental dysfunction by mental status evaluation was 3 %: 95 % (Cl; 25. 3 - 43. 2; n = 37 out of 108). The younger age group (13 - 15) years presented with a prevalence of 30 %: 95 % (Cl; 14. 7 - 44. 5) while the older adolescents (16 - 17 years) had a prevalence of 55 %: 95 % (Cl; 43. 3 - 67. 1). Attention deficit disorder was found in some children, some had history of drug and alcohol abuse, with few sexual disorders, depression and brief psychotic reaction and was found to be common among adolescent with unstable family situations such as death of parents, divorce of parents, and single parented children. Conclusion Findings are suggestive that there is a presence of underlying mental disorders in some of the adolescents in the juvenile detention. Thus mental health screening for children in juvenile homes should be made mandatory in order to identify causes of aberrant behaviour as well as provide treatment, prevent complications and maintain 	 VI mental health of these children. Mental health screening for such children would also assist in conducting a fair trial for these <b>emancipated</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{barriers}} of slavery hardened in the Second {{half of the}} 17th century, and imported Africans' prospects grew increasingly dim. By 1640, the Virginia courts had sentenced at least one black servant, John Punch, to slavery. In 1656 Elizabeth Key won a suit for freedom based on her father's status as a free Englishman, and his having baptized her as Christian in the Church of England. In 1662 the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a law with the doctrine of partus, stating that any child born in the colony would follow the status of its mother, bond or free. This was an overturn of a longheld principle of English Common Law, whereby a child's status followed that of the father.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Progressivism, Matthew Lipman, introduced an educational model for renewal and change {{by means of}} the child. With his Philosophy for Children programme he wished to offer an alternative for the intellectualistic oriented education which silenced children. The answer to the search for freedom and change, Lipman finds in the symbioses between ‘Philosophy’ and ‘Children’. Philosophy expressed in critical thinking and communication, was the basis to <b>emancipate</b> the <b>child</b> from the oppression of the adult and to cause change. According to Lipman the main purpose of philosophy is to free every individual from determination. This plea is being elaborated by dialogue. The main issue of our paper concerns the question whether Lipman’s alternative ‘Philosophy for Children’ can fulfil the promise of change and freedom. To answer this question we will investigate thoroughly where dialogue and change in Philosophy for Children stand for. Finally we will propose another perspective of dialogue. A dialogue stressed on listening. Listening to how the world appears to us and how we appear to ourselves. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{emphasis on}} participation in education offers {{the starting point}} for this paper. Participation appears to be a strategic notion in a particular problematisation of education: this is installed through certain ways of speaking and writing (discourse) and through certain procedures, instruments and techniques that are proposed and developed in different places and spaces (technology). Participation is thereby claimed to empower individuals and to <b>emancipate</b> the <b>child</b> or the student from dominant regimes of power, including liberating them from oppressive traditional educational practices. Foucault's concept of governmentality, which offers us a specific understanding of power, helps us to analyse the discourse and technology of participation in a different way: participation comes to be seen not as an increase in freedom and empowerment, but as an element in a particular mode of government or power. According to this analysis the plea for practices of participation appears as an interpellation or call, governing the way that people act and behave, and encouraging them to think of themselves in a very specific way. We characterise this in terms of immunisation. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Project (M. S. W., Social Work) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. This {{project is}} a {{collaboration}} of both authors. The authors jointly worked {{on the development of}} the research question, gathered and analyzed data for the literature review, and collected and coded the data. In addition, both authors jointly designed the questionnaire, the consent form for former foster youth to participate as research subjects, and the human subject application. Chapters one through five were prepared by both authors. Despite the fact that transitional living initiatives such as the Independent Living Program (ILP) have been enacted to improve the lives of foster youth who <b>emancipate</b> from the <b>child</b> welfare system in the United States, a significant number of youth experience detrimental outcomes after they leave care. These outcomes include, but are not limited to, homelessness, unemployment, incarceration, poor educational success, and a higher likelihood of becoming parents at a younger age. This study aimed to examine the barriers and problems that prevent emancipated foster youth from accessing the resources and benefits provided by the Independent Living Program (ILP) in Sacramento County. This project also aimed to understand the benefits provided by this program. Participants were asked how the ILP impacted their lives, and about the experiences they had while accessing such services. The implications of social work regarding foster youth are also discussed in this project. An exploratory questionnaire was utilized for this study. The questionnaire was distributed to emancipated foster youth who had accessed or were currently accessing services through the Independent Living Program (ILP). Participants were recruited from the Guardian Scholars program at California State University, Sacramento, and through snowball referral. Based on data collected, the researchers were able to conclude that there is a need for comprehensive services for foster youth who are <b>emancipating</b> from the <b>child</b> welfare system.

40|$|When foster youth <b>emancipate</b> {{from the}} <b>child</b> welfare system {{they no longer}} have {{professionals}} overseeing decisions about contact with their biological parents. While there is a general awareness in the field of child welfare that former foster youth often do choose to reconnect with their biological parents as adults, there has been scant research investigating former foster youths’ lived experiences of contact with them. Little is known about the potential functions of these relationships as sources of support, conflict, healing, or resilience. Without an understanding of how decisions about contact are made, and how such contact impacts their lives, {{it is not possible to}} assess how prepared, or unprepared, emancipated youth are when they leave the child welfare system to negotiate these relationships in whatever manner is most beneficial to them. This qualitative study utilized interpretative phenomenological analysis in order to describe the experiences of a small sample (N = 8) of emancipated youth. This research also investigated the potential for theories of emerging adulthood, attachment and ambiguous loss, and resilience to contribute to a theoretical framework that could aid in understanding their experiences and decision making processes with regards to their relationships with their biological parents. Data were collected primarily via two rounds of in-depth, semi-structured interviews, and topics explored included descriptions of contact, ways in which relationships with biological parents served as supports and challenges, how emancipated youth made sense of their decisions about contact, identity development, forgiveness, and closure. Overall, participants described their biological parents as still struggling with the issues that led to foster care placement, and their relationships with them were often both supportive and challenging in different respects. For some, having children of their own had changed their relationships with their biological parents in rather complex ways. Despite the presence of difficulties in many of their relationships, participants expressed a great deal of empathy for their biological parents. Many had gone through a process of forgiveness in order to move on from the past.

40|$|Project (M. S. W., Social Work) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2015. Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} that show foster youth experience negative short term and long term outcomes after they have <b>emancipated</b> from the <b>child</b> welfare system. When compare with youth in the same age range who were not in the child welfare system, foster youth experience homelessness, unemployment, contact with law enforcement and substance abuse issues and not be enrolled in higher education at much higher rates. As a result of these outcomes various services and programs were created specifically for transitioning foster youth in the hopes of easing their transitioning and increasing their rates of success later in life. Current research shows that there are factors related to the social worker that can affect the quality of service they provide to the youth on their caseloads. Factors such as caseload size, length of experience, and education can all {{have an impact on the}} knowledge of services and rates of referrals and utilization of services. This study focuses on the utilization of transitioning services for youth in the foster care system. Social workers working in the child welfare system in Sacramento County were surveyed about their utilization of services for youth preparing to leave the child welfare system. The survey included questions regarding the social worker???s educational background, work experience and ability to research services. The survey assessed for utilization of services in four areas: housing, employment, education and mental health. Questions in each area of focus centered around the frequency of utilization, the barriers to utilization and accessibility factors. This study found that there are three factors associated with utilization of services; the length of experience with the child welfare system, ability to research services and knowledge of available services. Sacramento County child welfare workers caseloads are higher than the recommended amount, however time constraints did not appear to be a significant barrier to utilization. Although transitioning foster youth were not directly surveyed, results from the social workers did not significantly show that the lack of foster youth participation as a barrier. Further research into the specific services available in Sacramento County could provide more data on what other factors may be associated with utilization and which factors may serve as obstacles. The results of this study showed that the social worker does play a key part in the utilization of services among transitioning foster youth. Social Wor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract First paper “Audiovisual Sexual Risks and the Internet: social {{representations}} within European Parliamentary debates” The European Commission’s {{policy on}} children protection toward audiovisual sexual contents {{available on the}} Internet {{is based on a}} multi-stakeholders approach to regulatory, self-regulatory and co-regulatory initiatives. Several public meetings are held at the European Institutions. Aim: Our research focuses on the ones taken at the European Parliament between 2001 and 2016 and concerning the implementation of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (2010 / 13 /EU), the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography (2011 / 92 /EU) and the Better Internet for Kids program (COM 2012 196 final). Methods: The corpus was composed of 45 European parliamentary debates. Methodologies for data analysis were content analysis (AtlasTi), and Alceste method (Iramuteq). Results: First, anchoring and objectification are identified through images and metaphors of the Internet and online audiovisual risks, especially sexual ones. Second, 4 clusters were identified: 1. European issue; 2. Sexual exploitation and child-pornography; 3. Risks; 4. Positive use of the Internet. Third, relevant themes, such as international dimension of crime, and rapidity of technological change. Abstract Second paper “International statistics on audiovisual sexual risks within European parliamentary debates: hegemonic and emancipated representations of the problem description ” European parliamentary debates on the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (2010 / 13 /EU), the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography (2011 / 92 /EU) and the Better Internet for Kids program (COM 2012 196 final) make often reference to statistics provided by European institutions and associated agencies. These organizations {{play a role in the}} construction of knowledge and interpretation of socio-political phenomena. Aims: The research wishes to observe how international statistics create a hegemonic representation of audiovisual sexual risks for <b>children,</b> <b>emancipated</b> through reference to national data (Moscovici, 1961 / 76). Methods: The corpus is composed of 45 debates, held at the European Parliament between 2001 and 2016. A content analysis is carried on through the AltasTi software (Bauer, Gaskell, 2007; Dany, 2016). Results: A hegemonic representation is transmitted within European institutions through data produced by Eurobarometer, EuKidsOnline, Europol, Interpol, United Nations, NGOs. Policy concerning the most violent crimes, such as child pornography and sexual exploitation, tend to be tackled through reference to a higher variety of data sources and statistics, aimed at filling a gap of scientific knowledge. Emancipated representations are raised through reference to national dataAbstract Third paper “Children protection and freedom of expression towards online audiovisual contents in a European perspective: polemical representation based on different cultural backgrounds” Internet policy towards online audiovisual risks for children, especially pornography, has been determined by the defense of freedom of expression, enshrined by the first amendment of the American Constitution (Castell, 2001). Nevertheless, European media systems have been influenced by a variety of historical and cultural backgrounds, paying attention towards ethical concerns related to risky audiovisual contents (Frau-Meigs, 2011). Aims: the piece of research aims to retrieve ethical considerations within the social representations of audiovisual sexual risks. The hypothesis is that polemical representations of audiovisual sexual risks are related to ethical concerns, by making reference to different ideological and cultural groups in Europe (van Dijk, 1998). Methods: By analyzing the European parliamentary debates on Internet policy concerning children protection, the research first retrieves references to ethical considerations within the speeches, then analyzes them through the Alceste method (Iramuteq), and finally carries on a content analysis (AtlasTi). Results: Debates on audiovisual media services directive focus on finding a balance between public service and market-oriented media system. Amongst audiovisual risks, child pornography evokes more ethical reflections. The principle of freedom of expression is either opposed to the possibility of media censorship or to the need of children protection. Polemical representations are due to different historical and cultural backgrounds, regulatory and policy frameworks...|$|R
