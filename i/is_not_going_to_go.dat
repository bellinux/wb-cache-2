500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E

5000|$|Anthropologist Robin Dunbar at Oxford University argues against Crabtree's {{position}} that brain size {{was driven by}} tool use. Instead, Dunbar argues that the social environment drives intelligence. [...] "In reality what has driven human and primate brain evolution is the complexity of our social world", says Dunbar. [...] "That complex world <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away.

5000|$|Bugs is {{tunneling}} {{the cross}} country {{to meet his}} cousin in San Francisco, only to run head first into a boulder which is a large nugget of gold. Bugs is considering {{how to keep the}} gold safe; Nasty Canasta sees this and sets up a simple stand claiming to be a banker who can safely store Bugs' gold. The rabbit falls for the ruse. When Bugs decides to ask for his gold back, Canasta claims the bank is closing and traps the rabbit in the folded up stand while he rides away with the gold. Furious, Bugs vows revenge: [...] "You realize this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> unchallenged." ...|$|E
50|$|Joe {{attends the}} Mayfield Health Centre. Joe tells the {{receptionist}} {{that he would}} like to see Sarah. The receptionist does not appear to be surprised by his request and says that Joe is free to pop his head around the door. He sees Sarah advising parents on dealing with the changing of nappies. Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and says that Joe seems a bit wild. She states that she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> bowling with Joe.|$|E

While Riley {{describes}} to Xander where and how his wedding took place, Sam and Willow confirm that they have each other's e-mail addresses for future contact. A helicopter arrives and carries the couple off into the night. The next day, Buffy finds Spike at his crypt. She tells Spike that she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the wrongness of dealing with the Suvolte eggs because, as he said, that's just who he is. Instead she has come to tell him that although she wants him, she can never love him so {{it would be wrong to}} keep using him the way she has been, so it is over. Spike thinks that this is her usual routine of playing hard to get, but Buffy is serious and walks out with a final goodbye.|$|E

50|$|Tony becomes hysterical, blaming Anne {{and saying}} he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to prison. Anne {{tells him to}} call the police, as she won't let them hurt him. She gets {{on the phone and}} asks them to let Tony call his {{grandmother}}. When he talks to his grandmother she asks if it's true that he took Anne, and said she'll be praying for him. Tony tells his grandmother that he's going to kill Anne, and then himself. He points the gun at Anne's chest as Anne {{picks up the phone and}} tells the police not to shoot, as they are coming out. She tells Tony they can't shoot, or they'd end up shooting her, too. As they exit the house, he has his arm wrapped around her; she turns around and tells him to put the gun down. As he does, Anne runs to Officer Timbrook. Tony begins screaming for Anne as the FBI and police rush towards him. He begs them not to shoot, as he is getting on the ground. While Officer Timbrook is hugging Anne, he shows her the teddy bear that she left behind, returning it to Anne. Tony is put in the back of a police car, still screaming her name. Anne and Officer Timbrook walk up to the window as Anne throws at the window the wedding ring Tony gave to her.|$|E
5000|$|In Barbary Coast Bunny, {{a rather}} {{different}} version of Nasty Canastaâ€”now with a dopier look complete with pudgy lips and crooked teeth (and voiced not by Mel Blanc, but by Daws Butler)--steals gold from Bugs Bunny. That prompts Bugs to say: [...] "You {{realize that this}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> unchallenged." [...] Six months later Nasty Canasta uses the ill-gotten gold to erect a rigged casino. Bugs is disguised as a rube and appears {{to believe that a}} slot machine is a [...] "tele-o-phone." [...] He asks his mom for more money. The machine rings up a jackpot and a barrel of money comes out, to Canasta's shock. Bugs says: [...] "Gee, thanks, Mom!" [...] and wheels away his winnings in his bag. Seeing this, Nasty challenges Bugs to a series of crooked card games such as blackjack in hopes of parting Bugs from his winnings. Bugs continuously (though seemingly naively) defeats him. Nasty Canasta also rigs a roulette wheel, but it somehow fails when Bugs decided to play number 23 and wins; in the last round Nasty almost wins when the ball lands on a different number than 23 - which Nasty had blocked; however Nasty thinking he wins hits the table so hard that the ball lands in 23. Bugs ultimately gets revenge by rendering Canasta flat broke. Nasty tries to rob Bugs - who spins the pistol, which shoots coins. Nasty tries to spin coins from the gun as well - and gets blasted. Just outside the swinging door exit, Bugs proclaims the moral of the episode to be, [...] "Never try to steal no 18 carrots carats from no rabbit." ...|$|E
5000|$|Michael ParÃ© later recalled:You gotta realize that, out of {{the whole}} cast, nobody was over thirty. Diane Lane was, I think, eighteen. It was an {{enormous}} Hollywood production.

30|$|The {{message is}} that cruelty within dairy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away through {{increased}} welfare standards â€“ {{it is part of}} the industry, built into its infrastructure. SAFE and Farmwatch are not seeking to improve welfare conditions for animals per se. Higher animal welfare standards and practices are, of course, always preferable to an animal experiencing increased levels of suffering due to non-compliance. However, improving animal welfare standards will never be enough. Instead, they take an animal rights position, whereby the animal is not regarded as human property but rather as a sentient being with the right to live life on his/her own terms. An animal rights position extends the notion of rights to animals who are considered to have inherent value and interests of their own (Francione, 1995).|$|E
40|$|Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} frequently due to {{mutations in}} FAS (TNFRSF 6) gene. Unlike most of the self limiting autoimmune cytopenias sporadically seen in childhood, multi lineage cytopenias due to ALPS are often refractory as their inherited genetic defect <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away. Historically more ALPS patients have died due to overwhelming sepsis following splenectomy to manage their chronic cytopenias than due to any other cause, including malignancies. Hence current recommendations underscore the importance of avoiding splenectomy in ALPS, by long-term use of corticosteroid sparing immunosuppressive agents like mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus. Paradigms learnt from managing ALPS patients {{in recent years is}} highlighted here and can be extrapolated to manage refractory cytopenias in patients with as yet undetermined genetic bases for their ailments. It is also desirable to develop international registries for children with rare and complex immune problems associated with chronic multilineage cytopenias in order to elucidate their natural history and long-term comorbidities due to their disease and its treatments...|$|E

So {{the issue of whether}} such a tax would be legal under the WTO has become slightly less urgent than it recently appeared. But Pascal Lamy the Director-General of the WTO still thought the possibility of some countries imposing emission-based trade restrictions was worth mentioning prominently in his speech to the Trade Ministers Conference in conjunction with the Bali Conference on climate change after Kyoto. And at that same conference, an official of the European Commission may have indicated that such restrictions are not off the table entirely.

40|$|This {{report is}} also {{available}} from Consumer Futures [URL] responses to consumer vulnerability is a priority for Consumer Futures. This report, based on research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, is about how people on low incomes pay more for essential goods and services {{and what can be}} done about it. It is widely believed that consumers will best be served by encouraging competition on the basis that this drives efficiency and delivers innovation. However, competition does not always work this way and it is consumers on low income that often lose out, but so do others who are vulnerable for reasons other than low income. The fact that â€˜the poor pay moreâ€™ is not news. This report updates the picture and shows that paying higher prices for utilities and credit can raise the cost of a minimum household budget by around 10 per cent â€“ a â€˜poverty premiumâ€™. The cost of many essentials such as energy and water are likely to rise and while we hope for a tide of economic growth which will lift all, poverty and vulnerability <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away and indeed many people who are not seen as â€˜poorâ€™ will struggle to meet household bills...|$|E
40|$|This {{special issue}} offers an {{invitation}} {{to think about the}} first decade of the 21 st century. Acknowledging that millennia boundaries are always arbitrary such that any development is likely to have started earlier and to still be ongoing, I decided to write about the advent of computer-mediated communication (CMC) as one of the linguistic areas that are topical and prominent in today's world. In recent overview articles on 'electronic discourse' (Locher 2014; Locher and Mondada 2014) and on challenges in research methodology for scholars working on computer-mediated discourse (Bolander and Locher 2014), a number of observations were made that I want to revisit in light of the aim of this special issue. Given the fact that communication through computer-mediated means is a fairly recent phenomenon and that the vast majority of research on this use of language have been published since the turn of the millennium, we can indeed state that this topic is relevant. In line with Crystal, "[t]he Internet is the largest area of language development we have seen in our lifetimes. Only two things are certain: it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away, and it is going to get larger" (2011, 149). In this chapter, I will briefly sketch the object of study, show some of the research questions and developments that have occurred and discuss some of the ways linguists have responded to language online...|$|E
