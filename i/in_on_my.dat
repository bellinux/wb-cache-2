500|$|Pfeiffer's early acting {{appearances}} included television roles on Fantasy Island, Delta House and BAD Cats among others. She {{was one of}} {{the several}} candidates to audition as a replacement for Kate Jackson on the television series Charlie's Angels in 1979, although the part went to Shelley Hack. She had small roles in a few theatrical films, including Falling in Love Again (1980) with Susannah York, The Hollywood Knights (1980) opposite Tony Danza, and Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen (1981), none of which met with much critical or box office success. Pfeiffer later said of her early screen work: [...] "I needed to learn how to act... in the meantime, I was playing bimbos and cashing <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> looks." [...] She appeared in a television commercial for Lux soap, and took acting lessons at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, before appearing in three further television movies – Callie and Son (1981) with Lindsay Wagner, The Children Nobody Wanted (1981), and a 1981 TV movie remake of Splendor in the Grass.|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{began his}} fourth season {{representing}} Penn State with 17 points, 8 assists, and 5 rebounds {{in an exhibition}} game against Philadelphia on November 3, 2012. He sat out {{for much of the}} second half, giving his duties to D. J. Newbill. After the game, Frazier said that the team [...] "just played Penn State basketball." [...] On November 9, 2012, the first regular season for Frazier as a senior, he logged his 19th career 20-point game against Saint Francis (PA). On November 18, Frazier left six minutes into a game against Akron due to a ruptured left Achilles tendon. It was announced that he had a recovery period of about 12 months and would be out for the season. The injury was described as a [...] "devastating blow" [...] to the program by ESPN.com writer Eamonn Brennan. Chambers addressed the situation, saying, [...] "I have no doubt he will meet this challenge and will again be one of the top players in the nation," [...] in accordance to his potential fifth year of NCAA eligibility. Frazier redshirted the season shortly after it was announced by the school that he would undergo surgery. He said, [...] "I will never forget that game, that injury, never forget that camera. I'm sitting there on the sideline with the (television) camera just zooming <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> foot. I'll never forget the look on my sister's face, my mom and dad's face." [...] During his rehabilitation, Frazier began using the elliptical machine, doing work in the swimming pool, and taking part in weight training. He was guided by Penn State's athletic trainer, Jon Salazer, throughout the process. Frazier's sister Krystal had torn her right Achilles tendon when playing college basketball nearly seven years prior, and had gone through a similar rehabilitation before resuming her playing career.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Garner's novel Strandloper was published. His {{collection}} of essays and public talks, The Voice That Thunders, contains much autobiographical material (including an account of his life with bipolar disorder), as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language, literature and education, the nature of myth and time. In The Voice That Thunders he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade-long drought which preceded Strandloper to 'forsake [...] "literature", and become instead a [...] "popular" [...] writer, cashing <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> established name by producing sequels to, and making series of, the earlier books'. Garner feared that [...] "making series ... would render sterile the existing work, the life that produced it, and bring about my artistic and spiritual death" [...] and felt unable to comply.|$|E
