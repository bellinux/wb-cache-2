The two conventional controllers included a PD controller and the following: (1) a DOB with a control input given by I_M^ref= 1 /K_t(τ ^ref_PD+τ̂^dis) and (2) a DOB and a <b>dither</b> <b>signal</b> with a control input given by I_M^ref= 1 /K_t(τ ^ref_PD+τ̂^dis + τ ^dither). The <b>dither</b> <b>signal,</b> τ ^dither=Asin (10 π t), is intended to suppress static friction. Note that the frequency of the <b>dither</b> <b>signal</b> was determined according to reference [14]. Figures  9 and  10 show the experimental results with step and sinusoidal (of 0.5 Hz) commands, respectively. Figures  9 a and  10 a show the results for the PD controller with the DOB. Figures  9 b, c and 10 b, c show the results for the PD controller with the DOB and <b>dither</b> <b>signal,</b> with <b>dither</b> <b>signal</b> amplitudes of 5.0 and 50.0. The amplitudes were determined so that one of them was lower than the static friction and the other was greater than the static friction. Since one with a greater value still had a value that was lower than the quantization value of the proposed method (70 Nm), the validity of the proposed method can be confirmed with respect to the two dither signals. Figures  9 d and  10 d show the results for the proposed controller. Figure 9 e shows the result for the PD controller with the FM when the DOB was not used. Figure  9 f shows the result for the PD controller with the proposed DOB given in (7) when the FM was not used. The red lines indicate the commands; the green lines show the responses.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to closed-loop identification of transfer function models require a sufficiently large data set and model forms that are general enough {{while at the}} same time requiring some form of an external excitation (a “dither signal”) be applied to the process. In the limit, as the <b>dither</b> <b>signal</b> dominates the control actions, identification is easier, but the operation of the process becomes closer to that of an uncontrolled (i. e. open-loop) process, which could be unacceptable. This paper proposes a closed-loop system identification procedure that aims to improve model parameter estimates by incorporating prior knowledge about the process in the form of constraints without the use of a <b>dither</b> <b>signal.</b> A Monte Carlo simulation study is presented to illustrate the small sample benefits of adding various forms of constraints. It is shown how constraints based on process knowledge which is relatively easy to know from prior experience result in best identified models among the class of constraints considered.

For the linear array with uniform spacing, there are some classic methods to calculate the excitation coefficients to make the radiation pattern satisfy the given requirements. For the linear array with non-uniform spacing, linear programming and particle swarm optimization are proposed to calculate the excitation coefficients to make the array get minimum SLL in this thesis.

40|$|Dither {{signals are}} {{commonly}} used for compensating nonlinearities in feedback systems in electronics and mechanics. The seminal works by Zames and Shneydor and more recently by Mossaheb present rigorous tools for systematic design of dithered systems. Their results rely however on a Lipschitz assumption on the nonlinearity and thus do not cover important applications with discontinuities. The aim of this thesis is to provide some ideas and tools on how to analyse and design dither in nonsmooth systems. In particular, it is shown that a dithered relay feedback system can be approximated by a smoothed system. Guidelines are given for tuning the amplitude and the period time of the <b>dither</b> <b>signal,</b> in order to stabilize the nonsmooth system. Stability results based on Popov-like and Zames-Falb criteria jointly with some Linear Matrix Inequalities are proposed. Moreover {{it is argued that}} in dithered relay feedback systems the shape of dither signals is relevant for stabilization. Some peculiar behaviours of relay feedback systems dithered with a particular class of dither signals are presented. When the <b>dither</b> <b>signal</b> is a square wave, the dithered system can exhibit an asymmetric periodic orbit, though the smoothed system is asymptotically stable. We even show an example in which, by using a trapezoidal <b>dither</b> <b>signal,</b> both systems have a stable oscillation, but the period time for the oscillation of the smoothed system is different from the one of the dithered system.
