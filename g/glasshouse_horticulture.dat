40|$|The Netherlands have {{a strong}} and {{competitive}} horticulture sector, with regional clusters of <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> companies, of which the ‘Greenports’ of Westland – Oostland (near The Hague), Aalsmeer (near Amsterdam) and Venlo (near the German Ruhr Area) {{are the most important}} ones. The sector makes a strong contribution to the export position of the Netherlands. Since the 1990 s, stimulated by changing societal expectations growers and surrounding actors engaged in improving the sustainability of the <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> sector, especially focussing on reducing energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions, water usage and land use. The <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> sector in the Netherland is often perpetrated as a successful example of a sustainability transition and is therefore interesting to derive lessons for sustainable regional economic development. This paper studies how the <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> sector in the Netherlands did developed, became more sustainable and what modes of governance contributed to this process? To answer this question, an evolutionary transition perspective and mode of governance theory were used. Our expectation was that knowledge governance (Gerritsen et al., 2013) interventions were important for the sustainability transition and would be needed because of the high complexity of transitions. Dutch agriculture as a whole and specially the horticulture sector traditionally has a strong focus on innovation. Over the years, many innovation projects and programs have been executed, and sustainability innovations have been central to it. These seemed examples of knowledge governance interventions; in our study other modes of governance were taken into account as well.

40|$|The {{entry and}} exit decisions, {{considered}} as investment decisions, are investigated in the paper. Taking {{into account the}} heterogeneity of entry and exit, the analysis is based on two types of entry-exit: real (related to the establishment or closing of a firm), or entry-exit in a new sector (indicating the diversification or changing specialisation). The theoretical model is based on Marshallian trigger points with Real Option trigger points as an alternative. The estimation exploited the negative binomial model to investigate the role of trigger points (thresholds) on the observed number of entry or exit firms in Dutch <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> over 25 years.

The Dutch <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> is a business card of Dutch agriculture due to quick adjustment to new technologies and implementation of many now-how. The unique way of trading of horticulture production through auction system implies a strong competition with horticulture firms not only inside of the Netherlands but also outside. The evolution and adaptation of the sector to such changes are reflected in the process of firm entry and exit. Therefore it is important to examine the firms ’ entry and exit decisions. By considering the entry as an investment decision and exit as a disinvestment (negative investment) decision, the findings in investment theory can be applied for explanation of observed changes in population of operating firms. The economic literature on investments and entry-exit decision suggests different possible theoretical models to explain choices of entry, exit and size of firms.

40|$|Although thermal screens {{were already}} {{introduced}} {{more than twenty}} years ago in Western European <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture,</b> growers were discouraged to install them in their glasshouse, since they were not able to quantify the crop's behaviour under a thermal screen. Nowadays, crop monitoring techniques have become commercially available, which might aid growers to support their decision to adapt their climate control set points once a thermal screen is installed. In this study, leaf temperature, stem diameter and sap flow measurements were performed on glasshouse tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. 'Clothilde') grown inside two compartments in Beitem, Belgium during spring 2008. In one compartment, a movable and semi-transparent thermal screen was used during the night. Differences in leaf temperature between the two compartments were observed, which were mainly caused by differences in air temperature, although differences in radiative energy losses also had {{to be taken into account}} in the upper canopy layer in the case of cold nights. Based on these results, it is advised to include leaf temperature measurements in research concerning the effect of the use of thermal screens. Additionally, a reduced water uptake was observed in the morning when the screen was still closed, whereas during the evening hours no difference in water uptake could be revealed. However, when the thermal screen was closed in the evening, stem diameter measurements indicated that the internal water storage pools were restored more quickly under the screen. It is, however, acknowledged that these effects were only observed on sunny days. Consequently, in addition to leaf temperature measurements, sap flow and stem diameter measurements can provide growers and researchers useful feedback from the crop itself, when thermal screen application strategies are to be evaluated. As a general conclusion, it was stated that these crop monitoring techniques are imperative when novel techniques are to be introduced in <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> in a sustainable way...|$|E

40|$|The {{trend in}} <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> {{has always been}} to keep culture systems as clean as {{possible}} by using new substrates, by applying disinfection techniques, pathogen-free propagation material, etc. However, several root diseases cause problems under these conditions.

The present paper shows the importance of the microflora in suppressing root pathogens in soilless systems, either by introducing selected antagonists or by stimulation of a beneficial microflora. The limited volume of substrate and a 'biological vacuum' in soilless systems, facilitate inoculation and establishment of antagonists. Examples of soilless systems that contain a suppressive microflora are described. Moreover, the impact of recirculation and disinfection of the nutrient solution on pathogen spread and disease suppression is discussed.

As energy, especially natural gas, is a major intermediate input in Dutch <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture,</b> it has potentially large impacts on producers and trade.

Thus, the investment decision is considered as a realization of the firm's profit-maximizing objective. To understand the investment decision, investments in fixed capital in Dutch <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> were studied. Because an investment decision is dynamic by nature, investment patterns were analysed during the period 1975 - 1999, thereby providing a longer term overview. The salient characteristic of Dutch <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> firms is that they remain small-scale family firms with respect to labour and land, but are highly capital-intensive. Moreover, in recent decades, the sector has experienced many transformations in the fields of evolution and adaptation to new technologies, consumer preferences, and market and environmental requirements. This makes the Dutch <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> sector an attractive case for studying investment patterns. This is done by considering an investment decision as having three components: decisions about participation, about level, and about time. These components are a tangible part of investment decision-making; they reflect the latent factors of: investment thresholds, adjustment costs, irreversibility, and risk and uncertainty, all of which predetermine investments. Results from this research show the relevance of separating the participation and level decisions since the set of significant variables differ (e. g. energy- and land prices are not significant for the level decision), and some of the variables exhibited contrasting signs (e. g. debts, revenue, labour cost). The impact of thresholds is tested on different types of entry and exit, which are considered as investment or disinvestment decisions. The raising of a threshold discourages firms from action; they prefer to delay any decision that can be related to the irreversibility of an investment. The results of this study do not provide strong support for the Real Option theory, which postulates that the effect of the uncertainty can be observed through the changes in investment threshold. While the model based on Marshallian trigger points, which suggests the direct impact of the sector-characterizing variables (such as expectation of output prices, interest rate and uncertainty), explains the participation investment decision better. A phenomenon that has not been studied in any depth is the effect of uncertainty on investment, which is considered in many studies as ambiguous. This study argues that risk and uncertainty should be distinguished from each other. The estimation leads to the conclusion concerning the difference in their effects on the level of investment, which sometimes contrast with each other. Moreover, the asymmetry in the effect of uncertainty is confirmed. The timing of investment addresses the phenomenon of lumpy and intermittent patterns of investment, as estimated by a duration model. The timing of investments {{can be explained by the}} irreversibility of investment, with the lumpiness suggesting the fixed component in adjustment costs. A 6 -year investment cycle was revealed at firm level and confirmed at average level. This implies that new policy instruments for increasing the adoption of new technologies will not necessarily lead to an immediate increase in investments, but will depend on, amongst others, factors associated with the degree of vintage of the installed technologies...|$|E

To fill this gap of information, the Centreof Agricultural Economics developed an extrapolation model that uses data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network of the Centre and data of the Agricultural Census of the National Institute of Statistics to monitor the energy consumption in the glasshouse horticultural sector from 1980 till now. The model is developed in such way that for each holding of the population the energy consumption is estimated. This allows us to estimate the energy consumption for different aggregates. The estimation of {{the share of the}} different energy sources in the total energy consumption makes it possible to estimate emissions due to the heating of the glasshouses.

40|$|For on-line plant {{monitoring}} equipment to be functional in commercial <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture,</b> relations between sensor readings and plant responses {{on both the}} short (days) and long term (weeks) are required. For this reason, systems were installed to monitor rockwool grown gerbera plants on a minute-to-minute basis from July 2002 until April 2003. Data collected included, amongst others, crop transpiration from lysimeter data (2 m 2), canopy temperature using infrared sensors, rockwool water content, and greenhouse climatic parameters, such as global radiation and temperature. By combining data from lysimeter and water content, changes in crop fresh weight could be calculated on a daily basis. Both transpiration and daily fresh weight production were better related to light integral as measured inside the greenhouse, than outside the greenhouse. The contribution of heating pipes underneath the canopy to transpiration could be estimated with the system. From the relation between daily FW production and previous day light integral, a light use efficiency of ca. 10 -g FW/MJ solar radiation as measured inside the greenhouse was calculated. Water use efficiency was on average 25 g FW/L. A 3 - 4 day drying cycle did not affect flower production.

40|$|Understanding and {{alleviating}} {{the constraints}} to ICT adoption are currently {{at the forefront}} of ICT for agricultural production and rural development. EFITA 1 is conducting since 1999 a survey to gain such understanding. The 2004 symposium of the International Society for Horticultural Science (ISHS) offered a unique opportunity to compare the EFITA survey results to symposium participant’s perspectives. The following were identified as comparable adoption constraints: end user (ICT) proficiency, ICT benefit awareness, time, cost of technology, system integration, and software availability. The following constraints were mainly indicated by respondents originating from “developed ” countries: no perceived economic benefits, do not understand the value of ICT and not enough time to spend on technology. The respondents from developing countries stressed the importance of cost of technology and lack of technological infrastructure suggesting that infrastructure and cost of technology are thresholds for adoption of ICT. They are no longer a threshold for ICT adoption in developed countries as understanding “how to get a benefit from the use of ICT ” is. The indication of the importance of “training ” to alleviate this constraint is supported by comparison of these results to the results of a similar Belgian case study in <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture.</b> These three survey comparisons provide insights which suggest remedial steps to expedite ICT adoption and prioritize the necessary research...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to analyse and to {{investigate}} the investment dynamics in Dutch <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture,</b> and to reveal the factors underlying the changes in this sector. Insight into the effect of different factors on the investment behaviour in Dutch horticulture is socially relevant because this sector has to undergo structural changes. The Dutch glasshouse industry has to improve its environmental performance (reduce its energy use, pesticides, use and CO 2 emissions). Improvement of the environmental performance can be achieved by investments in new technologies (e. g. energy saving technologies). Insights into factors that determine investment patterns are important in designing policies that aim at enhancing the environmental performance of horticulture. Also, insights into factors that affect investment patterns in the glasshouse industry are relevant for assessing future credit demand of the glasshouse industry by banks. Panel data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) were used to describe the dynamics of the investments during 1975 - 1998. Inspection of investment patterns of firms demonstrates that investments are not spread over a number of years. Rather, investments are concentrated in some years, followed by some years without any significant investment activity. Another feature from inspection of data is that investment patterns differ between capital goods (e. g. machines, installations, buildings) and between sectors (vegetable, cut-flower, pot-plant).

40|$|Energy is an {{important}} production factor in <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture.</b> However in recent years glasshouse growers are faced with increasing energy prices and growing environmental concerns. In 2000 the Flemish government decided to stimulate environmentally sound investments by means of investment subsidies. In the current research the factors influencing the adoption of environmentally sound and energy saving technologies by glasshouse growers are analysed. Based on the innovation diffusion theory the hypothesis is that external factors, personal characteristics of the firm manager (personal objectives, age, education level, importance attached to subsidies, [...] .) and fixed characteristics (business objectives, business size, modernity, [...] .) determine investment behaviour. Data for the research are obtained from accounting data and interviews at 58 holdings specialised in vegetable production and 79 holdings specialised in production of ornamental plants. These holdings all belong to the Farm Accountancy Data Network of the Centre of Agricultural Economics. PRINCALS and discriminant analysis are used to analyse the data. The most important investments are the conversion from fuel oil to natural gas and the installation or use of energy saving screens. An important obstacle to the conversion to natural gas, as determined by this study, {{is the lack of}} natural gas pipelines in the surroundings of the glasshouse holding. The holdings which currently use natural gas are mainly large, energy-intensive businesses with younger managers. Those who intend to change over to natural gas attach a great importance to investment subsidies as they have smaller but growth-oriented business. Investments in energy saving screens are important for producers of energy intensive ornamental plants. In most of the cases these investments consist of replacement of the existing energy saving screens with more efficient ones...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} provide Bromelia growers with lacking {{information}} about optimal levels of supplementary light and nutrient EC, two consecutive greenhouse experiments were conducted by Wageningen UR <b>Glasshouse</b> <b>Horticulture</b> in Bleiswijk (The Netherlands). In the first experiment a light intensity gradient (17 - 155 µmol m- 2 s- 1 PAR) was installed in the length direction of two 144 m 2 greenhouses. In the width direction four mineral nutrition levels were supplied (EC of 0. 6, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 dS m- 1) to three plant species: Guzmania, Vriesea and Neoregelia (a CAM Bromelia). Each greenhouse had a different (supplementary) photoperiod: 12 or 16 hours. It was concluded that the optimum intensity of supplementary light was 43 µmol m- 2 s- 1 PAR for Vriesea, and 80 µmol•m- 2 s- 1 PAR for Guzmania and Neoregelia applied during 12 hours. The corresponding optimum EC of the nutrient solution was 1. 5. At higher light levels, longer photoperiod, or the same light levels but nutrition with a lower EC, signs of light damage appeared (chlorotic leaves, reduced plant diameter, red spots on leaves). Neoregelia was tolerant to the 16 hour photoperiod. These optima were validated and compared to a non-lighted control {{by means of a}} second experiment with 10 cultivars of 4 different genera grown at a EC of 1. 5 dS m- 1 under three light levels: 43 µmol m- 2 s- 1 PAR (applied to all Vriesea and Guzmania ‘Hilda’), 80 µmol m- 2 s- 1 PAR (applied to Aechmea, Tillandsia, Guzmania ‘Rana’ and Guzmania ‘Tempo’) and no supplementary light (as reference for all varieties). Compared to the reference, the use of supplementary light enhanced plant growth and ornamental quality and it shortened the time to commercial development stage for most studied cultivars, with the exception of Vriesea ‘Miranda’ and Vriesea ‘Stream’...|$|E

The present paper shows the importance of the microflora to suppress Pythium aphanidermatum, a fungal root pathogen which is a serious threat in cucumber. Introduced single antagonists as well as the indigenous microflora suppressed pythium root and crown rot. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Streptomyces griseoviridis, Pythium oligandrum, and 2 isolates of Trichoderma harzianum reduced the disease occurrence by 60 ␘r more in several, but not all, of the experiments. The indigenous microflora showed a very constant disease suppression of 50 to 100 &Eth;This was tested in experiments where P. aphanidermatum was added to sterilised and non-sterilised rockwool, and to sterilised rockwool that had been recolonised with the original microflora. Suppressiveness correlated with the number of filamentous actinomycetes present in the nutrient solution in the rockwool slabs. If a beneficial microflora is present in the cropping system, it should not be disturbed or eradicated by treatments such as disinfection of the recirculated nutrient solution. Therefore, the effects of different disinfection procedures on the composition of the microflora were compared. Numbers of filamentous actinomycetes in the nutrient solution in the tank after the disinfection treatment were highest without disinfection, intermediate after slow filtration, and lowest after UV treatment. Numbers of actinomycetes in the slabs, i. e. around the roots, were not distinctly different between the treatments. The implication of potential shifts in the microbial populations due to certain treatments for the disease development is not known. Increased knowledge on the beneficial microflora and the treatments that influence the composition of such a microflora, will stimulate the exploitation of microbially balanced and optimised soilless culture systems...|$|E

In many cases the firm shows a life cycle that corresponds with the life cycle of the entrepreneur. The objective of the paper is to test the hypothesis that the ‘family-firm life cycle’ {{will have an impact on}} the personal and business characteristics, objectives and the quality of the management processes involved in sustainable <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture.</b> As sustainable horticulture integrates the three P’s (People, Planet, Profit) special attention is paid to human resource, environmental and financial management. Data for the research are based on interviews and accounting data at 138 glasshouse holdings situated in Flanders (northern part of Belgium). The results reveal that the glasshouse managers in the different phases of the ‘family-firm life cycle’ show significant differences in age, education level and numbers of seminars attended. The economic dimension, modernity of durable goods, solvency and investment pattern of the firms in the different stages of the ‘family-firm life cycle’ also show significant differences. At the older businesses the availability of a successor has an important influence. The results confirm the hypothesis that the objectives and the quality of the management processes involved in environmental, human resource and financial management are dependent on the phase in the ‘family-firm life cycle’. In the early stages firm managers are more ambitious and attach a higher importance to the management processes involved in sustainable development. In the later stages the availability of a successor has an important influence. Unexpectedly no significant influence of the phase in the ‘family-firm life cycle’ on the income obtained per familial labour unit is found. The insights derived from this research have important implications both for research and practice. They can enable glasshouse growers and advisers to take and/or support correct decisions and may help policy makers to differentiate on the base of the ‘family-firm life cycle’. farm management, horticulture, sustainability, Crop Production/Industries, Farm Management,...|$|E

In addition, the instruments are described that the local governments have at their disposal within the various task areas: spatial planning, construction and housing, traffic, environment and local government task management. The options and policy instruments are set out against each other in a matrix, with the target groups along one axis and the task areas along the other. The matrix with combinations of options and instruments forms the overview of the playing field of local climate policy. The use of options and instruments from the playing field is examined on the basis of literature and interviews with local governments. In the process, barriers for the implementation of options are illustrated. The evaluation of the playing field in practise shows that local governments often utilise only a part of their playing field. The importance of climate is not made explicit enough in many task areas. The options in climate policy for local governments are influenced by social developments. In the study three trends are examined with respect to their influence: developments in the area of liberalisation of the energy market, the position of local governments in national environmental policy and changes in local democracy. This trends result in a complication of the role of local governments. In order to reinforce contributions from local governments to climate policy, a systematic integrative approach is needed. The ideal model focuses on formulating a so-called climate management system. Similar to quality and environment management systems, a systematic introduction of a (climate) interest in a broad field of activities and decisions are involved. We distinguish some necessary basic steps and elements. The model of a climate management system was tested by practise. For the municipalities of Haren, Hengelo and Alkmaar, the use of the playing field of local climate policy was linked to passing through the steps of a climate management system and mechanisms of external integration...|$|E

About 50 per cent of the difference in results was due to differences in management. 3. Investigation in the area of appropriate levels of management which depend on the entrepreneur's objectives and thestructural characteristics of the firm. To complete the investigation, a research-based system for determining options for improving management was developed. On the basis of the differences in economic results in Dutch <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture,</b> the differences in management wereexpected {{to be one of the}} main causes. In order to verify that hypothesis and to be able to make recommendations for bettermanagement, a model was designed in the first phase to measure the level of management. In this model, all decisions were described and quantified by means of arbitrary scores. At the same time other factors of influence such as the modernity of thefirm as well as the entrepreneur's level of education were incorporated into the model. The investigation during the first phase, of which the results are described in chapter 4, showed that the level of management was rather low and could be improved considerably. Policy-making, crop-planning and work planning scored very low Other factors of influence such as modernity of the firm and the entrepreneurs's level of education scored relatively high. On average, a total level of about 40 per cent of the theoretical maximum level of management was realised. Regression analysis showed that there was a clear relation between the level of man agement and the yield level. In the second phase, the influences of the various manage ment aspects on the economic results of the firm were analysed by means of factor analysis. The results of this investigation, which are described in chapter 5, can be summarized as follows: 1. The more modern the business, in general the better the results. Broadly speaking, one can say that 1 per cent highermodernity is related to a 1 per cent higher level of returns. 2. Young entrepreneurs with a good education level, working in a relatively big, modern business obtain good economic results. It is the combination of factors which exerts a positive influence on the level of returns. 3. A third origin of the differences was found in the use of recorded labour data in the executive phase of production. It is absolutely essential to compare the estimates with the recorded data. If this comparison is not made the positiveInfluence on the level of returns disappears almost completely. 4. Worker participation in long-term decisions and crop-plan ning decisions influences the level of returns. Worker participation at the executive level of production influences labour productivity in particular. 5. Tension on the part of the entrepreneur shows little connection with the quality of management and does not influencethe economic results of the firm. 6. The entrepreneur's relatively one-sided attention to one or several management aspects was often found in businesseswith economic objectives and was relatively often concentrated on the modernity of the firm and the technical level ofthe means of production. 7. A harmonious structure of management instruments was often found in businesses with a social objective. The entrepreneur not only pays attention to the economic and technical aspects of the management of the business, but also considers more social aspects. In the third phase (chapter 6), an investigation was made to establish an appropriate level of management for individual entrepreneurs. The entrepreneur's objectives in <b>glasshouse</b> <b>horticulture</b> substantially influence the level of management. In this investigation, the term "fitting" is applied with respect to the levels of management appropriate to the context. The fitting level of management depends among other things on the degree of ambition of the entrepeneur's objective. The term "fitting" actually indicates that the right form or size of the level of management, generally speaking, cannot be fixed uniformly and a priori, but depends on certain influences of which the entrepreneur's objectives and structural characteristics of the firm are the most important. For the purpose of the investigation the entrepreneur's objective was formulated in terms of the level of returns and earning capacity. In general, a relatively high economic result corresponds with a relatively high level of management. More or less apart from the objectives, the financing and the costs of outside capital may require a certain level of earning capacity and a corresponding level of management. The influence of the structural characteristics of the firm on the different components of management was also taken into consideration. It proved possible to determine the appropriate levels of decision- making processes (pollcy-making, crop-planning and operational decisions) and other factors that can Influence management, such as modernity of the firm and the entrepeneur's level of education. It turned out that the suitable or appropriate level of management of big firms Is in general higher than for small firms. Another conclusion was that firms that have only family labour at their disposal have a suitable level that is lower than firms in which also hired labour is involved. Furthermore, it appeared that firms that are expanding have a higher suitable level of management than firms with a stable size. The study ends by giving directives for practical applications (chapter 7). For that purpose, it is necessary to compare the real level of management with the appropriate level specified by the management model. From this comparison, a gap might appear for each component of management between the actual and the appropriate level. Management advice can be derived from the model, offering the possibility of reducing the shortcoming with regard to the different productions characteristics. According to the study, it is advisable to call in the extension service to carry out the comparison and give the resultant advice. ...|$|E
