Unfortunately, a full <b>entanglement</b> characterization is generally not possible with most <b>entanglement</b> criteria such as <b>entanglement</b> witnesses or the partial transposition criterion.

The brigade was allocated four primary objectives to seize during the assault, one for each battalion, with the 40th Battalion to take the final target located on the ridge itself. The advance commenced at the predetermined time of 06:00 on 4 October 1917, {{under the cover of}} an artillery barrage. The first three battalions were able to seize their objectives, though the fighting intensified with each stage. As the 40th Battalion set to advance towards the final objective, its progress became hampered by increasingly heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, as well as by barbed wire <b>entanglements</b> and sectors of impassable swamp.|$|E
5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, <b>entanglements</b> in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E

A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox <b>entanglements</b> across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E

40|$|This work aims to {{understand}} the monogamy of quantum <b>entanglement</b> from a geometrical point of view. By regarding quantum <b>entanglement</b> as a geometrical structure on the state space of quantum systems and attributing all <b>entanglement</b> related properties as emergent from this geometry of <b>entanglement,</b> we assume there exists a genuine general monogamous relation of quantum <b>entanglement</b> w. r. t. a correspondent genuine <b>entanglement</b> measure Q* which possesses an underlying geometrical origin. We speculate that the monogamous relations w. r. t. an <b>entanglement</b> measure Q can be understood by comparing the different dimension dependencies of the measure Q and Q*.
