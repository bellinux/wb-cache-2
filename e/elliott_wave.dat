40|$|The {{theory of}} <b>Elliott’s</b> <b>waves</b> {{is the world}} wide know and reputable theory in many {{branches}} of science. This argument is applicable also to financial market topic, where the theory of <b>Elliott’s</b> <b>waves</b> became basic for the whole scale of technical analysis oriented to investment instruments evaluation – mainly the shares, currencies or commodities. Anyway to understand the dilemma correctly, the right choice of its application is quite difficult, {{not only because of}} its understanding but also its basics and axioms, and the choice of analytical methods based on its principles used in investment practice. The content of this article is Elliott’s theory basics analysis, focused on research of each kind of <b>Elliott’s</b> <b>waves</b> from mutual relations on each hierarchy levels point of view and also in between each level.

25|$|The <b>Elliott</b> <b>Wave</b> Principle {{posits that}} {{collective}} investor psychology, or crowd psychology, moves between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences.

25|$|The GBP/JPY {{currency}} chart {{gives an}} example of a fourth wave retracement apparently halting between the 38.2% and 50.0% Fibonacci retracements of a completed third wave. The chart also highlights how the <b>Elliott</b> <b>Wave</b> Principle works well with other technical analysis tendencies as prior support (the bottom of wave-1) acts as resistance to wave-4. The wave count depicted in the chart would be invalidated if GBP/JPY moves above or even touches the wave-1 low.|$|E
25|$|Extracted {{from the}} same {{relationship}} between <b>Elliott</b> <b>Waves</b> and Fibonacci ratio, a 78.6% retracement level is identified as a best place for buying or selling (in continuation to the larger trend) as it increases the risk to reward ratio up to 1:3.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a joint review on professional technical analysis and academic quantitative {{analysis of the}} financial markets, aiming at bridging the deep gulf between the two fields and unifying them under a general science of intelligent finance or financial intelligence. While econometricians and econophysicians have recently reexamined technical analysis, most of their effort is focused on chart patterns and technical indicators, leading to some simplicity impression of technical analysis. In our view, the most valuable core and also {{the hardest part of}} technical analysis is the fractal and quantum nature of <b>Elliott</b> <b>waves</b> and Gann price-time cycles and angles. On the quantitative analysis side, since Mandelbrot’s discovery of fractals in financial time series, both empirical and fundamental progresses have been made, mainly in the last decade, including a third-order power law asymptotic behavior in return distribution, an accelerated crossover from the power law towards a Gaussian, a theoretical framework of crashes as critical points, and multi-agent game models of the financial markets. Inspired by these developments from the two fields we point out the possibility of developing an adaptive computational model of <b>Elliott</b> <b>waves</b> and Gann price-time cycles and angles using multilevel power laws, log-periodicity and instantaneous phase estimation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Agent based model, {{aimed to}} mimic the real economy by {{interactions}} between its agents, needs a flexible and eclectic sub-models {{in order to have}} an opportunity to adjust itself to different situations. The aim of the paper is to offer an outline of the fexible parametric model of the capital market and to offer a new approach to it. We will consider the market being influenced by the fundamental and technical indicators. The fundamental indicators must be given by the output of the agent-based model. The technical indicators will be considered from two points of view: psychology and mathematics. The psychological part of the technical analysis will be represented by <b>Elliott</b> <b>waves</b> and jumps caused by appearance of the strong signals of the technical analysis determining the trend. The mathematical part will be represented by stochastic models comprising stable and operator stable innovations. The initial values of the model must be obtained from the observations of the real data and parameters of the world's economy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the basic {{framework of a}} comprehensive computational theory of stock market behavior, which we call Swingtum, taking multivariate stock index time series data as input, and producing probabilistic predictions of stock index movement at multiple time frames. The theory should also be applicable to other liquid markets. The Swingtum theory {{is based on the}} view that the movement of the stock market as a whole as represented by its benchmark index is driven by three types of forces: business dynamics, mass psychological dynamics, and news impacts, and consequently the market movement can be decomposed into four types of components: dynamical swings, physical cycles, abrupt momentums, and random walks. Dynamic swings include business cycles, stock life cycles, and <b>Elliott</b> <b>waves</b> of different levels, which typically have a fractal nature characterized by log-periodic power laws. Physical cycles includes anniversary days, seasonality cycles, and weekly cycles, which have relatively constant periodicity. Abrupt momentums may be caused by endogenous critical points or driven by exogenous news shocks or impacts. Random walks correspond to remainin...|$|R
