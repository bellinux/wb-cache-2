40|$|We {{introduce}} a new family of nonperiodic tilings, based on a substitution rule that generalizes the pinwheel tiling of Conway and Radin. In each tiling the tiles are similar to a single triangular prototile. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> countable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cases, the tiles appear <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sizes and <b>an</b> infinite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> orientations. These tilings generally do not meet full-edge to full-edge, but CAN be forced through local matching rules. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> countable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cases, the tiles appear <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> orientations but <b>an</b> infinite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sizes, all within a set range, while <b>in</b> <b>an</b> uncountable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cases both the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sizes and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> orientations is infinite.

50|$|An {{algorithm}} is lock-free if infinitely often operation by some processors will succeed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> steps. For instance, if N processors {{are trying to}} execute an operation, some of the N processes will succeed in finishing the operation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> steps and others might fail and retry on failure. The difference between wait-free and lock-free is that wait-free operation by each process is guaranteed to succeed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> steps, regardless of the other processors.|$|R

That condition, topologically, is that the set A is closed. This fact—that all closed games are determined—is called the Gale-Stewart theorem. Note that by symmetry, all open games are determined as well. (A game is open if I can win only by winning <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> moves.) ...|$|R
