5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as <b>improve</b> <b>understanding</b> of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E

Backed by a {{syndicate}} led by a patron of hers, she bought a former synagogue on Woodward Avenue, Temple Beth El, for $500,000 and commissioned C. Howard Crane to renovate it. At first she carried on producing mostly Broadway-style plays. However, the company did perform classics, including modern-dress productions of Romeo and Juliet in 1926 and Hamlet in 1927, {{among the first to}} put on such performances. In February 1928 Bonstelle began a campaign to gain community support for the theater. A fund of over $200,000 was raised by donations from the public and Bonstelle made an agreement with local authorities to make the playhouse the city's unofficial premier theater. Later that year the group became known as the Detroit Civic Theater. In her plan for the theater she emphasized the importance of providing the public with the best drama, including both classics and modern works, and improving young people's knowledge of dramatic literature. Funded by public subscription, it had ticket prices as low as $1.50. Performances included works by Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The theater also played a religious role. Bonstelle used it in an effort to <b>improve</b> <b>understanding</b> and co-operation between the church and the theater, holding multi-denominational religious services there during Lent, and she stated that her plays, while avoiding being preachy, were intended to have a positive moral influence on the audience. Local clergy publicly praised her work with the theater.|$|E

25|$|Motivating operations, MOs, {{relate to}} the field of {{motivation}} in that they help <b>improve</b> <b>understanding</b> aspects of behavior that are not covered by operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the function of the reinforcer is to influence future behavior. The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.|$|E
25|$|Theoretical ecology is the {{scientific}} discipline {{devoted to the}} study of ecological systems using theoretical methods such as simple conceptual models, mathematical models, computational simulations, and advanced data analysis. Effective models <b>improve</b> <b>understanding</b> of the natural world by revealing how the dynamics of species populations are often based on fundamental biological conditions and processes. Further, the field aims to unify a diverse range of empirical observations by assuming that common, mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological environments. Based on biologically realistic assumptions, theoretical ecologists are able to uncover novel, non-intuitive insights about natural processes. Theoretical results are often verified by empirical and observational studies, revealing the power of theoretical methods in both predicting and understanding the noisy, diverse biological world.|$|E

2500|$|Horkheimer {{maintained}} that critical theory {{should be directed}} at the totality of society in its historical specificity (i.e., how {{it came to be}} configured at a specific point in time), just as it should <b>improve</b> <b>understanding</b> of society by integrating all the major social sciences, including geography, economics, sociology, history, political science, anthropology, and psychology. While critical theory must at all times be self-critical, Horkheimer insisted that a theory is critical only if it is explanatory. Critical theory must, therefore, combine practical and normative thinking to [...] "explain what is wrong with current social reality, identify actors to change it, and provide clear norms for criticism and practical goals for the future." [...] Whereas traditional theory can only mirror and explain reality as it presently is, critical theory's purpose is to change it; in Horkheimer's words the goal of critical theory is [...] "the emancipation of human beings from the circumstances that enslave them".|$|E
