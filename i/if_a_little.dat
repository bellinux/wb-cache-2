25|$|With the Ashes now contested {{across all}} three formats, the drawn Test meant that England {{would have to}} win the {{combined}} ODI and Twenty20 match series at least 8-4 (2 points for a win) to win back the Ashes. They began badly in the first ODI at Lords, where Australia batted first and scored 203-8, due to good performances from Katherine Brunt and Marsh with the ball. England began well <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slowly but faded against the Australian spinners, as despite 61 from Edwards, they slumped to a 27 run defeat. England came back strongly in the second ODI at Hove, batting first and making 256-6 in their 50 overs. Edwards led the way with her 6th consecutive ODI fifty, {{with all of the}} top six making at least 26. Brunt and Anya Shrubsole then dismissed both openers, including the dangerous Meg Lanning for zero, and despite 81 from Jess Cameron, England won by 51 runs, although Marsh injured her shoulder and missed the remainder of the series. The final ODI again took place at Hove, and after rain reduced the game to 36 overs a side, Australia scored an imposing 203-4, led by Lanning's 64. The Australia innings was notable for the remarkable dismissal of Australian captain Jodie Fields, who was brilliantly caught one-handed by Taylor as Fields attempted to reverse sweep Danielle Hazell. England chased down this target impressively, as after Edwards early dismissal, Knight and Taylor combined for a partnership of 126 in 18 overs. They fell for 69 and 64 respectively, but Sciver and Gunn saw England home and into a series lead.|$|E

Richardson wrote how [...] "Fleming's method is worth noting, and recommending: he does not start indulging in his wilder fantasies until he has laid down a foundation of factual description." [...] Elements of a review by Raymond Chandler for The Sunday Times were used as advertising for the novel; Chandler wrote that it was [...] "about the nicest piece of book-making {{in this type of}} literature which I have seen for a long time...

[...] The Observer, in 2005, reports that the play [...] "got stinking reviews" [...] according to folk singer Martin Carthy, adding that the Western Daily Mail reviewer was [...] "baffled" [...] and The Listener had [...] "noted that Dylan had 'sat around playing and singing attractively, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> incomprehensibly'".|$|E
500|$|Dan Stapleton of IGN {{rated the}} game {{a score of}} 9.2 out of 10, praising the graphics, {{gameplay}} variety, detail of the open world, the voice acting performances (particularly of Kevin Conroy as Batman and John Noble as Scarecrow) and the overall improvement in the combat and predator systems. He criticized the Batmobile's Battle mode as [...] "weird" [...] and [...] "about as un-Batman an activity as [...] imagine," [...] {{as well as the}} difficulty of managing the vehicle's default controls, though praised the tank battles as [...] "good fun". Polygon's Justin McElroy, giving the game a 10 out of 10, stating that the game [...] "ticks all the boxes for the fourth entry in a AAA franchise." [...] He lauded the ingenuity of the game's puzzles, noting how they make the players think on a significantly higher level than past entries in the series, calling the game [...] "nothing short of revolutionary" [...] and [...] "the best game of this console generation." [...] Steve Tilley of The Toronto Sun deemed the game [...] "fantastic, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> formulaic". He felt it a satisfying and appropriately large-scale conclusion to Rocksteady's Arkham games, praising the surprises in the plot, as well as the graphics, combat, and the Batmobile's range of abilities.|$|E

500|$|... "Silly Love Songs" [...] was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim from many television critics upon its initial airing. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave a very positive review of the episode, and wrote, [...] "This was our favorite type of Glee episode. Though we enjoy over-the-top spectacles , the show's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline. Sue Sylvester didn't make an appearance and—dare we say it—we didn't even miss her." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the episode, going on to write, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} strong showing, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> disjointed. Well, at least it was honest. If this show is one thing, it's disjointed. It's part of its spazzy appeal." [...] Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review: [...] "On Tuesday night, Glee wasn’t only back at its usual time, it was back to doing what it does best: giving us entertaining [...] storylines involving characters we care about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story. It was like a perfect heart-shaped bubble of an episode reminding the show’s fans about all the things we’ve missed about the show these last couple of months." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers' {{opinions}} on the graphics and gameplay were largely negative, while {{opinions on}} the title's music varied. The background music was described as [...] "...the only thing that is remotely interesting about this appallingly tedious game..." [...] by Popular Computing Weeklys reviewer. He followed this by stating [...] "At first it sounds all right, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> monotonous, then it begins to grate the nerves. After a while it begins to take on all {{the appeal of the}} Chinese water torture." [...] Crash magazine's three reviewers were more positive about the music, stating [...] "The sound is fairly well done...", [...] "The title screen plays a nice tune..." [...] and [...] "...the game's drawing point is the sound..." [...] The game's graphics were described as [...] "fairly crude", [...] "unattractive" [...] and [...] "...none too exciting, consisting of colourful but flickery characters." [...] One reviewer stated [...] "The graphics are large and colourful but {{there is a lot of}} character clash..." [...] Overall impressions of Moonlight Madness were negative. Crash magazine's reviewers compared the game unfavourably to Booty. One expressed disappointment because of Bubble Bus' history of releasing [...] "great arcade/adventures". Your Sinclairs reviewer stated [...] "Maybe Bubble Bus had a touch of Moonlight Madness when it picked this one for its new release." [...] The reviewer from ZX Computing stated [...] "Keeping to the boy scout theme, be prepared before you buy this one." ...|$|E

Without {{somebody}} like Nikki Blonsky {{at the heart of}} the movie, it might fall flat, but everybody works at her level of happiness..." [...] Ebert also noted that this film is [...] "a little more innocent than Waters would have made it..." [...] Krishna Shenoi, of the Shenoi Chronicle, called the movie [...] "Shankman's masterpiece," [...] saying that it moved away from his previous works into a different direction, making a light comedy that deals with serious issues maturely. Shenoi also said that the film was everything he wanted Grease to be. Lou Lumenick of The New York Post hailed Hairspray as [...] "The best and most entertaining movie adaptation of a stage musical so far this century— and yes, I’m including the Oscar-winning Chicago," [...] calling it [...] "one of the best-cast movies in recent memory..." [...] New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews called the film [...] "A great big sloppy kiss of entertainment for audiences weary of explosions, CGI effects and sequels, sequels, sequels." [...] The Baltimore Sun review offered Michael Sragow's opinion that [...] "in its entirety, Hairspray has the funny tilt that only a director-choreographer like Shankman can give to a movie," [...] pointing out that Shankman skillfully [...] "puts a new-millennial zing behind exact re-creations of delirious period dances like the Mashed Potato." [...] Dana Stevens from Slate called Hairspray [...] "intermittently tasty, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too frantically eager to please." [...] Stevens noted that [...] "Despite its wholesomeness, this version stays remarkably true to the spirit of the original, with one size-60 exception: John Travolta as Edna Turnblad," [...] saying [...] "How you feel about Hairspray will depend entirely on your reaction to this performance..." ...|$|E

500|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will vs. determinism. One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C.A. Wolski commented, [...] "At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate?" [...] However, {{there is also the}} added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, [...] "is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way." [...] The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, [...] "ere's the biggest one of all: Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, {{and there would be no}} question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act [...] a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (<b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> maddening) to ponder." [...] Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.|$|E
500|$|Like the {{original}} release, The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of GamePro praised its updated audio, {{and said that}} the new graphics [...] "blow the old clunker visuals ... out of the water". He cited its script, humor, plot, puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points, and finished, [...] "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is impressive, hilarious and downright worth your money." [...] Daemon Hatfield of IGN wrote, [...] "Almost 20 years after its release, [...] remains a blast to play." [...] He called the new graphics [...] "slick, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> generic", and noted that the [...] "original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don't." [...] However, he enjoyed the redone music, the new hint function, and the added sound effects and voice acting. He summarized it as [...] "one of the best times you'll ever have pointing and clicking", and noted that [...] "few games are this funny." [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot noted that [...] "the Special Edition looks much better and {{is the only way to}} play if you want to hear ... what characters are saying, whereas {{the original}} game's interface is less clunky." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it's difficult to go back to the original edition." [...] He praised its humor, writing, puzzles and characters, and he believed that it had aged well. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead wrote, [...] "Purists like me will almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game, but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better." [...] However, he preferred the original game's Guybrush design, and believed that the new control system was [...] "rather less intuitive" [...] than the old one. He finished by stating that [...] "few games can stand the test of time with such confidence".|$|E
