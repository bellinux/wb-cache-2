5000|$|The Virginia Dale stage station hosted many famous {{travelers}} such as author Albert D. Richardson ("Beyond the Mississippi") and an Illinois governor, probably Richard Yates. Samuel Bowles, {{editor of}} the Massachusetts Republican wrote in 1865, [...] "Virginia Dale deserves its pretty name. A pearly, lively-looking stream runs through a beautiful basin of perhaps one hundred acres, among the mountains - for we are within the entrances {{of one of the}} great hills-stretching away in smooth and rising pasture to nooks and crannies of the wooded range; <b>fronted</b> by rock <b>embankment,</b> and flanked by the snowy peaks themselves; warm with the June sun, and rare with an air into which no fetid breath has poured itself-it is difficult to imagine a loveable spot in Nature's kingdom." [...] The station itself was built with timber cut by Hiram 'Hi" [...] Kelly, one of the first profitable cattle ranchers in the Laramie area.|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} moisture {{dynamics of}} an aged (> 100 years old) railway earthwork embankment, {{which is still}} in use, are investigated using 2 D and 3 D resistivity monitoring. A methodology was employed that included automated 3 D ERT data capture and telemetric transfer with on-site power generation, the correction of resistivity models for seasonal temperature changes and the translation of subsurface resistivity distributions into moisture content based on petrophysical relationships developed for the embankment material. Visualization of the data as 2 D sections, 3 D tomograms and time series plots for different zones of the embankment enabled the development of seasonal wetting <b>fronts</b> within the <b>embankment</b> to be monitored at a high-spatial resolution and the respective distributions of moisture in the flanks, crest and toes of the embankment to be assessed. Although the embankment considered here is at no immediate risk of failure, the approach developed for this study is equally applicable to other more high-risk earthworks and natural slopes. ...|$|R
5000|$|Ahmedabad lies at [...] {{in western}} India at 53 metres (174 ft) {{above sea level}} {{on the banks of}} the Sabarmati river, in north-central Gujarat. It covers an area of 464 km2. The Sabarmati {{frequently}} dried up in the summer, leaving only a small stream of water, and the city is in a sandy and dry area. However with the execution of the Sabarmati River <b>Front</b> Project and <b>Embankment,</b> the waters from the Narmada river have been diverted to the Sabarmati to keep the river flowing throughout the year, thereby eliminating Ahmedabad's water problems. The steady expansion of the Rann of Kutch threatened to increase desertification around the city area and much of the state; however, the Narmada Canal network is expected to alleviate this problem. Except for the small hills of Thaltej-Jodhpur Tekra, the city is almost flat. Three lakes lie within the city's limits—Kankaria, Vastrapur and Chandola. Kankaria, in the neighbourhood of Maninagar, is an artificial lake developed by the Sultan of Gujarat, Kutb-ud-din, in 1451.|$|R
5000|$|Colonel Hercules Scott's column {{consisted}} {{of his own}} 103rd Regiment, less its light company. He launched his attack as soon as firing was heard from Snake Hill. Surprise was quickly lost when American pickets detected them and fired muskets to alert the defenders. Once the British had moved close enough, the guns of the fort and the Douglass Battery (loaded with canister) and several hundred U.S. Infantry opened fire, causing horrific losses to the British who were jammed into a narrow <b>front</b> between an <b>embankment</b> and the lake. Colonel Scott was mortally wounded by a musket ball in the head early in the attack. His second in command, Major William Smelt, was also seriously wounded. At {{one point in the}} battle, a cry rose from the British forces of [...] "Stop firing, you're shooting your own men!", and the fighting ceased for almost an entire minute until an American officer, unconvinced by the unfamiliarly accented appeal, shouted back [...] "To Hell with you!" [...] and the firing resumed. Scott's shattered regiment fell back with 360 casualties (although some may later have joined Drummond's attack against the fort). The Americans facing them reported no casualties from Scott's attack.|$|R
40|$|Embankments {{are common}} {{structures}} along rivers or lakes in riparian zones in plain areas. They should have natural slopes instead of slopes covered by concrete or other hard materials, {{in order to}} rebuild sustainable ecosystems for riparian zones. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of vegetative slopes on water flow and pollutant transport through the embankments. Three embankments with different slope treatments (a bare slope, a slope covered in centipede grass, a slope covered in tall fescue) were examined, and three inflow applications of pollute water with different concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) used to simulate different agricultural non-point pollution levels. The results showed that the water flux rates of the three embankments were relatively stable under all inflow events, and almost all values were higher than 80 %. The embankments with vegetative slopes had better nitrogen removal than the bare slope under all events, and the one with tall fescue slope was best, but the benefits of vegetative slopes decreased with increasing inflow concentration. Moreover, {{there were no significant differences}} between the embankments on phosphorus removal, for which the reductions were all high (above 90 %) with most loads remaining in the <b>front</b> third of <b>embankment</b> bodies. Overall, the embankments with vegetative slopes had positive effects on water exchange and reducing non-point pollutant into lake or river water, which provides a quantitative scientific basis for the actual layout of lakeshores...|$|R
40|$|Optimal and {{sustainable}} allocation of equipment in earthwork tasks {{is a complex}} problem that requires the study of several different aspects, {{as well as the}} knowledge {{of a large number of}} factors. In truth, earthworks are comprised by a combination of repetitive, sequential, and interdependent activities based on heavy mechanical equipment (i. e., resources), such as excavators, dumper trucks, bulldozers and compactors. In order to optimally allocate the available resources, knowledge regarding their specifications (e. g., capacity, weight, horsepower) and the work conditions to which they will be subjected (e. g., material types, required and available volumes in <b>embankment</b> and excavation <b>fronts,</b> respectively) is essential. This knowledge can be translated into the productivity (i. e., work rate) of each piece of equipment when working under a specific set of conditions. Moreover, since earthwork tasks are inherently sequential and interdependent, the interaction between the allocated equipment must be taken into account. A typical example of this is the need for matching the work rate of an excavator team with the capacity of a truck team to haul the excavated material to the <b>embankment</b> <b>fronts.</b> Given the non-trivial characteristics of the earthwork allocation problem, conventional Operation Research (e. g., linear programming) and blind search methods are infeasible. As such, a potential solution is to adopt metaheuristics – modern optimization methods capable of searching large search space regions under a reasonable use of computational resources. While this may address the issue of optimizing such a complex problem, the lack of knowledge regarding optimization parameters under different work conditions, such as equipment productivity, calls for a different approach. Bearing in mind the availability of large databases, including in the earthworks area, that have been gathered in recent years by construction companies, technologies like data mining (DM) come forward as ideal tools for solving this problem. Indeed, the learning capabilities of DM algorithms can be applied to databases embodying the productivity of several equipment types when subjected to different work conditions. The extracted knowledge can then be used to estimate the productivity of the available equipment under similar work conditions. Furthermore, as previously referred, since earthwork tasks include the material hauling from excavation to <b>embankment</b> <b>fronts,</b> it also becomes imperative to analyze and optimize the possible transportation networks. In this context, the use of geographic information systems (GIS) provides an easy method to study the possible trajectories for transportation equipment in a construction site, ultimately allowing for a choice of the best paths to improve the workflow. This paper explores the advantages of integrating the referred technologies, among others, in order to allow for a sustainable management of earthworks. This is translated in the form of an evolutionary multi-criteria optimization system, capable of searching for the best allocation of the available equipment that minimizes a set of goals (e. g., cost, duration, environmental impact). Results stemming from the validation of the resulting system using real-world data from a Portuguese construction site demonstrate the potential and importance of using this kind of technologies for a sustainable management and optimization of earthworks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEarthworks {{are part}} of the {{construction}} of any type of ground transport infrastructure. In many road and railway infrastructures earthworks represent up to 30 to 50 % of total cost of the construction. Moreover, earthworks involve the use of heavy mechanical equipment (e. g., excavators, dumper trucks, bulldozers and rollers) and repetitive activities that are responsible for large amounts of carbon emissions with negative impact to the environment. In this context, the optimization of earthworks construction activities is becoming increasingly important in recent years, while effective and practical integrated solutions have not been established so far. As such, this work introduces a novel optimization integrated system for earthwork tasks. In this integrated system, the optimization is carried out on various fronts, namely minimization of execution cost and duration, while attempting to reduce environmental impacts, such as carbon emissions. In order to achieve this, the integration of a wide array of technologies is required, so as to allow for a proper adjustment to reality. These range from evolutionary computation and data mining (i. e., soft computing), to geographic information systems and linear programming. The former are used firstly to provide realistic estimates of the productivity of available resources (i. e., equipment), and secondly to perform their optimal allocation throughout the construction site. Concurrently, the latter are employed for supporting the optimization of resource and material management, {{as well as of the}} trajectories associated with transportation of material from excavation to <b>embankment</b> <b>fronts.</b> The system has been validated using real-world data stemming from a Portuguese road construction site. Results show that the proposed system is very competitive when compared with the manual allocation methodologies currently used for the design and construction of earthworks. In fact, the system can output several different resource distribution solutions, which comprehend a trade-off between the referred optimization objectives, enhancing the flexibility of design by allowing the user to select the solution that best fits the project restrictions (e. g., deadline, budget). As such, the system is capable of allocating the available equipment in a way that maximizes its potential and productivity, while indirectly guaranteeing minimum carbon emissions in each possible solution. These results emphasize the importance of using this kind of decision support/optimization tools in the design and construction of earthworks...|$|R
