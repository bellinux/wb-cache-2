50|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{contrast between}} civil procedure in jurisdictions {{where there are}} no oral examinations for <b>discovery,</b> for example <b>in</b> Australia and England, and North American practice, can be discerned by reading an extract from the New South Wales Law Reform Commission Report in 1978. The process is described in detail and aimed at an Australian audience. It is clear that the North American process is unfamiliar to Australian lawyers as the author witnessed an <b>examination</b> for <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> Toronto and outlines in intricate detail the rules in Ontario as they were in effect at that time.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, {{the process}} is nearly {{identical}} but is called an <b>examination</b> for <b>discovery.</b> <b>In</b> Australia, and England and Wales, {{there is no right}} of oral examination of opposing parties in civil litigation, save that in England and Wales the pre-litigation discovery process allows for each party to make written questions and the answers to those questions will be relied upon during if there is any discrepancy in the oral evidence given <b>in</b> Court. Oral <b>examination</b> is typically completed after pleadings and requests for particulars by exchange of affidavits of documents and sometimes written questions and answers (interrogatories). Often affidavits are exchanged before trial, but the first opportunity to orally question the opposing party's evidence is usually at trial.|$|R
40|$|Recently, I {{was invited}} to present a keynote address, and the {{preparation}} of that speech led me to review how our field {{has changed over the}} past 10 years. Clearly, the science informing psychiatric practice has grown at an exponential rate during the past decade. But the question that gave me pause was, “Have the lives of our consumers and their families similarly improved over these past 10 years? ” At the end of the day, that is really the only question that should compel us, and bring a sense of perspective to our work as psychiatric and mental health nurses. So for the next few minutes let us engage in a process of revelation, <b>examination,</b> and <b>discovery.</b> <b>In</b> the words of Michael Proust, “The real voyage of <b>discovery</b> consists not <b>in</b> seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes. ...|$|R
40|$|Our {{interest}} in Staphylococcus epidermidis strain A 487 {{was prompted by}} the unusual nature of its inhibitory activity in screening tests against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The inhibitory activity was detected in deferred antagonism tests only if the agar plate was preheated for at least 35 min at >= 55 degrees C before inoculation of the indicator bacteria, this phenomenon indicating possible involvement of a heat-labile immunity agent or protease. The inhibitor was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by cation-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography. Tandem MS revealed a novel peptide of molecular weight 2588. 4 Da. The draft genome sequence of strain A 487 was determined using 454 GS FLX technology, allowing {{the identification of the}} structural gene (hlp) encoding the mature peptide MQFITDLIK KAVDFFKGLFGNK. The deduced amino acid sequence of peptide 487 exhibited 70. 8 % similarity to that of a putative haemolysin from Staphylococcus cohnii. Analysis of the genome of strain A 487 showed several additional inhibitor-encoding genes, including hld, the determinant for staphylococcal delta-lysin. This work indicates that potentially useful inhibitors could be overlooked in agar-based inhibitor screening programmes lacking a heat pretreatment step and also highlights the utility of draft genome sequence <b>examination</b> <b>in</b> antibacterial agent <b>discovery...</b>|$|R
