First of all, the barons {{of the realm}} elected Joscelin III the child king's guardian to look after him. The High Court also stipulated that the military orders would hold all royal fortresses during the king's minority, but Beirut was granted to Raymond to compensate him for the expenses of state administration. Finally, the High Court ruled that if the child king died before reaching the age of majority, the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor and the kings of France and England were to be approached to decide whether his mother or her half-sister, Isabella, had the stronger claim to succeede him. Although some versions of the Estoire de Eracles hint that Raymond had persuaded the <b>Hight</b> Court to pass these rules, {{most of them were}} clearly adopted to limit the regent's authority.|$|E

25|$|In 1948 {{the first}} person of Māori descent to accept the Bahá’í Faith was Albert White, who was one quarter Māori. In 1949 the first Persian Bahá'í pioneer, Manoochehr Ala’i, arrived {{as a student at}} Massey College. In 1953 the first {{standing}} Hand of the Cause, the highest appointed position in the religion open to all, `Alí-Akbar Furútan, visited New Zealand. In 1957 the New Zealand community held its first independent convention to elect its own National Spiritual Assembly with three delegates from Auckland and two each from Devonport, New Plymouth and Wellington. This convention elected the first National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand. In 1958 Hand of the Cause of God, Enoch Olinga visited the Ngaruawahia Marae and talked with elders and four years later, when Hand of the Cause of God, Dr Muhajir visited, Ephraim Te Paa, a Kaumatua (Māori elder) from Ahipara converted to the religion. In 1963 with the election of the Universal House of Justice the Hands of the Cause updated and published a kind of census of the religion. At that time there were four assemblies -Auckland, Devonport, Hamilton, Wellington - and 18 localities with smaller groups of Bahá'ís - see maps. The story of one convert in 1964 includes her concern for her bi-racial children and despair at the bigotry of interracial marriage among the very minorities her children were members (she being Celt and married a Māori) when she found this kind of marriage highly accepted among Bahá'ís. The members of the National Assembly, who participated in the convention for the first election of the Universal House of Justice, were: Hugh Blundell, John Carr, Margaret Harnish, Linda <b>Hight,</b> Percy Leadley, Phyllis Milne, Jean Simmons, Douglas Weeks, and Terry Stirling. The New Zealand Bahá'í community came to the assistance of refugees in 1979 from the persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran who were allowed to settle in New Zealand. Between 1987 and 1989, a further 142 Iranian Bahá'ís settled in New Zealand.|$|E

It was given a story to [...] "create the premise and help player to be emotionally invested"; however, the team avoided making the story too strong, as it would [...] "distract the player from the core experience" [...] of flying freely and shaping clouds. In the early stages of development, the game had an involved backstory about an alien who attempts to clean up the environment, but this was cut down to [...] "a simple 'poetic' introduction to the cloud child trapped in a hospital bed." [...] The team intended Cloud to [...] "communicate a feeling of youthfulness, freedom, and the wonder of imagination." [...] It was built on a modified version of a game engine developed by several team members for their previous game, Dyadin.

In March 2009, it was {{reported that}} Sony was seeking opinions about a collector's edition from PlayStation 3 owners. In October, an Ultimate Edition was unveiled for North America, and an Ultimate Trilogy Edition was announced soon afterwards for a limited European, Australian, and New Zealand release.

[...] From April 2011 until April 2012, several sources claimed that a fourth main entry would release sometime in 2012 and would feature an online component. On April 12, 2012, Sony released a teaser image on its official PlayStation Facebook page, which was followed by the game's announcement on April 19, though Amazon leaked the announcement the day before. The trailer announced Todd Papy, who had worked as a designer on God of War and God of War II and as Design Director on God of War III, as Game Director. David Jaffe confirmed that God of War III Game Director Stig Asmussen did not return to direct this game because he was working on another project at Santa Monica. The announcement trailer was narrated by Linda Hunt; it refers to a time before Kratos became the Ghost of Sparta and was not [...] "bound in blood". The announcement officially confirmed that the game's title would be God of War: Ascension. Papy said the game was not titled God of War IV to avoid confusion because it is a prequel, rather than a sequel, to the trilogy.

[...] Santa Monica studio director John <b>Hight</b> reassured players that God of War III lasts longer than 10 hours: [...] "We've {{done a lot}} of play testing on it... We know, for a really hardcore player, it'll take them longer than it took them to play either of the previous God of War games." [...] The finished game script was about 120 pages long, and the number of onscreen enemies increased from 15 in the previous games to a maximum of 50. To light the game, Turtle by Illuminate Labs was used. Head of development Christer Ericson of SCE Santa Monica Studio confirmed that God of War III has seamless loading; no loading screens and no hard disk drive installation requirement. SCE America animator Bruno Velazquez said that while the first two God of War titles had computer-generated imagery (CGI) cinematics, there would be no true CGI in the third game: [...] "all the cutscenes are created using our in-game engine." [...] A God of War III game trailer debuted on Spike's GameTrailers TV on February 11, 2010, and Asmussen confirmed that all footage is of gameplay. New camera angles were added; during some major battles the player can still control Kratos while the camera pans away from the fight, and a first-person camera view was used for the final portion of the Poseidon and Zeus boss fights. According to Sony Santa Monica director of technology Tim Moss, God of War III used 35 gigabytes (GB) of Blu-ray Disc. God of War IIIs budget was $44million USD, and the game had a staff of 132 {{at the end of its}} development.|$|E

[...] Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone called the record [...] "one of the best albums of the year" [...] noting {{that all of the}} tracks contain [...] "a down-home generosity and accessibility" [...] and that [...] "even the most street-oriented songs have some sort of commentary in them." [...] Tony Green of The Village Voice praised OutKast's [...] "feel for sonics and structure" [...] and stated, [...] "they've moved toward harder, darker textures, in service of song designs that are often disarmingly subtle." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic commented that, [...] "given the variety of moods, it helps that the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of reset button. It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it's striking how few weak tracks there are". Aishah <b>Hight</b> of PopMatters stated, [...] "Within Stankonia, Outkast successfully presented a southern perspective of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But on the surface, phat beats and pure funk should suffice." [...] Alternative Press commented that [...] "experienced, acclaimed groups rarely make albums as bold and confrontational as Stankonia, because they have too much to lose", but felt that [...] "OutKast don't care", writing that they [...] "coalesced the political and societal challenges of hip hop's past into what is one of the genre's most artistically unorthodox releases so far." ...|$|E
