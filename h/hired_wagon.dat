6000|$|In {{the course}} of the {{afternoon}} we availed ourselves of the opportunity of a return vehicle to go as far as Sandy Hill, where we passed the night. The next morning, bright and early, we got into a <b>hired</b> <b>wagon</b> and drove across the country until near night, when we paid for our passage, sent the vehicle back, and sought a tavern. At this house, where we passed the night, we heard {{a good deal of the}} [...] "Injins" [...] having made their appearance on the Littlepage lands, and many conjectures as to the probable result. We were in a township, or rather on a property that was called Mooseridge, and which had once belonged to us, but which, having been sold, and in a great measure paid for by the occupants, no one thought of impairing the force of the covenants under which the parties held. The most trivial observer will soon discover that it is only when something is to be gained that the aggrieved citizen wishes to disturb a covenant. Now, I never heard any one say a syllable against either of the covenants of his lease under which he held his farm, let him be ever so loud against those which would shortly compel him to give it up! Had I complained of the fact--and such facts abounded--that my predecessors had incautiously let farms at such low prices that the lessees had been enabled to pay the rents for half a century by subletting small portions of them, as my uncle Ro had intimated, I should be pointed at as a fool. [...] "Stick to your bond" [...] would have been the cry, and [...] "Shylock" [...] would have been forgotten. I do not say that there is not a vast difference between the means of acquiring intelligence, the cultivation, the manners, the social conditions, and, in some senses, the social obligations of an affluent landlord and a really hard-working, honest, well-intentioned husbandman, his tenant--differences that should dispose the liberal and cultivated gentleman to bear in mind the advantages he has perhaps inherited, and not acquired by his own means, in such a way as to render him, in a certain degree, the repository of the interests of those who hold under him; but, while I admit all this, and say that the community which does not possess such a class of men is to be pitied, as it loses one of the most certain means of liberalizing and enlarging its notions, and of improving its civilization, I am far from thinking that the men of this class are to have their real superiority of position, with its consequences, thrown into their faces only when they are expected to give, while they are grudgingly denied it on all other occasions! There is nothing so likely to advance the habits, opinions, and true interests of a rural population, as to have them all directed by the intelligence and combined interests that ought to mark the connection between landlord and tenant. It may do for one class of political economists to prate about a state of things which supposes every husbandman a freeholder, and rich enough to maintain his level among the other freeholders of the State. But we all know that as many minute gradations in means must and do exist in a community, as there exists gradations in characters. A majority soon will, in the nature of things, be below the level of the freeholder, and by destroying the system of having landlords and tenants, two great evils are created--the one preventing men of large fortunes from investing in lands, as no man will place his money where it will be insecure or profitless, thereby cutting off real estate generally from the benefits that might be and would be conferred by their capital, as well as cutting it off from the benefits of the increased price which arise from having such buyers in the market; and the other is, to prevent any man from being a husbandman who has not the money necessary to purchase a farm. But they who want farms now, and they who will want votes next November, do not look quite so far ahead as that, while shouting [...] "equal rights," [...] they are, in fact, for preventing the poor husbandman from being anything but a day-labourer.|$|E

Fred {{says that he has}} heard about the boy, but expresses disbelief that Cora has brought him along. “He’s my son.” Cora insists emphatically. Sgt. Hook accepts an invitation to stay for dinner, perhaps sensing trouble ahead. While the two are attending to a horse, Sgt. Hook attempts to reason with Fred, man-to-man, suggesting that Fred accept Quito as the son Cora and he were unable to have in 9 years of marriage. Fred warns him not to interfere. During an uncomfortable dinner, Fred points out that Cora has put Quito to sleep on a blanket on the floor instead of a bed, as an indication that Quito does not fit in. Cora encourages Fred to give it some time to see how he feels then. When Sgt. Hook goes to the stable to prepare for departure, Fred intensifies his attempts to convince Cora to send Quito off with Sgt. Hook. Cora insists that Quito belongs with her and she won’t give him up. Fred states that he is willing to “forgive” Cora and welcome her back, but he can’t be expected to accept Nanchez’s son and keep his sense of manhood. “FORGIVE ME?” Cora exclaims in amazement, what has she done, she asks, for which she has to be forgiven? Realizing that her husband will never accept her son, Cora rouses Quito and heads with him out to the stable to depart with Sgt. Hook. Fred comes out with a rifle to stop her, pointing the rifle at Sgt. Hook and affirming that Cora belongs to him, but that he and Quito can leave. Sgt. Hook asks Fred whether he intends to kill him and Quito to keep Cora. While Sgt. Hook and Fred are squaring off over the issue, Nanchez and his men appear menacingly over the horizon.|$|E

50|$|The railway {{operated}} like a toll road; independent hauliers {{were permitted}} to place wagons {{on the line and}} haul them with their own horses to the destination, paying the company a toll for the facility. The track used edge rails, in which the wagon wheels had flanges for guidance (as opposed to a plateway, where plain wheels run on the flat of an L-shaped plate) so that the wagons were specific to railway use, and the company <b>hired</b> <b>wagons</b> to the hauliers. Whishaw recorded that there were 270 wagons in use on the system, each weighing about 24 cwt (1200 kg); the horses in use belonged to the coal proprietors, not the railway itself.

Neither General Prentiss nor Colonel Marsh, who commanded at Jackson, knew their destination. I drew up all the instructions for the contemplated move, and kept them in my pocket until I should hear of the junction of our troops at Jackson. Two or three days after my arrival at Cape Girardeau, word came that General Prentiss was approaching that place (Jackson). I started at once to meet him there and to give him his orders. As I turned the first corner of a street after starting, I saw a column of cavalry passing the next {{street in front of}} me. I turned and rode around the block the other way, so as to meet the head of the column. I found there General Prentiss himself, with a large escort. He had halted his troops at Jackson for the night, and had come on himself to Cape Girardeau, leaving orders for his command to follow him in the morning. I gave the General his orders--which stopped him at Jackson--but he was very much aggrieved at being placed under another brigadier-general, particularly as he believed himself to be the senior. He had been a brigadier, in command at Cairo, while I was mustering officer at Springfield without any rank. But we were nominated at the same time for the United States service, and both our commissions bore date May 17th, 1861. By virtue of my former army rank I was, by law, the senior. General Prentiss failed to get orders to his troops to remain at Jackson, and the next morning early they were reported as approaching Cape Girardeau. I then ordered the General very peremptorily to countermarch his command and take it back to Jackson. He obeyed the order, but bade his command adieu when he got them to Jackson, and went to St. Louis and reported himself. This broke up the expedition. But little harm was done, as Jeff. Thompson moved light and had no fixed place for even nominal headquarters. He was as much at home in Arkansas as he was in Missouri and would keep {{out of the way of}} a superior force. Prentiss was sent to another part of the State.|$|R
