50|$|Grid dip {{oscillator}} (GDO), {{also called}} grid <b>dip</b> <b>meter,</b> <b>dip</b> <b>meter,</b> dipmeter, or just dipper, is a measuring instrument to measure resonant frequency of radio frequency circuits. It measures {{the amount of}} absorption of a high frequency inductively coupled magnetic field by nearby objects. It is an oscillator whose amplitude changes when near a resonant circuit which is tuned to the frequency the oscillator generates. At {{the heart of the}} instrument is a tunable LC circuit with a coil that serves as a loose inductive coupling to the measured LC resonant circuit. Resonance is indicated by a dip in the meter indicator on the device, usually based on a microammeter.|$|E

5000|$|An {{absorption}} wavemeter {{is a simple}} electronic instrument {{used to measure the}} frequency of radio waves. It is an older method of measuring frequency, widely used from the birth of radio in the early 20th century until the 1970s, when the development of inexpensive frequency counters, which have far greater accuracy, made it largely obsolete. A wavemeter consists of an adjustable resonant circuit calibrated in frequency, with a meter or other means to measure the voltage or current in the circuit. When adjusted to resonance with the unknown frequency, the resonant circuit absorbs energy, which is indicated by a <b>dip</b> on the <b>meter.</b> Then the frequency can be read from the dial.|$|R

To fulfil the demand of the groundwater sources, the water quality {{is one of the}} important factor that should be measure. The contaminated groundwater can cause adverse effect to humans. Domestic well water sample is collected from 15 well located at different locations covering the area of study area in Tanah Merah town. The well water samples is analyzed for their physico-chemical parameter. This physical parameter such as water level, temperature, pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Turbidity, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) is measured by using some intruments such as Multiparameter probe, Portable TSS probe, portable Turbidimeter and <b>dip</b> <b>meter.</b> The chemical parameter such as hardness, Calcium, Magnesium, Ferum, Potasssium,Sodium, Bicarbonates, Sulphate, Nitrate, Chloride, Silica, and Fluoride is measured in laboratory by using the Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), titration method and also gravimetric method. The hydrochemical facies of the well water at the study area is determined by using piper diagram. The result of the analysis is compared with the standardize value by World Health Organization (WHO) and Ministry of Health (MoH). Water Quality Index (WQI) is also applied to identify the overall water quality at Tanah Merah. From the analysis carried on these sample, 8 well out of 15 well is contaminated and the WQI result stated the overall well water is in poor quality status. From the piper diagram, the dominant group is bicarbonate-sodium-potassium. There is two types of rock at study area, which is sedimentary rock and volcanic igneous rock. The volcanic igneous rocks consist of andesite and tuff...|$|E
40|$|The Basal Unit of West Woodbourne Field in Barbados is a 250 m thick {{succession}} of finely-interbedded sandstones and mudstones deposited by Paleogene, fine-grained, deep-water systems off the northern South American margin and deformed as sediments were translated to the subduction {{zone of the}} Caribbean and Atlantic plates. Closely spaced gamma ray, neutron, density, spontaneous potential, formation microimager and <b>dip</b> <b>meter</b> logs, limited core, and published reports of local outcrops, were used to define three scales of vertical stratigraphic variation within this 1. 5 km 2 field: (1) decimeters to meters thick log facies; (2) meters to tens of meters thick log successions; and (3) tens to hundred meter thick intervals that are continuous laterally across the field. These variations record changes in sediment supply and depositional energy during progradation and abandonment events varying in scale from local shifts in distributary channels to regional changes in sediment transport along the basin. Well log correlations suggest the Basal Unit comprises a turbidite fan system (250 m thick) trending north to northeast, composed of six, vertically-stacked, distributary channel complexes. Three architectural elements are identified within each distributary channel complex: (1) Major amalgamated channels (30 - 40 m thick, 150 - 200 m wide and at least 900 m long) pass down depositional dip into proximal second-order channels that bifurcate basinward (15 - 20 m thick, symmetric successions); (2) Lobe deposits (20 - 50 m thick, 400 m wide, and at least 400 m long) are composed of upward-coarsening successions that contain distal second-order channels (1 - 10 m thick); and (3) Laterally extensive overbank deposits (5 - 10 m thick), which vertically separate distributary channel-lobe complexes. Reservoir heterogeneities within the Basal Unit are defined by the lateral extent and facies variations across a hierarchy of strata within channel-lobe complexes. Although laterally extensive muddy overbank deposits generally inhibit vertical communication between stacked channel-lobe complexes, in places where high-energy first-order channel sandstones incise underlying muddy overbank deposits, sandstones in subsequent intervals are partially connected. The Basal Unit is bounded on the southwest by a northwest-southeast trending fault that rises 30 degrees towards the northwest to define a structural trap on the northeast side of the field...|$|E
40|$|After a {{visit to}} Death Valley, the desert {{wanderer}} Edward Abbey wrote that "the first impression remains a just one. Despite variety, most of the surface of Death Valley is dead [...] . a land of jagged salt pillars, crackling and tortured crusts of mud, sunburnt gravel bars the color of rust, rocks and boulders of metallic blue naked even of lichen. " For the most part, that description is accurate. As one of the world's harshest desert regions, Death Valley is a land of eroding badlands, scorching alluvial fans, and barren flats of mud and salt. Even maps of the Death Valley region of California and Nevada allude to the region's sweltering temperatures. Furnace Creek, the Funeral Mountains, Dante's View, the Devil's Golf Course [...] the names of its geological features are omens of an extreme landscape. And, in those extremes, Death Valley delivers. Death Valley holds concurrent titles of being the lowest, driest and hottest location in North America. The valley's floor <b>dips</b> 86 <b>meters</b> below sea level and is the lowest location in the Western Hemisphere. In an average year, Death Valley receives only 5 centimeters of precipitation, and temperatures soar routinely above 49 degrees Celsius during summer.

40|$|The Ouray {{fault is}} one of the best exposed {{structures}} in southwestern Colorado. The fault has controlled geomorphic expression and drainage evolution around the town of Ouray. Although the fault has been described in publications for over half a century, no previous research documents strike-slip or curved slickenlines. There has been speculation regarding the timing of movement, and there has not been any detailed study of the faultâ€™s kinematics. This information is important for understanding the faultâ€™s history and the influences of faulting on other geologic events. 	In this investigation, a compatibility analysis was conducted from discretely analyzed data sets of normal and dextral slickenlines on the Ouray fault to test whether these features are linked by a common deformation source, or heterogeneous deformation. Orientation measurements of the fault surface and slickenlines provided data for stereographic paleostress analyses. 	The Ouray fault is defined by a N 70 W general strike, steep to vertical <b>dips,</b> 100 <b>meters</b> average stratigraphic separation, dominant two-mile trace bounding the northern basement extent, and splays on its east and west extents near contact with 28 - 26 Ma volcanic rocks. Quartz vein surfaces confine and reasonably constrain the strike-slip component to Cenozoic Laramide events or later (approximately 70 - 30 Ma). The compatibility analyses suggest these features are incompatible as indicated by the orientation discrepancy between compared normal and dextral P-T axes data sets. Discretely analyzed data sets yielded averaged shortening orientations of 48, 173 for normal, and 03, 144 for dextral slickenlines. It is hypothesized that incompatible principal stresses acted on the fault during the latest period of major displacement, changing the shortening and lengthening directions of the fault, and consequently slip sense. Strongly curved slickenlines documented at the fault further support interpretations of slip sense change and may also suggest a single event contributed to fault failure and reactivation. The analytical and field data in this research suggest during Cenozoic time, there was a temporal and spatial slip direction change to the Ouray fault that may have contributed to the faultâ€™s dextral slip component...|$|R
40|$|The Foam claim {{consisting}} of 10 units is located 10 kilometers south of Lillooet, B. C., and 4 kilometers {{west of the}} Fraser River, immediately west of the Spray 1 and 2 claims. The area is situated in the Coast Mountains with the best present access by helicopter from the Lillooet airport. The area is cut {{by one or more}} northwesterly trending major fault zones, which are parallel to or splays from the Fraser Fault zone, a major crustal fault, bordering the eastern margin of the Coast Range, alonq which occur numerous significant gold deposits, several porphyry molybdenum/copper deposits, and associated placer go 1 d deposits. On the Spray property, gold mineralization has been located in a quartz-sulphide vein and quartz-molybdenite stockwork zone that cuts quartz diorite and may extend into the underlying sediments. The gold bearing zone is outlined by molybdenum and arsenic geochemistry. Two drill holes in a 400 meter by 600 meter molybdenum anomaly intersected significant gold values. DDH CH 81 - 3 intersected 3 meters containing 2100 ppb gold and DDH CH 81 - 4 intersected 21 meters containing 3670 ppb gold with a maximum of 7860 ppb for a 3 meter sample. Further testing of the gold bearing stockwork is required alonq strike and down <b>dip.</b> A 400 <b>meter</b> diamond drilling program is planned for September 1986 to verify the extremely encouraging intercept of gold in DDH CH 81 - 4, to sample the mineralization in smaller increments and to do limited step-out holes adjacent to this previous intersection.

40|$|The Oak Ridge {{fault is}} located in the Ventura Basin, {{southern}} California, USA. It is a south-dipping reverse fault formed under the effect of Miocene extension, followed by Pliocene to middle Pleistocene compression, late Quaternary uplift and associated clockwise rotation of the western Transverse Ranges. In this thesis, the integration of well data, well image, subsurface maps, fault interpretation and public well correlations were used to interpret cross sections and build a 3 D structural model of the Oak Ridge fault in an area of about 500 km 2. The 3 D model contains 36 cross sections, 2 fault planes and 6 horizons. Based on the strike variation of the Oak Ridge fault, the model was subdivided into four segments: (1) NE-SW striking coastal segment with an eastwards increased dip angle up to 80 degrees, (2) NE-SW striking segment dipping 85 degrees, (3) ENE-WSW striking segment with an eastwards decreasing dip angle from 80 degrees to 60 degrees, and (4) N-E striking segment with an eastward increasing dip angle from 60 to 80 degrees. With the well tops and <b>dip</b> <b>meter</b> data control, in the region from coastal area to the Santa Paula city, horizon modeling was performed on both hanging wall and footwall block. However, in the area from Santa Paula city to the eastern end, the top Santa Barbara and top Pico surfaces were made in the footwall block, while only the top Sespe surface was made in the hanging wall. Unfaulted horizons show a monoclinal structure in the western area. To the east, the Oak Ridge fault offset all horizons. The hanging wall Sespe horizon expresses an anticlinal structure due to late Quaternary uplift deformation, while the footwall Pico and Santa Barbara horizons show a synclinal structure. Cross sections interpretation and final model show that the thickness of the Pliocene Pico and Pleistocene Santa Barbara strata decreases eastwards on the hanging wall but increases eastwards on the footwall from the coastal area to the Santa Paula city. Fault displacement analysis shows the displacement of Oak Ridge fault decreases westwards. The 3 D structural model built in this study can be used to improve the understanding of the large number of fields in the Ventura Basin, which its developments are linked to the Oak Ridge fault...|$|E
40|$|Re-evaluation of acoustic, {{gamma ray}} and <b>dip</b> <b>meter</b> logs from the Cominco American Federal No. 2 {{well in the}} Sevier Desert basin of west-central Utah sheds {{new light on the}} {{interpretation}} of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian stratigraphy and Mesozoic structure in a region that has been influential in the development of ideas about crustal shortening and extension. The most prominent of several major thrust faults (the Canyon Range and Pavant thrusts) have been interpreted by DeCelles and Coogan (2006) [Regional structure and kinematic history of the Sevier fold-and-thrust belt, central Utah: Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 118, n. 7 - 8, p. 841 - 864, [URL] as having been cut and in part re-activated between late Oligocene and Holocene time by as much as 47 km of displacement on the gently west-dipping Sevier Desert detachment. This interpretation, which is based upon a combination of outcrop, seismic reflection and well data, depends critically on the Canyon Range thrust intersecting the Cominco well at a depth of 2, 551 to 2, 557 m (8, 370 - 8, 389 ft.), and terminating downwards against a re-activated Pavant thrust. Our work suggests that the fault at 2, 551 m (8, 370 ft.) is a strand of the Pavant thrust, and that the Canyon Range thrust cuts the well at a depth of 1, 222 m (4, 010 ft.). This alternative interpretation depends in turn on identification of the section between the two faults as terminal Neoproterozoic to middle Cambrian Prospect Mountain Quartzite through Chisholm Formation rather than Neoproterozoic "Pocatello Formation," "Blackrock Canyon Limestone" and lower Caddy Canyon Quartzite. To support this interpretation we present evidence for stratigraphic repetition and for deformation at the 1, 222 m (4, 010 ft.) level. Use of the lithostratigraphic terms "Pocatello" and "Blackrock Canyon" in west-central Utah is shown to be inappropriate, and among the reasons that the critical interval in the Cominco well has been misinterpreted by some authors. If the Canyon Range and Pavant thrusts are both found in the Cominco well, as we suggest, then they cannot be used as a piercing point for the estimation of displacement on the Sevier Desert detachment or as justification for the existence of the detachment. Published estimates of extension across the Sevier Desert basin therefore need to be reduced, potentially to as little as âˆ¼ 10 km...|$|E
