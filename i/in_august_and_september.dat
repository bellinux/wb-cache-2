5|$|Chemetco had a {{long history}} of violations. For example, <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1992, while taking air {{emission}} readings, Chemetco was caught using semi-articulated trucks and water sprinklers as a buffer in front of the air emission monitors. This was in contravention of the Clean Air Act, 42.|$|E
5|$|In the {{earliest}} published {{accounts of the}} killings, <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1950, two North Korean journalists with the advancing northern troops reported finding an estimated 400 bodies in the No Gun Ri area, and seeing some 200 bodies in one tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Coinage of eagles {{followed}} {{shortly after}} production of half eagles began, although the exact date is uncertain. The first group produced {{is believed to}} have been struck <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1795; 1,097 eagles were made available for circulation on September 22. Four hundred of these were immediately paid out to the Bank of Pennsylvania, which had deposited gold at the Mint for striking into eagles. One piece was put aside for the Mint's coin collection by Eckfeldt.|$|E

5|$|Comet {{was built}} by the AG Vulcan {{shipyard}} in Stettin. She was laid down in 1890 and launched on 15 January 1892. After the completion of fitting-out work, she was transferred to Kiel, where she was commissioned for sea trials. Comet was commissioned into the German fleet on 29 April 1893. That summer, she served in the newly formed III Division of the Maneuver Fleet for the annual maneuvers <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Elsass {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise during the summer, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September.</b> The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. For Elsass, her career began with squadron training in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in May, followed by the summer cruise in July and August. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. Further maneuvers in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September.</b> KzS Reinhard Scheer replaced Bachmann in October 1907. The winter cruise that year went to the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|Gallaher's unit {{fought in}} the Battle of Messines, near La Basse Ville, and <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1917 they trained for the {{upcoming}} Passchendaele offensive. In the attack on Gravenstafel Spur on 4October 1917 Gallaher was wounded by a piece of shrapnel that penetrated through his helmet, and he died later that day at the 3rd Australian Casualty Clearing Station, Gravenstafel Spur. He was 43 years old.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September,</b> the VRS {{launched}} several {{attacks against}} the Bosanski Brod bridgehead for little gain. In mid-September, the HVO and the ARBiH deployed near Brčko, further to the east, attacked the same east–west road the VRS aimed to secure through Operation Corridor 92. The counterattack managed to capture {{a section of the}} road south of Orašje, at the eastern end of the Brčko corridor. However, the VRS restored its control of the road quickly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Incubation lasts 72–80days in {{the wild}} and for a similar period in {{artificial}} conditions. <b>In</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September,</b> the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the egg tooth. Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the nest and overwinter to emerge the following spring.|$|E
5|$|Moult {{is poorly}} recorded, the only records coming from Sakhalin and Himachal Pradesh. In Sakhalin, moult occurs <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September,</b> between the {{breeding}} season and migration. In Himachal Pradesh, aviculturalist G. A. Perreau observed captive and wild birds {{and reported that}} they were yellow from December to spring and whitish during the remainder of the year, a pattern which may be atypical.|$|E

The action takes place in London, Tokyo, and Moscow as Cayce judges {{the effectiveness of a}} proposed corporate symbol and is hired to seek the creators of film clips anonymously posted to the internet.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Division was {{assembled}} <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1917 at Camp Mills, New York, {{where its}} training emphasized open-field combat rather than trench warfare. It sailed in a convoy from Hoboken, New Jersey, for France on 18 October 1917. On 19 December, Mann was replaced as division commander by Major General Charles T. Menoher.|$|E
5|$|The Venetians {{fought for}} decades before they {{finally managed to}} re-take Klis. During the Candian War (1645–1669), the Venetians in Dalmatia enjoyed {{the support of the}} local population, {{particularly}} the Morlachs (Morlacchi). Venetian commander Leonardo Foscolo seized several forts, retook Novigrad, temporarily captured the Knin Fortress, and managed to compel the garrison of Klis Fortress to surrender. At the same time, a month-long siege of the Šibenik Fortress by the Ottomans <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> failed.|$|E

5|$|The {{final two}} weeks of the {{earthquake}} swarm were observed by a quick response cruise launched in August 1996. The National Science Foundation funded an expedition by University of Hawaiʻi scientists, led by Frederick Duennebier, that began investigating the swarm and its origin in August 1996. The scientists' assessment laid the groundwork for many of the expeditions that followed. Follow-up expeditions to Lōʻihi took place, including a series of manned-submersible dives <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{variant of}} the Panzer IV was the Panzerbefehlswagen IV (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV) command tank. This {{conversion}} entailed the installation of additional radio sets, mounting racks, transformers, junction boxes, wiring, antennas and an auxiliary electrical generator. To {{make room for the}} new equipment, ammunition stowage was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armor, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen Panzerbefehlswagen were built on Ausf. J chassis <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished chassis.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Devers took command, the Armored Force had two {{operational}} armored divisions: the 1st Armored Division at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Knox, and one independent tank battalion, the 70th Tank Battalion at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Both divisions {{participated in the}} large-scale war games of the Louisiana Maneuvers <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1941, and the Carolina Maneuvers in November 1941. Despite some successes, the maneuvers revealed armored unit and equipment operational deficiencies, plus {{a general lack of}} combat readiness. Devers attributed much of the poor performance to poorly-trained junior and staff officers, but also saw doctrinal deficiencies that hampered the coordination of tanks, infantry and artillery.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Jeanne was one {{of three}} November hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico; it was the first {{tropical}} cyclone to attain hurricane strength in the Gulf of Mexico during November. The late season storm surprised maritime interests, and two barges broke free from towing vessels. Indirectly, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation that peaked at 23.28inches (591mm) in Key West. Minor beach erosion occurred along the Texas coast, where tides were two to four feet above normal; coastal flooding affected the state, which was heavily impacted by tropical cyclones <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September.</b> Jeanne caused no deaths.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps have a {{complete}} moult in their breeding areas <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> prior to migration. Some birds, typically those migrating the greatest distances, have a further partial moult between December and March. Juveniles replace their loosely structured body feathers with adult plumage, starting earlier, but taking longer to complete, than the adults. Blackcaps breeding {{in the north of}} the range have an earlier and shorter post-juvenile moult than those further south, and cross-breeding of captive birds shows that the timing is genetically controlled.|$|E
5|$|Books {{and audio}} dramas {{have also been}} made. Phantasia {{received}} multiple CD dramas, including four collected into anthologies in January and March 2000. and a stand-alone drama in December 2001. Symphonia received seven audio dramas following the game's plot. Two CD dramas for Legendia were respectively released <b>in</b> <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 2005. A manga of Phantasia was written and serialized in 2008 and 2009, while Abyss received three manga adaptations {{in the years after}} its release. Symphonia was adapted in both novelizations and a manga serial. Others to receive adaptations of these kinds are Destiny, Graces and Xillia.|$|E
