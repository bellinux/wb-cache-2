40|$|Abstract — Fully {{autonomous}} robots {{will often}} need to open doors and traverse doorways {{in order to}} freely operate within human environments, and assistive robots that open doors on command would potentially benefit the motor impaired. In spite of these opportunities, autonomous manipulation of doors remains a challenging problem {{after more than a}} decade of research. Until recently, published research has focused on one or two aspects of door opening, and included results from only a small number of tests on a single door. Within this paper we present a set of behaviors that enable a mobile manipulator to reliably open a variety of doors and traverse doorways using force-sensing fingers and a laser range finder. With this system, a user only needs to briefly illuminate a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> using a green laser pointer, after which the robot autonomously locates the <b>door</b> <b>handle,</b> finds the manipulable end of the <b>door</b> <b>handle,</b> twists the <b>door</b> <b>handle,</b> and pushes the door open while traversing the doorway. The behaviors use sensory feedback to continuously monitor task-relevant aspects of the world and respond to common forms of variation in the task, such as whether the door is locked or unlocked, is blocked or unblocked, opens to the right or left, or has a handle that twists down clockwise or counterclockwise. We tested the robot in 30 trials with 6 different doors from an initial position over 1. 6 meters away from the <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> <b>For</b> the 24 trials with unlocked doors, the robot succeeded at the entire task in 21 trials (87. 5 % success rate). In the 6 trials with locked doors, the robot successfully detected that the door was locked in all 6 trials (100. 0 % success rate). For all 30 trials, the robot stopped in a safe manner without requiring human intervention after detecting failure or success at the task. We conclude with a discussion of how this work relates to several broader issues for intelligent manipulation within human environments, including the use of 3 D locations to select behaviors, the generality of serialized sub-tasks, task-relevant features, active perception, force sensing, and methods for scaling systems to handle more tasks of greater complexity...|$|R

Method: To solve the problem, a device for opening the door {{with the help of a}} foot pedal was built into the door leaf. Results: The design enables mechanical opening of the door with a foot pedal without manual operation. Subsequently, the door closes with the help of a mechanical locking mechanism. Discussion: The foot-operated door opener constitutes an additional option to the <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> Together with the equipment of a soft closing mechanism, it is possible to prevent noise emanating from the door latch impinging on the door frame. Using this construction, the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> as a transmission vector is eliminated. In addition, the transport of goods held with two hands simultaneously is facilitated. Conclusion: With a foot-operated door opener instead of the traditional manual <b>door</b> <b>handle,</b> it is possible to open doors with a foot pedal.

The work focuses on the redesign of a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> assembly <b>for</b> the Jaguar XJ Saloon. The original 11 -piece assembly, comprising eight different materials, was subject to a redesign with an RM technology in mind as the method for final manufacture. In this case the suggested method for manufacture was selective laser sintering (SLS). The design freedoms afforded by the SLS process {{had a profound effect on}} the potential to redesign the product. Two different redesigns were proposed, and these, along with the original design, were subjected to analyses of environmental burden and financial profits/costs for end-of-life recycling and reuse using Boothroyd Dewhurst DFE software. The first redesign incorporated the entire assembly as a single prefabricated unit and consequently rendered a DFE analysis impossible. The second redesign was a four-piece assembly retaining three metallic components from the original product and, when subjected to the DFE analysis, showed a significant reduction in environmental burden and cost for disassembly. The surface finish of the SLS parts proved to be inadequate for visual components on a luxury car, but the potential to apply RM for applications with less stringent aesthetic requirements remains...|$|R
