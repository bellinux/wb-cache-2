40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the opportunities for}} an empirically grounded decision support system as an instrument for independent and scientifically based <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> consulting. To date, <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> {{is dominated by the}} information paradigm and the leitbild of the rational, sovereign and information-seeking consumer. Yet, both everyday practice and research in behavioural economics show that this view lacks empirical ground. In fact, there are different consumer types and different forms of rationalities at work. Effective <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> making should be based on the empirically revealed behaviour of consumers, not on an ideal model. Moreover, it is often not clear how much <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> measures actually contribute to the consumer interest, and whether there would be more effective and efficient policy instruments to strengthen the consumer position. The authors suggest introducing an empirically based "Check <b>Consumer</b> <b>Policy</b> and <b>Consumer</b> Participation" as a systematic decision and evaluation tool for policy makers. This check should be independent from the government and should be grounded on an empirical view of the <b>consumer.</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>policy</b> tools should be tested with real consumers. The authors suggest an independent national "Expert Council for Consumer Policy" as an ideal candidate to supervise this work...|$|R

40|$|This article {{traces the}} trajectories of <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> in Finland and Germany {{in the light}} of a {{comparative}} history in order to reflect upon the notion of consumer empowerment in public policy. The principle developments of contemporary <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> {{can be traced back to}} the post-war political and economic integrations arising from the initial idea of free markets and individual freedom emphasized in classical liberalism. The article explores this development in Finland and Germany to the point of the establishment of a joint European Union (EU) <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> to reveal the notion of consumer empowerment. This approach creates an understanding of the peculiarities of <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> in EU member states despite the presence of a joint European policy area. Nowadays, both Finnish and German consumers find EU regulations excessive. It is important to acknowledge the influence of this historic development in order to understand what consumer empowerment meant in the past and thus to further develop policy action on a joint level...|$|R

40|$|With {{interest}} in <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> growing recently, need has arisen for interdisciplinary {{study of the}} existing literature in this area. This paper presents information for Japanese <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> discussions. It includes a survey of analyses, policy documents, and comments by consumer groups and businesses related to <b>policies</b> for preventing <b>consumer</b> fraud and promoting product safety. Among the information, I present literature and documents that support a notion that one cause of consumer problems is that "market norms have been weakening. " I also show that among market norms there are "norms enforced by the state," "norms abided by {{as a result of}} socioeconomic pressure," and "norms abided by as a result of conscience," and I abstract some common items from a variety of literature with regard to methods of constructing market norms. I show that <b>consumer</b> <b>policies</b> are not limited to those enforced by the state. I also present examples of <b>consumer</b> <b>policies</b> that affect socioeconomic pressure and the conscience of individual players in the market. In this way I argue that <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> should not be considered from the viewpoint of assuming a general confrontation structure between consumers and firms, and then determining on whose side the government stands. I suggest that it be considered from the standpoint of securing overall socioeconomic development and stability by consumers, firms, and the government all playing roles in building and maintaining market norms. ...|$|R

40|$|Students of {{comparative}} politics have highlighted {{different styles of}} regulation in the U. S. and Europe. These differences also apply to <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> and its different models of governance. The paper holds that governance is a key variable but adds aspects of issue framing. Two examples of <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> are analysed: regulation of genetically modified organisms and tobacco control. The case studies show that features of governance such as adversarial legalism or the precautionary principle are not necessarily linked to distinctive styles of regulation. Instead they vary across policy fields. Only a mix of governance elements and framing opportunities for interest groups can explain output and new directions of <b>consumer</b> <b>policy.</b> Dilemmas of collective action appear to be shrinking for consumers because framing trumps mobilization of members.

40|$|<b>Consumer</b> <b>policy</b> {{approaches}} regarding green {{products and}} solutions can be differentiated by their main focus. “Green positioning” is basically targeted at environmentally aware consumers, while “efficiency-focused positioning” {{concentrates on the}} efficiency gain of the product or solution, targeting the whole society, regardless of consumers' environmental awareness. The paper argues that the scope and total environmental benefit can be increased if green products or solutions are promoted in different ways, not only as “green” but also based on other arguments (like cost-efficiency, return on investment, etc.). The paper suggests a model for improving the efficiency of greenhouse gas (GHG) -related <b>consumer</b> <b>policy.</b> Based on the marginal social cost curve and the marginal private cost curve, different (green, yellow, and red) zones of action are identified. GHG mitigation options chosen from those zones are then evaluated {{with the help of}} profiling method, addressing the barriers to implementation. Profiling may help design an implementation strategy for the selected options and make <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> more effective and acceptable for mass market. Case study results show three different ways of positioning of GHG-related <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> in Hungary from 2000 and give practical examples of profiling, based on the latest marginal social cost curve and the contemporary energy saving policy of the state regarding the residential sector...|$|R
40|$|<b>Consumer</b> <b>policy</b> {{increasingly}} places {{emphasis on}} the role of information in allowing consumers to protect themselves and promoting a competitive economy. Increasing the information available to consumers is undoubtedly beneficial, but this article cautions that the limitations of consumer protection though information also have to be recognized. In particular, emphasis is placed on the insights provided by behavioural economics which suggests that consumers may not always respond to information provided as rationally as traditional economic models sometimes assume. One implication of this is that the way information rules are framed needs to be revisited. Other <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> approaches (altering the default rules, using bans and regulations, and risk sharing) need to be considered alongside a strategy of information provision. To analyse which approach should be adopted or to find the appropriate balance between different approaches requires policy makers to engage more fully with the legal and <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> research community...|$|R

40|$|<b>Consumer</b> <b>policy</b> has {{developed}} over recent years into a central {{field of action}} in the European Union.

Only then do European companies get incentives from their customers as well. These {{contribute to the development}} of successful products. The aim of an efficient European <b>consumer</b> <b>policy</b> must therefore be to balance the interests of consumers and companies appropriately i. e. on the one hand, consumers have and should be able to rely on a certain protection throughout Europe, and on the other hand, this protection should not become an unacceptable burden for companies which makes it difficult for SMEs to withstand European competition.
