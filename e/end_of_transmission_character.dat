50|$|A {{transmission}} {{block is}} usually terminated by an End Of Block character (EOB), End Transmission Block character (ETB), End Of Text character (ETX), or <b>End</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Transmission</b> <b>character</b> (EOT).|$|E
50|$|When a {{transmission}} medium is half duplex (that is, it can transmit {{in only one}} direction at a time), there is usually a master station that can transmit at any time, and one or more slave stations that transmit when they have permission. The enquire character (ENQ) is generally used by a master station to ask a slave station to send its next message. A slave station indicates that it has completed its transmission by sending the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>character</b> (EOT).|$|E
50|$|The {{start of}} heading (SOH) {{character}} was to mark a non-data section of a data stream—the part of a stream containing addresses and other housekeeping data. The start of text character (STX) marked the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the header, {{and the start of}} the textual part of a stream. The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> text character (ETX) marked the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the data of a message. A widely used convention is to make the two characters preceding ETX a checksum or CRC for error-detection purposes. The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> block <b>character</b> (ETB) was used to indicate the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a block of data, where data was divided into such blocks for transmission purposes.|$|R

5000|$|In electronics, {{electrical}} termination is the practice <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> a <b>transmission</b> {{line with a}} device that matches the characteristic impedance of the line. This is intended to prevent signals from reflecting off the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transmission</b> line. Reflections at the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> unterminated <b>transmission</b> lines cause distortion which can produce ambiguous digital signal levels and mis-operation of digital systems. Reflections in analog signal systems cause such effects as video ghosting, or power loss in radio transmitter transmission lines.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Power {{flow control}} {{in a long}} {{transmission}} line plays {{a vital role in}} electrical power system. This paper uses the shunt connected STATCOM for the control of voltage and power flow. The proposed device is used in different locations such as sending end, middle and receiving <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transmission</b> line. The PWM control is used to generate the firing pulses of the controller circuit. Simulation modeling of the system is carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Based on a voltage-source converter, the STATCOM regulates system voltage by absorbing or generating reactive power. This paper deals with a cascaded multilevel converter model, which is a 48 -pulse (three levels) GTO converter. The simulation studies are carried for sending end, middle and receiving <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transmission</b> line. The objective is to define the reactive power generated and voltage control at different locations (at sending end, middle, receiving <b>end)</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> line using STATCOM...|$|R
