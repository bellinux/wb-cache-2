Utilizing a splitmouth design. 11 dental hygienists evaluated disposable prophylaxis angles while completing a routine oral prophylaxis. Fifty samples each of Brahler. Ash/Dentsply, Denticator. and Young Dental angles were compared to a control angle (Teledyne Getz). A questionnaire was completed by each operator following patient treatment (a total of 161 patients was treated). The questionnaire asked questions in which the four brands were compared to the Teledyne Getz disposable prophylaxis angle. followed by questions regarding individual performance characteristics of each brand of disposable prophylaxis angle. The comparative questions were analyzed utilizing a two-tailed z-test. and the individual performance characteristic questions were analyzed with a confidence interval. The results revealed that when the four brands of disposable prophylaxis angles were compared to the Teledyne Getz brand. the Teledyne Getz disposable prophylaxis angle performed better than the Brahler, Ash/Dentsply. and Denticator brands. However. the Young Dental disposable prophylaxis angle performed better than the Teledyne Getz brand. The results of the evaluation of the independent performance characteristics revealed that the Young Dental disposable prophylaxis angle performed more reliably than the other brands. while the Teledyne Getz disposable prophylaxis angle produced significantly less vibration than all of the other brands of disposable prophylaxis angles...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Emergence of {{antimicrobial}} resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{has led to}} the search for alternative agents for <b>infections</b> <b>control.</b> Natural <b>products</b> have been a good alternative to present antibiotics. The present study was undertaken {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} cranberry in attenuation of virulence of P. aeruginosa in experimental urinary tract infection (UTI) in mouse model. Efforts were also directed to explore the action of cranberry towards virulence of P. aeruginosa through quorum sensing (QS) inhibition. Methods: Efficacy of cranberry was evaluated in an experimental UTI mouse model and on production of QS signals, alginate, pyochelin, haemolysin, phospholipase-C, cell-surface hydrophobicity, uroepithelial cell-adhesion assay and biofilm formation by already standardized methods. Results: Presence of cranberry showed significant decline in the production of QS signals, biofilm formation and virulence factors of P. aeruginosa in vitro (P< 0. 001). Further, cranberry was found to be useful in prevention of experimental UTI in mouse model as indicated by reduced renal bacterial colonization and kidney tissues destruction. Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of the present study indicated that cranberry inhibited QS and hence elaboration of virulence factors of P. aeruginosa. It also affected the adherence ability of this pathogen. This approach can lead to the discovery of new category of safe anti-bacterial drugs from dietary sources such as cranberry with reduced toxicity without the risk of antibiotic resistance...|$|R

Methods We performed a qualitative study to examine facilitators and barriers to <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> at an 800 -bed, private, tertiary hospital in Manila, Philippines.

Methods audit of <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> service was conducted annually over a 10 -day period in six community hospitals with bed capacities ranging from 140 to 557 beds. Data were collected on standardized checklists on various <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> service items during surprise visits to the medical, pediatric, surgical, and critical care units, and the kitchens. Percentage scores were calculated for audited items. The results of the audit for hospitals were confidentially sent to them within four weeks after the end of Hajj.

During January-May 2000 a questionnaire about <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> {{was sent to the}} hospital health director of all Italian National Health System hospitals treating acute patients and with more than 3500 admissions in 1999. An active programme was defined as a hospital <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> committee (HICC) meeting at least four times in 1999, the presence of a doctor with <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> responsibilities, a nurse employed in <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> and at least one surveillance activity and one <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> guideline issued or updated in the past two years. There was a response rate of 87. 5 % (463 / 529). Almost fifteen percent (69 / 463) of hospitals had an active programme for <b>Infection</b> <b>Control</b> and 76. 2 % (353 / 463) had a HICC. Seventy-one percent (330 / 463) of the hospitals had a hospital <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> physician and 53 % (250 / 463) had <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> nurses. Fifty-two percent (242 / 463) reported at least one surveillance activity and 70. 8 % (328 / 463) had issued or updated at least one guidance document in the last two years. The presence of regional policies [odds ratio (OR) 8. 7], operative groups (OR 4. 2), at least one full-time nurse (OR 4. 6) and a hospital annual plan which specified <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> (OR 2. 1) were statistically associated with an active programme in the multivariate analysis.

40|$|ABSTRACTHospital <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> is an {{essential}} part of infectious disease management and must be firmly structured and professionally organised. Prevention, limitation and eradication of nosocomial infections requires specific expertise not fully provided by clinical microbiologists and/or infectious disease consultants. Therefore, dedicated <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> physicians and nurses are essential. The basic components for successful hospital <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> include: (1) personnel and supporting resources proportional to size, complexity and estimated risk of the population served; (2) trained hospital <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> practitioners; and (3) the necessary structure to implement changes in medical, nursing and logistical organisation. The identification of areas of concern, provision of written policies and education still constitute the backbone of <b>infection</b> <b>control.</b> The <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> team must propose priorities and necessary resources, objectives, development methods, implementation and follow-up. The strategic approach must be discussed and approved by the <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> committee, comprising the hospital administrator(s), medical and nursing directors, a microbiologist, a hospital pharmacist and a delegation of clinicians. Follow-up of the projects is regularly presented to the committee by the <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> team. To what extent may evolution in the organisation of hospital <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> contribute to the optimisation of allocated resources and fulfilment of these objectives? From the Belgian experience, we conclude that structural changes represent {{an essential}} incentive. The impact of changes is greater when they are directed by the national authorities, providing resources and imposing new standards. Recommendations for staffing must consider not only the number of beds but also the objectives, complexity and characteristics of the patient population...|$|R
