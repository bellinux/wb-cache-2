5000|$|George is {{the main}} character. He is in his 30’s and in his “real life” is married to Joyce. George is a stock broker and is {{brilliant}} at math. He discovered {{at a young age}} about alternate lives that he could live when he was young doing a math problem, or so he says. In reality all of this is constructed inside George’s brain and never really takes place {{as far as we can}} tell. George is the Protagonist of the play although some of his actions throughout the play pose as blocks to what he wants. What he wants is to be loved by Joyce and be in a relationship with Joyce in every world that he encounters. George is also a semi-static character as far as the worlds go. George is always George while other characters appear in way that they would not in the real world. George stays the same through the play so that the viewer can connect with him and feel bad for him at the end. He is the only main “human” character because of how he does not really change from one world to the next. Joyce is George’s real life wife. In every world he pursues her. Sometimes he is successful and sometimes not. Joyce is a scientist on some worlds, a stock broker in others and in one entirely different construct she is Jocelyn, the teacher of a meditation type class focused at increasing intelligence through imagination. Joyce is one of the main antagonists of the play in most worlds. Especially in the world where she has a boyfriend because George can not reach his goal at all in the world. Joyce is also an agent of action because without her decisions George could not further pursue his goals or change his tactics to pursue new goals. [...] Berkely and Williams are detectives and they are in the real world. They are the voice of Justice and the morals in the world. They are pitted against the scientist and they tend to show that they feel bad for the brains being kept alive by Pensfield. They question Pensfield right to experiment on the brains while searching for the murderer of their case who turns out to be Pensfield. [...] Pensfield is the neurologist who is killing people and stealing their brains. In this plot line, which includes Berkely and Williams he is not only the antagonist but the bad guy. Pensfield shows up throughout the play as the Guide, the Scientist and the Doctor. Pensfield causes discomfort in the characters and the viewer and forces them to think about questions in morality, especially concerning science and man. The question that immediately jumps out is, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>ok</b> to kill in the name of scientific advancement? The man is the caretaker of George’s building. He goes to the detectives with a story of seeing UFO lights the night that George was killed. They don’t believe him of course even when he says that “they” are going to kill him. Later the man shows up dead, frozen to death at room temperature which makes the detectives question what they are dealing with in these cases.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was heard}} from White that {{administering}} propofol without careful bedside monitoring could be dangerous. [...] "Do you agree there were instances where Dr. Murray deviated from {{standard of care}} on June 25, 2009?" [...] "Yes". Walgren asked [...] "have you ever administered propofol in someone's bedroom?" [...] "No". [...] "Have you heard anyone else doing it?" [...] "No." [...] Dr. White agrees Dr. Murray deviated from the 'standard of care' of Jackson but doesn't know to what degree. [...] "Do you disagree with Dr. Shafer's opinion that failure to keep medical records 'egregious and unconscionable' deviation?" [...] White doesn't know what the words egregious and unconscionable mean in this case. [...] "Would you administer propofol to a patient without proper airway-opening equipment?" [...] "I would certainly have means for ventilation, means of ventilation could be an ambu bag and a mask, not necessarily other respiratory equipment". It was heard that Dr. White has received $11,000 so far for his testimony in this case. He usually charges $3,500 per day and any expenses such as airfares. He doesn't think the defense have this much so will not bill them that much. Dr. Safer testified for many days, and performed numerous simulations for both the prosecution and defense for free. [...] "Was Dr. Murray offered money to provide Jackson's propofol?" [...] "It is my understanding that Dr. Murray was offered money to be Jackson's personal doctor." [...] Walgren then asked [...] "If you injected 25 mg propofol, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>ok</b> {{to walk out of}} the room?" [...] "25 mg only lasts 15-30 minutes, after that I see no problem in leaving the patient's bedside." [...] "If the patient liked to 'push' propofol themselves, would you walk out of room?" [...] "No." [...] Upon being asked about Murray's actions after he found Jackson, Dr. White said [...] "I would have done things differently. I would have called for help, called 911 and initiated CPR." [...] When being asked about Murray's delay to call 911 he stated [...] "I would have called 911 earlier but do not believe it would have made any difference in this case." [...] "3-5 minutes after finding him I would call 911." [...] It was heard that [...] "forgetting to mention propofol was a detail overlooked, could also be a lie?" [...] "Yes." [...] After Dr. White mentioned he believed that Jackson had his own stash of propofol, Walgren asked the judge to admonish witness to respond the question only. Judge asked jurors to leave the courtroom. Walgren asked [...] "Do you reject that Jackson drank propofol and that caused his death?" [...] "Yes. I speculated that oral administration may have played a role. I don't reject completely the self-administration theory. The evidence suggests that Jackson did not drink propofol". Flanagan then asked Dr. White: [...] "If patient died on noon, would it matter if help came 5 minutes later?" [...] "Unlikely." [...] Dr. White continued and added, [...] "Propofol does not have a reversal treatment, only treatment for propofol overdose is time." ...|$|E
