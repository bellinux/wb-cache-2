After several years, Thomas decided that he had little interest in making a career as a performing musician. In a 1998 interview, he stated [...] "I realized that being in a band you were dependent on all these other people, and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if I'd ever been successful in a band, I would've wanted to stay in the studio and just make the records; I wasn't that interested in playing live." ...|$|E
2500|$|One element Gerson Saines {{was sure}} about from the {{beginning}} was {{that she wanted to}} work with HBO, in part because of her longstanding relationship with the network through her work as an agent. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> by going that route, more people will see it," [...] she said. [...] "When you're trying to make a movie like this, it's very rare that it reaches a wide audience." [...] HBO was equally intrigued by the story, and Gerson Saines credits past and present HBO executives with keeping the project alive until it could be properly realized. [...] "I made a commitment to Temple that I {{was going to make it}} and make it right...I never pushed to get it made until now, because now we got it right." ...|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, I am {{thankful to}} say that my powers of {{judgment}} and of action did not forsake me. I knew that it would be folly to attempt to follow my track back again through the intricacies of the forest in so dark a night, especially now that the track was partly mingled and confused with that which I had made in joining it. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> to give way to despair, and lie down without a fire or food, would be to seal my own doom.

60|$|As the {{circumstances}} of the murder, gradually unravelling, took stronger and stronger possession of the public mind, I kept them away from mine by knowing as little about them as was possible {{in the midst of the}} universal excitement.

60|$|I {{seemed to}} believe the boy, I didn't know why. Something in me seemed to believe him--my consciousness, as you may say; but my reason didn't. My reason {{straightway}} began to clamor; that was natural. I didn't know {{how to go about}} satisfying it, because I knew that the testimony of men wouldn't serve--my reason would say they were lunatics, and throw out their evidence. But all of a sudden I stumbled on the very thing, just by luck. I knew that the only total eclipse of the sun {{in the first half of}} the sixth century occurred on the 21st of June, A.D. 528, O.S., and began at 3 minutes after 12 noon. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> no total eclipse of the sun was due in what to me was the present year--i.e., 1879. So, if I could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart out of me for forty-eight hours, I should then find out for certain whether this boy was telling me the truth or not.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{acquaintance}} was made, oddly enough, {{with him}} twenty-seven years ago. A pauper {{said to me}} of him, [...] "He's the poor man's doctor." [...] Such a recommendation seemed to me a good one: and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> his organizing head had formed the first district society in England (for Mrs. Fry told me {{she could not have}} effected it without his aid); yet he has always ignored his own share of it. I felt in him at once the curious combination of the Christian and the cynic,--of reverence for man, and contempt of men. It was then an internal war, but one in which it was evident to me that the holier cause would be victorious, because there was deep belief, and, as far as I could learn, a blameless and benevolent life. He appeared only to want sunshine. It was a plant which could not be brought to perfection in darkness. He had begun life by the most painful conflict between filial duty and conscience,--a large provision in the church secured for him by his father; but he could not sign. There was discredit, as you know, attached to such scruples.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Merrill {{wiping his}} brow, for {{he found the}} matter even more difficult than he had imagined, [...] "it was not until Duncan told me how you had acted in his library that I guessed the truth--that I remembered myself how you had acted. I knew {{that you were not}} mixed up in politics, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> you were an intimate friend of Jethro's, and I thought that you had been let into the secret of the woodchuck session. I don't defend the game of politics as it is played, Mr. Wetherell, but all of us who are friends of Jethro's are generally willing to lend a hand in any little manoeuvre that is going on, and have a practical joke when we can. It was not until I saw you sitting there beside Duncan that the idea occurred to me. It didn't make a great deal of difference whether Duncan or Lovejoy got to the House or not, provided they didn't learn of the matter too early, because some of their men had been bought off that day. It suited Jethro's sense of humor to play the game that way--and it was very effective. When I saw you there beside Duncan I remembered that he had spoken about the Guardian letters, and the notion occurred to me to get him to show you his library. I have explained to him that you were innocent. I--I hope you haven't been worrying." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{became aware}} of this a few days later, by the {{appearance}} on my desk of a small pot containing a specimen of camellia japonica in flower. I knew the school-children were {{in the habit of}} making presents to me in this furtive fashion,--leaving their own nosegays of wild flowers, or perhaps a cluster of roses from their parents' gardens,--but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> this exotic was too rare to come from them. I remembered that See Yup had a Chinese taste for gardening, and a friend, another Chinaman, who kept a large nursery in the adjoining town. But my doubts were set at rest by the discovery of a small roll of red rice-paper containing my washing-bill, fastened to the camellia stalk. It was plain that this mingling of business and delicate gratitude was clearly See Yup's own idea. As the finest flower was the topmost one, I plucked it for wearing, when I found, to my astonishment, that it was simply wired to the stalk. This led me to look at the others, which I found also wired! More than that, they seemed to be an inferior flower, and exhaled that cold, earthy odor peculiar to the camellia, even, as I thought, to an excess. A closer examination resulted in the discovery that, {{with the exception of the}} first flower I had plucked, they were one and all ingeniously constructed of thin slices of potato, marvelously cut to imitate the vegetable waxiness and formality of the real flower. The work showed an infinite and almost pathetic patience in detail, yet strangely incommensurate with the result, admirable as it was. Nevertheless, this was also like See Yup. But whether he had tried to deceive me, or whether he only wished me to admire his skill, I could not say. And as his persecution by my scholars had left a balance of consideration in his favor, I sent him a warm note of thanks, and said nothing of my discovery.|$|E
6000|$|The liberals were, to all appearance, {{pledged to}} the {{reconstruction}} [...] {{of the tax}} by their opinions, and the tories by their party [...] following. The small fraction of Peelites could probably be relied [...] upon the other way, and some few individuals with financial [...] knowledge and experience. The mission {{of the new government}} was [...] described by Lord Aberdeen in the House of Lords as a financial [...] mission, and the stress of it thus lay upon a person, very [...] ill-prepared. My opinions were with Peel; but under such [...] circumstances it was my duty to make a close and searching [...] investigation into the whole nature of the tax, and make up my mind [...] whether there was any means of accepting or compounding with the [...] existing state of opinion. I went to work, and laboured very hard. [...] When I had entered gravely upon my financial studies, I one day had [...] occasion--I know not what--to go into the city and to call upon [...] Mr. Samuel Gurney, to whom experience and character had given a [...] high position there. He asked me with interest about my [...] preparations for my budget; and he said, 'One thing I will venture [...] to urge, whatever your plan is,--let it be simple.' I was a man [...] much disposed to defer to authority, and I attached weight to this [...] advice. But as I went further and further into my subject, I became [...] more and more convinced that, as an honest steward, I had no option [...] but to propose the renewal of the tax in its uniform shape. I [...] constructed much elaborate argument in support of my proposition, [...] which I knew {{it would be difficult to}} answer. But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> [...] no amount of unassisted argument would suffice to overcome the [...] obstacles in my way, and that this could only be done by large [...] compensations in my accompanying propositions.

6000|$|A {{walk on the}} Neck was {{proposed}} in {{the cool of the}} evening; for Satanstoe had many a pleasant path, pretty vista, and broad view. Away we went, then, the four of us, Kate leading the way, as the person most familiar with the [...] "capabilities." [...] We were soon on the shore of the Sound, and at a point where a firm, wide beach of sand had been left by the receding waters, rocks fringing the inner boundary toward the main. Here one could walk without confinement of any sort, there being room to go in pairs, or all abreast, as we might choose. Miss Bayard seeming a little coy, and manifesting a desire to keep near her friend, I abandoned the intention of walking at her side, but fell behind a little, and got into discourse with her brother. Nor was I sorry to have this early opportunity of sounding the party who was likely soon to become so nearly connected with me. After a few minutes, the conversation turned on the late revolution, {{and the manner in which}} it was likely to influence the future fortunes of the country. I knew that a portion of the family of my companion had adhered to the crown, losing their estates by the act of confiscation; but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> a portion did not, and I was left to infer that Tom's branch belonged to the latter division of his name, inasmuch as his father was known to be very easy in his circumstances, if not absolutely rich. It was not long, however, before I ascertained that my new friend was a mild tory, and that he would have been better pleased had the rights we had sought, and which he was willing enough to admit had been violated, been secured without a separation of the two countries. As the Littlepages had actually been in arms against the crown, three generations of them, too, at the same time, and the fact could be no secret, I was pleased with the candor with which Tom Bayard expressed his opinions on these points; for it spoke well of the truth and general sincerity of his character.|$|E

6000|$|One of {{the first}} {{accidents}} was that, before dinner, I met Ford Obert wandering a little apart with Mrs. Server, and that, as they were known to me as agreeable acquaintances, I should have faced them with confidence had I not immediately drawn from their sequestered air the fear of interrupting them. Mrs. Server was always lovely and Obert always expert; the latter straightway pulled up, however, making me as welcome as if their converse had dropped. She was extraordinarily pretty, markedly responsive, conspicuously charming, but {{he gave me a}} look that really seemed to say: [...] "Don't--there's a good fellow--leave me any longer alone with her!" [...] I had met her at Newmarch before--it was indeed only so that I had met her--and I knew how she was valued there. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> an aversion to pretty women--numbers of whom he had preserved for a grateful posterity--was his sign neither as man nor as artist; the effect of all of which was to make me ask myself what she could have been doing to him. Making love, possibly--yet from that he would scarce have appealed. She wouldn't, on the other hand, have given him her company only to be inhuman. I joined them, at all events, learning from Mrs. Server that she had come by a train previous to my own; and we made a slow trio till, at a turn of the prospect, we came upon another group. It consisted of Mrs. Froome and Lord Lutley and of Gilbert Long and Lady John--mingled and confounded, as might be said, not assorted according to tradition. Long and Mrs. Froome came first, I recollect, together, and his lordship turned away from Lady John on seeing me rather directly approach her. She had become for me, on the spot, as interesting as, while we travelled, I had found my two friends in the train. As the source of the flow of [...] "intellect" [...] that had transmuted our young man, she had every claim to an earnest attention; and I should soon have been ready to pronounce that she rewarded it as richly as usual. She was indeed, as Mrs. Briss had said, as pointed as a hat-pin, and I bore in mind that lady's injunction to look in her for the answer to our riddle.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had left}} {{one of your}} rings up-stairs, which made as good an excuse for my {{intrusion}} as I could have desired. But, oh, sir! if you have ever loved, you will understand how it was that all my courage cooled, when I walked into the room, and found myself in your presence. And then, you {{looked up at me}} so coldly, and you thanked me for finding your ring in such an indifferent manner, that my knees trembled under me, and I felt as if I should drop on the floor at your feet. When you had thanked me, you looked back, if you remember, at your writing. I was so mortified at being treated in this way, that I plucked up spirit enough to speak. I said, 'This is a strange thing about the Diamond, sir.' And you looked up again, and said, 'Yes, it is!' You spoke civilly (I can't deny that); but still you kept a distance--a cruel distance between us. Believing, as I did, that you had got the lost Diamond hidden about you, while you were speaking, your coolness so provoked me that I got bold enough, {{in the heat of the}} moment, to give you a hint. I said, 'They will never find the Diamond, sir, will they? No! nor the person who took it--I'll answer for that.' I nodded, and smiled at you, as much as to say, 'I know!' THIS time, you looked up at me with something like interest in your eyes; and I felt that a few more words on your side and mine might bring out the truth. Just at that moment, Mr. Betteredge spoilt it all by coming to the door. I knew his footstep, and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it was against his rules for me to be in the library at that time of day--let alone being there along with you. I had only just time to get out of my own accord, before he could come in and tell me to go. I was angry and disappointed; but I was not entirely without hope for all that. The ice, you see, was broken between us--and I thought I would take care, on the next occasion, that Mr. Betteredge was out of the way.|$|E
60|$|The {{excitement}} {{is caused}} by the coming of the King; and I wish that I could present that event in just its sincere unimpressiveness. I have assisted at several such events on the Continent, where, especially in Germany, they are heralded as they are in the theatre, with a blare of trumpets, and a sensation in the populace and the attendant military little short of an ague fit. There, as soon as the majesties mount into their carriages from the station, they drive off as swiftly as their horses can trot, and their subjects, who have been waiting for hours to see them, make what they can of a meagre half-minute's glimpse of them. But how different was the behavior of that easy- going Majesty of England! As soon as I heard that he was coming, I perceived how anxious I had been in the half-year of my English sojourn to see him, and how bitterly I should have been disappointed to leave his realms without it. All kings are bad, I knew that well enough; but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> some kings are not so bad as others, and I had been willing to accept at their face the golden opinions of this King, which, almost without exception, his lieges seemed to hold. Of course {{it is not hard to}} think well of a king if you are under him, just as it is not hard to think ill of him if you are not under him; but there is no use being bigotedly republican when there is nothing to be got by it, and I own the fact that his subjects like him willingly. Probably no man in his kingdom understands better than Edward VII. that he is largely a form, and that the more a form he is the more conformable he is to the English ideal of a monarch. But no Englishman apparently knows better than he when to leave off being a form and become a man, and he has endeared himself to his people from time to time by such inspirations. He is reputed on all hands to be a man of great good sense; if he is ever fooled it is not by himself, but by the system which he is no more a part of than the least of his subjects. If he will let a weary old man or a delicate woman stand indefinitely before him, he is no more to blame for that than for speaking English with a trace of German in his th sounds; he did not invent his origins or his traditions. Personally, having had it out with life, he is as amiable and as unceremonious as a king may be. He shares, as far as he can, the great and little interests of his people. He has not, so far as noted, the gifts of some of his sisters, but he has much of his mother's steadfast wisdom, and his father's instinct for the right side in considerable questions; and he has his father's prescience of the psychological moment for not bothering. Of course, he is a fetish; no Englishman can deny that the kingship is an idolatry; but he is a fetish with an uncommon share of the common man's divinity. The system which provides him for the people provides them the best administration in the world, always naturally in the hands of their superiors, social and political; but we could be several times rottener than we administratively are, and still be incalculably reasonabler, as republicans, than those well-governed monarchists.|$|E
