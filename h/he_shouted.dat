5|$|On September 14, 1951, PFC Edward Gomez (1932–1951), an Ammunition Bearer in Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division, voluntarily {{moved down}} an {{abandoned}} trench {{to search for}} a new location for his machine gun and, when a hostile grenade landed between himself and his weapon, <b>he</b> <b>shouted</b> a warning to those around him as he grasped the activated charge in his hand. Determined to save his comrades, he unhesitatingly chose to sacrifice himself and, diving into a ditch with the deadly missile, absorbed the violence of the explosion in his own body.|$|E
5|$|The BORAX Experiments were {{a series}} of {{destructive}} tests of boiling water reactors conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. The BORAX-1 test was conducted under Zinn's supervision in 1954. He had the control rods removed {{to demonstrate that the}} reactor would shut down without trouble, and it immediately blew up with a loud bang and a tall column of dark smoke, a turn of events that he had not anticipated. <b>He</b> <b>shouted</b> to Harold Lichtenberg to put the control rods back in again, but Lichtenberg pointed out that one was already flying through the air. Zinn later had to testify on the experiment before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.|$|E
5|$|The dragon was {{regarded}} as a great lover and seducer of beautiful women, whom he visited by night, entering their houses down the chimney before turning into a man. The women who were visited by a dragon would after a while grow weak, pale and sunken-faced. There were magical methods to repel the dragon from them. It was believed that the children born out of such liaisons were physically and mentally ill, and that they would not live long. In another belief, the dragon would come for his son amidst thunder and lightning, and fly away with him. In the region of Bitola, it was told that such children were born with a tail. After they grew wings, they flew into the sky, from where they shot witches with thunderbolts. There was a belief in the region of Leskovac that the dragon boys, fighters against ale born with the little wings, were offspring of dragons. At the village of Kruševo, Macedonia, people told of an old shepherd named Trail who was a son of a dragon. He was allegedly so strong that he could shatter cliffs, and when <b>he</b> <b>shouted,</b> his voice could be heard from miles away.|$|E

5|$|Two gaps {{opened up}} in the Union line: the {{commander}} of the 71st Pennsylvania ordered his men to retreat when the Confederates came too close to the Angle; south of the copse of trees, the men of the 59th New York (Hall's brigade) inexplicably bolted for the rear. In the latter case, this left Captain Andrew Cowan and his 1st New York Independent Artillery Battery to face the oncoming infantry. Assisted personally by artillery chief Henry Hunt, Cowan ordered five guns to fire double canister simultaneously. The entire Confederate line to his front disappeared. The gap vacated by most of the 71st Pennsylvania, however, was more serious, leaving only a handful of the 71st, 268 men of the 69th Pennsylvania, and Cushing's two 3-inch rifled guns to receive the 2,500 to 3,000 men of Garnett's and Armistead's brigades as they began to cross the stone fence. The Irishmen of the 69th Pennsylvania resisted fiercely in a melee of rifle fire, bayonets, and fists. Webb, mortified that the 71st had retreated, attempted to bring the 72nd Pennsylvania (a Zouave regiment) forward, but for some reason they did not obey the order, so he had to bring other regiments in to help fill the gap. During the fight, Lt. Cushing was killed as <b>he</b> <b>shouted</b> to his men, three bullets striking him, the third in his mouth. The Confederates seized his two guns and turned them to face the Union troops, but they had no ammunition to fire. As more Union reinforcements arrived and charged into the breach, the defensive line became impregnable and the Confederates began to slip away individually, with no senior officers remaining to call a formal retreat.|$|E
25|$|Auvinen then reentered the school, {{went back}} to the first floor, and began walking around, {{knocking}} on classroom doors. He then managed to enter an occupied comprehensive-school classroom. Inside, <b>he</b> <b>shouted</b> orders at some of the students, proclaimed a revolution, and urged the students to destroy school property. Despite firing two shots at a television set and a window, Auvinen left the classroom without shooting anyone.|$|E
25|$|Later that month, Morrison {{pleaded guilty}} to the charges of {{criminal}} libel brought by Jamison. Judge W. S. McClennehan reduced the sentence to a $100 fine, which so pleased Morrison that he attempted to make a speech thanking the judge. McClennehan pounded his fist {{on his desk and}} admonished Morrison. “I don’t think any more of you, sir, than I do this damn desk,” <b>he</b> <b>shouted.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 15 June 2006, in {{a closed}} hearing, the People's Supreme Court of Appeals heard Glitter's appeal for a reduced sentence. The three-judge panel {{rejected}} the appeal four weeks later. Although he was calm throughout the 40-minute reading of the verdict, upon leaving the courthouse, <b>he</b> <b>shouted</b> angrily to reporters and denounced Vietnamese justice for not hearing the defence arguments. On 7 February 2007, {{it was announced that}} his sentence had been reduced by three months. In anticipation of his release, the Philippines barred Glitter from entering that country as of 16 May 2008.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April 1945, Italy, {{when a small}} {{party were}} almost wiped out in {{an assault on the}} east floodbank of the river, Sepoy Namdeo Jadav carried two wounded men under heavy fire through deep water, up a steep bank and through a mine belt to safety. Then, {{determined}} to avenge his dead comrades, he eliminated three enemy machine-gun posts. Finally, climbing on top of the bank <b>he</b> <b>shouted</b> the Maratha war cry and waved the remaining companies across. He not only saved many lives but enabled the battalion to secure the bridgehead and ultimately to crush all enemy resistance in the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{firearms}} officers {{boarded the}} train and it was initially claimed they challenged the suspect, though later reports indicate he was not challenged. According to Hotel 3, Menezes then stood up and advanced towards the officers and Hotel 3, at which point Hotel 3 grabbed him, pinned his arms against his torso, and pushed {{him back into the}} seat. Although Menezes was being restrained, his body was straight and not in a natural sitting position. Hotel 3 heard a shot close to his ear, and was dragged away onto the floor of the carriage. <b>He</b> <b>shouted</b> 'Police!' and with hands raised was dragged out of the carriage by one of the armed officers who had boarded the train. Hotel 3 then heard several gunshots while being dragged out.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} the red light of the Advance came into sight, Captain Gallant was the only man left alive. The vessel came within {{quarter of a mile}} of him, and he made one more desperate effort to attract attention. In his own words <b>he</b> <b>shouted</b> and screeched without stopping, and within 20 minutes was picked up in an almost {{unconscious}} condition by the ship's boat. All his strength had vanished and the boat containing him was hauled up on board the schooner, and he was lifted into the captain's cabin where spirits were administered and his limbs were rubbed to restore the circulation of the blood. Spirits in very small quantities were given to him and the terrible thirst from which he was suffering was gradually allayed. Captain Gallant subsequently managed to obtain a few hours sleep, and upon awakening, although extremely weak from exhaustion and exposure, was able to relate the privations through which he had passed.|$|E
25|$|Barrett {{was talking}} to the second engineer, Mr. Hesketh, when the red light and bells came on {{signalling}} the order to stop the engines. <b>He</b> <b>shouted</b> to the men in the boiler room to shut the dampers, the doors to the furnaces and to shut off the wind for the fires. Then he felt a crash and water came pouring in on him from a large tear in the ship's starboard side. Barrett made his way through the water tight door into boiler room 5. He was ordered to go back into boiler room 6, but there was 8 feet of water there. As some of the engineers attended the pumps, the engine room rang for all the stokers to go up on deck. Barrett was ordered to stay behind by an engineer, Mr. Harvey, in boiler room 5 to get some lamps, draw fires, and lift the manhole plate until water started to rush in.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Stefan (Nikitin) was {{a medical}} doctor and this {{assisted}} his survival in the concentration camps through work as a camp doctor. He often allowed the overworked and underfed prisoners {{to be allowed to}} stay in hospital to recuperate. The camp authorities became aware of this and warned him that a new trial was probably awaiting him that would have a possible maximum sentence of fifteen years for wrecking Soviet industrial effort by taking workers from their jobs. The bishop was told by a nurse of a woman named Matrionushka in the Volga city of Penza who he should ask to pray for him, and he was told that Matrionushka did not need a letter because she could hear him if he asked for her help. <b>He</b> <b>shouted</b> for her help, and the threatened trial did not happen, and he was released several weeks later. He moved to Penza in order to find Matrionushka. When he met her, she supposedly knew intimate details about him and that he had asked for her help, and she told him that he had prayed to the Lord for him. She was soon arrested, however, and transported to a Moscow prison where she died.|$|E

25|$|The {{plans were}} brought to Robertson, who feeling unwell had dined with Maurice in his room, at around 9pm. In Spears’ famous account Robertson’s face “went the colour of {{mahogany}} … his eyebrows slanted outwards like a forest of bayonets held at the charge – in fact he showed every sign of having a fit” <b>He</b> <b>shouted</b> “Get ‘Aig!”. Haig and Robertson visited Lloyd George – one of Robertson’s objections was that the agreement could not be binding on Dominion troops – who told them {{that he had the}} authority of the War Cabinet and that, although Nivelle’s demands were “excessive”, they must have a scheme agreed by 8am. The next morning, after Nivelle had claimed he had not personally drawn up the scheme and professed astonishment that the British generals had not already been told of it, Robertson “ramped up and down the room, talking about the horrible idea of putting “the wonderful army” under a Frenchman, swearing he would never serve under one, nor his son either, and that no-one could order him to”. Hankey drew up a compromise rather than see Haig and Robertson resign, with Haig still under Nivelle's orders but with tactical control of British forces and right of appeal to the War Cabinet. Robertson later (3 March) regretted even agreeing to this.|$|E

500|$|The {{ghosts of}} actor Charles Macklin and clown Joseph Grimaldi are also {{supposed}} to haunt the theatre. Macklin appears backstage, wandering the corridor which now {{stands in the}} spot where, in 1735, he killed fellow actor Thomas Hallam in an argument over a wig ("Goddamn you for a blackguard, scrub, rascal!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>shouted,</b> thrusting a cane into Hallam's face and piercing his left eye). Grimaldi {{is reported to be}} a helpful apparition, purportedly guiding nervous actors skilfully about the stage on more than one occasion. The comedian Stanley Lupino claimed to have seen the ghost of Dan Leno in a dressing room.|$|E

500|$|In one scene, Reeves needed Price {{to shoot}} his flintlock between {{the ears of}} the horse he was riding. When Price {{realised}} that Reeves had ordered that an actual blank charge was to be used so the weapon's puff of smoke would be visible, <b>he</b> <b>shouted,</b> [...] "What? You want the gun to go bang between the ears of this fucking nag? How do you think he's going to react?" [...] However, Reeves insisted and, when the gun went off, the horse reared and sent Price tumbling onto the ground. Price was not hurt but he was extremely angered by the incident.|$|E
500|$|Not {{all were}} grief-stricken. In New York City, {{a man was}} {{attacked}} by an enraged crowd when <b>he</b> <b>shouted,</b> [...] "It served Old Abe right!" [...] after hearing the news of Lincoln's death. Elsewhere in the South, Lincoln was hated in death as in life, and Booth {{was viewed as a}} hero as many rejoiced at news of his deed. Other Southerners feared that a vengeful North would exact a terrible retribution upon the defeated former Confederate states. [...] "Instead of being a great Southern hero, his deed was considered the worst possible tragedy that could have befallen the South as well as the North," [...] writes Kunhardt.|$|E
500|$|After {{nearly three}} hours of shouts from the angry crowd, {{officers}} moved in to quell the riot. Police reportedly covered their badges with black tape—preventing any identification—and attacked rioters. Dozens of police officers swept into the crowd, using tear gas to force protesters away from the building. Police were surprised at the resistance they faced from the protesters, who attempted to push them back using tree branches, chrome torn off city buses, and asphalt ripped from the street, as weapons. As one man ignited the last police car <b>he</b> <b>shouted</b> to a reporter [...] "Make sure {{you put in the}} paper that I ate too many Twinkies." [...] Sixty officers were injured, and about two dozen arrests were made.|$|E
