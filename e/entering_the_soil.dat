50|$|Infiltration is {{the process}} by which water on <b>the</b> ground surface <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> <b>The</b> water <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> through <b>the</b> pores by the forces of gravity and {{capillary}} action. The largest cracks and pores offer a great reservoir for the initial flush of water. This allows a rapid infiltration.

50|$|Whether {{nitrogen}} is mineralized or immobilized {{depends on}} the Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) ratio of the plant residues.

50|$|Decomposition fluids <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> {{represent}} an important influx {{of organic matter}} and can also contain a large microbial load of organisms from the body. The area {{where the majority of}} the decomposition fluid leaches into the soil {{is often referred to as}} a cadaver decomposition island (CDI). It has been observed that decomposition can have a favorable influence on the growth of plants due to increased fertility, a useful tool when trying to locate clandestine graves. The changes in the concentration of nutrients can have lasting effects that are still seen years after a body or carcass has completely disappeared. The influence that the surge in nutrients can have on the microorganisms and vegetation of a given site is not well understood but it appears that decomposition initially has an inhibitory effect for an initial stage before entering a second stage of increased growth.|$|E
40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to develop}} {{indicators}} that relate the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) with changes in land management of horticultural production systems. Soil nematode communities {{have been shown to be}} sensitive to land management changes, but often do not include plant-parasites in the calculation of soil nematode community indices. The concept of nematode functional guilds was used to estimate the proportion of carbon <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> ecosystem through different channels, such as through decomposition of organic material, the detrital channel, through the roots of plants, the root channel or recycled through the activity of predators, a predation channel. Calculations of the indices were developed and validated using case studies in the north Queensland banana industry. Firstly, a survey of organic and conventional banana farms found a greater proportion of C <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> ecosystem through the detrital channel and a reduced proportion of C originating through the root channel at the organic sites relative to conventional sites. Secondly, a field experiment comparing compost amendments, found application of fresh compost significantly increased the proportion of C <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> ecosystem through the detrital channel and decreased proportion of C originating from the root channel. Thirdly, a field experiment comparing 'conventional' banana production to an 'alternative' system which incorporated organic matter, found the proportion of C <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> ecosystem through the root channel was significantly greater in the conventional systems relative to the alternative system.

40|$|The {{movement}} and {{storage of water}} in surface soils is important for economic and environmental reasons. The ability of a soil to store water in the root zone determines its ability to support plant growth and crop production. Water moving through the root zone {{has the potential of}} carrying chemicals downward to the underlying aquifers. Rainfall and irrigation water <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> tends to replenish the soil storage reservoir and extend its ability to support plant life. If infiltrating water exceeds the storage capacity of the soil root zone, the excess water tends to move downward through the soil. This deep drainage contributes to recharging the aquifer below. The challenge to farm managers is to provide sufficient water for producing a crop while limiting the amount of water and dissolved chemicals moving deeply into the soil. This software uses the water balance concept to estimate water available for plants and water drainage below the root zone. The basic concept is just a statement of the principle of conservation of mass. It can be represented by the equation Infiltration- Evapotranspiration – Increase In Storage = Drainage where Infiltration represents the amount of water <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> surface from rainfall or irrigation, Evapotranspiration represents the amount of water leaving the soil by surfac...|$|E
