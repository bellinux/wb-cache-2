5|$|Christchurch {{was under}} heavy {{development}} at this time, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been granted city status {{and was the}} new administrative capital of the province of Canterbury. This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings in timber. The buildings were constructed from 1857–59, but in a more limited form than the original design. As the Provincial Council gained new functions with growth in the population and economy of the province, the buildings were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an iron clock tower from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65. The buildings today are {{regarded as one of}} Mountfort's most important works.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, {{the city}} of Laredo, Texas, issued an arrest warrant for Treviño in {{connection}} with a 2006 double homicide in Texas. In 2008, Treviño Morales and Lazcano Lazcano, the two leaders of Los Zetas, forged an alliance with the Beltrán Leyva Cartel. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> gone to war with the Sinaloa Cartel, believing that El Chapo Guzmán, their leader, had betrayed them. Treviño Morales subsequently joined them to kill the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. Government sources said Los Zetas were fighting for control against La Federación (The Federation), an alliance of several drug trafficking groups led by Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán and Ismael El Mayo Zambada, two drug lords who used to work for the Beltrán Leyva Cartel.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of Igloo White/Commando Hunt, the aerial interdiction effort entered a new phase. Armed {{reconnaissance}} – the patrolling of known segments of the trail system by aircraft searching for targets of opportunity – gave way to strikes directed by the sensor system. That {{is not to say}} the Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft that carried out the missions. The Seventh Air Force was not about to surrender the single air manager control that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> fought so hard to obtain. Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh by gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence. This intelligence was delivered from Nakhon Phanom to the Seventh's headquarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base, where it issued the strike orders. The ABCCCs were also {{under the control of the}} Seventh, not Task Force Alpha.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Amway {{purchased}} WHN in New York, giving Mutual {{a second}} major-market owned-and-operated station. On a Country Road, a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At {{the beginning of}} the year, Mutual had begun airing Mutual Radio Theater, formerly Sears Radio Theater, which <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series. In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual. The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final show on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|On the {{division}} right, Tabu-dong was in North Korean hands, {{on the left}} Waegwan was a no-man's land, {{and in the center}} strong North Korean forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518. The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan-Tabu-dong lateral supply road behind it, and was in danger of being surrounded. After discussing a withdrawal plan with Walker, Gay on September 5 issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position. The movement was to progress from right to left beginning with the 8th Cavalry Regiment, then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area, and finally the 5th Cavalry in the Waegwan area. This withdrawal caused the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, to give up a hill <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> attacked and captured near the Tabu-dong road on the approaches of the Walled City of Ka-san. In the 7th Cavalry sector the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Battalions were to withdraw in that order, after the withdrawal of the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, on their right. The 2d Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 north of Waegwan was to cover the withdrawal of the 7th Cavalry and hold open the escape road.|$|E

25|$|In Ojibwe, Eastern Cree, Westmain Swampy Cree, Naskapi, and Innu lore, wendigos {{are often}} {{described}} as giants, many times larger than human beings (a characteristic absent from the myth in the other Algonquian cultures).

The Royal Air Force (RAF) had just introduced two long-range bombers, the Vickers Valiant and the English Electric Canberra, but owing to their recent {{entry into service}} the RAF had not yet established proper bombing techniques for these aircraft. Despite this, General Sir Charles Keightley, {{the commander of the}} invasion force, believed that air power alone was sufficient to defeat Egypt. By contrast, General Hugh Stockwell, the Task Force's ground commander believed that methodical and systematic armored operations centered on the Centurion battle tank would be the key to victory.|$|E
25|$|This station {{served the}} village of Swimbridge in Devon. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> a single {{platform}} {{on the south side}} of the line until a second platform and passing loop were provided from 19 February 1904. The goods shed was on a loop line opposite the original platform, and so from 1904 was behind the westbound platform. The original small signal box was at the east end of the original platform, but was replaced by one in the middle of that platform when the loop was lengthened. Goods traffic was withdrawn from 3 August 1964. The site is now been taken over by the North Devon Link Road.|$|E

25|$|On {{the eve of}} Kenya's {{independence}} in August 1963, British officials belatedly realized that the new Kenyan regime {{was not willing to}} give up the Somali-inhabited areas <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been granted administration of. Led by the Northern Province People's Progressive Party (NPPPP), Somalis in the NFD vigorously sought union with their kin in the Somali Republic to the north. In response, the Kenyan government enacted a number of repressive measures designed to frustrate their efforts in what {{came to be known as}} the Shifta War. Although the conflict ended in a cease-fire, Somalis in the region still identify and maintain close ties with their brethren in Somalia. They have traditionally married within their own community and formed a cohesive ethnic network.|$|E
25|$|The moor {{has been}} common land since 1065, and anyone owning grazing animals who {{registers}} {{with the local}} authority is entitled to graze stock on it. The traditional limit of livestock a person could leave to graze on the common was one horse and two cattle per head. Formerly the commoners were any {{people who lived in}} the parish of Staines, which since the mid-20th century has had three Church of England churches, whereas before the mid-19th century <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> one church, but the parish is unaltered save that it has been slightly increased in the east. Since these 20th-century changes, the part of the moor north of the A30 is indivisible from Stanwell Moor's actual moor occupying most of that late 20th-century small village, which was before then a hamlet.|$|E
25|$|The {{scene is}} within a room where, at an open end on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a woman grieving over a dead child in her arms. The center is {{occupied}} by a horse falling in agony as if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been run through by a spear or javelin. The large gaping wound in the horse's side is {{a major focus of}} the painting. Under the horse is a dead, apparently dismembered soldier; his hand on a severed arm still grasps a shattered sword from which a flower grows. On the open palm of the dead soldier is a stigma, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the stigmata of Christ. A light bulb blazes in the shape of an evil eye over the suffering horse's head (the bare bulb of the torturer's cell).|$|E

25|$|Compiègne {{had been}} {{the site of the}} 1918 Armistice, which ended the First World War with a humiliating defeat for Germany; Hitler viewed the choice of {{location}} as a supreme moment of revenge for Germany over France. On 21 June 1940, Hitler visited the site to start the negotiations which took place in the very same railway carriage in which the 1918 Armistice was signed (<b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been removed from a museum building and placed on the precise spot where it was located in 1918). Hitler sat in the same chair in which Marshal Ferdinand Foch had sat when he faced the defeated German representatives. After listening to the reading of the preamble, Hitler left the carriage in a calculated gesture of disdain for the French delegates, and negotiations were turned over to Wilhelm Keitel, the Chief of Staff of OKW. The armistice was signed on the next day at 18:36 (French time), by General Keitel for Germany and Huntziger for France. The armistice and cease-fire went into effect, two days and six hours later, at 00:35 on 25 June, once the Franco-Italian Armistice had also been signed, at 18:35 on 24 June, near Rome.|$|E
