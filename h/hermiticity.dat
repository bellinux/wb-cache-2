Window technologies always in progress and it is common today to use low-emissive glass. In spite of progress the low temperature of glass surface is still the problem of constructive glazing. Heatable glass helps to solve problems concerning low surface temperature and increase the level of comfort in the room significantly. Heatable glass can be used in practically all kinds of glazing systems made of wood, plastic or aluminum. Heatable glass and multiple glass panes can be used both in blind and openable constructions. Multiple glass panes made of heating glass can have one or two chambers. The advantages of multiple glass panes are their <b>hermiticity</b> and ability to decrease heat transfer significantly.|$|E

40|$|While a Hamiltonian {{can be both}} Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric, it is $PT$ {{symmetry}} that is {{the more}} general, as {{it can lead to}} real energy eigenvalues even if the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian. We discuss some specific ways in which $PT$ symmetry goes beyond <b>Hermiticity</b> and is more far reaching than it. We show that simply by virtue of being the generator of time translations, the Hamiltonian must always be $PT$ symmetric, {{regardless of whether or not}} it might be Hermitian. We show that the reality of the Euclidean time path integral is a necessary and sufficient condition for $PT$ symmetry of a quantum field theory, with <b>Hermiticity</b> only being a sufficient condition. We show that in order to construct the correct classical action needed for a path integral quantization one must impose $PT$ symmetry on each classical path, a requirement that has no counterpart in any <b>Hermiticity</b> condition since <b>Hermiticity</b> of a Hamiltonian is only definable after the quantization has been performed and the quantum Hilbert space has been constructed. With the spacetime metric being $PT$ even we show that a covariant action must always be $PT$ symmetric. Unlike <b>Hermiticity,</b> $PT$ symmetry does not need to be postulated as it is derivable from Poincare invariance. <b>Hermiticity</b> is just a particular realization of $PT$ symmetry, one in which the eigenspectrum is real and complete.

40|$|We {{introduce}} <b>hermiticity</b> {{as a new}} symmetry {{and show}} that when starting with a model which is Hermitian in the classical level, quantum corrections can break <b>hermiticity</b> while the theory stay physically acceptable. To show this, we calculated the effective potential of the (gϕ^ 4 +hϕ^ 6) _ 1 + 1 model up to first order in g and h couplings which is sufficient as the region of interest has finite correlation length for which mean field calculation may suffice. We show that, in the literature, there is a skipped phase of the theory due to the wrong believe that the theory in the broken <b>hermiticity</b> phase is unphysical. However, in view of recent discoveries {{of the reality of}} the spectrum of the non-Hermitian but PT symmetric theories, in the broken <b>hermiticity</b> phase the theory possesses PT symmetry and thus physically acceptable. In fact, ignoring this phase will lead to violation of universality when comparing this model predictions with other models in the same class of universality.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} vacuum {{structure}} of QCD with two flavors of Wilson fermions. We derive two possible scenarios: (i) If the spectral density ρ_U(λ,κ) of the overlap hamiltonian in a fixed background gauge field is not symmetric in λ, <b>Hermiticity</b> is violated and <b>Hermiticity</b> violation effects could influence numerical determinations of the η meson mass {{if we are}} not near enough to the continuum limit, where <b>Hermiticity</b> should be recovered; (ii) otherwise we argue that, under certain assumptions, new phases appear beside the Aoki phase, which can be characterized by a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of iψ̅_uγ_ 5 ψ_u+iψ̅_dγ_ 5 ψ_d, and with vacuum states that cannot be connected with the Aoki vacua by parity-flavor symmetry transformations.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{and weak}} current {{operators}} for interacting systems should properly commute with the Poincaré generators and satisfy <b>Hermiticity.</b> The electromagnetic current should also satisfy P and T covariance and continuity equation. In frontform dynamics the current {{can be constructed}} from auxiliary operators, defined in a Breit frame where initial and final three-momenta of the system are directed along the z axis. Poincaré covariance constraints reduce for auxiliary operators to the ones imposed only by kinematical rotations around the z axis; while <b>Hermiticity</b> requires a suitable behaviour of the auxiliary operators under rotations by π around the x or y axes. Applications to deep inelastic structure functions and electromagnetic form factors are discussed. Elastic and transition form factors can be extracted without any ambiguity and in the elastic case the continuity equation is automatically satisfied, once Poincaré, P and T covariance, together with <b>Hermiticity,</b> are imposed.
