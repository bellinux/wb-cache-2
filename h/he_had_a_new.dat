5|$|Cesaro was {{endorsed}} by Hulk Hogan on the post-WrestleMania Raw, who presented him with the Andre the Giant battle royal trophy. Cesaro went on to reveal that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> manager in Paul Heyman, who would replace Zeb Colter. This earned Cesaro an attack from his former partner Jack Swagger, who destroyed Cesaro's trophy. Swagger later cost Cesaro his match against Rob Van Dam in the semi-finals of the Intercontinental Championship #1 contender tournament, while Van Dam later lost in the tournament final due to Cesaro's interference. At Extreme Rules, Cesaro defeated Swagger and Van Dam in an elimination match.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{settled in}} San Juan in 1814. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> son, Pedro Cornelio, and {{maintained}} a simple life growing grapes. He awaited {{the final decision}} of Posadas, but the supreme director had a political crisis at the time. The Spanish king Ferdinand VII {{had returned to the}} throne and demanded the colonies to return to their former organization, the royalists at Upper Peru were still a threat, and José Gervasio Artigas opposed Buenos Aires as well, because of its high centralism. As a result, Carlos María de Alvear became the new supreme director, who would decide the final fate of Cornelio Saavedra.|$|E
5|$|As the war {{drew to a}} close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having {{believed}} {{the federal government had}} limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.|$|E

25|$|When he was born, {{his parents}} were living with his mother's mother in Isestraße. After her death in October 1925, {{the family moved to}} a rented flat in a new {{building}} in Lattenkamp, in the Winterhude quarter. He attended a kindergarten then, in April 1930, moved to Alsterdorfer Straße School.

Thus in 1931 he moved to the Meerweinstraße School where his mother taught.|$|E
25|$|During {{the year}} Van Gogh {{stayed at the}} asylum, the {{prolific}} output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued. During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September, 1889, in the Musée d'Orsay. The Starry Night was painted mid-June by around 18 June, the date {{he wrote to his}} brother Theo to say <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> study of a starry sky.|$|E
25|$|When, however, he {{defeated}} his rivals, in 45 BC, {{and assumed}} full personal {{control of the}} Roman state, he asserted more. During the Roman Civil War, since 49 BC, he {{had returned to the}} Eastern Mediterranean, where he had been called god and savior, and been familiar with the Ptolemaic Egyptian monarchy of Cleopatra, called Cleopatra Thea because of the weight she placed on her own divinity. Also, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Senate to deal with. Most of the more resolute defenders of the Senate had joined with Pompey, and – one way or another – they were not sitting in the Senate. Caesar had replaced them with his own partisans, few of whom were committed to the old Roman methods; some of them were not even from Italy. It was rumoured that Caesar intended a despotic removal of power and wealth from Rome eastwards, perhaps to Alexandria or Ilium (Troy).|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Hariri donated $12 {{million to}} Lebanese {{victims of the}} 1978 South Lebanon {{conflict}} and helped clean up Beirut's streets with his company's money and contributed to early reconstruction efforts during lulls in the Lebanon war. Said to have heavily financed opposing militias during the war, his former deputy Najah Wakim later accused him of helping to destroy downtown Beirut in order to rebuild it again and make {{billions of dollars in}} the process. After the conflict, he acted as an envoy of the Saudi royal family to Lebanon. He laid the groundwork that led to the 1989 Taif Accord, which Saudi Arabia organised to bring the warring factions together. Taif {{put an end to the}} civil war, building goodwill for Hariri politically. While acting as the Saudi envoy to Lebanon, he spent more time in Damascus than in Beirut where he ingratiated himself with the Assad regime; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> presidential palace built in Damascus as a gift to the Syrian dictator but Assad didn't use it personally.|$|E
25|$|In Salta {{he found}} an {{intelligence}} net who was passing information to Goyeneche's royalist army, headed by the city's bishop, whom he forced to leave the territories controlled by the Junta. Even though they suffered from malaria he decided to advance towards Cochabamba. The advanced elements consisting of the battalion of mulattoes and the two cavalry regiments of Hussars and Dragoons, reached Humahuaca, {{while the rest of}} the army positioned itself in Jujuy. He celebrated there the second anniversary of the May Revolution, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> white and light blue flag blessed by the chaplain. The well-planned solemn ceremony helped gain the support of the locals who were distrustful and some supported the royalist army and the dislike of the troops to the Prussian regime imposed by Holmberg. Order was strict and Belgrano ordered capital punishment inflicted for whom disobeyed express orders. One of the deserters due to the strict discipline was Venancio Benavídez, who moved to Goyeneche's forces, which had already taken Cochabamba and he told of the harsh conditions at Belgrano's army. With that intelligence, Goyeneche, who had just reinforced Pío de Tristán, decided to advance towards the south and press the advantage. Belgrano ordered conscription of all able men, forming a troop of cavalry irregulars, but received the order to retreat towards Córdoba from the Junta in Buenos Aires.|$|E
2500|$|In late February 1720, {{they were}} joined by French pirate Montigny la Palisse in another sloop, the Sea King. The {{inhabitants}} of Barbados equipped two well-armed ships, the Summerset and the Philipa, to try {{to put an end to}} the pirate menace. On 26 February, they encountered the two pirate sloops. The Sea King quickly fled, and the Fortune broke off the engagement after sustaining considerable damage and was able to escape. Roberts headed for Dominica to repair the sloop, with twenty of his crew dying of their wounds on the voyage. There were also two sloops from Martinique out searching for the pirates, and Roberts swore vengeance against the inhabitants of Barbados and Martinique. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> flag made with a drawing of himself standing upon 2 skulls, one labelled ABH (A Barbadian's Head) and the other AMH (A Martiniquian's Head) ...|$|E

2500|$|During his youth, {{his mother}} would work several jobs {{in order to support}} the family, often taking odd jobs as a nurse and caterer. She would also attend night school to learn English. His father later {{abandoned}} the family, prompting his maternal grandmother to take care of Abel. This allowed him to become fluent in Amharic in his early years, with this Semitic language acting as his first language. His grandmother would also take him to services at an Ethiopian Orthodox church. About his father, The Weeknd stated [...] "I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> family and kids.

Judge Crane later granted a motion by Goetz to dismiss the new indictments, based on alleged errors in the prosecutor's instructions to the jury regarding Goetz's defense of justification {{for the use of}} deadly force. A second factor in the dismissal was the judge's opinion that testimony by Canty and Ramseur [...] "strongly appeared" [...] to have been perjury, based on later public statements by Canty and Ramseur that they had intended to rob Goetz, and on a newspaper interview where Cabey stated that {{the other members of the}} group planned to frighten and rob Goetz because he [...] "looked like easy bait". The judge allowed the weapons possession and reckless endangerment charges to stand.|$|E
