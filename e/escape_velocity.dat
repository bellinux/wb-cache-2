5|$|Due to {{tidal force}} from Jupiter and Amalthea's low density and {{irregular}} shape, the <b>escape</b> <b>velocity</b> at its surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter {{is no more}} than 1 m/s and dust can easily escape from it after, e.g. micrometeorite impacts; this dust forms the Amalthea Gossamer Ring.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always {{looking toward the}} planet. Its orientation is such that the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface {{is thought to be}} {{near the edge of the}} Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the <b>escape</b> <b>velocity</b> in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E

5|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach <b>escape</b> <b>velocity,</b> entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic <b>escape</b> <b>velocity.</b> At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to reach <b>escape</b> <b>velocity</b> was the Soviet Luna 1, which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959. In 1961, Venera 1 {{became the first}} planetary probe. It revealed {{the presence of the}} solar wind and performed the first fly-by of the planet Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the Mariner 2 fly-by of Venus in 1962. The first {{spacecraft to}} perform a fly-by of Mars was Mariner 4, which reached the planet in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth. In August 2012, Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter interstellar space.|$|E

5|$|Thermal energy causes {{some of the}} {{molecules}} at {{the outer edge of}} the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve <b>escape</b> <b>velocity</b> more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|$|E

This may be the case with most comets if they come from outside the solar system.|$|E

40|$|We present new {{analysis}} of 11 intermediate-age (1 - 2 Gyr) star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging data. Seven of the clusters feature main sequence turnoff (MSTO) regions that are wider {{than can be}} accounted for by a simple stellar population, whereas their red giant branches indicate a single value of [Fe/H]. The star clusters cover a range in present-day mass from about 1 E 4 to 2 E 5 solar masses. We compare radial distributions of stars in the upper and lower parts of the MSTO region, and calculate cluster masses and <b>escape</b> <b>velocities</b> from the present time back to a cluster age of 10 Myr. Our main result is that for all clusters in our sample with estimated <b>escape</b> <b>velocities</b> > 15 km/s at an age of 10 Myr, the stars in the brightest half of the MSTO region are significantly more centrally concentrated than the stars in the faintest half AND more massive red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch stars. This is not the case for clusters with <b>escape</b> <b>velocities</b> < 10 km/s at an age of 10 Myr. We argue that the wide MSTO region of such clusters is mainly caused by to a 200 - 500 Myr range in the ages of cluster stars due to extended star formation within the cluster from material shed by first-generation stars featuring slow stellar winds. Dilution of this enriched material by accretion of ambient interstellar matter is deemed plausible if the spread of [Fe/H] in this ambient gas was very small when the second-generation stars were formed in the cluster.

25|$|When {{only two}} {{gravitational}} bodies interact, their orbits follow a conic section. The orbit can be open (implying the object never returns) or closed (returning). Which it is {{depends on the}} total energy (kinetic + potential energy) of the system. In {{the case of an}} open orbit, the speed at any position of the orbit is at least the <b>escape</b> <b>velocity</b> for that position, {{in the case of a}} closed orbit, the speed is always less than the <b>escape</b> <b>velocity.</b> Since the kinetic energy is never negative, if the common convention is adopted of taking the potential energy as zero at infinite separation, the bound orbits will have negative total energy, the parabolic trajectories zero total energy, and hyperbolic orbits positive total energy.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the inertia and {{centrifugal}} pseudo-force can {{be significant}} {{due to the}} path of the rocket around the center of a celestial body; when high enough speeds in the right direction and altitude are achieved a stable orbit or <b>escape</b> <b>velocity</b> is obtained.|$|E
40|$|We address three {{questions}} regarding solar system planets. What determined their number? Why are their orbits nearly circular and coplanar? How long did they take to form? Runaway accretion in a disk of small bodies {{resulted in a}} tiny fraction of the bodies growing much larger than all the others. This was followed by oligarchic growth during which the big bodies maintained similar masses and uniformly spaced semi-major axes. We depart from standard treatments of planet formation by assuming that as the big bodies got bigger, the small ones got smaller as the result of undergoing a collisional fragmentation cascade. It follows that oligarchy was a brief stage in solar system evolution. When the oligarchs' surface mass density matched that of the small bodies, dynamical friction was no longer able to balance viscous stirring, so their velocity dispersion increased to the extent that their orbits crossed. This marked the end of oligarchy. What happened next differed in the inner and outer parts of the planetary system. In the inner part, where the ratios of the <b>escape</b> <b>velocities</b> from the surfaces of the planets to the <b>escape</b> <b>velocities</b> from their orbits are smaller than unity, big bodies collided and coalesced after their random velocities became comparable to their <b>escape</b> <b>velocities.</b> In the outer part, where these ratios are larger than unity, the random velocities of some of the big bodies continued to rise until they were ejected. In both parts, the number density of the big bodies eventually decreased to the extent that gravitational interactions among them no longer produced large scale chaos. After that their orbital eccentricities and inclinations were damped by dynamical friction from the remaining small bodies. The last and longest stage in planet formation was the clean up of small bodies. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that the globular cluster X-ray sources can be interpreted in terms of mass shed by evolving postmain-sequence stars in the central regions of the globular cluster and accreting onto a massive (approximately 100 - 1000 solar masses) central black hole.

40|$|The {{interstellar}} medium is a multiphase gas in which turbulent support {{is as important}} as thermal pressure. Sustaining this configuration requires both continuous turbulent stirring and continuous radiative cooling to match the decay of turbulent energy. While this equilibrium can persist for small turbulent velocities, if the one-dimensional velocity dispersion is larger than approximately 35 km/s, the gas moves into an unstable regime that leads to rapid heating. I study the implications of this turbulent runaway, showing that it causes a hot gas outflow to form in all galaxies with a gas surface density above approximately 50 solar masses/pc^ 2 corresponding to a star formation rate per unit area of 0. 1 $ solar masses/yr/kpc^ 2. For galaxies with <b>escape</b> <b>velocities</b> above 200 km/s, the sonic point of this hot outflow should lie interior to the region containing cold gas and stars, while for galaxies with smaller <b>escape</b> <b>velocities,</b> the sonic point should lie outside this region. This leads to efficient cold cloud acceleration in higher mass galaxies, while in lower mass galaxies, clouds may be ejected by random turbulent motions rather than accelerated by the wind. Finally, I show that energy balance cannot be achieved at all for turbulent media above a surface density of approximately 10 ^ 5 solar masses/pc^ 2.

25|$|A larger {{planet is}} likely to have a more massive atmosphere.
