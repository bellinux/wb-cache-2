5|$|As of December 2010, South Australia had {{thirteen}} operational wind farms, with an {{installed capacity}} of 1,018 MW. By August 2014 this has increased to 1,473 MW, accounting for 27 per cent of <b>electricity</b> <b>production.</b> As of late 2015 {{there are a}} large range of new wind farms {{in various stages of}} planning but only one under construction, the Hornsdale Wind Farm. Hornsdale was generating 86 MW immediately prior to the 2016 South Australian blackout in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the United States led {{the world}} in {{geothermal}} <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> with 3,086 MW of installed capacity from 77 power plants.

5|$|In 2012, over 40 {{per cent}} of Scotland's {{electricity}} came from renewable energy, and Scotland contributed almost 40 per {{cent of the}} UK's renewables output. At the end of 2012, there was 5,801 megawatts (MW) of installed renewables electricity capacity in Scotland, an increase of 20.95 per cent (1,005 MW) {{on the end of}} 2011. Renewable electricity generation in 2012 was a record high at 14,756 GWh – an increase of 7.3 per cent on 2011, the previous record year for renewables output. The bulk of <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> is derived from gas and oil. 2002 figures used in RSPB Scotland et al. (2006) are gas (34%), oil (28%), coal (18%) and nuclear (17%), with renewables 3% (principally hydro-electric), prior to the substantial growth in wind power output. It should be borne in mind that <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> {{is only part of the}} overall energy use budget. In 2002, Scotland consumed a total of 175 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy in all forms, some 2% less than in 1990. Of this, only 20% was consumed in the form of electricity by end users, the great majority of energy utilised being from the burning of oil (41%) and gas (36%).|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the rest}} of the nation, most of Texas is on its own {{alternating}} current power grid, the Texas Interconnection. Texas has a deregulated electric service.

As an independent nation, Texas would rank as the world's eleventh-largest producer of electricity, after South Korea, and ahead of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Various {{proposals}} {{have been put}} forward to construct a Severn Barrage for tidal <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> from Brean Down to Lavernock Point in south Wales.

5|$|Till 2014, Tripura was a power deficit state. In late 2014, Tripura reached surplus <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> {{capacity}} {{by using}} its recently discovered natural gas resources, and installing high efficiency gas turbine power plants. The state has many power-generating stations. These {{are owned by}} Tripura State Electricity Corporation (TSECL), natural gas-powered thermal power stations at Rokhia and Baramura, and the ONGC Tripura Power Company in Palatana. The ONGC plant has a capacity of 726.6 MW, with the second plant's commissioning in November 2014. It is the largest individual power plant in the northeast region.|$|E

5|$|Falling <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> may be boosted through {{drilling}} additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei {{power station}} {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E

25|$|The Faroe Islands {{have set}} a goal of {{producing}} their entire electrical energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2030. Since energy consumption has been rising steadily during the last few decades, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has conducted a study for the future development of <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> projects. Apart from the development of new hydropower plants and wind farms, the study proposes the investigation of the possibility to produce electricity from LNG and biogas. The University of the Faroe Islands has undertaken research into the feasibility of tidal power at several sites which have a high energy potential, leading the Ministry of Trade and Industry to consider tidal power as a possibility.
