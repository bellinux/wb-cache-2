500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the one to oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So {{this is the end of}} an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy,' cried Margaret vehemently. 'You {{know that}} I owe {{everything}} to him. I'd do all I could {{to make him}} happy, even if I had to sacrifice myself. But I can't sacrifice myself, because I love him so much that all I do is pure delight.' ...|$|E

6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS: 'Of {{course you}} wouldn't, dear! And that's what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> promise, Aunt Mary: never {{to do it}} again, no matter HOW much he's provoked. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> promise it right here in your presence, Aunt Mary!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "No, no! <b>I</b> <b>want</b> the Doctor's {{services}} myself. <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> give me his medicines. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> give me away." ...|$|R
6000|$|But the {{deliberate}} voice up there became animated to ask: [...] "Jukes turned up yet?" [...] Then, {{after a short}} wait, [...] "I wish he would bear a hand. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done and come up here in case of anything. To look after the ship. I am all alone. The second mate's lost. [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{dont know}} his address, {{and my brother}} says I ought not to write to him. I dont think I ought, either; but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> told {{something}} that may prevent {{a great deal of}} unhappiness. It seems so unfeeling to sit down quietly and say, 'It is not my business to interfere,' when the mischief might so easily be prevented." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For the present, at least. I cannot help it," [...] said Margaret. [...] "Oh, {{he is so}} kind, and so unselfish, and {{so beautifully}} gentle--and to think of his still caring! But there, dear Ethel, I {{am not going to}} cry; do call papa, or he will think me foolish again. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite at ease about me before he comes." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> think, {{the dress}} really is {{appropriate}} for our wedding because we don’t always think inside the box. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have fond memories of seeing me in the dress, and {{to look back and}} think how much he enjoyed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can tell}} Cheditafa," [...] said the captain, quickly, [...] "that if <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay he'll stay, and if <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go he'll go. He {{has nothing to}} say about that. So much for him. Now, what do you think?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, sir; but isn't it {{natural for}} a young man to have some {{personal}} aim or aspiration to live for? If David was a weak or dull man I could understand it; but I seem to feel a power, a possibility for something higher and better than any thing I see, and this frets me. He is so good, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> great also in some way." ...|$|E
6000|$|He moved himself round {{immediately}} {{to the front of}} her, and held her hand more firmly, as he continued, 'Cytherea, why do you say [...] "It would," [...] so entirely in the tone of abstract supposition?

O Cytherea, my darling, my love, come and be my wife!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{should have}} come to me with their grievances; {{but it is too}} late to talk of that now, and {{immediate}} steps must be taken to prevent the mischief. It won't be policy for you to show yourself until my plans have been perfected, otherwise they would take alarm. The boy can go home, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the breaker this morning as if nothing had happened. Where can you remain in hiding for a few days?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don' want none o' you uns," [...] said Aunt Matilda. [...] "Ole Miles {{is used to}} carryin' letters, and <b>I</b> <b>wants</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{carry my}} letter.

60|$|I {{knew the}} {{question}} absurd. I asked it of <b>him</b> because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> ask it of me.|$|R
60|$|With {{those words}} he took {{himself out of}} the way, which was exactly what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Course I know it, Reddy. Why, Peg's too modest. But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dead {{in earnest}} to-day. Mind you, I'm thinkin' of Place. He'll beat Herne to a standstill. I {{worked on his}} feelin's just to get him all stirred up. You know there's always the chance of rattles in any young player, {{especially}} a pitcher. If he's mad he won't be so likely to get 'em. So I hurt his feelin's. I'll {{make it up to}} him, don't you fear for that, Reddy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You don't {{know what}} he is,' she said; 'you don't {{know what he}} really is. How can you, seeing him there all at once, dear love, and not gradually, as I have done! You have been so good to us, so delicately and truly good, that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better in your eyes than in anybody's. And I cannot bear to think,' cried Little Dorrit, {{covering}} her tears with her hands, 'I cannot bear {{to think that you}} of all the world should see him in his only moments of degradation.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] I said, [...] "come {{with me to}} the water's edge, all of you. You will be in less {{danger from}} the {{lightning}} there, where are no tall trees. And while I am gone, do you ladies dress up Hans in that gorilla-skin as best you can, lacing it on to him with some of that palm-fibre string which we brought with us, and filling out the hollows and the head with leaves or reeds. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready when I come back with the canoe.|$|E

6000|$|In a {{few moments}} Arabella replied in a curiously low, hungry tone of latent sensuousness: [...] "I've got <b>him</b> <b>to</b> care for me: yes! But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> more than care for me; <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have me--to marry me! I must have him. I can't do without him.

60|$|I {{told him}} mine, which was down that street there, and which <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{take to the}} Dover coach office for sixpence.|$|R
6000|$|Fortunately Nunez was tired, {{and in a}} {{short time}} he desisted, and threw himself down on the ground. [...] "Take off his ropes, one of you," [...] he said: [...] "there would be no fear of his running away had he three or four days to live, instead of as many hours. Take the gag out of his mouth, throw some water over him to bring him round, and pour some wine down his throat. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fresh, so as to be able to enjoy the {{pleasure}} we have in store for him. And now let's have dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{wish you}} to go, Jim. This gentleman {{is a great}} friend of mine, and when bad black man {{attacked}} young Missy, he saved her life. So <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken good care of; and the horse, too, and to see no one steals it. So someone I can trust must go with him. If you don't like him for a master, after you have tried him, Jim, {{you can come back}} to me again. You have been a good boy, and I have no wish to get rid of you; but this gentleman don't know the ways of the country, and I want to be sure he has someone with him he can trust." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{interrupt}} me. He {{has died}} and come alive again thirteen times, and traveled {{under a new}} name every time: Smith, Jones, Robinson, Jackson, Peters, Haskins, Merlin--a new alias every time he turns up. I knew him in Egypt three hundred years ago; I knew him in India five hundred years ago--he is always blethering around in my way, everywhere I go; he makes me tired. He don't amount to shucks, as a magician; knows {{some of the old}} common tricks, but has never got beyond the rudiments, and never will. He is well enough for the provinces--one-night stands and that sort of thing, you know--but dear me, he oughtn't to set up for an expert--anyway not where there's a real artist. Now look here, Clarence, I am going to stand your friend, right along, and in return you must be mine. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to get word to the king that I am a magician myself--and the Supreme Grand High-yu-Muck-amuck and head of the tribe, at that; and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made to understand that I am just quietly arranging a little calamity here that will make the fur fly in these realms if Sir Kay's project is carried out and any harm comes to me. Will you get that to the king for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! mamma! Only <b>I</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> think. <b>I</b> wouldn't do {{everything}} he liked, except that <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be unkind about those poor girls.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{he must be}} back by this time. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{make the}} list for the match to-morrow. Where the deuce can Buckhurst be?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As usual; {{going on}} well, but slowly. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go away--to Stone Court, for example. But your mamma {{seems to have}} some objection." ...|$|R

5000|$|Denise Horvath-Allan {{believes}} her son {{died in the}} summer of 1989. [...] "How and by what means I don't know but something terrible happened to him that prevented him from calling home," [...] she said.

5000|$|In 2010, {{speaking}} {{of what he}} wanted his son Fenmore to be like, LeBlanc said [...] "I want Fenmore to be different. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a smart-ass because I play him that way. He would be Michael back to me, you know how children sometimes are, like little Michael and big Michael… really smart and verbal, which he is." [...] In fact, two years later, Fen was aged to fifteen years old and Max Ehrich stepped into the role. Fen became [...] "a chip off the old block", turning into a rebellious teen with attitude.|$|E
