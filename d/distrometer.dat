40|$|Abstract—A Z-R {{relation}} {{is derived}} using a data set {{which consists of}} nine rain events selected from Singapore’s drop size distribution. Rain events are separated into convective and stratiform types of rain using two methods: the Gamache-Houze method, a simple threshold technique, and the Atlas-Ulbrich method. In the Atlas-Ulbrich method, the variability of the rain integral parameters R, Z, Nw, D 0 and gamma model parameter µ are used for the classification of rain into convective, stratiform and transition. Z-R relations are derived {{for each type of}} rain after classification. The changes in the coefficients of the Z-R relations for different rain events are plotted and analyzed. The Z-R relations of the different methods using the Singapore data are compared and analyzed. It is concluded that the coefficient A of the Z-R relation is higher for the convective stage followed by the stratiform and transition stages. The coefficient b values are higher for the transition stage followed by the stratiform and convective stages. Reflectivities are extracted from RADAR data above NTU site for rain events and compared with the reflectivities derived from the <b>distrometer</b> data. Rain rates retrieved from RADAR data using the proposed relations from Singapore’s data set are compared with the <b>distrometer</b> rain rates. The RADAR extracted rain rates are found to be constantly lower than the <b>distrometer</b> derived rain rates but matches well...|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} from bulk to spectral bin microphysics schemes within {{numerical weather prediction}} (NWP) models promises more realistic simulations of cloud resolving processes and finally an improving of weather forecasting quality. However the needed size distributions of water drops and ice particles were parameterized from rare observations, typically from ground based rain <b>distrometers</b> or aircraft in-situ measurements. The current work introduces a retrieval method to derive size distributions from synergetic use of vertical pointed Ka-band and polarimetric C-band radar. The method is based on using the full height-resolved Doppler spectra instead of mean values of reflectivity and radial velocity inside the radar bin volume. Within a Mie and T-matrix based radar forward operator, Doppler spectra were simulated from assumed size distributions, {{taking into account the}} attenuation at Ka-band. In an iterative way, the parameters of distributions were varied until differences between simulated and observed radar profiles could minimized. Additional data e. g. from radiosounding and SODAR wind profilers were used to estimate and minimize the most relevant error sources expected from vertical air motion and turbulence. First results were achieved from a case study of 8 th July 2007 during the Convection and Orographically Induced Precipitation Study (COPS) ...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{rain rate}} is an {{important}} climatic variable and many entities are interested in obtaining accurate rain rate estimates. Rain rate, however, cannot be measured directly by currently available instrumentation. A hierarchical Bayes model is used as the framework for estimating rain rate parameters through time, conditional on observations from multiple instruments such as rain gauges, ground radars, and <b>distrometers.</b> The hierarchical model incorporates relationships between physical rainfall processes and collected data. A key feature of this model is the evolution of drop-size distributions (DSD) as a hidden process. An unobserved DSD is modeled as two independent component processes: 1) an AR(1) time-varying mean with GARCH errors for {{the total number of}} drops evolving through time, and 2) a time-varying lognormal distribution for the size of drops. From the modeled DSDs, precipitation parameters of interest, including rain rate, are calculated along with associated uncertainty. This model formulation deviates from the common notion of rain gauges as “ground truth”; rather, information from the various precipitation measurements is incorporated into the parameter estimates and the estimate of the hidden process. The model is implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods...|$|R

One convective event and one stratiform event are analysed in this paper, where the main goals are the correlation of brightness temperature and differential brightness temperature with rain rate and drop size distribution. By utilization of the results of radiative transfer calculations, an algorithm has been developed to derive an effective (path integrated) two-parameter drop size distribution from polarimetric radiometer measurements...|$|E
40|$|Rainfall {{simulation}} is {{a widely}} used method for soil erosion studies on agricultural land. Major problem of this experimental research method is the comparability between different simulators {{due to differences in}} simulated rainfall. Therefore {{the purpose of this study}} is to characterize the rainfall produced by a rainfall simulator which was widely used during the last decades. Four different calibration methods were used to assess the drop size distribution: (1) Indication Paper, (2) Plaster Micro Plot, (3) Joss–Waldvogel Disdrometer and (4) Laser <b>Distrometer</b> (Thies). Additionally, the latter one was used to measure drop fall velocity in combination with drop diameter. The spatial rainfall distribution pattern on the plot was measured with 100 rainfall gauges. The spatial rainfall distribution pattern clearly shows a heterogeneity, which is caused by the used nozzle configuration. Considerable differences in drop-size distribution can be observed depending on the used measurement technique. Laser Disdrometer and Plaster Micro Plot cover the whole produced drop size spectrum ranging from 3. 0 mm, whereas Indication Paper as well as the Joss–Waldvogel Disdrometer primarily show drops smaller than 2. 0 mm. Characterisation of rainfall is therefore strongly dependent on the used method and if different methods are used, may lead to contradictory results. The volume drop size distribution reflected by the Laser <b>Distrometer</b> is very similar to that one produced by rain with an intensity of 40 mm h- 1. Nevertheless, with maximum velocities above 10 m s- 1 small drops are by far too fast and large drops with velocities dominantly below 5 m s- 1 are too slow compared to natural rainfall. As an overall result, the simulator can be characterised as suitable for runoff and infiltration measurements, but with constraints due to the low reproducibility of the spatial rain distribution. As a consequence of the produced drop spectrum and fall velocity the erosion quantities may be underestimated systematically. For this, methodological development has to be focussed on homogeneous spatial rainfall distributions and on increasing the amount of large drops with higher fall velocitie...|$|E
40|$|For {{modelling}} attenuation and emitted radiometric radiation of a plane-parallel rain slab, {{the vector}} equation of radiative transfer is solved iteratively fully incorporating polarisation effects {{based on the}} bistatic scattering properties of spheroidal rain drops. Drop size spectra are derived from dual polarisation radiometer measurements, which are confirmed by <b>distrometer</b> and radar data. This became possible due to an achieved differential calibration accuracy of the radiometer better than #+-# 1 K. By schemes for automatic detection of rain, hail and melting band, {{in connection with the}} proper choice of a case-adequate propagation model, the accuracy of rain attenuation predictions by radiar reflectivity measurements could be considerably improved. Measurements of the 20 GHz beacon of the OLYMPUS satellite, as well as radiometer and rain gauge data are analysed in form of monthly and annual statistics and are compared with different models and results of previous experiments.

40|$|The {{verification}} of radar retrieval results like hydrometeor type, quantity, and dynamics of clouds {{is an essential}} requirement for assimilating observation data into Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. Field campaigns were executed to enrich the observational data base with special aims - for instance the Convection and Orographically Induced Precipitation Study (COPS) in 2007 iin south-west Germany and eastern France had planed to improve the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) in mountainous areas. Therefore {{a huge amount of}} different observation instruments were concentrated in the region around Black Forest, Vogues and Rhine valley especially at socalled supersites. The current study focus on comparison between polarimetric C-band and vertically pointed Ka-band to retrieve profiles of hydrometeor type and quantity. Additional data from radio sounding, rain gauges, and <b>distrometers</b> were used to retrieve temperature profile, rain rate, and raindrop size distribution at ground. The melting height level was used to confirm the spatial data synchronization of different radars. The predominant hydrometeor type were estimated from C-band radar by using polarimetric variables LDR and ZDR. Profiles of reflectivity differences from Ka- and C-band radar were analyzed to give a first guess of mean particle sizes as well as liquid and ice water content taking iinto account attenuation of radar beam. For comparisons additional simulations of radar reflectivity from C- and Ka- band by using T-matrix method were examined by assuming profiles of liquid water and ice particles. In a case study a more complex procedure was used to retrieve profiles of liquid and ice water content from measured raindrop size distribution at ground, vertical Doppler velocity from Ka-band radar and the attenuation corrected reflectivity difference from C- and Ka-band radar. To correct vertical velocity measurements from convective up- or downward motion additional data from an SODAR system were taken into account...|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that at high rainfall intensities, small raindrops may fall with much larger velocities than would be expected from their diameters. These were argued to be fragments of recently broken-up larger drops. In this paper we quantify {{the effect of this}} phenomenon on raindrop size distribution measurements from a Joss-Waldvogel disdrometer, a 2 -D Video <b>Distrometer,</b> and a vertically-pointing Doppler radar. Probability distributions of fall velocities have been parameterized, where the parameters are functions of both rainfall intensity and drop size. These parameterizations have been used to correct Joss-Waldvogel disdrometer measurements for this phenomenon. The effect of these corrections on fitted scaled drop size distributions are apparent but not major. Fitted gamma distributions for three different types of rainfall have been used to simulate drop size measurements. The effect of the high-velocity small drops is shown to be minor. Especially for the purpose of remote sensing of rainfall using radar, microwave links, or optical links, the errors caused by using the slightly different retrieval relations will be masked completely by other error source...|$|E
40|$|Intercomparison {{among three}} sensors for {{ground-based}} measurement of DSD's are presented, the Joss-Waldvogel <b>Distrometer</b> (JWD), the Optical Spectro-Pluviometer (OSP), and the Precipitation Occurrence Sensor System (POSS). This {{is done in}} order to quantifying any systematic bias that can be identified in their measurements, and to evaluate a new data acquisition system developed for the JWD. Data corresponding to stratiform, continental rain is analyzed, and a function (delta) is defined {{in order to provide}} a quantification of the relative differences between pairs of instruments. Significant differences in drop concentrations simultaneously measured by the instruments are found, being these about 100 % at the extremes of the diameter spectra. Bulk rain quantities, rain rate (R) and reflectivity (Z), do not show significant biases in POSS and OSP, although the Z-R relationships present a strong dependence with the sensor and the method for obtaining them. Analyzing an event of convective precipitation, it is concluded that neither POSS nor JWD can be used unattended without a criterion that filters observations during non-liquid precipitation. A problem in the new data acquisition system for the MID is identified, and a future project for its calibration is proposed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerical and observational {{study focused on}} ice-pellet formation and microphysical properties near 0 degrees C from an ice-pellet-dominated storm associated with an unusually warm and dry atmosphere on 10 April 2005, in Sapporo, Japan. A one-dimensional numerical model simulation indicated that precipitation particle temperatures were sensitive to environmental temperature and relative humidity {{and close to the}} wet-bulb temperature. The simulation demonstrated that completely melted snowflakes could refreeze by evaporative cooling. Moreover, initial freezing could be explained by contact ice nucleation {{at the height of the}} minimum wet-bulb temperature. Observations using a 2 D video <b>distrometer</b> (2 DVD) indicated that ice pellets exhibited two modes of fall velocities at surface temperatures near 0 degrees C during the same time period: slow falling and fast falling. The slow-falling ice pellets exhibited a velocity similar to the average terminal velocity of hail, whereas the velocities of the fast-falling ice pellets were closer to those of raindrops. Surface roundness and fracturing characteristics of ice pellets suggest that slow-falling ice pellets froze rapidly and uniformly in a relatively cold dry layer with a wet-bulb temperature near - 4 degrees C. In contrast, the fast-falling ice pellets exhibited the properties of ice particles with a wet smooth surface, suggesting that they froze slowly in a relatively warm layer by contacting ice crystals or splinters generated by preceding slow-falling ice pellets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{quest to}} {{understand}} the variation of rainfall microstructures at subtropical and equatorial regions is vital to rain attenuation studies. In this study, point rainfall datasets obtained at Butare (2 ◦ 36 ′S, 29 ◦ 44 ′E) and Durban (29 ◦ 52 ′S, 30 ◦ 58 ′E), are compared at the reflectivity threshold of 38 dBZ. Joss-Walvogel (JW) <b>distrometer</b> measurements collected from these two locations represent physical rainfall data from equatorial and subtropical climates respectively. The reflectivity threshold enables the classification of rainfall datasets into stratiform and convective (S-C) precipitation regimes. These thresholds, Rth, at Durban and Butare are analysed based on three known rainfall microphysical parameters: rain rate, rainfall Drop Size Distribution (DSD) and radar reflectivity. The results from rain rate distributions at the both regions are similar for both stratiform and convective classes. However, the sampled DSDs indicate the dominance of larger rain droplets at Butare compared to observations at Durban, irrespective of the rain classes. In addition, {{it is found that}} the reflectivity distributions at both regions, under stratiform and convective conditions, are distinct in their probability profiles. The overall S-C analysis implied that the reflectivity and DSD profiles at both regions — result in significant variation of predicted specific attenuation — at microwave and millimeter band. In comparison with other global locations, it is affirmed that the S-C transition occurs globally at rain rates between 6 mm/h and 13 mm/h. 1...|$|E
40|$|X-band-radar-based {{quantitative}} precipitation estimation (QPE) {{system is}} increasingly gaining interest {{thanks to its}} strength in providing high spatial resolution rainfall information for urban hydrological applications. However, prior to such applications, a variety of errors associated with X-band radars are mandatory to be corrected. In general, X-band radar QPE systems are affected by two types of errors: 1) common errors (e. g. mis-calibration, beam blockage, attenuation, non-precipitation clutter, variations in the raindrop size distribution) and 2) “wind drift” errors resulting from non-vertical falling of raindrops. In this study, we first assess the impacts of different corrections of common error using a dataset consisting of one-year reflectivity observations collected at an X-band radar site and a <b>distrometer</b> along with rainfall observations in Beijing urban area. The common error corrections demonstrate promising improvements in the rainfall estimates, even though an underestimate of 24. 6 % by the radar QPE system in the total accumulated rainfall still exists as compared with gauge observations. The most significant improvement is realized by beam integration correction. The DSD-related corrections (i. e., convective–stratiform classification and local Z - R relationship) also lead to remarkable improvement and highlight the necessity of deriving the localized Z - R relationships for specific rainfall systems. The effectiveness of wind drift correction is then evaluated for a fast-moving case, whose results indicate both the total accumulation and the temporal characteristics of the rainfall estimates can be improved. In conclusion, considerable potential of X-band radar in high-resolution rainfall estimation can be realized by necessary error corrections...|$|E
40|$|The {{character}} of precipitation detected {{at the surface}} is the final product of many microphysical interactions in the cloud above, the combined effects {{of which may be}} characterized by the observed drop size distribution (DSD). This necessitates accurate retrieval of the DSD from remote sensing data, especially radar as it offers large areal coverage, high spatial resolution, and rigorous quality control and testing. Combined instrument observations with a UHF wind profiler, an S-band polarimetric weather radar, and a video disdrometer are analyzed for two squall line events occuring during the calendar year 2007. UHF profiler Doppler velocity spectra are used to estimate the DSD aloft, and are complemented by DSDs retrieved from an exponential model applied to polarimetric data. Ground truth is provided by the disdrometer. A complicating factor in the retrieval from UHF profiler spectra is the presence of ambient air motion, which can be corrected using the method proposed by Teshiba et al. (2009), in which a comparison between idealized Doppler spectra calculated from the DSDs retrieved from KOUN and those retrieved from contaminated wind profiler spectra is performed. It is found that DSDs measured using the <b>distrometer</b> at the surface and estimated using the wind profiler and polarimetric weather radar generally showed good agreement. The DSD retrievals using the wind profiler were improved when the estimates of the vertical wind were included into the analysis, thus supporting the method of Teshiba et al. (2009).

40|$|Modelling {{raindrop}} {{size distribution}} (DSD) {{is a fundamental}} issue to connect remote sensing observations with reliable precipitation products for hydrological applications. To date, various standard probability distributions have been proposed to build DSD models. Relevant questions to ask indeed are how often and how good such models fit empirical data, given that the advances in both data availability and technology used to estimate DSDs have allowed many of the deficiencies of early analyses to be mitigated. Therefore, we present a comprehensive follow-up of a previous study on the comparison of statistical fitting of three common DSD models against 2 D-Video <b>Distrometer</b> (2 DVD) data, which are unique in {{that the size of}} individual drops is determined accurately. By maximum likelihood method, we fit models based on lognormal, gamma and Weibull distributions to more than 42. 000 1 -minute drop-by-drop data taken from the field campaigns of the NASA Ground Validation program of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. In order to check the adequacy between the models and the measured data, we investigate the goodness of fit of each distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Then, we apply a specific model selection technique to evaluate the relative quality of each model. Results show that the gamma distribution has the lowest KS rejection rate, while the Weibull distribution is the most frequently rejected. Ranking for each minute the statistical models that pass the KS test, {{it can be argued that}} the probability distributions whose tails are exponentially bounded, i. e. light-tailed distributions, seem to be adequate to model the natural variability of DSDs. However, in line with our previous study, we also found that frequency distributions of empirical DSDs could be heavy‐tailed in a number of cases, which may result in severe uncertainty in estimating statistical moments and bulk variables...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Network fade {{countermeasures}} for {{link budget}} {{can be better}} implemented based on the knowledge of seasonal variability of rainfall attenuation in a locality. Therefore, in this study, a seasonal approach is applied to estimate the effects of spatial rainfall attenuation in Durban (29 ◦ 52 ’S, 30 ◦ 58 ’E), South Africa using twoyear rainfall data obtained from the RD- 80 Joss-Waldvogel (J-W) <b>distrometer.</b> An analysis is undertaken for different seasons to obtain the rainfall rate exceedences at 0. 001 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 1 % and 1 % of time. Consequently, rainfall drop-size distribution (DSD) models are developed for the control site at different seasons for the same period. The probability density analysis for each model indicates that the lognormal distribution best fits the summer and autumn season with percentage root-mean-square errors (RMS) of 30 % and 26 % respectively; gamma distribution fits winter season with RMS error of 16 % and Weibull distribution fits spring season with RMS error of 26 %. The results from the rainfall rate and rainfall DSD are combined to estimate the rainfall specific attenuation, by applying spherical droplet assumption for Mie scattering techniques, between 2 GHz and 1000 GHz. With this, the seasonal k and α coefficients for specific attenuation are derived from the best rainfall DSD models, using regression technique at 2. 5 GHz, 25 GHz, 40 GHz and 100 GHz. At these frequencies, {{the results show that}} the predicted specific attenuation coefficients for all seasonal rainfall rates at the control site are lower, when compared to those from ITU-R models. It is concluded that specific attenuation levels may be similar and more intense in summer and autumn seasons, while, lower and less intense in autumn and winter seasons at similar rainfall rates...|$|E
