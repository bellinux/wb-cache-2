40|$|During the 1990 s, {{a number}} of {{airports}} around the United States radically changed the way they managed the retail space in their terminals. Departing from the traditional master concessionaire/operator model, airports began experimenting with branded <b>direct</b> <b>leasing</b> programs and outsourcing to third party developers. Serving over 700 million domestic airline passengers annually, and until recently overlooked by the retail development community at large, the airport network presents a significant market for retail development. We review the issues surrounding airport retail management, {{the genesis of the}} branded, mall- style and developer-run programs, and evaluate the relative performance of different management models both quantitatively and qualitatively, based on recent sales data and case studies of {{a number of}} airports. Data for this report was collected June/July 2002 in the form of publicly available data from industry trade groups and journals, interviews with members of airport business offices, developers active in airport retail, and firms providing concessionaire service to airports. by Ahron B.

5000|$|Business Express {{embarked}} {{a significant}} route and fleet expansion beginning in 1993, although its facilities at hub airports Boston Logan International Airport, and New York City's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports {{were unable to}} effectively accommodate the influx in passenger boardings and aircraft movements. In May 1995, the carrier inaugurated a major expansion and renovation of its primary passenger hub at Boston Logan. Negotiated as a <b>direct</b> <b>lease</b> with Massport, this long-awaited facilities upgrade substantially increased gate and ramp space in the [...] "C" [...] concourse. Enhancements included improved Americans with Disabilities Act compliance, new airside elevators, upgraded signage, and refurbishment of all passenger lounge areas. Gatehouse expansion allowed the airline to reduce remote bus boardings, whereby 80 percent of the airline's daily departures were serviced directly from the terminal. Service was increased to both Bangor and Portland in Maine utilizing Avro RJ-70 jets and Saab 340 aircraft. Additional round-trip service was added between Boston Logan and Washington National Airport, bringing {{the total number of}} roundtrips to five daily, in addition to Delta's three mainline flights.

In wireline telephony, the original hosted PBX was the Centrex service provided by telcos since the 1960s; later competitive offerings evolved into the modern competitive local exchange carrier. In voice over IP, hosted solutions are easier to implement as the PBX may be located at and managed by any telephone service provider, connecting to the individual extensions via the Internet.

50|$|The telecom {{infrastructure}} {{falls in}} the category of lifeline installations and BTS towers are a critical infrastructure for providing essential communication service. Companies who have been granted the Access Service License under section-4 of Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 and the companies which are registered as Infrastructure Providers under category IP-I are the only ones authorized to set up the mobile towers in country. The IP-I registered companies shall provide dark fibres, Right of Way, duct space and towers on lease, renting out, or on sale basis to the licensees of telecom services on mutually agreed terms and conditions. The access service providers can create the telecom infrastructure including telecommunication network and may provide the voice and non voice services to the customers. As of 15 December 2015, a total of 572 companies are registered under the IP-I category and 163 companies have been granted the access service license in 21 service areas.To reduce the capital expenditure, IP-1 companies and access service providers are entering into <b>direct</b> <b>lease</b> agreement with the individual property owners. The employees or representatives of the telecom company negotiates with the property owners and obtains the lease right for installation of mobile tower on the vacant land or roof top. A telecom tower company agrees to pay the monthly rent to property owners and both are entered into a long term registered lessor-lessee contract. Sometimes, family members of property owners obtain indirect benefits, such as securing the job of caretaker or security guard of the mobile towers and electric connection from the tower. These indirect benefits are normally not the part of lease agreement or terms and conditions of the contract. The mobile tower rent contracts ensure a long term rental income to the lessor (i.e., property owner) wherein the lessee (i.e., telecom tower company) enjoys the usage right for the property and provide the mobile services in the area.|$|R

50|$|The act {{chartering}} American Western University {{was never}} repealed. The state had the College Townships appraised in 1803. On February 18, 1804, the Ohio legislature passed another “act establishing {{a university in}} the town of Athens.” This act named the university “Ohio University” and authorized the trustees to lease the land “for the term of ninety years, renewable forever, on a yearly rent of six percentum on the amount of valuation” subject to re-evaluation after 35 and 60 years. No leases were taken, as land in adjacent townships could be bought outright for one dollar per acre or less, and no one would risk such re-evaluations. In February 1805, the state <b>directed</b> that <b>leases</b> should run for 99 years, renewable forever, at six percent of appraised valuation. In 1826 the university was permitted to sell lands within the townships, but for leased lands, the rent established in 1805 still prevails.|$|R
50|$|Most lessor {{accounting}} is not substantially changed between ASC 840 and ASC 842. The {{change from}} executory costs to nonlease components, discussed above, applies equally to lessors. Leveraged leasing is discontinued, though leveraged leases entered into before the effective date of ASC 842 {{can continue to}} be accounted for under ASC 840 unless they are modified. The distinction between sales-type and <b>direct</b> financing <b>leases</b> has changed: whereas in ASC 840 the test was whether the fair value of the leased asset {{was different from the}} lessor's cost or carrying amount (if so, the lease is a sales-type lease), in ASC 842, any lessor lease that meets the lessee finance lease tests (based on rents and guaranteed residuals due from the lessee) is a sales-type lease; direct financing treatment applies if the lease is capital only because a third-party residual guarantee causes the present value test to be met.|$|R
50|$|Under {{a capital}} lease, the lessor credits owned assets and debits a lease {{receivable}} {{account for the}} present value of the rents (an asset, which is broken out between current and long-term, the latter being {{the present value of}} rents due more than 12 months in the future). With each payment, cash is debited, the receivable is credited, and unearned (interest) income is credited. If the cost or carrying amount of the asset being leased is different from its fair value at inception, then the difference is recognized as a profit and the lease is called a sales-type lease. This most commonly applies when a manufacturer is using leasing as a method of selling its product. Other capital lessor leases, where the cost and fair value are the same, are called <b>direct</b> financing <b>leases.</b> A third type of lessor capital lease, called a leveraged lease, is used to recognize leases where the acquisition of the leased asset is substantially financed by debt.|$|R
50|$|For an {{operating}} lease, a liability and a right-of-use asset {{are set up}} at lease inception, at {{the present value of}} the rents plus any guaranteed residual. To the asset is added any initial direct costs and subtracted any lease incentives (such as a tenant improvement allowance). The liability is amortized using the interest method (like a mortgage). If the lease has the same rent over its life, the net asset at any point is equal to the liability, plus the unamortized balance of initial <b>direct</b> costs and <b>lease</b> incentives. If the rents change during the lease term, the difference between the cash rent and average rent is added to or subtracted from the asset as well.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} growth in rates of new-car leasing {{over the last}} few decades. Building on recent theoretical research, we construct a model of the leasing decision in which leasing mitigates adverse selection and reduces transaction costs, but moral hazard limits its use. In our model, the prevalence of leasing is related to new-car reliability, which suggests that the recent growth in leasing is at least partly due to improvements in new-car reliability. We use this model to derive testable implications and then conduct an empirical analysis to investigate whether the operation of the new- and used-car markets is consistent with the predictions of this theoretical approach. Our empirical results support the theoretical predictions of our model. In particular, we provide <b>direct</b> evidence that <b>leasing</b> mitigates adverse selection and that an important factor in the growth in new-car leasing rates has indeed been the growth of new-car reliability...|$|R
5000|$|Closed-end leases {{have become}} very popular for {{automobile}} buyers in North America since the mid-1980s. Shield laws in most states allow lessors to avoid legal responsibility {{for the actions of}} their lessees, which has made it practical for automakers to offer <b>leases</b> <b>direct</b> to consumers without fear of [...] "deep pockets" [...] liability for injuries resulting from an accident. In those states which assess a use tax on vehicles, lessees need only pay tax on the amount of their lease payment, not on the entire value of their vehicle at the time of purchase. Finally, and most significantly, because lessees pay only for depreciation and financing, and not the entire retail cost of the vehicle, payments can be significantly lower than in loan-based financing. This allows consumers to significantly shorten their purchase cycle, increasing new-vehicle sales, which gives the automakers reason to emphasize leasing programs in their marketing.|$|R

40|$|The {{retention}} rate {{of a company}} {{has an impact on}} its earnings and dividend growth. Corporate management has control over this. However, lease structures in some real estate markets reduce the control of investment managers and force them to adopt full distribution policies and a passive management style. This is likely to impact the rental performance of the real estate by permitting depreciation to go uncorrected. This paper examines several European office markets across which lease structures and {{retention rate}}s vary. It then compares depreciation rates across these markets. It is concluded that there is evidence of a relationship between retention and depreciation. Markets with particularly inflexible lease structures clearly exhibit low retention rates, and we can tentatively suggest higher levels of rental value depreciation. This poses interesting questions concerning the relationships between lease structures in different markets and their impact on expenditure by owners, and also concerning the impact on building depreciation and property performance. While longer and deeper datasets are necessary to establish <b>direct</b> linkages between <b>lease</b> structures and performance, this paper raises important issues for global investors...|$|R
40|$|Three main {{criteria}} should govern a privatisation plan: speed, fairness, {{and efficient}} control. From this view we derive our optimum scheme, though we recognise {{that in most}} countries it needs modifying to existing circumstances. 1. Privatisation should be by gift, not sale. But distribution by gift does not require distribution through vouchers. 2. To ensure efficient control of restructuring, there should be holding companies, each being the chief owner of enterprise drawn {{from a range of}} industries. Citizens should be given shares in each holding company. The holding company should be charged to restructure its enterprises and then sell all (or at least 50 per cent) of its shares within a 10 -year period. The final pattern of owners would include citizens, workers, foreigners, and pension funds, but provision would be made for some ''stable core'' of owners - either interlocking ownership among firms, or major holdings by foreigners, banks or holding companies. 3. For smaller companies a different approach would suffice, involving <b>direct</b> sale or <b>leasing.</b> 4. If mass unemployment is to be avoided, it is crucial to create a mass market in housing. The only way to do this quickly is to give all houses to their existing tenants...|$|R
5000|$|The Preliminary Views {{and first}} Exposure Draft called for {{eliminating}} the FAS 13 test which classifies leases as operating leases or capital leases, and treating all leases similarly to current capital leases. All leases would {{be accounted for}} as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet - on the asset side as [...] "right-of-use assets" [...] and on the liability side as lease liabilities; on the income statement, depreciation and interest expense would be recognized instead of rent expense. One implication {{of this is that}} expenses are [...] "front loaded," [...] because interest expense is higher {{in the early part of}} the lease term while the liability is higher. Following substantial protests from both financial statements preparers and users, the second Exposure Draft reinstated two types of lease accounting, with [...] "Type A" [...] leases treated essentially the same as FAS 13 capital leases and [...] "Type B" [...] leases maintaining the single lease expense, straight line over the life of the lease, that characterizes FAS 13 operating leases, but with an asset and liability on the balance sheet. The liability would be the present value of the remaining rents; the asset would be the same as the liability for simple leases, but then adjusted for scheduled changes in rents (which under FAS 13 result in a deferred rent liability or asset) and amortization of initial <b>direct</b> costs and <b>lease</b> incentives. Effective with the second Exposure Draft, the new standard has been given the new Accounting Standards Codification topic number 842 (the topic number for leases was previously 840).|$|R
