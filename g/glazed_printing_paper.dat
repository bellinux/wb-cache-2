However, little research exits that evaluates the impact of text presented in a digital format compared to large <b>print</b> <b>paper</b> text for students with visual impairments. In this single-subject study, the author investigated silent and oral reading fluency, reading comprehension, reading errors, and leisure reading rates on two formats (large <b>print</b> <b>paper</b> and the iPad 2).
