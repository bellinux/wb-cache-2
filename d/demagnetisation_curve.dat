40|$|A fully {{automatic}} {{system has been}} designed for the accurate measurement of the DC magnetic properties of soft and hard ferromagnetic materials utilising discrete calibrated instruments {{in order to provide}} a traceable calibration route separate from the transfer of standard magnetic test samples. Custom written software is used to operate the system in one of three modes, constant dH/dt, variable dH/dt and a second quadrant <b>demagnetisation</b> <b>curve</b> mode. The first two of these modes are utilised for soft magnetic materials with the second mode varying dH/dt in order to keep dB/dt relatively constant. Both modes use cycle times of between 60 and 300 s and may utilise a variety of test configurations including a bar permeameter, electromagnet, ring samples or Epstein frame. The minimum cycle time and the most appropriate mode is dependent on the particular sample and the effect of this on materials with a large dB/dH is significant. Measurements on soft materials include major BH loop, minor BH loops, first-order reversal curves, remanence, coercivity, normal magnetisation curve, peak permeability and loop area. The third mode is used with an electromagnet to measure the <b>demagnetisation</b> <b>curve</b> of hard magnetic materials up to a maximum demagnetisation field of 1. 6 MA/m. The measurement algorithm modulates dH/dt depending on dB/dt and incorporates holdback in order to accommodate rare earth materials which exhibit high viscosity...|$|E
40|$|Fine-grained, heavy {{rare earth}} free Nd-Fe-B {{sintered}} magnets were prepared from He jet milled powders {{with an average}} particle size of 1. 5 µm by low temperature sintering at 920 °C or 980 °C. A coercivity of > 1600 kA/m was achieved for an average grain size of 1. 68 µm. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the distribution and composition of intergranular and grain boundary junction phases {{was similar to that}} in conventionally processed magnets. Microstructural analysis on different length scales revealed the occurrence of abnormal grain growth, which is unexpected for sintering temperatures below 1000 °C. A larger area fraction of abnormal grains was observed in the sample sintered at 920 °C compared to that sintered at 980 °C. Microtexture investigation showed a better crystallographic alignment of the abnormal grains compared to the fine-grained matrix, which is explained by a size dependent alignment of the powder particles during magnetic field alignment prior to sintering. Slightly larger particles in the initial powder show a better alignment and will act as nucleation sites for abnormal grain growth. Magneto-optical Kerr investigations confirmed the lower switching field of the abnormal grains compared to the fine-grained matrix. The <b>demagnetisation</b> <b>curve</b> of the sample sintered at 920 °C showed reduced rectangularity and this was attributed to a cooperative effect of the larger fraction of abnormal grains with low switching field and, as a minor effect, a reduced degree of crystallographic texture in this sample compared to the material sintered at 980 °C, which did not show the reduced rectangularity of the <b>demagnetisation</b> <b>curve...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} medium noise and Neutron Depolarisation in {{recording}} media {{has been made}} {{as a function of}} remanent magnetisation along the isothermal remanence and dc <b>demagnetisation</b> remanence <b>curves.</b> The measurements are discussed in relation to VSM measurements of the remanent characteristics. Medium noise measurements are presented for commercial particulate media, experimental barium ferrite media and commercial metal evaporated thin film media, while Neutron Depolarisation measurements are presented for commercial particulate media alone. The results show that medium noise is not a unique function of magnetisation, but is also dependent upon the magnetic rnicrostructure brought about through its magnetic history; a microstructure which is in turn also dependent upon the physical microstructure. This is seen through asymmetry in the observed noise during dc demagnetisation, and also in observed differences in noise between the two remanence curves In particular, a distinct difference is seen between the dc erased and ac erased states, where efficient flux closure and lower energy configurations are attributing factors to the lower ac erased noise. An effect which is also supported by Neutron Depolarisation results in these states. Through the choice of samples with distinctly different physical microstructures within each media type studied, the medium noise measurements show how important a role the physical rnicrostructure has in its effect on the magnetic microstructure, illustrating that the sensitivity of medium noise measurements as a natural probe of the magnetic and physical microstructures is an important source of information towards the general characterisation and understanding of magnetic recording materials...|$|R
