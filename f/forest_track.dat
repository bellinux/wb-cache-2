25|$|The Germans {{attacked}} at {{dawn and}} it was all over by 14:00. As the Germans searched the forest the SAS men tried to break out. A party of 34 were moving down a <b>forest</b> <b>track</b> when they were ambushed and captured. The leader of the party, Lieutenant Tomos Stephens, was beaten to death by a German officer using a rifle butt; seven captured Maquisards were executed in the woods. The SAS men and the US pilot should have been treated as prisoners of war. However, their fate was determined by the issue of the Commando Order by Adolf Hitler which called for the execution of commandos. The decision of who was going to execute them was the cause of an argument between the German Army and the SS. It was decided that the army would carry out the execution. On 7 July, the surviving prisoners of war, 30 SAS men and Second Lieutenant Bundy, were taken into the woods near to St Sauvant, forced to dig their own graves then executed by a German firing squad at dawn under the command of SS Major Josef Kieffer. Their bodies were then buried in a mass grave. Three Special Air Service men who had been wounded and hospitalized were killed by the administration of lethal injections. The men executed in the woods were re-interred in the village cemetery of Rom, Deux-Sèvres. The bodies of the three men executed in the hospital have never been found, but they are commemorated by a plaque among their comrades' headstones in Rom.|$|E

60|$|On {{the second}} morning they mounted {{before the day}} had quite broken, in order that they might breakfast on {{the summit of the}} ridge which {{separates}} the two oceans. At this spot the good road comes to an end, and the <b>forest</b> <b>track</b> begins; and here also, they would, in truth, enter the forest, though their path had for some time been among straggling trees and bushes. And now, again, they rode two and two, up to this place of halting, Arkwright and Ring well knowing that from hence their labours would in truth commence.|$|E

60|$|The {{difficulties}} were formidable. One or two light field pieces could, at the most, {{be taken}} with the column. They would have to march by a narrow and winding footpath, through a thick forest, exposed at any moment to a desperate attack by the enemy. Moreover, {{it would be necessary}} to leave a strong force for the defence of Rangoon, as Bandoola would be sure to learn, from his spies, of the intended movement and, having with him men intimately acquainted with every <b>forest</b> <b>track,</b> could make a rush down upon the town during the absence of so many of its defenders.|$|E
60|$|After well {{wringing}} out our {{wet clothes}} {{and putting them}} on, we again proceeded along a similar narrow <b>forest</b> <b>track</b> as before, choked with rotten leaves and dead trees, and in the more open parts overgrown with tangled vegetation. Another hour brought us to a smaller stream flowing in a wide gravelly bed, up which our road lay. Here w e stayed {{half an hour to}} breakfast, and then went on, continually crossing the stream, or walking on its stony and gravelly banks, till about noon, when it became rocky and enclosed by low hills. A little further we entered a regular mountain-gorge, and had to clamber over rocks, and every moment cross and recross the water, or take short cuts through the forest. This was fatiguing work; and about three in the afternoon, the sky being overcast, and thunder in the mountains indicating an approaching storm, we had to loon out for a camping place, and soon after reached one of Mr. Rosenberg's old ones. The skeleton of his little sleeping-hut remained, and my men cut leaves and made a hasty roof just as the rain commenced. The baggage was covered over with leaves, and the men sheltered themselves as they could till the storm was over, by which time a flood came down the river, which effectually stopped our further march, even had we wished to proceed. We then lighted fires; I made some coffee, and my men roasted their fish and plantains, and {{as soon as it was}} dark, we made ourselves comfortable for the night.|$|E
60|$|Thus conversing, {{they entered}} {{sufficiently}} {{deep into the}} wood to secure themselves from the observation of any casual passenger along the <b>forest</b> <b>track.</b> Here they {{sat down on a}} luxuriant heap of moss; which at some epoch of the preceding century, had been a gigantic pine, with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade, and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere. It was a little dell where they had seated themselves, with a leaf-strewn bank rising gently on either side, and a brook flowing through the midst, over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves. The trees impending over it had flung down great branches from time to time, which choked up the current, and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points; while, in its swifter and livelier passages there appeared a channel-way of pebbles, and brown, sparkling sand. Letting the eyes follow along the course of the stream, they could catch the reflected light from its water, at some short distance within the forest, but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of tree-trunks and underbrush, and here and there a huge rock covered over with gray lichens. All these giant trees and boulders of granite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of this small brook; fearing, perhaps, that, with its never-ceasing loquacity, it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest whence it flowed, or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface of a pool. Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance and events of sombre hue.|$|E

50|$|From Fort Augustus {{the route}} climbs {{away from the}} canal and up into the forest above Loch Ness. There are views from the high level <b>forest</b> <b>track</b> which {{eventually}} drops into Invermoriston and out by a steep climb. High level <b>forest</b> <b>track</b> leads into the hamlet of Grotaig then alongside the road until a path heads down through Clunebeg Wood to {{the banks of the}} River Coiltie and Borlum Bridge. Then through the village of Drumnadrochit, and up a steep hill to Abriachan. The Great Glen Way ascends a <b>forest</b> <b>track</b> giving good views traversing through the forest. Leaving the road at Blackfold, the waymarking indicates <b>forest</b> <b>track</b> at Craig Leach Forest which eventually emerges at a reservoir. The route runs downhill through the suburbs of Inverness, then follows the canal and the River Ness to the city centre, finishing at Inverness Castle.|$|E
