5|$|Phantom Blood {{was created}} using a ki-shō-ten-ketsu {{structure}} – introduction (ki), development (shō), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) – {{along with the}} rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time {{in relation to their}} starting point {{in the beginning of the}} story, and not stagnate or regress. Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar <b>growth</b> <b>curve</b> for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided to bend the rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable to do such a thing in a shōnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit to be passed to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While calling it a gamble, he called this passing of the torch a positive that enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist.|$|E

500|$|Most age {{categories}} of Albertosaurus {{are represented in}} the fossil record. Using bone histology, the age of an individual animal {{at the time of}} death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species. The youngest known Albertosaurus is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50 kilograms (110lb) and measured slightly more than [...] in length. The [...] specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an S-shaped <b>growth</b> <b>curve</b> results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was [...] per year, based on an adult 1.3tonnes. Other studies have suggested higher adult weights; this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate, but not the overall pattern. Tyrannosaurids similar in size to Albertosaurus had similar growth rates, although the much larger Tyrannosaurus rex grew at almost five times this rate ( [...] per year) at its peak. The end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of sexual maturity in Albertosaurus, although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives. Sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and elephants. This pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing.|$|E

The original NCHS growth charts are currently being revised to incorporate additional national data, to include <b>growth</b> <b>curves</b> for body mass index (BMI, in kg/m 2), to reduce or eliminate dis-continuities, and to use new and improved methods of smoothing. Methods of curve smoothing in the development of <b>growth</b> <b>curves</b> are briefly discussed {{in the context of this}} revision by using examples based on the provisional data set for revision of the <b>growth</b> <b>curves.</b> Among the factors that may affect the construction of the revised <b>growth</b> <b>curves</b> are sample sizes, sampling weights, and secular trends. The use of BMI or other weight-height indexes in <b>growth</b> <b>curves</b> presents some new issues because these transformations of weight and height data do not increase monotonically with age. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of several different approaches to creating smoothed percentiles and standardized scores are discussed briefly. These effects need to be considered in the broader context of constructing <b>growth</b> <b>curves.</b> No single method of developing smoothed curves is clearly the best for all purposes, and estimates of overweight and underweight may be sensitive to the method chosen.

2500|$|The {{development}} of the bluefin trevally larvae after hatching has been briefly described {{in a study of}} changes in the digestive enzymes of the species. The species has depleted its storage of energy from the egg at 3 days old, with a series of transformations including coiling of the gut and fin formation occurring before flexion at 26 days of age. Digestive enzymes active from hatching to 30 days old show an apparent shift from carbohydrate utilisation to protein and lipid utilisation as the larvae grows older. Measurements from juveniles in Hawaii indicate the fish is around 70mm by 100 days and 130mm by 200 days. Otolith data fitted to the von Bertalanffy <b>growth</b> <b>curve</b> shows the species grows to 194mm in its first year, 340mm in the second and 456mm in the third year. It reaches 75cm by 8 years of age and 85cm by 12 years. [...] This model also suggests a growth of 0.45mm/day; while laboratory feeding studies found the fish grow at an average of 0.4mm/day in these confined conditions. The maximum theoretical size indicated from the growth curves is 89.7cm, [...] much less than the 117cm reported as the known maximum size. Juveniles often enter estuaries, however the species is not estuary dependant as breeding is known to occur where no estuaries are present, suggesting the use of these habitats is facultative.
