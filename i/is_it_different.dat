Do we really believe that? If children are a gift from God, let’s {{for the sake of}} argument ask ourselves what other gift or blessing from God we would reject. Money? Would we reject great wealth if God gave it? Not likely! How about good health? Many would say that a man’s health is his most treasured possession. But children? Even children given by God? [...] "That’s different!" [...] some will plead! All right, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>different?</b> God states right here in no-nonsense language that children are gifts.
