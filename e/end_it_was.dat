5|$|Australia took a first innings lead of 134 and Davidson removed Subba Row and Barrington {{with the}} new ball in the second innings to end with 2/50 and help set up a five wicket victory. Davidson was at the crease when the winning runs were scored, albeit at the non-striker's <b>end.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> the first time Davidson had tasted Test victory on English soil in three tours.|$|E
5|$|Except for its two stations—one at {{each end}} of the tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The line was built in less than three months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's <b>end,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not included in the 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E

5|$|The torpedo {{struck the}} after {{portion of the}} {{starboard}} side of the Houston, blowing 20 men overboard and spreading gasoline fires in the waters around the cruiser. Initially unsure whether the ship would hold together, the captain ordered the evacuation of 300 crew members while the ship's condition was ascertained. In the <b>end</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> determined she would stay afloat. Towing continued as before, slowly moving the task group towards the Navy base at Ulithi.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In the <b>end</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} June 2017 to extend Tonkin Highway north, past Ellenbrook {{and through the}} Swan Valley to Brand Highway and Great Northern Highway in Muchea. Interchanges are planned at {{junctions}} with Reid Highway, Hepburn Avenue and Beechboro Road North, Gnangara Road, The Promenade, Stock Road, Neaves road and Brand Highway and Great Northern Highway. The 3rd stage was originally planned to be a 2 lane single-carriageway road with at-grade intersections, with provision for upgrading in the future, but in the <b>end,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> decided that the ultimate plan with a 4 lane dual-carriageway was to go ahead. The previously planned route of the PDNH, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park. Construction is due to be completed mid 2019.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{initial safety}} concerns, DC-10 {{aircraft}} continued {{to serve with}} passenger airlines for over 30 years after the crash of Flight 191. In the <b>end,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> newer, more fuel-efficient twin-engined airplanes from Boeing and Airbus and not safety concerns that ultimately ended the passenger career of the DC-10. Many retired passenger DC-10s have since been converted to all-cargo use. DC-10 freighters, along with its derivative, the MD-11, form {{the backbone of the}} FedEx Express fleet. The DC-10s have been upgraded with the glass cockpit from the MD-11, thereby turning them into MD-10s. American Airlines retired its last DC-10s in 2000 after 29 years of service. In February 2014, Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated the final DC-10 passenger flights. DC-10s continue to be used extensively in air freight operations, and military variants also remain in service.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{to end the}} impasse, Shackleton agreed, in {{a letter}} to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to work to the east of the 170°W {{meridian}} and therefore to avoid all the familiar Discovery ground. In the <b>end</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E
5|$|Iowa State {{took some}} {{outstanding}} players to Norman, {{but in the}} <b>end</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not enough to win. Quarterback Brent Meyer was the all-time leader in passing yards and total offense at ISU. He finished the season with the Cyclone record for career touchdowns as well. Meyer was complemented by wide receiver Todd Blythe who {{led the nation in}} career yards per catch (19.0) and was fifth on the career touchdown receptions list (25) before the game. ISU linebacker Alvin Bowen also led the nation in tackles per game this season and had 17against Nebraska. The special teams of the Cyclones was led by Ryan Baum who was averaging 18.0yards per punt return and had scored one touchdown.|$|E

5|$|The David Longhurst Stand {{opened in}} 1991 after a roof was erected on the Shipton Street <b>End.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{named after the}} former York player David Longhurst, who died during a match at the ground in 1990. Bootham Crescent hosted {{football}} in the Football League from 1932 to 2004 and from 2012 to 2016, both spells ending after York were relegated into non-League football. The ground was renamed KitKat Crescent from 2005 to 2010 {{as part of a}} sponsorship deal with Nestlé. York are expected to move to a community stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington in early 2018, and the Bootham Crescent site will be used for housing.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y {{with the}} Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, {{or at the}} Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was considered, but in the <b>end</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> decided that a remote location would be best. A site {{in the vicinity of}} Los Angeles was rejected on security grounds, and one near Reno, Nevada as being too inaccessible. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The climate was mild, there were air and rail connections to Albuquerque, it was sufficiently distant from the West Coast of the United States for a Japanese attack not to be an issue, and the population density was low.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} given the go-ahead; the Horsas were {{modified}} to jettison their landing gear after takeoff to reduce drag, while the Halifax bombers were modified with long-range fuel tanks fitted in the bomb bays. The pilots for the gliders came from No.2 Wing, having been left in England {{when most of the}} wing departed for Tunisia earlier in the year. An eleven-week period of training followed, during which four crashes killed thirteen men. At a mission conference on 21 May 1943, hosted by No. 38 Wing RAF, the impossibility of training the bomber crews to tow the gliders and deliver forty gliders to North Africa was discussed. In the <b>end</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> decided that as a priority ten bomber crews would be fully trained to deliver around fifteen gliders to North Africa by 21 June.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} {{developed as a}} vehicle and sitcom debut for Shannen Doherty under the working title Wingwoman. Though picked up by UPN, Doherty {{was removed from the}} project {{at the request of the}} network due to her poor reception by preview audiences; she was replaced by Philipps. The show was set in New York City, but filming took place at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles and other locations in California. It included contemporary hip hop music and was promoted heavily by UPN to attract an urban audience, and to that <b>end</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> paired with Everybody Hates Chris as its lead-in on Thursday nights.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically, {{the game}} used Fire Emblem {{elements}} as motifs, but took its setting and premise of {{a clash between}} worlds from Shin Megami Tensei. The battle system was originally going {{to be similar to}} a Fire Emblem game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system. After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together. Its upbeat focus on character drama was a deliberate shift away from the dark scenarios of the Megami Tensei series. The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating Fire Emblem characters, as characters in medieval armor just dropping into a modern setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing Fire Emblem characters as human party members. In the <b>end,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of Shin Megami Tensei, drawn into the real world from their Idolosphere dimension.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1922 the {{coalition}} government Birkenhead {{was a member of}} began to splinter, and when it finally collapsed Birkenhead was forced to resign on 25 October 1922. His replacement was Lord Cave, a member of the new Conservative government who was appointed on 27 October 1922. The Conservative government under Stanley Baldwin soon ran into trouble due to his desire to introduce protectionist tariffs to protect British jobs. Baldwin called an early general election in December 1923 to serve as a referendum on the subject, and although the Conservatives remained the largest party they did not have enough Members of Parliament to claim a parliamentary majority. At the opening of the new Parliament in January 1924 the party was defeated in a vote of no confidence, and the king instead invited the Labour Party under Ramsay MacDonald to form a government. This caused various constitutional problems; traditionally every member of a cabinet, including the Prime Minister, must be a Privy Councillor. MacDonald was not a Privy Councillor, and therefore could not be made Prime Minister. The king asked Lord Cave for a way around this problem, and as an expert on constitutional issues Schuster helped draft the response. In the <b>end</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> determined that MacDonald would be sworn in as a Privy Councillor and then invited to form a government.|$|E

5|$|The X-Files {{was a hit}} for the Fox {{network and}} {{received}} largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, {{it turned into a}} pop culture touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced conspiracy theories and spirituality. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple awards and nominations, and by the <b>end</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a franchise which includes The Lone Gunmen spin-off, two theatrical films and accompanying merchandise. After the final theatrical film in 2008, fans continued to push for a third movie to conclude the series' plot lines, and in March 2015, Fox eventually announced that the series would return, with Chris Carter as executive producer and writer, and Duchovny, Anderson, Pileggi, Davis, and Gish all reprising their roles.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y at Oak Ridge was considered, {{but in the}} <b>end</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{decided that}} it should be in a remote location. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search for a suitable site was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch. In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Project was sent to survey the area, and he recommended a site near Jemez Springs, New Mexico. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned with the possibility of flooding. The party then moved on to the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, it was hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E
5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} of Crystal Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers spent much time on taking all demands from staff into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working on the individual tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance. Unable to wait any longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with the engine. In the <b>end,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus of Crystal Tools and the game's team began cooperating with the Research and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support of Crystal Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the engine out to other companies at some point in the future, although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E
