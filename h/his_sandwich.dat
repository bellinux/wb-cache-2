5|$|The {{production}} continues, {{and after}} the filming of a pool scene the crew gather in catering; Beeman discovers a severed finger in <b>his</b> <b>sandwich,</b> recognizing from its ring that it belonged to Niederman. When the sheriff shuts down production, Black theorizes that the killer may target the crew's hotel; he and Hollis arrive to find {{the body of the}} film's publicist hanging from a rope. The next day, a film extra (Gene Simmons) confesses to the killings; Black pokes holes in his story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator. Regardless, production is resumed—and shortly afterwards, several crew members are found with their throats cut, while Winston's body hangs nearby in an apparent murder-suicide.|$|E
500|$|At a diner in Brooklyn, New York, a {{bald man}} with no eyebrows sits down at a table and orders a raw roast beef {{sandwich}} with eleven jalapeño peppers {{and a glass of}} room temperature water. When the sandwich arrives, he drowns it in Tabasco sauce and black pepper and wolfs it down in large, quick bites, to the bemusement of the diner staff. During this time he is also watching the construction site across the street through high-tech binoculars and taking notes from right to left in unrecognizable characters. The ground shakes and a gas main explodes at the site, toppling a crane. The bald man—the Observer—calmly pays for <b>his</b> <b>sandwich</b> and wanders to the gaping hole where the construction site was. On a wireless phone, he says [...] "It has arrived." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{possible}} fathers of the hamburger is Charlie Nagreen (1871–1951) of Seymour, Wisconsin, who {{at the age of}} 15 sold Hamburg steaks from a street stall at the annual Outagamie County Fair. Nagreen said he began by selling Hamburg steaks, but these did not have much success because people wanted to freely move around the festival without the need to eat them at his stand. In response to this, in 1885 Nagreen decided to flatten the hamburger steak and insert it between two slices of bread, so that the public could move freely from booth to booth while eating <b>his</b> <b>sandwich,</b> an innovation that was well received by his customers. This became known as the [...] "Hamburger Charlie", and Nagreen's creation was sold at the festival until his death in 1951. To this day, his accomplishment is celebrated annually with a [...] "Burger Fest" [...] in his honor in his hometown of Seymour.|$|E
60|$|Jacob ate half <b>his</b> <b>sandwiches,</b> drank a {{good deal}} of whisky and water, and took a little exercise. He then had a nap, woke up and {{finished}} <b>his</b> <b>sandwiches</b> with an amazingly good appetite, had another whisky and water and thrust the flask into his pocket. He lit a cigarette, doubled up his coat, and was lounging against the wall when he heard the key once more turn in the lock of the downstairs door. There was the sound of ascending footsteps, and presently Montague's glittering shirt front appeared through the grating. Joe Hartwell again was by his side. They peered in.|$|R
50|$|The {{store was}} able to realize a profit its first year of business, despite the poor {{location}} of the store, due to Jimmy John’s willingness to deliver <b>his</b> <b>sandwiches</b> to the nearby dorms at Eastern Illinois University, {{as well as his}} handing out free samples for marketing purposes.|$|R
50|$|In their heyday Harley {{sandwich}} shops {{dotted the}} commercial landscape.

Others followed at 5041 Reisterstown Road, 2235 Edmondson Avenue, 1001 East 25th Street, 6416 Holabird Avenue, 2047 East Monument Street and 3203 Greenmount Avenue. The chain was open all night.

2500|$|In the fourth, co-starring Ben 10, Superman, Aquaman, Wonder Woman and Batman are {{drinking}} coffee and discussing about the 'new kid' Ben [...] Tennyson. Wonder Woman tells Batman he's envious of Ben, and she wonder [...] "Maybe {{because he has}} super powers?" [...] Batman just torments, however Superman agrees Wonder Woman's point, then explains that Aquaman can talk to fish, and that he can fly; [...] "But you're just a loaded guy with a rubber mask, an expensive car and a funny belt." [...] Just then, Ben walks into the break room and gets his lunch. Batman greets him not quite friendly at first, however after Ben asks Batman for his autograph, Batman feels pleased. He then asked the other superhero if they want half of <b>his</b> <b>sandwich</b> and Aquaman takes it. Ben then tells Superman that he has Superman pajamas, which makes his day. Ben then leaves the break room, all heroes are happy to Ben's nice side for them. And Aquaman chimes in, saying it was cool that he gave him half of his tuna sandwich. Suddenly their mood turns very awkward.|$|E

50|$|On May 11, 2006, Dean Young {{announced}} {{the opening of}} the first of <b>his</b> Dagwood's <b>Sandwich</b> Shoppes that summer in Clearwater, Florida, and the comic strip characters discussed the notion of Dagwood opening <b>his</b> own <b>sandwich</b> shop.

5000|$|Though not {{directly}} influenced by it, Ninja Burger's concept {{is similar to}} a Saturday Night Live sketch from the late 1970s by John Belushi entitled [...] "Samurai Delicatessen" [...] In this skit, Belushi played a samurai working in a New York City deli who would commit seppuku if customers were unhappy with <b>his</b> <b>sandwiches</b> (which he prepared using his katana). Other likely influences include Snow Crash, which features a ninja-like deliveryman named Hiro Protagonist who works for a Mafia pizzeria and would be assassinated if a delivery took longer than half an hour, and [...] "A Fistful of Yen", a short parody of Enter the Dragon from Kentucky Fried Movie.|$|R

[...] "Your mother," [...] he said, [...] "wants you and Irene to come and dine to-night." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tony's {{signature}} [...] "sausage-and-sauce sandwich" [...] on rye {{was first}} made {{when he decided}} to add a spicy chili sauce to <b>his</b> <b>sandwiches</b> for more flavor. Eventually, his creation became known as the [...] "Hungarian hot dog", even though no such thing had come from the Old Country. The dish quickly became popular and the cafe is now billed as [...] "the place where man bites dog". The [...] "hot dog" [...] is really a Hungarian sausage called Kolbász, not unlike the Polish kielbasa, about twice the diameter of a conventional hot dog, and slicing the sausage in half yields about the same amount of meat.|$|R
5000|$|Montagu {{retired in}} 1782.

The song both satirizes and celebrates nerd culture, as recited by the subject who cannot [...] "roll with the gangstas" [...] because he is [...] "just too white and nerdy", and includes constant references to stereotypically nerdy activities, such as collecting comic books, playing Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), going to the Renaissance Fair, riding a Segway, and editing Wikipedia, as well as stereotypically Caucasian activities, such as watching Happy Days and eating [...] "all <b>his</b> <b>sandwiches</b> with mayonnaise." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fact that}} Attalano dropped <b>his</b> <b>sandwich</b> attested {{to the large}} size and close {{proximity}} of the tarpon. He uttered a grunt of satisfaction and pushed out the boat.

Thousands of mullet had been cut off from their river haunts and were now leaping, flying, darting in wild haste to elude the great white monsters. In the foamy swirls I saw streaks of blood.|$|E

Mr. Grex is favourably inclined towards it. That idea isn't a bit of good to ourselves or any one else unless Monsieur Douaille here shares our point of view. Here we are, then, all met together--let us hope for a week or two's enjoyment. Little by little we must try and {{see what we can do}} towards instilling that idea into the mind of Monsieur Douaille. We may succeed, we may fail, but let us always remember that our conversations are the conversations of four friends, met together upon what is nothing more or less than a holiday. I hate the sight of those sheets of blotting-paper and clean pens. Who wants to make notes, especially of what we are going to talk about! The man who cannot carry notes in his head is no statesman." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hamilton Fynes {{discovered}} that place of entertainment without difficulty, ordered for himself {{a cup of}} coffee and a sandwich, and drew a chair close up to the small open fire, taking care, however, to sit almost facing the only entrance to the room. He laid his hat upon the counter, close to which he had taken up his position, and smoothed back with his left hand his somewhat thick black hair. He was a man, apparently of middle age, of middle height, clean-shaven, with good but undistinguished features, dark eyes, very clear and very bright, which showed, indeed, but little need of the pince-nez which hung by a thin black cord from his neck. His hat, low in the crown and of soft gray felt, would alone have betrayed his nationality. His clothes, however, were also American in cut. His boots were narrow and of unmistakable shape. He ate <b>his</b> <b>sandwich</b> with suspicion, and after his first sip of coffee ordered a whiskey and soda. Afterwards he sat leaning back in his chair, glancing every now and then at the clock, but otherwise manifesting no signs of impatience. In less than half an hour an inspector, cap in hand, entered the room and announced that everything was ready. Mr. Hamilton Fynes put on his hat, picked up his suitcase, and followed him on to the platform. A long saloon carriage, with a guard's brake behind and an engine in front, was waiting there.|$|E
