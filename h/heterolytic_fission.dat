5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by <b>heterolytic</b> <b>fission</b> to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s.

5|$|The pale-brown bromine monofluoride (BrF) is {{unstable}} at room temperature, disproportionating {{quickly and}} irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride.

Bromine monofluoride in ethanol readily leads to the monobromination of the aromatic compounds PhX (para-bromination occurs for X = Me, But, OMe, Br; meta-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = –CO2Et, –CHO, –NO2); this is due to <b>heterolytic</b> <b>fission</b> of the Br–F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by Br+.|$|E
25|$|Radical {{formation}} through homolytic bond cleavage {{most often}} happens between two atoms of similar electronegativity; in organic chemistry, {{this is often}} between the OO bond in peroxide species or between ON bonds.

50|$|In heterolytic cleavage, or heterolysis, {{the bond}} breaks {{in such a}} fashion that the originally-shared pair of {{electrons}} remain {{with one of the}} fragments. This process is also known as <b>heterolytic</b> or ionic <b>fission.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{discovery}} and categorization of <b>heterolytic</b> bond <b>fission</b> was clearly {{dependent on the}} {{discovery and}} categorization of the chemical bond. In 1916, chemist Gilbert N. Lewis developed {{the concept of the}} electron-pair bond, in which two atoms may share one to six electrons, thus forming the single electron bond, a single bond, a double bond, or a triple bond. This became the model for a covalent bond. In 1932 Linus Pauling first proposed the concept of electronegativity, which also introduced the idea that electrons in a covalent bond may not be shared evenly between the bonded atoms. However, the ions had been studied before bonds mainly by Svante Arrhenius, who pioneered development of ionic theory and proposed definitions for acids as molecules that produced hydrogen ions, and bases as molecules that produced hydroxide ions.|$|R
40|$|The role {{of water}} as a solvent or medium is {{reviewed}} and examined using near infrared spectroscopy for direct probing of water structure and ultra-violet spectroscopy for kinetic spheres. The kinetic behaviour {{of water in the}} SN 1 hydrolysis of t-butyl iodide is studied by monitoring the rate of loss of absorbance of the n?o* electronic transition for the C-I bond in the ultra-violet spectral region as opposed to the normal conductiometric methods of measuring this type of hydrolysis. The effects of added basic cosolvents and electrolytes on the rate of reaction are studied and the results show good agreement with those obtained from conductiometric methods. A direct probe of the water structure is made by studying temperature variations and its effects on the pure water system and water/basic cosolvent mixtures. The observed results are linked to a theoretical model by mathematical predictions. A search for spectroscopic evidence for the type of 'intermediates' postulated in the mechanism for the SN 1 hydrolysis reaction is made. The results support the concept of a solvated alkyl halide species [...] - this being formed before the <b>heterolytic</b> bond <b>fission</b> of the carbon halide bond. Free energies of interaction and equilibrium constants are also calculated. For this work both methanol and water are used.

Both are quite reactive and attack even platinum and gold, though not boron, carbon, cadmium, lead, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, and tungsten. Their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions. Iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate phenol and salicyclic acid, since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation, chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive.

This means that the hydroxide ion attacks the carbon atom from the other side, exactly opposite the bromine ion. Because of this backside attack, SN2 reactions result in a reversal of the configuration of the electrophile. If the electrophile is chiral, it typically maintains its chirality, though the SN2 product's absolute configuration is flipped as compared to that of the original electrophile.|$|E

Thallium(III) {{reacts with}} dithizone(I) in a {{complicated}} way {{through a number of}} intermediate products which depend on the relative proportions of reactants, the pH of the aqueous phase, the order of mixing of reactants, the time of phase equilibrium {{and the nature of the}} organic solvent used. The reaction between thallium(III) and dithizone is essentially oxidative in character. In the present work the complete reaction scheme is proposed: Thallium(III) reacts with dithizone to give a thallic-dithizonate complex, [TlIII(HDz) ₃], which spontaneously and oxidatively disproportionates to the disulphide (III) and a thallium(I) -dithizonate complex, [Tl(HDz) ]. The disulphide(III) decomposes by first-order <b>heterolytic</b> <b>fission</b> to give equimolar amounts of dithizone and the mesoionic compound (IV). The Tl(HDz) complex undergoes reversion to give Tl+ in the aqueous phase and dithizone in the organic phase. In the presence of excess thallium(III) the regenerated dithizone is oxidized to the mesoionic compound (IV) : the mesoionic compound (IV), partitions between the two phases and appears to react with excess thallium(III) to give possibly a mesoionic compound (IV) -thallium(III) complex and an unspecified oxidation product. The molecular structure of the 1 : 1 adduct formed between diphenylthallium(III) and dithizone has been shown by single crystal X-ray diffraction, to be a five co-ordinate diphenylthallium(III) complex: the dithizone acts as a bidentate chelating ligand co-ordinating through the nitrogen and sulphur atoms.

It also reports the thermolyses of 2 -fluoromethyl- 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2, 1 -b) furan (l 6 l) {{in the presence}} of 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene and 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene respectively. Chapter 1 discusses the history, mechanism and stereochemistry of the Glaisen and thio-Claisen rearrangements of aromatic prop- 2 -enyl and prop- 2 -ynyl systems. While Chapter 2, reports on the various cyclisation reactions that may follow an initial Glaisen rearrangement. Chapter 3 deals with the literature on the Glaisen and thio-Claisen rearrangements of polyfluoroaryl systems which are directly related to those under study in this thesis. Chapters 4 and 5 describe the isomerisation reactions of pentafluorophenyl prop- 2 -ynyl thioether (167) and 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 -heptafluoro- 2 -naphthyl prop- 2 -ynyl thioether (171). Chapter 4 is concerned with the reaction of compound (167) with p-xylene and benzene at 180 C and {{in the presence of}} BF (_ 3) -etherate, at 25 C. Chapter 5 reports upon the reactions of the thioether (171) with benzene and p-xylene at l 40 C and 160 C. At l 60 G, in nickel apparatus the isomerisation product 2 -fluoromethyl- 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2, 1 -b) thiophen (173) is shown to be an intermediate in the conversion of the thioether (171) to the substitution product, 2 -(2, 5 -dimethylbenzyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2, 1 -b) thiophen (173) with p-xylene. This chapter also highlights the differing courses of reactions of the thioether (17 l) in glass and nickel apparatus. Chapter 6 reports the isomerisation reactions of 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 -heptafluoro- 2 -naphthyl prop- 2 -ynyl-ynyl ether (156) in both the liquid phase and vapour phase. The glass surface of the reaction vessel was shown to act as a Lewis-acid catalyst at elevated temperatures, in the reaction of the naphthyl ether (156) with p-xylene and isopropylbenzene to give the aromatic substitution products (159) and (160) respectively. Whereas in nickel apparatus, the 2 -fluoromethyl compound (161) was the main product in both reactions. Chapter 7 discusses the mechanism of the isomerisation reactions of the polyfluoroaryl prop- 2 -ynyl ethers and thioethers studied in this thesis. It also incorporates a critical experiment in which compound (161) is reacted with N, N-diethylaniline at 140 C only to be recovered unchanged. (The thermolysis of (161) in p-xylene at the, same temperature gives the substitution product (159) exclusively) The charge-separated species (197) and (195) are proposed as intermediates in the reactions of the ether (156) and thioether (171) via the <b>heterolytic</b> <b>fission</b> of the sp (^ 3) C-F bond in the Claisen rearrangement intermediates (157) and (172) respectively. It is concluded that the isomerisation reactions of (I 56) and (171), which require a 1, 4 -fluorine shift, proceed via an ionic mechanism. The final chapter describes the thermolysis reactions of the naphthyl ether (156) and the 2 -fluoromethyl compound (161) with 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene and 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene. Compounds (156) and (161) react with 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene at 150 C to give 2 -(2, 2, 3 -trimethylbut- 3 -enyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2, 1 -b) furan (186) and a small amount of 2 -(2, 3, 3 -trlmethylbut-l. enyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoro-naphtho(2, 1 -b) furan (187) compound (161) reacts with 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene at 25 C in the presence of BF(_ 3) -etherate to give the Markovnikov addition-elimination product, 2 -(3, 4 -dimethylpent- 3 -enyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoro-naphtho (2, 1 -b) furan (194) and a small amount of (186). Thermolysis of both (156) and (161) with 3, 3 -dimethylbut- 1 ene gave (186) as the major product accompanied by smaller amounts of (187) and (194). It is proposed that compounds (186) and (187) arise via reaction with 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene formed by isomerisation of the terminal alkene. 2 -Chloromethyl - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2,l-b) furan (161 a) has been prepared; it reacts with 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene in the presence of ZnCl (_ 2), to give (186), (194) and (196) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} an investigation into the thermal and photochemical reactivity of dihydrodiazines. In order to prepare the title compounds the diazines and some phenyldiazines are treated with phenyllithium in ether, yielding adducts resulting from attack of phenyllithium on the various positions of the heteroaromatic ring. With pyrimidine addition takes place mainly at C(4), with pyridazine at C(3). By using TMEDA, addition at C(2) in 4 -phenylpyrimidine and at C(4) in pyridazine is strongly promoted. The structure of the adducts is studied by n. m. r. spectroscopy. The charge distribution pattern in the C(4) -adduct of pyrimidine and in both the C(3) -adduct and the C(4) -adduct of pyridazine is determined by comparing the carbon chemical shifts of these compounds with those of the corresponding dihydrodiazines obtained by hydrolysis of the adducts. C(5) in the phenyllithium-pyrimidine adduct carries little negative charge, C(4) in the phenyllithium-pyridazine adduct has a considerable amount of charge while the charge density at C(6) in the 3 -adduct and both C(3) and C(5) in the 4 -adduct of pyridazine is moderate. Some organolithium-diazine adducts and some dihydropyrimidines are treated with electrophilic reagents. Both 4, 6 -diphenyl- 1 (3) -lithio- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidine and 4, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 4 (3. 4) -dihydropyrimidine are attacked by the electrophilic reagent (methyliodide, methyl chloroformate) at N(3), yielding 4, 6 -dipheny]- 3 -methyl(methoxycarbonyl) - 3, 4 -dihydropyrimidine. 4, 4, 6 -Triphenyl- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidine gives upon treatment with methyliodide mainly 3 -methyl- 4, 4, 6 -triphenyl- 3, 4 -dihydropyrimidine. The 3, 4 -dihydro structure of the products is established both spectroscopically and chemically. Reaction of 2 -lithio- 3 -methyl- 2, 3 -dihydropyridazine with methyliodide (methyl chloroformate, tosylchloride) gives the corresponding 2, 3 -dimethyl-(2 -methoxycarbonyl- 3 -methyl-, 2 -tosyl- 3 -methyl-) 2, 3 -dihydropyridazine. 1 -Lithio- 2 -phenyl- 1, 2 -dihydropyrazine yields upon treatment with methyliodide 5 -methyl- 2 -phenylpyrazine. Reaction with carbonyl compounds only yields high molecular material. Photolysis of 4 -R- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidines causes rearrangement to 5 -R- 1, 2 (2, 3) -dihydropyrimidines, provided that the substituent R contains a π-bond in αposition to the heterocyclic ring (R=phenyl,isobutenyl,phenylethynyl). 4 -Methyl- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidine does not show this rearrangement. Chemical evidence is presented that the rearrangement occurs via the di-π-methane mechanism leading to 6 -R- 2, 4 -diazabicyclo [3. 1. 0] hex- 2 (3) -ene. This latter intermediate undergoes a thermal homo [1, 5] hydrogen shift into 5 -R- 2, 5 -dihydropyrimidine which on tautomerization gives the final product. The reaction can be sensitized by acetone. 4, 5 -Diphenyl-, 5 -methyl- 4 -phenyl and 5 -bromo- 4 -phenyl- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidine do not rearrange under photochemical conditions. Several 4 -R- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidines (R= 2 - or 3 -thienyl, 2 -furyl, 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolyl and 3 -pyridyl) containing heteroaryl vinyl methane moieties undergo photochemical rearrangement into 5 -R- 1, 2 (2, 3) -dihydropyrimidines. Oxidation of these compounds yield 5 -heteroarylpyrimidines. The chemical yields are strongly dependent {{of the nature of the}} heteroaryl group. The existence of a 6 -R- 2, 4 -diazabicyclo [3. 1. 0] hex- 2 (3) -ene as an intermediate in the photoisomerization of 4 -R- 1, 4 (3, 4) - dihydropyrimidines into 5 -R- 1, 2 (2, 3) -dihydropyrimidines is confirmed spectroscopically in case R= p -trifluoromethylphenyl. It is established that the p -trifluoromethylphenyl group is in exo position in the bicyclic compound. 6 - Exo -(p -trifluoromethylphenyl) - 2, 4 -diazabicyclo [3. 1. 0] hex- 2 (3) -ene immediately gives 5 -(p -trifluoromethylphenyl) - 1, 2 (2, 3) - dihydropyrimidine upon addition of potassium hydroxide in methanol. Photolysis of 4 -R- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidines causes ring contraction into imidazoles, provided that the substituent R is sufficiently capable of stabilizing an anionic centre (R= 2 -thiazolyl and 2 - or 4 -pyridyl). Chemical evidence is presented that the ring contraction of 6 -phenyl- 4 -(2 -pyridyl) - 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidine occurs via <b>heterolytic</b> <b>fission</b> of the C(1) -C(6) bond of intermediate 1 -phenyl- 6 -(2 -pyridyl) - 2, 4 -diazabicyclo [3. 1. 0] hex- 2 (3) -ene. The anion stabilizing effect of R is correlated with the acid strength (pKa) of R-CH 3 . A pKa value around 30 determines the border-line between ring contraction into an imidazole and formation of an isomeric 5 -R- 1, 2 (2, 3) -dihydropyrimidine...|$|E
