5000|$|Photomultipliers are {{typically}} constructed with an evacuated glass housing, containing a photocathode, several dynodes, and an anode. Incident photons strike the photocathode material, {{which is usually}} a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer {{on the inside of}} the entry window of the device. Electrons are ejected from the surface as a consequence of the photoelectric effect. These electrons are directed by the <b>focusing</b> <b>electrode</b> toward the electron multiplier, where electrons are multiplied by the process of secondary emission. The electron multiplier consists of a number of electrodes called dynodes. Each dynode is held at a more positive potential, by ≈100 Volts, than the preceding one. A primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3 eV for [...] "blue" [...] photons, minus the work function of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons. (In Fig. 1, the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray.) The primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field. They each arrive with ≈100 eV kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference. Upon striking the first dynode, more low energy electrons are emitted, and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode. The geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage. For example, if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron, and if there are 12 dynode stages, then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 512 ≈ 108 electrons. This last stage is called the anode. This large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable, for example on an oscilloscope, signaling the arrival of the photon(s) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier.|$|E

The diameter of the X-ray tube is 10 mm, and the total length is 50 mm. The weight of the tube is only 14.5 g. All of the connection parts of the X-ray tube are tightly vacuum-sealed. The both ends of the alumina ceramic tube were vacuum-brazed with a <b>focusing</b> <b>electrode</b> assembly and a connecting anode, respectively. Both electrodes were made of Kovar (Carpenter Technology Corporation, Reading, PA, USA) that has a similar thermal expansion coefficient to alumina. The connecting anode was used to interconnect a ceramic tube and a Be X-ray window that have different thermal expansion coefficients. The connecting anode and the Be window were also vacuum-brazed. All the components of the X-ray tube were baked at 550 °C for 10 h, and subsequently, these were brazed through a single-step brazing process at 680 °C for 30 min in a vacuum furnace. Before the brazing process, electron emission and transport tests of the X-ray tube have been carried out inside a vacuum chamber. The position of the cathode inside the <b>focusing</b> <b>electrode</b> could be finely controlled through this process.

30|$|Using Si-supported CNT arrays, Ryu et al. {{demonstrated}} {{the potential of}} CVD in X-ray source applications [205]. A resist-assisted patterning process was used to produce a cathode assembly consisting of a gate and <b>focusing</b> <b>electrode.</b> This assembly was approximately 0.5  mm × 2.0  mm and gave an isotropic focal spot [205]. Ryu et al. also described a further shaping technique for post processing the as-grown vertically aligned CNTs. Here they used hydrofluoric acid to produce an array of conical pillars (Figure  5 b), rather reminiscent of earlier Spindt emitters. Hydrofluoric acid, though cheap and readily available, is rather hazardous to handle and poses a significant health risk. This somewhat limits the commercial viability of the compaction technique presented. Nevertheless, they demonstrated anode currents of up to 90  mA at 7.8  V/μm, with a turn-on electric field of approximately 3  V/μm. To increase the geometric uniformity of the emitters the team used an electrical aging treatment, which degrades the taller tubes and bundles that would dominate the emission. For a high performing emitter this aging, also termed seasoning, is not desirable and CNTs of very uniform height and diameter are preferred, as evidenced by Teo et al. [166], to obviate {{the need for such}} post-growth treatments. Nevertheless, part of the Ryu et al. ageing process [205] was to remove the Ni catalyst particles at the CNTs apex, which they argued reduced the emission current. Detailed analysis and theoretical studies surmising the emission implications of the metallic nanoparticle in the emitter tip are lacking in the literature.|$|E
30|$|High spatial {{resolution}} requires a small X-ray spot size. However, practical systems also require a wide {{field of view}} {{in order to be}} able to inspect suitably large areas. Thus, to realise high resolution large area scans the X-ray source must be constructed from multiple cathodes, each with dedicated focusing electrodes. One way to maximise the field of view is to carefully engineer the vacuum chamber to maximise the total angular field of view. A 5 pixel source system has been constructed by Zhang et al. [236]. This system provided sequentially acquired images over a finite angular range, each fitted with an electrostatic <b>focusing</b> <b>electrode</b> to control the size and scanning of the focal spot, which had a width of less than 300  μm. Operating at 40  kV, they showed that the electronic switching time was largely negligible with high emission reproducibility, both in FE curves and beam diameter, between the individual electron sources. Yang et al. demonstrated a multiple source digital breast tomosynthesis unit using an array of 25 cathodes, each individually programmed using analogue controls. Their sources employed CNT-based inks, each with a dedicated gate and an electrostatic focusing ring to control the focal spot size to approximately 200  μm [237]. In this system an impressive total angular field of view of up to 48 ° was realised, and the performance compared favourably with commercially available moving-source systems. A similar system, termed a multi-beam FE X-ray source, described a similar geometry [203]. A simple linear multiple source using an array of 31 CNT FE cathodes has also been constructed, for the purposes to digital breast tomosynthesis, which was shown to be capable of a total scan angle of 30 ° [171]. In a further extension, a digital chest tomosynthesis scanner was demonstrated [238]. This system used 75 CNT FE sources, operating at up to 80  kV with a 20 ° beam angle.|$|E
