40|$|Many of {{the newly}} issued {{corporate}} bonds are finding their way into insurance and pension fund asset portfolios. Modelling these bonds is tricky. Historic return distributions are well behaved and the observed credit spreads exceed all estimates of historic default probabilities. As a result, corporate bonds may appear anomalously attractive. We show {{that some of the}} more widely used models of corporate bonds have some major weaknesses from a theoretical perspective and in particular fail to explain this apparent anomaly convincingly. However, our analysis of the economics of corporate debt early in the paper suggests that credit spreads are option premiums and thus have option-like characteristics. This leads to the Merton Model as a means of capturing these characteristics. The model reveals that the apparent anomaly in credit spreads is another facet of well known apparent anomalies in option prices under the standard Black Scholes Model (such as the existence of skews and smiles in implied volatility). The latter anomalies are not generally regarded as exploitable in asset allocation studies. Armed with the insights from this model, suitable for heavy <b>duty</b> <b>application</b> in pricing contingent claims based on default, we return to the simpler problem of modelling corporate bond portfolios. We suggest that complexity in these models inevitable, given that a rebalancing investment process must be modelled {{and that there is a}} fundamental arbitrariness in the relevant grade categories on which the process is based. Having considered these issues we suggest that, despite its sledge-hammer appearance the Merton Model provides a solid foundation for alternative approaches to modelling such portfolios that ensures consistency and reduces the risk of anomalies. In particular we reconcile well-known approximations in terms of special cases of this model. ...|$|E

40|$|Current, {{state of}} the art natural gas engines provide the lowest {{emission}} commercial technology for use in medium heavy duty vehicles. NOx emission levels are 25 to 50 % lower than {{state of the}} art diesel engines and PM levels are 90 % lower than non-filter equipped diesels. Yet, in common with diesel engines, natural gas engines are challenged to become even cleaner and more efficient to meet environmental and end-user demands. Cummins Westport is developing two streams of technologies to achieve these goals for medium-heavy and heavy-heavy <b>duty</b> <b>applications.</b> For medium-heavy <b>duty</b> <b>applications,</b> lowest possible emissions are sought on SI engines without significant increase in complexity and with improvements in efficiency and BMEP. The selected path builds on the capabilities of the CWI Plus technology and recent diesel engine advances in NOx controls, providing potential to reduce emissions to 2010 values in an accelerated manner and without the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction or NOx Storage and Reduction technology. For heavy-heavy <b>duty</b> <b>applications</b> where high torque and fuel economy are of prime concern, the Westport-Cycle{trademark} technology is in field trial. This technology incorporates High Pressure Direct Injection (HPDI{trademark}) of natural gas with a diesel pilot ignition source. Both fuels are delivered through a single, dual common rail injector. The operating cycle is entirely unthrottled and maintains the high compression ratio of a diesel engine. As a result of burning 95 % natural gas rather than diesel fuel, NOx emissions are halved and PM is reduced by around 70 %. High levels of EGR can be applied while maintaining high combustion efficiency, resulting in extremely low NOx potential. Some recent studies have indicated that DPF-equipped diesels emit less nanoparticles than some natural gas vehicles [1]. It must be understood that the ultrafine particles emitted from SI natural gas engines are generally accepted to consist predominantly of VOCs [2], and that lubricating oil is a major contributor. Fitting an oxidation catalyst to the natural gas engine leads to a reduction in nanoparticles emissions in comparison to engines without aftertreatment [2, 3, 4]. In 2001, the Cummins Westport Plus technology was introduced with the C Gas Plus engine, a popular choice for transit bus applications. This incorporates drive by wire, fully integrated, closed loop electronic controls and a standard oxidation catalyst for all applications. The B Gas Plus and the B Propane Plus engines, with application in shuttle and school buses were launched in 2002 and 2003. The gas-specific oxidation catalyst operates in concert with an optimized ring-pack and liner combination to reduce total particulate mass below 0. 01 g/bhphr, combat ultrafine particles and control VOC emissions...|$|R

50|$|Long haul {{transport}} usually {{operates as}} B-doubles with two trailers (each with three axles), {{for a total}} of nine axles (including steering). In some lighter <b>duty</b> <b>applications</b> only one of the rear axles of the truck is driven, and the trailer may have only two axles. From July 2007, the Australian Federal and State Governments allowed the introduction of B-triple trucks on a specified network of roads. B-Triples are set up differently from conventional road trains. The front of their first trailer is supported by the turntable on the prime mover. The second and third trailers are supported by turntables on the trailers in front of them. As a result, B-Triples are much more stable than road trains and handle exceptionally well. True road trains only operate in remote areas, regulated by each state or territory government.|$|R
