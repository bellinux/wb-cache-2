40|$|We {{describe}} a previously healthy woman {{who at the}} age of 44 years developed a factor VIII inhibitor, that over the years increased to a maximum level of 3600 Bethesda units (BU) mL(- 1) in 1978. The epitope specificity of the factor VIII inhibitor was investigated and antibodies directed against the A 2 and C 2 domains of factor VIII were detected. The majority of these antibodies were of subclass IgG 4. Over the years, the <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> gradually decreased and in 1989, the inhibitor could no longer be detected. Shortly after, the patient developed autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. A possible link between the disappearance of factor VIII inhibitors and the development of other autoantibodies may be explained by concomitant development of anti-idiotypic antibodies that neutralize the activity of factor VIII inhibitors. We were unable to detect anti-idiotypic antibodies, which could explain the decline in factor VIII <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> in this patien...|$|E

40|$|An immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) for the {{determination}} of factor IX inhibitors in haemophilia B was developed. The assay was based on competitive binding between radiolabelled anti-IX and inhibitors in the test material of immobilized IX:C. 5 haemophiliacs with known inhibitors were investigated with the new method and with a conventional neutralization test. An <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> as low as 5 X 10 (- 4) U/ml could be measured by IRMA, showing it to be about 500 times as sensitive as the conventional neutralization assay used, and in 2 cases the inhibitors could only be detected by IRMA.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{describe}} the haemostatic role of a variation in inhibitor reactivity with different factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates, we have compared <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titres</b> against a panel of FVIII concentrates and correlated titre with the capacity to inhibit thrombin generation. Three plasma-derived concentrates were tested in vitro in mixing experiments with inhibitor plasmas from 11 patients with severe haemophilia A: Fanhdi, which contains von Willebrand factor (VWF) with a final ratio of approximately 1 : 1 (VWF IU per IU FVIII:Q; Haemate-P with a ratio of 2. 5 : 1 and Hemofil-M containing only trace amounts of VWF. In addition, the recombinant FVIII concentrate Kogenate Bayer containing no VWF was included. <b>Inhibitor</b> <b>titres</b> {{and the capacity to}} generate thrombin were measured. A statistically significant difference in measured titres was found with the highest titres recorded against Hemofil-M. The <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titres</b> needed to inhibit 50 % maximum thrombin generation were the lowest for Kogenate Bayer and the highest and similar for Fanhdi and Haemate-P with intermediate titres needed for inhibition of Hemofil-M. In this study, the thrombin generation assay provides additional indications for the role of VWF in the treatment of patients with inhibitors. The VWF-containing concentrates Fanhdi and Haemate-P, added to FVIII-deficient plasma with the presence of inhibitor, generate more thrombin than do the purified concentrates Hemofil-M and Kogenate Bayer...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of an immune response towards factor VIII (FVIII) remains the major complication of haemophilia A replacement therapy. Product-related risk factors have recently been identified {{on the basis of}} epidemiological studies, but the mechanism is not understood. To this end, various commercially available FVIII concentrates were administered by the IV route to FVIII-knockout mice and the resulting immune response was characterised. Significantly higher <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titres</b> (Bethesda assay) were observed for one recombinant FVIII and one plasma-derived FVIII product depleted in von Willebrand factor (VWF). <b>Inhibitor</b> <b>titres</b> were reduced upon pre-incubation of FVIII with purified VWF. Epitope specificity of anti-FVIII IgG was characterised using FVIII-fragments produced in E. coli. Concentrates with no or reduced VWF-level elicited antibodies recognising predominantly the acidic a 1 and a 3 regions. Addition of VWF prior to injection also modified the epitope specificity. FVIII concentrates, therefore, show qualitative and quantitative variations in immunogenicity, which are at least partly modulated by VWF. status: publishe...|$|R

Recombinant activated FVII was used in addition to routine haemostatic agents. Conventional immunosuppression was supplemented with antithymocyte globulin and cyclophosphamide.

40|$|Alloantibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII (FVIII) {{develop in}} 20 – 30 % of {{patients}} with severe haemophilia A and render classical FVIII substitution therapy ineffective. Several {{studies have shown that}} genetic factors, the type of FVIII gene mutation and immune response genes (e. g. the Major Histocompatibility Complexes), influence the risk of inhibitor formation. In particular, the type of FVIII gene mutation {{has proven to be a}} decisive risk factor. Patients with severe molecular gene defects (e. g. large deletions, nonsense mutations, intron- 22 inversion) and no endogenous FVIII synthesis have a 7 – 10 times higher inhibitor prevalence than patients with milder molecular gene defects (e. g. missense mutations, small deletions, splice site mutations). To date, at least 10 distinct classes of mutations have been shown which have differing risks of associated inhibitor formation. A challenging observation in inhibitor patients is the heterogeneity of the antibody epitopes with respect to their number and their specifity. At least five epitopes in the FVIII molecule have been identified that constitute the targets for antibodies in most inhibitor patients. These epitopes are located in the ar 3 region and the A 2, A 3, C 1, C 2 domains which correspond to the functional binding sites of the ligands of the FVIII protein. At present, the determinants of the characteristics of these epitopes and the subsequent <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> are unknown. A relationship of the mutation site and the epitope localization has been shown for some individual patients with mild haemophilia A.

40|$|The revised UKHCDO factor (F) VIII/IX Inhibitor Guidelines (2000) are presented. A schema is {{proposed}} for inhibitor surveillance, which {{varies according to}} {{the severity of the}} haemophilia and the treatment type and regimen used. The methodological and pharmacokinetic approach to inhibitor surveillance in congenital haemophilia has been updated. Factor VIII/IX genotyping of patients is recommended to identify those at increased risk. All patients who develop an inhibitor should be considered for immune tolerance induction (ITI). The decision to attempt ITI for FIX inhibitors must be carefully weighed against the relatively high risk of reactions and the nephrotic syndrome and the relatively low response rate observed in this group. The start of ITI should be deferred until the inhibitor has declined below 10 Bethesda Units/ml, where possible. ITI should continue, even in resistant patients, where it is well tolerated and so long as there is a convincing downward trend in the <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre.</b> The choice of treatment for bleeding in inhibitor patients is dictated by the severity of the bleed, the current <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre,</b> the previous anamnestic response to FVIII/IX, the previous clinical response and the side-effect profile of the agents available. We have reviewed novel dose-regimens and modes of administration of FEIBA (factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity) and recombinant activated FVII (rVIIa) {{and the extent to which}} these agents may be used for prophylaxis and surgery. Bleeding in acquired haemophilia is usually treated with FEIBA or rVIIa. Immunosuppressive therapy should be initiated at the time of diagnosis with Prednisolone 1 mg/kg/d ± cyclophosphamide. In the absence of a response to these agents within 6 weeks, second-line therapy with Rituximab, Ciclosporin A, or other multiple-modality regimens may be considered...|$|E
40|$|Background Hemophilia is a {{hereditary}} blood-clotting disorder due {{to factor}} VIII deficiency. Up to this date, {{the administration of}} factor VIII in preventing and managing bleeding has been the main treatment. One of the complications, which may occur due to re- peated administrations of factor VIII, is the formation of factor VIII antibody (factor VIII inhibitor). Objective To find out the prevalence of severe hemophilia-A with factor VIII inhibitor and its clinical characteristics. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on children with severe hemophilia-A at the National Hemophilia Care Centre, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia, in June- August 2004. Results Out of 45 children studied, 16 had factor VIII inhibitor with average <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> of 1. 15 Bethesda units (BU) (range 0. 15 - 15 BU). Most of them (12 patients) had <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> < 5 BU. Chronic arthropathy was found in 17 out of 45 (37 %) children with severe hemophilia-A, consisting of nine patients from positive inhibitor group and 8 patients from negative inhibitor group. Thirty-nine patients (86 %) used an on-demand treatment pattern, among whom 15 had positive inhibitor. Among patients receiving prophylactic treatment pattern, only one had positive inhibitor. There were 39 patients (86 %) treated using cryoprecipitate, among whom factor VIII inhibitor was found in 12, while among those treated with fac- tor VIII concentrate, the inhibitor was positive in 4 / 6. The average amount of factor VIII transfused in positive and negative factor VIII inhibitor groups was similar. Conclusion The prevalence of factor VIII inhibitor in severe he- mophilia-A patients was 35 %. Chronic arthropathy occurred more often in patients with positive factor VIII inhibitor. Factor VIII inhibi- tor was found more frequently in patients with an on-demand treat- ment pattern and in those using factor VIII concentrat...|$|E
40|$|An immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) for {{determination}} of antibodies against f. VIII:C in haemophilia A was developed.

It was also possible to demonstrate the antibodies in three non-haemophilic patients with acquired inhibitors.

40|$|The {{eradication}} of inhibitory antibodies {{in patients with}} haemophilia A {{can be accomplished by}} frequent administration of high or intermediate doses of factor VIII (FVIII), so-called immune tolerance induction (ITI). This study monitored the distribution of IgG subclasses of anti-FVIII antibodies during ITI. FVIII-specific antibodies of subclass IgG 1 were detected in all inhibitor patients tested, anti-FVIII IgG 4 in 16, IgG 2 in 10 and IgG 3 in one of 20 patients analysed. Levels of anti-FVIII IgG 1 and IgG 4 correlated well with <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titres</b> as measured by Bethesda assay. In low-titre inhibitor patients, anti-FVIII antibodies consisted primarily of subclass IgG 1 whereas, anti-FVIII antibodies of subclass IgG 4 were more prominent in patients with high <b>titre</b> <b>inhibitors</b> who needed prolonged treatment or who failed ITI. Longitudinal analysis of 14 patients undergoing ITI revealed that the relative contribution of IgG subclasses was constant for most of the patients analysed. In two patients, the relative contribution of IgG 4 increased during ITI. Overall, our findings document the distribution and dynamics of anti-FVIII IgG subclasses during ITI. Future studies will need to address whether monitoring the relative contribution of anti-FVIII subclasses IgG 1 and IgG 4 may be useful for the identification of patients who are at risk of failing IT...|$|R
40|$|Treatment {{of severe}} {{bleeding}} {{and the performance}} of surgery in haemophilia patients with inhibitors creates severe problems. It is generally agreed that treatment is most effective if circulating levels of factor VIII/IX can be achieved long enough for control of haemostasis. Immunoadsorption with protein A for the removal of inhibitor has improved treatment for patients with initial <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titres</b> too high to neutralize by infusion alone. This is a summary of our experience in Malmo regarding immunoadsorption and haemostasis. A total of 19 applications with immunoadsorption in 10 patients were performed. On all occasions it was possible to eliminate totally the inhibitor or reduce it to low levels that could easily be neutralized with factor concentrate. Haemostatic levels of coagulation factors could be maintained for 5 - 9 days in all but one patient. This period was sufficient to stop ongoing haemorrhage or prevent excessive bleeding at surgical interventions...|$|R
40|$|Different regimens {{are used}} to achieve immune {{tolerance}} in patients with severe haemophilia A and inhibitory allo-antibodies against factor VIII (FVIII). In this study, results of 26 years of low dose immune tolerance induction are evaluated. We evaluated 21 patients, who were treated with regular infusions of low dose FVIII (25 - 50 IU kg(- 1) every other day {{or three times a}} week) to obtain immune tolerance. Several risk factors for success rate and time to success were analysed. In 18 of 21 patients (86 %) immune tolerance induction (ITI) was successful. The median of the maximum <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> before start of ITI was 4. 5 BU mL(- 1). Success rate was associated with both a pre-ITI titre and a maximum titre during ITI below 40 BU mL(- 1) (P = 0. 003). The time to success was significantly shorter if the maximum inhibitor level during ITI was below 40 BU mL(- 1) (P = 0. 040). In low titre inhibitors (< 5 BU mL(- 1)) this effect was even stronger (P = 0. 033). Low dose immune tolerance induction therapy was successful in severe haemophilia A patients with a pre-ITI titre below 40 BU mL(- 1). The time to success is predicted by a maximum ITI titre below 40 BU mL(- 1), and is even shorter in low titre inhibitors (< 5 BU mL(- 1)). We suggest that all patients with severe haemophilia A and a pre-ITI <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> below 5 BU mL(- 1), should be treated with low dose immune tolerance induction therapy. Patients with a maximum titre below 40 BU mL(- 1) may also strongly benefit from the beneficial effects of low dose immune tolerance induction therap...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAcquired {{haemophilia}} is an autoimmune disorder characterised by autoantibody formation against {{coagulation factor}} VIII.

Very few prospective studies exist evaluating the use of these treatments. Here, we performed a survey among 73 physicians from 57 haemophilia treatment centres in order to describe current practice patterns and critical issues for future research in acquired haemophilia. The results demonstrate a high diversity of first- and second-line treatments. Factors influencing treatment decision were underlying disorder, severity of bleeding and <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre.</b> Frequently used first-line treatments were steroids plus cyclophosphamide (44 %) and steroids alone (11 %). Second-line treatment was most often rituximab (30 %), with or without steroids and/or cyclophosphamide.

40|$|The authors {{report on}} {{bilateral}} simultaneous knee arthroplasty in a 40 -year-old male patient with haemophilia A, high <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> and an aneurysma spurium {{of the right}} popliteal artery. Both knees showed a fixed flexion deformity of 20 degrees. To build up haemostasis, treatment with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) and recombinant activated factor seven (rFVIIa) was initiated preoperatively. A tourniquet was used on both sides during the operation and factor VIII (FVIII) was administered to further correct coagulopathy. On the eleventh postoperative day the patient complained of increasing pain and pressure in the right knee. An ultrasound suggested aneurysm, which was confirmed by substraction angiography. Under the protection of rFVIIa the aneurysm could be coiled and further rehabilitation was uneventful. At one year post-op the patient presented a range of motion of 90 / 5 / 0 degrees for both knees and had returned to full time office work. This case indicates that haemophiliacs with high antibody titre and destruction of both knees can be operated on in one session in order to diminish the operative risk of two consecutive surgical procedures, thus allowing an effective rehabilitation programme.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the influence of the}} type of factor VIII deficient plasma used on the assay results of the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda method for factor VIII inhibitors.

Moreover the performance of the assay with immuno depleted plasma was contaminated in a certain type of this plasma by the presence of a factor VIII:C inhibitor. Chemically depleted factor VIII deficient plasma appeared to give falsely elevated titres when used in combination with other types of deficient plasmas as substrate plasma in the factor VIII:C assay due to the presence of activated factor Va in the preparation.

The introduction of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) appears to be a major breakthrough for the management of such patients. Administration of rFVIIa as a continuous infusion is a very attractive option and precludes the need for very frequent (2 -h) injections due to the very short half-life of the product.

40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{capacity of}} plasma samples from 24 patients with severe haemophilia A and high-responding inhibitors were evaluated in a concentrate-based assay using two plasma-derived (Haemate and Monoclate-P) and three recombinant (Helixate, Recombinate and ReFacto) factor VIII concentrates and {{correlated with the}} corresponding epitope profile. In most, but not all, inhibitor plasmas with a relatively low reactivity against the von Willebrand-containing product Haemate, the main epitopes were located in the FVIII light chain. The reactivities within the group of recombinant products varied in that the reactivity against the B-domain deleted ReFacto was in general higher than that against Recombinate and Helixate. This difference did not correlate with any particular epitope profile and indicates that the B-domain, type of formulation and/or purification procedures may {{have an impact on}} the inhibitor reactivity in vitro. The ratio between the <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titres</b> in the concentrate-based assay and the Bethesda assay was dependent on the inhibitor plasma and concentrate used.

40|$|The complex {{relation}} between {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} (TTP) and pregnancy is concisely reviewed. Pregnancy {{is a very strong}} trigger for acute disease manifestation in patients with hereditary TTP caused by double heterozygous or homozygous mutations of ADAMTS 13 (ADisintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 domains, no. 13). In several affected women disease onset during their first pregnancy leads to the diagnosis of hereditary TTP. Without plasma treatment mother and especially fetus are at high risk of dying. The relapse risk during a next pregnancy is almost 100 % but regular plasma transfusion starting in early pregnancy will prevent acute TTP flare-up and may result in successful pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy may also constitute a mild risk factor for the onset of acute acquired TTP caused by autoantibody-mediated severe ADAMTS 13 deficiency. Women having survived acute acquired TTP may not be at very high risk of TTP relapse during an ensuing next pregnancy but seem to have an elevated risk of preeclampsia. Monitoring of ADAMTS 13 activity and <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> during pregnancy may help to guide management and to avoid disease recurrence. Finally, TTP needs to be distinguished from the much more frequent hypertensive pregnancy complications, preeclampsia and especially HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelet count) syndrome...|$|E

In this study, we present a longitudinal analysis of the epitope specificity of an inhibitor that developed in a mild haemophiliac with an Arg 593 [...] >Cys mutation. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed the presence of antibodies directed towards the light chain and A 2 domain of factor VIII. Limited reactivity was observed with metabolically labelled C 2 domain.

Evaluation of the epitope specificity of anti-factor VIII antibodies in plasma samples obtained at different time-points of inhibitor development revealed initial development of a low titre inhibitor directed towards the A 2 domain and factor VIII light chain.

We evaluated the prevalence of non-neutralizing antibodies, in 201 inhibitor-negative brother pairs with severe haemophilia A, enrolled in the Malmö International Brother Study and the Haemophilia Inhibitor Genetics Study. To evaluate binding specificity of the antibodies, ELISA plates were coated with two recombinant full-length (FL) FVIII-products and one recombinant B-domain-deleted (BDD) product. Seventy-nine patients (39. 3 %) {{had a history of}} positive <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> measured by Bethesda assay, and FVIII antibodies were detected in 20 of them (25. 3 %). Additional 23 samples from subjects without a history of FVIII inhibitors were ELISA-positive corresponding to a frequency of non-neutralizing antibodies of 18. 9 %. The antibody response towards the different FVIII products was heterogenous, and was raised not only towards the non-functional B-domain but also towards both FL-rFVIII and BDD-rFVIII. In patients considered successfully treated with immune tolerance induction, 25. 4 % had remaining FVIII antibodies. The number of families with an antibody response in all siblings was increased when the total antibody response was taken into account, further supporting the concept of a genetic predisposition of the immune response.

Further analysis of patient LE, with the highest inhibitor titer, showed that (1) plasma or polyclonal IgG antibodies prepared from LE plasma inhibited the activity of allogeneic (wild-type) but not of self FVIII; (2) the presence of von Willebrand factor (vWF) increased by over 10 -fold the inhibitory activity on wild-type FVIII; (3) the kinetics of FVIII inhibition followed a type II pattern, but in contrast to previously described type II inhibitors, LE IgG was potentiated {{by the presence of}} vWF instead of being in competition with it; (4) polyclonal LE IgG recognized the FVIII light chain in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the recombinant A 3 -C 1 domains in an immunoprecipitation assay, indicating that at least part of LE antibodies reacted with the FVIII domain encompassing the mutation site; and (5) LE IgG inhibited FVIII activity by decreasing the rate of FVIIIa release from vWF, but LE IgG recognized an epitope distinct from ESH 8, a murine monoclonal antibody exhibiting the same property.

40|$|Inhibitors {{represent}} {{one major}} complication of haemophilia treatment, as they {{increase the risk}} of bleeding, physical disability and mortality. The Cost Of Care Inhibitors Study (COCIS) showed that modern strategies applied to manage patients with inhibitors adsorb high amounts of resources but provide satisfactory levels of Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HR-QoL). This paper focuses on determinants of HR-QoL in inhibitory patients. Fifty adult patients, enrolled by 11 Italian Haemophilia Centres, were clinically assessed and filled in two HR-QoL generic questionnaires: the EuroQol instrument (EQ- 5 D) and the Short Form- 36 (SF- 36). According to our results, bleeding frequency and <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titres</b> were not found associated with HR-QoL. Global HR-QoL, and in particular the physical component of wellbeing in these patients was found negatively associated with their orthopaedic condition: the EQ- 5 D Visual Analogue Scale (P < 0. 001) scores, the SF- 36 domain 'physical functioning' and 'physical component summary' (P < 0. 01) scores were found significantly correlated with the orthopaedic joint score, even after adjusting for patients' age. These results were confirmed by those from the EQ- 5 D profile. To conclude, the COCIS study is the first study showing that HR-QoL in inhibitory patients is impaired by their orthopedic status, while other aspects do not seem to influence patients' global wellbeing. Our results suggest that while the management of this complication is satisfactory, the attention has now to be focused on the prevention of the orthopaedic problems in these patients, which nowadays constitute {{one of the most important}} aspects to be considered in the haemophilia care...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{occurrence}} of an acquired inhibitor to factor VIII (FVIII) {{is a rare}} event. About 50 % of cases are idiopathic. Among younger people, inhibitors are often found in the postpartum period. Treatment must be administered either to overcome haemorrhagic symptoms or to eradicate the inhibitor. Several approaches have been proposed for inhibitor eradication, based on immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, with varying results. High-dose immunoglobulin (HDIg) has been recently proposed as first-line therapy. We report on four cases with acquired inhibitor to FVIII occurring 4 - 8 months after delivery. At diagnosis, <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> was 5 BU mL(- 1) in one. Factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) was < 1 U dL(- 1) in three cases and 12 U dL(- 1) in one.

In three women, the inhibitor was suppressed in 2 - 50 weeks. After an off-therapy period ranging from 20 to 104 weeks, the FVIII:C was persistently normal and the inhibitor undetectable. The fourth woman remained unresponsive. In two cases, recombinant activated factor VII administration stopped the bleeding.

40|$|Background: Development of inhibitors is {{the most}} serious {{complication}} in haemophilia A treatment. The assessment of risk for inhibitor formation in new or modified factor concentrates is traditionally performed in previously treated patients (PTPs).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine cases of de novo inhibitors in PTPs reported in the scientific literature and to the EUropean HAemophilia Safety Surveillance (EUHASS) programme, and explore determinants and course of inhibitor development. Methods: We used a case series study design and developed a case report form to collect patient level data; including detection, inhibitor course, treatment, factor VIII products used and events that may trigger inhibitor development (surgery, vaccination, immune disorders, malignancy, product switch). Results: We identified 19 publications that reported 38 inhibitor cases and 45 cases from 31 EUHASS centres. Individual patient data were collected for 55 / 83 (66 %) inhibitor cases out of 12   330 patients. The median (range) peak <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> was 4. 4 (0. 5 – 135. 0), the proportion of transient inhibitors was 33 % and only two cases of 12 undergoing immune tolerance induction failed this treatment.

40|$|We {{and others}} have {{previously}} shown that inhibitor containing plasma from patients with congenital haemophilia A sometimes reacts less with von Willebrand factor (VWF) containing concentrates compared with highly purified plasma-derived or recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates. To further substantiate the haemostatic role of a variation in inhibitor reactivity with different FVIII concentrates, we compared the inhibitor titres from 11 plasma samples against a panel of FVIII concentrates and correlated titre with the capacity to inhibit thrombin generation. Three plasma-derived concentrates were tested: Fandhi (Grifols) which contains VWF with a final ratio of approximately 1 (VWF IU per IU FVIII:C); Haemate (CSL Behring) with a ratio of 2. 5 and Haemofil M (Baxter), a monoclonal antibody-purified concentrate containing only trace amounts of VWF. In addition, the recombinant FVIII concentrate Kogenate Bayer (Bayer) containing no VWF {{was included in the}} panel. A statistically significant difference in measured titres against the four concentrates was found. The <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> needed to inhibit 50 % maximum thrombin generation was lowest for Kogenate Bayer and highest and similar for Fandhi and Haemate. This study confirms the results from previous research regarding variation of inhibitor reactivity against different concentrates and further shows that the VWF containing concentrates Fandhi and Haemate added to FVIII-deficient plasma with the presence of inhibitor generate more thrombin than do the purified concentrates Haemofil M and Kogenate Bayer. A further interesting aspect could be that bypass therapy may have an increased efficacy when infused together with FVIII concentrates containing VWF. However, the clinical implications of all these findings in vitro need to be established...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{goal in the}} treatment of haemophilia patients with inhibitors is to eradicate permanently the inhibitor and induce tolerance. Here we summarize our experience at the Malmo centre regarding tolerance induction according to the Malmo Treatment Model. The protocol includes immunoadsorption if needed, neutralization of inhibitor and replacement with factor concentrates, cyclophosphamide intravenously for 2 days (12 - 15 mg kg- 1 bw) and then orally (2 - 3 mg kg- 1 bw) for an additional 8 - 10 days and intravenous gammaglobulin daily at dosages of 0. 4 g kg- 1 bw for 5 days. This protocol has been applied in 23 haemophilia patients with inhibitors, 16 haemophilia A patients and seven haemophilia B patients. Altogether 36 {{attempts have been made to}} induce tolerance. Ten of the 16 haemophilia A (62. 5 %) and 6 / 7 patients with haemophilia B (86 %) became tolerant after the treatment. The chances of success or failure are roughly equal, if the series is considered in a historical perspective. The data showed that the chances of success in tolerance induction with the Malmo protocol were best in those patients with low <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titres,</b> with relatively low historical inhibitory peak and with a long interval since the previous replacement therapy. This was especially true where no inflammatory state was present at the start or during tolerance induction. The advantage with this method compared to the high-dose regimen is that in the successful cases tolerance can be achieved within 3 - 4 weeks...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII (FVIII) {{is a major}} complication of treatment with FVIII in patients with severe haemophilia A. This {{study was designed to}} describe the relationship between the type and location of the factor 8 (F 8) gene mutation and the {{development of}} clinically relevant inhibitors in patients with severe haemophilia A. We conducted a single centre cohort study among 318 consecutive patients (baseline FVIII activity level < 0. 01 IU mL(- 1)) born between 1934 and 2007 who were treated with FVIII on at least 50 exposure days. The primary outcome was clinically relevant inhibitor development, defined as the occurrence of at least two positive <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titres</b> and a decreased recovery. Clinically relevant inhibitors were diagnosed in 14 % (43) of patients (30 high-titre). The cumulative incidence of inhibitor development was 18 % (35 of 200) in high-risk gene defects (67 % in patients with large deletions, 30 % in patients with nonsense mutations, 15 % in patients with intron 1 or 22 inversions) and 7 % (8 of 118) in low-risk gene defects (7 % in patients with small deletions and insertions, 6 % in patients with missense mutations, 8 % in patients with splice site mutations). In patients with point mutations, the cumulative risk of developing inhibitors was highest in patients with mutations in the A 3 and C 2 domains (13 % and 17 % respectively). In conclusion, in agreement with earlier observations, the type and location of the F 8 gene mutation were important determinants of inhibitor development in patients with severe haemophilia...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Objectives: Inhibitor {{development}} in nonsevere haemophilia A patients (FVIII:C, 2 - 40 IU/dL) has a heterogeneous clinical phenotype, ranging from irrelevant transient <b>inhibitors</b> to high <b>titre</b> neutralizing antibodies with severe bleeding complications. Data on inhibitor presentation are scarce and selected, favouring those with severe complications. The aim of {{current study was}} to describe the presenting symptoms of inhibitors in a large unselected cohort of nonsevere haemophilia patients. Materials and Methods: Clinical data were collected of 107 inhibitor patients derived from a source population of 2, 709 nonsevere haemophilia A patients that were treated between 1980 and 2011 in 34 European and Australian centers (the INSIGHT consortium). Patients were subdivided according to age and calendar period at time of inhibitor development (10 -year groups), aiming to search for age-related trends and trends over time. Results: Age at inhibitor detection varied widely between 1 and 85 years with a median age of 38 years (IQR, 15 - 61). Most inhibitors developed {{in the period of}} 2000 - 2010 (n = 64, 60 %). Inhibitors developed after a median of 28 exposure days (IQR, 14 - 66), which was comparable between all age groups. Fifty-seven patients (56 %) had high <b>titre</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (> 5 BU/mL). About half of the high <b>titre</b> <b>inhibitors</b> developed in patients older than 40 years (n = 30, 53 %) and 60 % after the year 2000 (n = 34). In 13 (12 %) inhibitor patients the inhibitor was detected during routine laboratory screening and no clinical signs of the inhibitor were present. More than half of the patients (n = 61) had an increased bleeding tendency at presentation with inhibitor. In 80 patients (80 %) endogenous FVIII:C was decreased to below 5 IU/dL (including 33 / 44 patients with low titer inhibitors), of whom FVIII:C fell below ≤ 0. 01 IU/mL in 49 patients (46 %). Conclusion: Half of the patients with nonsevere haemophilia A and <b>inhibitors</b> developed high <b>titre</b> inhibitors; these were more common in the last decennium. More than half of the patients presented with bleeding complications and 46 % had changed to a severe phenotype. These results stress the importance of close follow-up after exposure to therapeutic factor VIII concentrates in nonsevere haemophilia A patients...|$|R
40|$|In {{children}} with severe haemophilia A, inhibitors to factor VIII (FVIII) usually develop {{during the first}} 50 treatment exposure days and are classified as low or high titre depending on the peak <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> being greater or less than 5 Bethesda units/mL (BU/mL). Classification of the inhibitor may change with time, as some low-titre inhibitors progress to high titre following re-exposure to FVIII concentrate. The aimof this studywas to investigate potential risk factors for such a progression in {{children with}} severe haemophilia A and newly diagnosed inhibitors. This study was a follow-up study of the PedNet Registry and included 260 children with severe haemophilia A and inhibitors born between 1990 and 2009 and recruited consecutively from 31 haemophilia centres. Clinical and laboratory data were collected fromthe date of each child’s first positive inhibitor test for at least 3 years. At the timeof first positive inhibitor test, 49 % (n = 127) had low-titre inhibitors,with 50 % of them progressing to high titre and only 25 % maintaining low titres. The FVIII gene (F 8) mutation type was known in 247 patients (95 %), and included 202 (82 %) null mutations. The progression to high-titre inhibitors was associated with null F 8 mutations (odds ratio [OR]: 2. 6; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 0 – 6. 5), family history of inhibitors (OR: 7. 2; 95 % CI: 1. 8 – 28. 4) {{and the use of}} high-dose immune tolerance induction, defined as 100 IU FVIII concentrate/kg/d (OR: 3. 9; 95 % CI: 1. 5 – 10. 0). These results suggest that high-dose immune tolerance induction should be avoided as the initial strategy in patients who develop low-titre FVIII inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Twenty six {{patients}} with mild or moderate haemophilia A and inhibitors are described. The inhibitor was detected at a {{median age of}} 33 years, after a median of 5. 5 bleeding episodes. This usually following intensive replacement therapy. The median presenting <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> was antihuman 11. 6 BU/ml, antiporcine 1. 45 BU/ml. Plasma basal factor VIII level declined from a median of 0. 08 IU/ml to 0. 01 IU/ml following the inhibitor development. This caused spontaneous bleeding in 22 and a bleeding pattern similar to acquired haemophilia in 17. Bleeding was often severe and caused two deaths. The inhibitor disappeared spontaneously, or following immune tolerance induction, in 16 cases after a median of 9 months (range 0. 5 - 46), with {{a return to the}} original baseline VIIIC level and bleeding pattern accompanied inhibitor loss. The inhibitor persisted in the remainder of the cases over a median period of 99 months (range 17 - 433 months) of follow-up. Inhibitors are an uncommon complication of mild haemophilia which frequently persist and may be associated with severe, life-threatening, haemorrhage. Forty-one percent of treated haemophilic family members had a history of factor VIII inhibitors, suggesting a familial predisposition to develop inhibitors in these kindreds. Sixteen patients from 11 families were genotyped. Seven different missense mutations affecting the light chain were detected and two in the A 2 domain. Five patients from three families had a mutation causing a substitution of Trp 2229 by Cys in the C 2 domain which appears to predispose to inhibitor formation since 7 of the 18 affected individuals have a history of inhibitor developmen...|$|E
40|$|Immune {{tolerance}} induction (ITI) {{is effective}} in approximately 70 % of haemophilia patients with inhibitors. Poor prognostic factors are age > 6 years, ITI started > 1 year from inhibitor development, inhibitor peaks > 200 BU, <b>inhibitor</b> <b>titre</b> > 10 BU when ITI is started and previously failed ITI. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the effectiveness in ITI of a high purity von Willebrand factor/factor VIII (VWF/FVIII) complex concentrate in inhibitor patients at high risk of failure. Patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A and high responding inhibitors who had at least one poor prognostic factor for ITI failure were prospectively followed-up. Success was defined by undetectable inhibitor, recovery and half life > 66 % of expected values. ITI dose regimens were chosen by each haemophilia centre. Seventeen haemophiliacs (16 severe, one moderate), aged 4 - 54 years (median 23) were followed-up for 6 - 71 months. Poor prognostic factors were delayed-onset ITI (n = 16), age > 6 years (n = 16), previously failed ITI (n = 4), inhibitor peak > 200 BU (n = 2) and inhibitor > 10 BU when ITI was started (n = 4). Complete success was obtained in nine patients (53 %) after 4 - 30 months of treatment (median 24), including two of four patients who had previously failed ITI. Seven patients achieved a partial success, with sustained low inhibitor titres (median 1. 5 BU, range 1. 1 - 2. 8) but abnormal recovery and/or half-life, while the remaining patient withdrew ITI after 12 months when the inhibitor titer was still 70 BU. These findings suggest that high purity VWF/FVIII complex concentrates are effective in ITI, even in patients at high risk of failure...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} an increased incidence of inhibitors in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe haemophilia A after the introduction of recombinant products. It was {{the objective of this}} study to investigate whether the inhibitor incidence has increased between 1990 and 2009 in an unselected cohort of PUPs with severe haemophilia A (FVIII< 1 %). Patients were consecutively recruited from 31 haemophilia treatment centres in 16 countries and followed until 50 exposure days or until inhibitor development. Inhibitor development was studied in five-year birth cohorts comparing cumulative incidences. Furthermore the risk for inhibitor development per fiveyear birth cohort was studied using multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for potential genetic and treatment-related confounders. A total of 926 PUPs were included with a total cumulative inhibitor incidence of 27. 5 %. The inhibitor incidence increased from 19. 5 % in 1990 – 1994 (lowest) to 30. 9 % in 2000 – 2004 (highest; p-value 0. 011). Low <b>titre</b> <b>inhibitor</b> incidence increased from 3. 1 % in 1990 – 1994 to 10. 5 % in 2005 – 2009 (p-value 0. 009). High <b>titre</b> <b>inhibitor</b> incidences remained stable over time. After 2000, risk of all inhibitor development was increased with adjusted hazard ratios 1. 96 (95 % CI 1. 06 – 2. 83) in 2000 – 2004 and 2. 34 (1. 42 – 4. 92) in 2005 – 2009. Screening for inhibitors was intensified over this 20 -year study period from a median of 1. 9 to 2. 9 tests/year before 2000 to 2. 7 to 4. 3 tests/ year after 2000. In conclusion, the cumulative inhibitor incidence has significantly increased between 1990 and 2009. The high <b>titre</b> <b>inhibitor</b> incidence has remained stable...|$|R

40|$|Inhibitors are {{antibodies}} that neutralize coagulation factors. They are immunoglobulin’s, arising in congenitally deficient {{individuals as}} a result of administration of missing factors. The development of inhibitors {{remains one of the most}} serious complications of replacement therapy in haemophilia A patients. Inhibitors makes control of bleeding difficult as they need higher doses of factors or bypassing agents, these are coasty and are not always available. This problem is under estimated and needs further work up to detect the true incidence and the risk factors and their effect on management. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of inhibitors in patients with haemophilia A and correlate the severity of illness with inhibitors level by measuring FVIII level and FVIII inhibitors. Design:Cross sectional prospective study Setting: Haemophilia clinic in Khartoum Teaching Hospital in the period from January to May 2010. Methods: Eighty patients with haemophilia A were included in the study. All patients were males with different disease severities (mild, moderate and severe). Their ages ranged from 3 - 60 years. Samples were collected from patients for Factor VIII level and inhibitor quantification. Inhibitor quantification was done by Bethesda assay and expressed inBethesda unit (BU). Results: Seventeen patients (21. 3 %) were found to have inhibitors, fifteen patients with low <b>titre</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (18. 8 %) and two of high titre (2. 5 %). Those with high <b>titre</b> <b>inhibitors</b> had more frequent visits to haemophilia clinic and received more units of factor VIII during the last month. No correlation was found between the severity of the disease and the number of visits during the last year. Inhibitors are most common among severely diseased patients but the correlation between the severity of the disease and the inhibitors was not significant for those with mild and moderate disease. Conclusion: The prevalence of factor VIII inhibitors in this group of patients with haemophilia A was 21. 3 % (seventeen patients). Fifteen patients of low <b>titre</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (18. 8 %) and two of high titre (2. 5 %). This result was significant asthe prevalence of inhibitors was 15 - 25 % in haemophilia A as mentioned in the literature. Inhibitors are most common among severely diseased patients.
