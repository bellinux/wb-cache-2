5|$|The roof {{had long}} been <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> {{by the time of}} Jacob Spiegel's death in 2001 and it was {{threatening}} to collapse. In December of that year, Shmuel Spiegel managed to raise $25,000 for emergency repairs. However, despite offering cholent (the traditional Sabbath lunch stew) at the Sabbath morning kiddush, Spiegel had to search local streets to make the ten men for the minyan. In 2004 the regular membership hovered around 40. Spiegel kept the synagogue running at an annual cost of around $75,000.|$|E
5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged {{to make it look}} like many of the exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape.</b> To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.|$|E

5|$|Duncan was {{assigned}} to Escort Group B-7 in the North Atlantic after her conversion was complete in May 1943. She escorted a number of convoys before she required a lengthy refit from November to May 1944. She helped to sink two German submarines in October 1943. The ship {{was assigned}} to anti-submarine duties in the Western Approaches after her refit was finished in May 1944, and Duncan remained there until April 1945. At that time she was transferred to coastal anti-submarine patrols to counter any last-gasp effort by the Kriegsmarine {{to interfere with the}} Allied supply lines to the Continent. Placed in reserve the following month, Duncan was <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> and was sold for scrap later that year. The demolition, however, was not completed until 1949.|$|E
5|$|Matches {{were played}} at the Namboole Stadium, with a {{capacity}} of 45,202. They were also to be {{played at the}} Nakivubo Stadium, which can hold 15,000 people. However, CECAFA Secretary General Nicholas Musonye decided to move the remaining group games from the Namboole Stadium since it had been <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> due to heavy rains. It was confirmed that on Saturday, 1 December, Somalia would play Tanzania at the Lugogo Stadium at 14:00 UTC+3 while Eritrea would take on Rwanda at the same venue two hours later. On the same day, Sudan were to play Burundi at the Wankulukuku Stadium at 14:00 UTC+3, and finally Malawi to play Zanzibar at the same stadium two hours later.|$|E
5|$|Still, Finley & Figg remains <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape.</b> The Krayoxx affair {{has left}} them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} recommissioned as the {{flagship}} of the China Squadron on 1 December 1881 {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Meyer. She was relieved by her sister La Galissonnière in April 1884. She became flagship of the Levant Squadron after she arrived in France, but was <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> and soon placed in reserve at Cherbourg. Victorieuse became the flagship of Rear Admiral Barrera, second-in-command of the Northern Squadron on 10 February 1892. The ship was on summer maneuvers off the Iberian coast in July 1893. Two years later she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Ménard. She was initially condemned in May 1897, but this was reversed so she could convoy torpedo boats to Bizerte. That plan was later cancelled and Victorieuse was paid off in 1899, becoming guardship of the outer harbor at Brest until finally condemned the following year.|$|E
5|$|Victorieuse {{was placed}} into reserve after she {{finished}} her sea trials in 1876.

5|$|All of the {{surviving}} ships except Condorcet were reduced to second-line roles by 1920. Mirabeau was not repaired after her salvage and was hulked {{for a few years}} before being sold. Vergniaud was <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> and became a target ship before she was sold for scrap. Voltaire and Diderot had their underwater protection modernized in the early 1920s and became training ships before they were condemned in the mid-1930s. Condorcet was assigned to the Channel Division in the early 1920s before she too had her underwater protection modernized. She also became a training ship after its completion, but she was hulked in 1931 and became a depot ship for the torpedo school. The ship was captured intact when the Germans occupied Toulon in November 1942 and was used by them as a barracks ship. Condorcet was scuttled by the Germans in August 1944 and refloated the following year before being scrapped.|$|E

5|$|Poltava was {{subsequently}} raised, repaired and reclassified as a first-class coastal defense {{ship in the}} Imperial Japanese Navy. Renamed Tango (丹後), she served as a gunnery training ship and the ship participated in the Siege of Tsingtao {{at the beginning of}} World War I. She was sold to Russia in March 1916 and arrived in Vladivostok on 2 April 1916. Renamed Chesma (Чесма), the ship arrived in Port Said, Egypt on 19 September and later supported efforts to intimidate the Greek Government into support Allied operations in Macedonia. She arrived at Alexandrovsk on 16 January 1917 after a brief refit in Birkenhead and became flagship of the Arctic Flotilla. Her crew joined the Bolsheviks in October 1917 and Chesma was captured by the British in Murmansk in March 1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. The ship was already <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> and the British immobilized her when they departed Russia in October 1919. She was stricken on 3 July 1924 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E

25|$|Prodded by the DCCTA, the NEA {{undertook}} {{a study of}} the condition of Florida's public schools.

After recovering the New Catalina, Almeida set her ablaze because she was <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> after the fight.|$|E
25|$|In {{anticipation}} of increased trade through the Panama Canal, the Apalachicola Northern Railroad was built from Chattahoochee to Port St. Joe in 1910 {{with plans to}} load large ships with goods to be taken through the canal, advertised as the “Panama Route”. When the depression hit, business dropped off and the railroad was <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> financially. Alfred I. DuPont purchased the struggling railroad in 1933 and created the St. Joe Paper Company. Dupont drew up elaborate plans {{for the development of}} his mill town as “The Model City of the South”, and then died.

In the above case, the ring may be found, but <b>in</b> such <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> that the querent would rather not have seen it in its terrible condition.

25|$|After Harrisburg {{suffered}} {{years of}} being <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>shape</b> economically, Stephen R. Reed was elected mayor in 1981 and stalwartly served until his unexpected defeat in 2009 by Linda D. Thompson, making him the longest serving mayor of Harrisburg. Once elected, Reed immediately started projects which would attract both businesses and tourists. Several museums and hotels such as the National Civil War Museum and the Hilton Harrisburg and Towers were built during his term, along with office buildings and residences. Several semi-professional sports franchises, including the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League, the defunct Harrisburg Heat indoor soccer club and the Harrisburg City Islanders of the USL Second Division, began operations in the city during his tenure as mayor.|$|E

Other notable commanders of the Netherlandish army were the Count of Boussu, Martin Schenck (who after the defeat at Gembloux, enlisted in the Army of Flanders), Emanuel Philibert de Lalaing, Philip, Count of Egmont, William II de La Marck, Lord of Lumey, and Charles Philippe de Croÿ, Marquis d’Havré.|$|E
