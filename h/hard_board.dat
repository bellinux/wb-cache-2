5000|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Smith {{developed}} an “antique" [...] style of painting. Utilizing oil glaze over gessoed <b>hard</b> <b>board,</b> he scratched and scraped {{the surface of}} wet paint to create highlights. Still lifes featured antique props set up in his studio. Landscapes depicted simple farmhouses and cottages in rural Cape Cod. Smith limited his palette to basic earth tones, avoiding overuse of white, with dashes of red or viridian applied sparingly. Smith completed the antique feel of his paintings by setting them in distressed frames.|$|E

50|$|Blades are damaged {{primarily}} by buckling - compressive force, from being pressed into a hard object, such as bone, ice, or a <b>hard</b> cutting <b>board</b> - and by bending, from sideways pressure. Both of these tend {{to roll the}} edge of a blade, due to metal's ductile nature.|$|R
50|$|Performance surf boards were {{traditionally}} {{made from}} laminated layers over foam cores. SUP boards are larger boards {{and the desire}} to travel with them has {{led to the development of}} an inflatable system where the board and pump can be carried in a back pack. The core material is called 'drop stitch'. Thousands of locked nylon stitches keep the board at a specific thickness. Pressure from specially designed hand pumps can inflate a board to over 30Psi. This creates a board not much less rigid than a <b>hard</b> <b>board.</b> This makes inflatable boards both durable and transportable.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{his career}} {{and as long as}} he had the strength, Congdon put his entire self into the work, in the smells, the incisions, the {{scrapings}} of medium across the <b>hard</b> <b>board.</b> His use of materials and on the painting’s surface indicate that his early training in sculpture never left him. He applied oil paints on a prepared - often black - board with masonry tools, palette knives, awls and spatulas, as well as large brushes, practically until the end of his life. Finally, in some cases, he would blow gold or silver powder on to the wet paint. In his later years, he forged a singular approach to painting that incorporated the physicality and spontaneity of action painting into forms of figuration and landscape.|$|E

Claude Nobs discovered the last album by Bonny B. {{and asked him to}} play at the Montreux Jazz Festival with Alice Cooper. On the side, he decided to explore the blues in public schools and colleges throughout western Switzerland, as part of educational concerts on the history and evolution of the blues. In 2006, he planned to open a school in Cambodia for underprivileged children, financed by the sale of his latest album and concert support.|$|E

Besides, in the arena a man's life depends upon his skill, and the conquered is sure to have no mercy shown him unless he has borne himself well. Therefore, each man is anxious to learn. I have had a few obstinate fellows, {{for the most part}} Goths, who would do nothing.

50|$|Containment is {{generally}} implemented by physical {{separation of the}} hot and cold aisles, using blanking panels, PVC curtains or <b>hard</b> panel <b>boards.</b> Containment strategies could differ based on various factors including server tolerance, ambient temperature requirements and leakage from data centers.

50|$|Traditional {{boats in}} the same {{category}} as folding boats include inflatable dinghies and small aluminium boats (tinnies). Inflatable boats try to solve the portability problem with an inflatable keel and side pods. This allows better storage and weight advantages. The main problems of these craft are that they are still quite heavy, they can puncture while on the water and can be time consuming to inflate and deflate for usage. Folding boats require in the order of 10 to 15 minutes to set up and put away but are much tougher than an inflatable craft, and may ultimately be smaller in storage as an inflatable boat may have <b>hard</b> <b>board</b> components for the floor. Aluminium boats cannot be disassembled, and the folding boat of space-age material is stronger than aluminium, while the strength to weight of some wooden ply is actually stronger than aluminium. The lower stiffness and rigidity may add to potential safety of a folding boat by allowing it to flex over waves. This stops the boat from the rocking effect of an inflexible boat.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of views about the origin. According to Nihon gaishi (unofficial history in Japan) written by Raisanyō in 1880s, in the second Siege of Jinju (1593), Toyotomi Hideyoshi {{commanded}} Katō Kiyomasa to invasion of Korea. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was a daimyo, warrior, general and politician of the Sengoku period in Japan and Katō Kiyomasa was famous liegeman of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The reason was Toyotomi Hideyoshi commanded to Korea twice is the breakdown in negotiations between Korea and Japan. In 1593 June, Katō Kiyomasa attacked the Jinju castle in Korea. When Ushi-oni was useful. Katō Kiyomasa and Japanese soldier made a tortoise shell cart. Japanese soldier could hide by entering a tortoise shell cart so that they can save themselves for arrows and stones. As the result, Katō Kiyomasa and Japanese soldier attacked a behind castle and they could collapsed for castle. The tortoise shell cart was wrapped <b>hard</b> <b>board</b> and cowhide. The tortoise shell cart had fake cow head on top and the face look angry. Consequently, it called Ushi-oni. Now, the Ushi-oni is essential for Uwajima festival and it became familiar existence for Uwajima citizen.|$|E

So far, timber waste (the small timbers) is not counted, in fact, only used for the lowest value product as houses fuel or just throw away. Instead, if the waste mannered and developed, it will produce high valuable product and can be accomplished as home industry. One of its uses can be accomplished as basic materials to make artificial board or often called particle board or <b>hard</b> <b>board.</b> These small timbers then destroyed into powder.
