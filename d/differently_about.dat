The New Think Festival is a yearly weekend event that is part of NewThink, a non-profit initiative that aims to inspire youth to think about the world in an innovative way. The festival {{is one of the many}} events throughout the year to get youth involved. In 2015 the festival hosted 40 different organizations at King Hussein Business Park in Amman that inspired their audience to be visionary and think <b>differently</b> <b>about</b> the world through presentations and workshops. The variety of organizations included business, environmental, medical and educational groups.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} first three episodes, Maxwell Zachs called the series [...] "a disappointment". One reason for this, he says, is that {{although}} [...] "we see... lovely, endearing transsexuals" [...] portrayed in the show, [...] "what I don’t see is anything {{that is going to}} make people think or feel any <b>differently</b> <b>about</b> what gender is or how it limits us all in one way or another." [...] He lamented that their expressions of nuance in gender identity and discussions of genderqueerness were absent from the broadcast edit of the show.|$|E
500|$|Before her own marriage, Stone {{felt that}} women {{should be allowed to}} divorce drunken husbands, to {{formally}} end a [...] "loveless marriage" [...] so that [...] "a true love may grow up in the soul of the injured one from the full enjoyment of which no legal bond had a right to keep her ...Whatever is pure and holy, not only has a right to be, but it has a right also to be recognized, and further, I think it has no right not to be recognized." [...] Stone's friends often felt <b>differently</b> <b>about</b> the issue; [...] "Nettee" [...] Brown wrote to Stone in 1853 that she was not ready to accept the idea, even if both parties wanted divorce. Stanton was less inclined to clerical orthodoxy; she was very much in favor of giving women the right to divorce, eventually coming to the view that the reform of marriage laws was more important than women's voting rights.|$|E

It is shown that when agents are <b>differently</b> informed <b>about</b> the income generated in the economy, aggregate demand shocks create a Keynesian-type unemployment. Moreover, the model explains nominal wage/price stickiness and a multiplier effect so as to imply that a larger burden of adjustment is taken by quantities rather than prices.

500|$|Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross {{had long}} been an admirer of Benjamin Franklin, and wished to see him on a coin. In 1933, Sinnock had {{designed}} a medal featuring Franklin, which may have given her the idea. [...] Franklin had opposed putting portraits on coins; he advocated proverbs about which the holder could profit through reflection. In a 1948 interview, Ross noted that Franklin only knew of living royalty on coins, and presumably would feel <b>differently</b> <b>about</b> a republic honoring a deceased founder. [...] Indeed, Franklin {{might have been more}} upset at the reverse design: as numismatic writer Jonathan Tepper noted, [...] "Had Benjamin Franklin known that he would be appearing on a half dollar with an eagle, he most likely would have been quite upset. [...] He detested the eagle, and numismatic lore has it that he often referred to it as a scavenger. Given the practical man that he was, Franklin proposed the wild turkey as our national bird." ...|$|E
500|$|The Irish proved {{very tough}} negotiators, {{so much so}} that Chamberlain complained that one of de Valera's offers had [...] "presented United Kingdom ministers with a three-leafed shamrock, none of the leaves of which had any {{advantages}} for the UK". With the talks facing deadlock, Chamberlain made the Irish a final offer in March 1938 which acceded to many Irish positions, though he was confident that he had [...] "only given up the small things", and the agreements were signed on 25 April 1938. The issue of partition was not resolved, but the Irish agreed to pay £10million to the British. There was no provision in the treaties for British access to the Treaty Ports in time of war, but Chamberlain accepted de Valera's oral assurance that in the event of war the British would have access. The agreements were attacked by Conservative backbencher Winston Churchill in Parliament for surrendering the Treaty Ports, which Churchill described as the [...] "sentinel towers of the Western Approaches". When war came, de Valera denied Britain access to the Treaty Ports under Irish neutrality. Churchill railed against these treaties in The Gathering Storm, stating that he [...] "never saw the House of Commons more completely misled" [...] and that [...] "members were made to feel very <b>differently</b> <b>about</b> it when our existence hung in the balance during the Battle of the Atlantic". Chamberlain, however, believed that the Treaty Ports were unusable if Ireland was hostile, and deemed their loss worthwhile to assure friendly relations with Dublin.|$|E
500|$|In a video review, Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone {{described}} it as [...] "extravagant, scintillating", further praising the dance moves. He concluded that the ending was in a classic [...] "it-was-all-a-dream fashion" [...] when the scenes cut back to the beginning. Melinda Newman, writing for HitFix {{described it}} as NSFW, highly stylized and a reclaim of the singer's sexuality. Whitney Phanuef of the same website praised the clip as the best on Beyoncé, further highlighting its [...] "unforgettable song/video combination" [...] accompanied with eroticism and Beyoncé's post-child sexuality. Melissa Locker, writing for Time stated that the singer went [...] "properly XXX" [...] for the [...] "hot" [...] clip and added {{that it would make}} viewers think <b>differently</b> <b>about</b> the word [...] "peaches". Edwin Ortiz of Complex felt that during the various wardrobe changes, each outfit was better than the previous. Ashley Lee from The Hollywood Reporter classified the visual as [...] "ornate" [...] and opined that Beyoncé portrayed an aristocrat daydreaming about affection. Similarly, Michael Zelenko of The Fader described her character as an aristocrat [...] "in desperate need of physical attention" [...] and noted similarities with the film True Lies in the strip scene. John Boone from E! Online praised the overall sexiness of the video and the singer's look in various scenes. Hailing the video [...] "steamy", Dan Reilly of Spin noted the variety of revealing outfits worn by Beyoncé and concluded [...] "here's no nudity, but the video certainly comes close". Writing on behalf of Vanity Fair, Michelle Collins stated in her review, [...] "If you're a fan of gorgeously choreographed burlesque routines, as well as women in their thirties who defy the logic of cellulite, 'Partition' is a good starting off point in your journey through Beyoncé's 'Beyoncé.'" [...] Alice Newbold of The Daily Telegraph hailed the explicit nature of the video stating how it showed Beyoncé as [...] "one sassy lady on a mission to show she's back in the game".|$|E

Empirical evidence also supports a historical pro-cyclical relationship between fertility rates and business cycle fluctuations (Silver 1965; Lee 1990; Sobotka et al. 2011). At the aggregate level this {{holds true for}} the majority of the 20 th century financial and economic crises that, albeit very <b>differently,</b> brought <b>about</b> a more or less pronounced reduction of birth rates (Sobotka et al. 2010, 2011).|$|R

He felt <b>differently</b> <b>about</b> the Muslim leader Muhammed Ali Jinnah, but was aware of his power, stating [...] "If {{it could be said}} that any single man held the future of India {{in the palm of his}} hand in 1947, that man was Mohammad Ali Jinnah." [...] During his meeting with Jinnah on 5 April 1947, Mountbatten tried to persuade Jinnah of a united India, citing the {{difficult}} task of dividing the mixed states of Punjab and Bengal, but the Muslim leader was unyielding in his goal of establishing a separate Muslim state called Pakistan.|$|E

I got to the stage when I started to ask myself if I really wanted to spend all my working life playing a misery." [...] However, according to Ratcliff, the scriptwriters decision to make Sue pregnant changed her mind about leaving.

50|$|Macrophomic acid is a fungal {{metabolite}} {{isolated from}} the fungus Macrophoma commelinae. The enzyme macrophomate synthase converts 5-acetyl-4-methoxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone to 4-acetyl-3-methoxy-5-methyl-benzoic acid (macrophomic acid) through an unusual intermolecular Diels-Alder reaction (Scheme 1). The pathway to formation of macrophomic acid suggests that the enzyme is a natural Diels-Alderase. Formation {{of this type of}} aromatic ring compound normally proceeds via the shikimate and polyketide pathways; however, the production of macrophomic acid by macrophomate synthase proceeds totally <b>differently.</b> Learning <b>about</b> the production of macrophomic acid by a possible natural Diels-Alderase enzyme is important in understanding enzyme catalytic mechanisms. This knowledge can then be applied to organic synthesis.|$|R

Critic Isabell St. John Bliss also celebrates Edward Young’s ability to write his poetry {{in the style of the}} Graveyard School and at the same time include Christian themes, and Cecil V.

25|$|Outcomes have {{generally}} indicated that early onset of puberty in girls can be psychologically damaging. The {{main reason for}} this detrimental effect {{is the issue of}} body image. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls who have not yet entered puberty. A result of the social pressure to be thin, the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, boys may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing <b>differently.</b> Embarrassment <b>about</b> a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.|$|R

5000|$|Despite Canadian {{adoption}} of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the 1980s, its courts have rejected US-style limits on libel law. While it was neither a political case or one about the freedom of religion, in Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto 1995 S.C.J. No. 64, Justice Peter Cory, for the Supreme Court of Canada, stated, “I simply cannot see that the law of defamation is unduly restrictive or inhibiting”. However, other English speaking countries have ruled <b>differently.</b> From <b>about</b> 1994 to 2006, according to Burnett, [...] "the highest courts in England, Australia and New Zealand have all recognized that the traditional law of libel fails to adequately protect free speech, and they have all issued decisions which begin to right the balance.

Here, we review behavioural and neuroimaging evidence that points to a complex interaction between emotion modulation and working memory in Alzheimer’s. In fact, depending on the function involved, patients may or may not show an emotional benefit in their working memory performance. In addition, this benefit is not always clearly biased (e. g., towards negative or positive information). We interpret this complex pattern of results {{as a consequence of the}} interaction between multiple factors including the severity of Alzheimer’s disease, the nature of affective stimuli, and type of working memory task...|$|R
