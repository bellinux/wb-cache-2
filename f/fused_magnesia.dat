The unit power consumption for magnesia production is about 3000 kWh/t, higher than that in developed countries. In this research, a 3000 kVA new arc furnace was used to produce <b>fused</b> <b>magnesia,</b> and the unit consumption decreased to 2560 kWh/t.

With {{the increase of}} zircon content up to 6 wt%, the strength of sintered samples increased but the apparent porosity decreased. 6 wt % is an appropriate content of zircon to possess better properties of samples, {{and in this case}} the samples have a dense microstructure and lower content of glass phase.

This type of purging plug makes the gas flow in the metal pipes with very small resisting force and good air tightness. It is produced by using cold isostatic pressing, and has high strength and good corrosion resistance.

40|$|The sinter {{quality is}} {{dependent}} on sinter mineralogy, which in turn depends on the chemical compositions of the sinter mix. Although many research works have been conducted, further investigation {{on the effect of}} chemical compositions (MgO, A 2 O 3, Basicity) on the sinter quality is still required for further improvement of the sinter and more alternative additives are still being tested. In this project, a sinter pot has been used to manufacture sinters, which were characterized using point-counting to quantify the different phases and X-Ray diffraction to identify the polymorphic forms of Ca 2 SiO 4 of the silicate phases. The produced sinters were evaluated with respect to reducibility index (RI), reduction degradation index (RDI), physical breakdown (TI and AI), and production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The influence of ignition temperature, magnesium oxide, alumina addition and basicity on the mineralogy as well as physical and chemical properties of iron ore sinters were investigated. Results were obtained as follows: For the Base case with a basicity of 2, 2. 8 mass% MgO content, 1. 7 mass % Al 2 O 3 and 10 mass% CaO, the effect of ignition temperature, which ranged between 864 oC and 1100 oC, on the sinter quality was investigated. Results showed that the ignition temperature had an effect on the sinter properties: reducibility (RI), physical strength (TI and AI), production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The temperature 1053 oC was the best ignition temperature for an economically acceptable sinter. A further increase in ignition temperature was found to form melt {{on the surface of the}} sinter produced, leading to a sinter of low quality. Also, X-rays diffraction pattern showed that the allotropic transformation of the Ca 2 SiO 4 did not take place. The Low SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter had the highest reducibility index and had the highest Abrasion index and the lowest coke breeze rate at 2. 8 mass% MgO content compared to all the sinters produced in this project. For the High SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter MgO was added through dolomite and <b>fused</b> <b>magnesia.</b> A comparative study on the effect of dolomite and <b>fused</b> <b>magnesia</b> was conducted. The sinter to which <b>fused</b> <b>magnesia</b> was added had lower reducibility, higher reduction degradation, higher tumble index, lower abrasion index and lower coke breeze rate than the sinter to which dolomite was added. High SiO 2 – High Al 2 O 3 sinter had the lowest reducibility index, the lowest reduction degradation, the lowest tumbler index and the highest coke breeze rate. The increase in MgO content in all the sinters produced increased the coke breeze rate. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|Magnesite is an {{industrial}} mineral {{used in the}} production of calcined, dead and <b>fused</b> <b>magnesia</b> as well as magnesium metal. In 1998, the total world magnesite production was estimated at 18 million tonnes (Coope, 1999). In that year, about 8. 7 million tonnes of magnesia were produced from natural magnesite and about 1. 8 million tonnes were produced from seawater or brines.

40|$|The project {{involved}} {{the formation of}} alumina-spinel composites from combinations of different raw material sources, at two different compositions, varied over a range of temperatures succeeding a single stage firing route. The starting materials used were viz. A 16 SG, CL 370, CT 9 FG for alumina sources and <b>fused</b> <b>magnesia</b> and sintered magnesia for magnesia sources. Alumina and magnesia sources were combined at compositions of 80 : 20 and 90 : 10 weight ratio, pressed and reaction sintered at temperatures 1200 ºC, 1300 ºC, 1400 ºC, 1500 ºC and 1600 ºC. Increase in the spinel content formed, was observed in samples fired at higher temperatures. Batches with finer raw material sources offered better densification an increasing trend with temperature was observed for the same. The XRD analysis plots of 80 : 20 batches showed trace amounts of corundum phase peaks at 1600 ºC while the 90 : 10 batches indicated small but clear peaks of the same at the highest temperature {{and that can be}} attributed to the higher residual alumina in the latter batches...|$|E
40|$|Sintered and <b>fused</b> <b>magnesia</b> (MgO) are primary {{ingredients}} of MgO-C and Mag-Chrome bricks used for steel processing furnaces, for example BOF, EAF, and ladles. Magnesia clinker exhibits brilliant blue or red CL colors in these bricks. The blue CL color is generally interpreted {{to be produced}} by lattice defects or intrinsic properties of MgO crystal. The red CL color is related to impurity centers. Cr 3 +, Fe 3 +, and Mn 4 + activators are known to produce red CL color in MgO. Red to blue or blue to red CL color changes in MgO clinkers in MgO-C refractories from slag line of ladle or BOF, in fact, represent changes in local atmosphere within the refractory brick. In a reducing surrounding local CO atmosphere (in {{the center of the}} brick), the valence state of these transition metal ions are easily reduced and the blue CL is enhanced. Similarly, in an oxidized environment where free O 2 and CO 2 are predominant gaseous species, MgO grains in MgO-C and Mag-Chrome brick generally produce red CL color. The cover shows photomicrograph of a sintered MgO clinker from a MgO-C brick used as slag line refractory in a steelmaking ladle. Note the original red CL color of MgO due to Cr 3 + ion in the central portion of the clinker and the blue CL color at the grain peripheral areas of the clinker. Cathodoluminescence may be used as thermobarometer in refractories to trace the environmental history...|$|E
40|$|Mold-metal {{reactions}} can be encountered {{during the}} investment casting of magnesium alloys. This study {{was carried out}} for investigating the degree of reactions between the various refractory materials and the magnesium alloy AZ 91 E, and for finding new techniques to reduce these reactions. Investment casting molds containing multiple test pieces with the dimensions of 25 x 25 x 60 mm in dimension were used. The wax pattern of each test piece was coated with a different ceramic face coat in mold fabrication and the resulting differences on cast metal surfaces were studied. The backup layers of the shell were {{the same for all}} test pieces. Fused alumina, fused silica, molochite, zircon, yttria, zirconia and <b>fused</b> <b>magnesia</b> were the ceramics studied as face coat materials. Digital pictures of the cast surfaces were taken and an image analyzer was used to a quantitatively assess the reacted areas. The results show that <b>fused</b> <b>magnesia</b> and yttria were the best face coat materials to resist molten magnesium. Fused alumina and zircon were the next best materials. Molochite and zirconia were ranked as moderate to poor in resisting reactions. Strong mold-metal reactions were seen in the case of fused silica. Shell permeability measurements suggest that the degree of reactivity is not related to the shell permeability. It can however be correlated to the free energy of formation of the refractory. The excellent reaction resistance of magnesia and yttria observed in the experiments {{can be explained by the}} strongly negative Gibb's free energy of formation and consequent stability of these materials. HSC software was used to calculate theoretically the free energy of formation for the refractories studied in this work. The obtained results were compared to experimental values. Analysis with EDS indicated that the reaction layers consisted mostly of oxides. Ceramic test bars coated with various refractories were dipped in magnesium melt to study for reactions. It was seen that none of the tested refractories reacted with magnesium as a result of the dipping operation. It was concluded that oxygen is required for the mold-metal reactions to be initiated. It was verified that the atmosphere surrounding the shell also influenced the observed reactions. In molds containing both normal and reduced permeability shells around the test pieces, the surfaces cast in reduced permeability shells showed large reductions in reactivity. It is suggested that reactions in investment casting molds occur in two stages: 1. During pouring and filling 2. After the filling is complete by the effect of external oxygen. The cooling curves of magnesia-coated test bars were compared with those of silica-coated test bars. Analysis shows that heat is released during the mold-metal reactions. An attempt was made to incorporate the inhibitor KBF 4 in the mold structure in the form of first coat stucco. Rough cast surfaces were obtained, which indicated that the used high sintering temperature was not compatible with this inhibitor. Similarly, when the preheated investment-casting mold was placed in a bed of KBF 4 before casting, only small reductions in reactivity were obtained. Reactivity was reduced in shells buried in a bed of Croning sand. Then, however, the cast pieces contained gas holes. NaBF 4 produced better results as an inhibitor. It was first dissolved in water and then the sintered molds were dipped in this solution. Large reductions in reactivity were observed. The inhibiting effect of this chemical can be attributed to the liberation of BF 3 gas during mold preheating. reviewe...|$|E
