5000|$|The {{classification}} {{of a crime}} or other conduct as constituting moral turpitude has significance in several areas of law. First, prior conviction of a crime of moral turpitude (or in some jurisdictions, [...] "moral turpitude conduct", even without a conviction) is considered to have a bearing on the honesty <b>of</b> a <b>witness</b> and might be used for purposes <b>of</b> the <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnesses.</b> Second, offenses involving moral turpitude may be grounds to deny or revoke state professional licenses such as teaching credentials, licenses to practice law, or other licensed profession. Third, this concept is of great importance for immigration purposes in the United States, Canada (prior to 1976), and some other countries, since offenses which are defined as involving moral turpitude are considered bars to immigration into the U.S.|$|R
40|$|On August 24, 1975, {{new rules}} of {{evidence}} became effective in Nebraska courts. Known officially as the Nebraska Evidence Rules and codified as Chapter 27 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes, the statutes represent {{the end result of}} an effort to modernize and simplify the evidence rules of this jurisdiction. Section 27 - 609 is the codification of that portion of the Nebraska Evidence Rules relating to the <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnesses</b> by the introduction of evidence relating to prior convictions. The provisions of this statute are well worth examination, for not only does rule 609 work apparent and substantial changes in the scope <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> by prior conviction but it also raises some serious unanswered questions regarding both the extent of the interrogation permitted in connection with, and the trial judge 2 ̆ 7 s ability to control, this form <b>of</b> <b>impeachment.</b> It is with the existence and significance of these unanswered questions that this article deals.

5000|$|The word [...] "impeachment" [...] {{derives from}} Latin root impedicare expressing {{the idea of}} {{becoming}} caught or entrapped, and has analogues in the modern French verb empêcher (to prevent) and the modern English impede. Medieval popular etymology also associated it (wrongly) with derivations from the Latin impetere (to attack). (In its more frequent and more technical usage, <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>witness</b> means challenging the honesty or credibility of that person.) ...|$|R
5000|$|All {{experienced}} courtroom observers, however, {{agree that}} jurors will have great difficulty understanding that distinction, known as [...] "limited admissibility" [...] or [...] "admissibility {{for a limited}} purpose". Even more unlikely is the prospect that a juror who understands the instruction will be psychologically capable of obeying it. The only practical impact of this limited admissibility is that the evidence cannot be used to prop up a weak case {{that would otherwise be}} dismissed by the court for insufficient evidence, as it was admitted only for the <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>witness.</b>|$|R
40|$|Typically, {{arguments}} for restricting character impeachment evidence {{are based in}} part on the premise that prior crimes, at least violent crimes, generally indicate little about a person 2 ̆ 7 s veracity. The argument advanced here against character <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> criminal defendants does not rely on that premise; in fact, it accepts the premise that prior antisocial behavior, even not involving dishonesty, often does indicate a good deal about a person 2 ̆ 7 s general truthtelling inclination. A careful analysis of the situation of the accused on the witness stand-rather than an easy assumption about irrelevance-leads to this Article 2 ̆ 7 s broad conclusion that character <b>impeachment</b> evidence <b>of</b> criminal defendants ought to be eliminated. A similar analysis suggests that in some cases character <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> other <b>witnesses</b> ought to be allowed...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Rules of Evidence {{limit the}} use of {{propensity}} character evidence to specific instances, including the <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>witness.</b> The character evidence rules focus textually on individuals, and {{it is unclear whether}} they apply to corporations. This note examines whether Rule 404, which prohibits propensity character evidence, and Rule 608, which makes an exception for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> apply to corporations. It explores whether corporations can possess character {{for the purposes of the}} Rules, examines how corporate vicarious testimony affects impeachment, and investigates whether the rationales for the character evidence rules are applicable to corporations. This note concludes that Rules 404 and 608 should be amended to include corporations, so that corporations testifying vicariously through representatives can be held accountable at trial for prior dishonest acts...|$|R
40|$|The United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1995 {{decision}} in Tome v. United States has read Federal Rule of Evidence 801 (d) (1) (B) {{to prevent the}} prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s offering a child abuse victim 2 ̆ 7 s prior consistent statements as substantive evidence. As {{a result of that}} decision, the statements will also be inadmissible even for the limited purpose of helping to evaluate the credibility of a child, if there is a serious risk that the out-of-court statements would be used on the issue of guilt or innocence. Moreover, after the Court 2 ̆ 7 s March 2004 {{decision in}} Crawford v. Washington, which redesigned the landscape of Confrontation Clause analysis, other avenues of substantive admissibility for the child 2 ̆ 7 s prior statements - the excited utterance hearsay exception, the residual 2 ̆ 2 catch-all 2 ̆ 2 hearsay exception, or the states 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 tender years 2 ̆ 2 hearsay exception - are all in jeopardy unless the child testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement. The combination of Tome and Crawford has been a 2 ̆ 2 one-two punch 2 ̆ 2 for child abuse prosecutions. Post-Crawford is the ideal time to revive and refine Judge Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s proposal that Rule 801 (d) (1) (B) should be amended. The amendment should permit the substantive use (subject to the court 2 ̆ 7 s exercise of discretion under Rule 403) of all <b>of</b> a <b>witness</b> 2 ̆ 7 s prior consistent statements that would be helpful to the fact-finder in assessing the credibility <b>of</b> the <b>witness</b> 2 ̆ 7 s trial testimony given whatever method <b>of</b> <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>witness</b> had occurred. That test, like the test of helpfulness of lay or expert opinion evidence under Rules 701 and 702, ought to be a flexible one; there should be no hard and fast rule requiring that an admissible prior consistent statement precede an alleged impeaching fact...|$|R
40|$|James v. Illinois permits illegally-obtained {{evidence}} to impeach defendants, but not defense witnesses. Thus far, all courts have construed James to allow <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> defendants 2 ̆ 7 hearsay declarations. This article argues against allowing illegally-obtained {{evidence to}} impeach defendants 2 ̆ 7 hearsay declarations because doing so unduly diminishes the exclusionary rule 2 ̆ 7 s deterrent effect. The distinction between impeaching defendants and defense witnesses disappears when courts allow prosecutors to impeach defendants 2 ̆ 7 hearsay declarations. Because defense witnesses report exculpatory conduct of a defendant who {{always has a}} substantial interest in disguising his criminality, their testimony routinely incorporates defendant hearsay. Defense witness testimony thus routinely paves the way for illegally-obtained evidence, contradicting James 2 ̆ 7 s intention that substantial deterrence result from prohibiting <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> defense <b>witnesses.</b> Moreover, in the few cases finding that defense witnesses 2 ̆ 7 testimony did not invite illegally-obtained evidence by incorporating defendant hearsay, prosecutors overlooked winning evidentiary arguments or the courts made evidentiary errors. The unpredictable nature of these instances of exclusion adds insult to injury: Because competent defense counsel will refrain from calling a defense witness rather than hope for prosecutorial neglect or judicial error, the prosecution benefits from its illegally-obtained proof, eliminating the deterrence James contemplates. Meanwhile, less than competent counsel will stumble into calling defense witnesses and occasionally {{reap the benefits of}} prosecutorial neglect or judicial error when illegally-obtained evidence is not admitted despite its impeaching effect on defendant hearsay. Thus, the status quo imposes costs to the truth without any compensating deterrence of constitutional violations. By comparison, flipping a coin to decide whether prosecutors can use suppressed evidence to impeach would greatly improve matters. It assures that a limited impeachment exception engenders at least some additional deterrence beyond that already provided by suppression on the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s case in chief to justify its truth seeking costs. Flipping a coin is hardly an acceptable solution. Nonetheless, that it improves the status quo vividly illustrates the error of applying the exception to impeach defendant hearsay and the futility <b>of</b> pursuing an <b>impeachment</b> exception whose parameters purport to promote accurate fact finding without undermining the exclusionary rule 2 ̆ 7 s deterrence of constitutional violations...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the federal}} level, the {{impeachment}} {{process is a}} two-step procedure. The House of Representatives must first pass, by a simple majority of those present and voting, articles <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> which constitute the formal allegation or allegations.
