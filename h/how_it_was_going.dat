5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E

The episode {{was the only time}} that show runner Mike Scully ever got a call from Fox where they {{suggested}} not doing the episode. They were worried about the sexual content, the nudity, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be handled. They disliked several of the phrases used in the episode, such as the term [...] "ass forkin'".|$|E

500|$|Lytle later noted, [...] "It was {{actually}} Jim 's fault. He {{suggested that we}} consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he convinced me {{it might be a}} good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 21, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Taking Back Sunday had begun recording their third album with Eric Valentine. The group chose Valentine because he had produced Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf (2002) and Third Eye Blind's self-titled album (1997). Although they met with Howard Benson and Rob Cavallo, the band's [...] "love of Eric’s work kind of trumped any other meeting we had." [...] Unlike their previous records, the group worked in a large studio (Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, California). Warner Bros. told them, [...] "Take your time and it’s done when you’re done with it," [...] and the band re-recorded the demos. According to Mascherino, the group [...] "knew <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to come out... was a thorough way to do it." [...] Working in a big studio, according to Lazzara, gave the band the opportunity to [...] "have more than two guitar sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E

2500|$|At {{one time}} {{a vial of}} poison {{was found in the}} flue of the chimney, and being taken down, Dr. George B. Hopson gave one drop to a cat, causing its death in seven seconds. The witch claimed to have put the poison there for the purpose of killing Mr. Bell. Being asked <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to {{administer}} the poison, it said by pouring it into the dinner pot. It is remarkable that, although he enjoyed good health up to the time of this event, Mr. Bell died within [...] days after the vial was found, being in a stupor {{at the time of his}} death. From this time the people visited the house less frequently, although the witch would now and then be heard.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting to Digital Spy {{about her}} return, Lawrence said: [...] "I've {{not been in}} the show for 11 years and it's not like I've ever thought [...] "I'll never go back", you just think that your chance to go back has gone. It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Butler Cornbury {{also called}} at the cottage; and her visit was very {{delightful}} to Rachel,--not the less so perhaps because Mrs. Prime was {{away at a}} Dorcas meeting.
