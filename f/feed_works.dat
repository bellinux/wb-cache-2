2500|$|As the {{population}} grew, a commercial district {{developed in the}} downtown area, made accessible by a mule-drawn trolley system that connected {{different parts of the}} city. The company that oversaw that system was the Meridian Street Railway Company, organized in 1883. At its peak the mule-drawn line included about four miles of track throughout the city. Industry profits helped finance the construction of most of the city's major buildings, including the Grand Opera House and its associated Marks-Rothenberg Store, which opened in 1890. [...] The opera house, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was combined with the neighboring Marks-Rothenberg Department Store and renovated in 2006 into an upscale theater and conference center. Together the buildings now comprise [...] "The Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts." [...] A significant business that developed in this period was Soulé Steam <b>Feed</b> <b>Works,</b> incorporated by George W. Soulé in 1893, which industrialized cotton and helped grow the lumber industry in the city. Partly due to Soulé's business, Mississippi was ranked sixth among the states in cotton seed production by the 1920s.|$|E

50|$|Soulé Steam <b>Feed</b> <b>Works</b> also {{patented}} the Simplex Automatic Lumber Edge Stacker in 1897, {{which would}} automate {{the process of}} stacking lumber. The first Edge Stacker was instaled in the mill of Camp & Hinton Company in Lumberton, Mississippi in July 1895, and more than 100 were installed around the nation. Some notable mills in which Soulé Stackers were instaled include the Great Southern Lumber Company in Bogalusa, Louisiana; Grays Harbor Commercial Company in Cosmopolis, Washington; and Potlatch Lumber Company in Elk River, Idaho.|$|E
50|$|Soulé Steam <b>Feed</b> <b>Works</b> is a {{historic}} business founded in Meridian, Mississippi in 1891 by George Soulé. The complex was listed as a contributing property to Union Station Historic District, which {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1979 under the Meridian Multiple Resource Area (MRA). It was listed as a Mississippi Landmark in 2003. The business, known for its many patented innovations in steam engine technology, reached its height {{around the turn of the}} century, producing products that were sold around the world.|$|E
50|$|Soulé founded {{two other}} {{companies}} before Steam <b>Feed</b> <b>Works,</b> the Southern Standard Cotton Press Company and the Progress Manufacturing Company. Short of money after his railroad accident, {{he decided to}} build his own cotton press for his fledgling cotton gin. The invention was simpler and less expensive than those {{on the market and}} attracted wide attention. Soulé called his invention the Southern Standard Cotton Press and founded the company around this machine. In 1881, two years after he moved the business to Meridian, the company sold 750 cotton presses all over the South.|$|E
50|$|To chuck a tool or {{workpiece}} {{is to hold}} it with a chuck, {{in which}} case it has been chucked. Lathe work whose workholding involves chucking individual slugs or blanks is often called chucking work, in contrast to bar <b>work</b> or bar <b>feed</b> <b>work.</b> In bar work the bar protrudes from the chuck, is worked upon, then cut off by a lathe tool (parted off) rather than being sawn off. Automatic lathes that specialize in chucking work are often called chuckers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Aquatic suction feeding in {{vertebrates}} involves extremely unsteady flow, externally {{as well as}} internally of {{the expanding}} mouth cavity. Consequently, studying the hydrodynamics involved in this process is a challenging research area, where experimental studies and mathematical models gradually aid {{our understanding of how}} suction <b>feeding</b> <b>works</b> mechanically. Especially for flow patterns inside the mouth cavity, our current knowledge is almost entirely based on modelling studies. In the present paper, we critically discuss some of the assumptions and limitations of previous analytical models of suction feeding using computational fluid dynamics...|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} laboratory {{setup for}} electrospinning {{consists of a}} spinneret (typically a hypodermic syringe needle) connected to a high-voltage (5 to 50 kV) direct current power supply, a syringe pump, and a grounded collector. A polymer solution, sol-gel, particulate suspension or melt is loaded into the syringe and this liquid is extruded from the needle tip at a constant rate by a syringe pump. Alternatively, the droplet {{at the tip of}} the spinneret can be replenished by feeding from a header tank providing a constant feed pressure. This constant pressure type <b>feed</b> <b>works</b> better for lower viscosity feedstocks.|$|E
50|$|In 1886, Soulé {{sold the}} Southern Standard Press after {{founding}} Progress Manufacturing in 1894, and invented the Ideal Hay-Press {{for use in}} the new company. This new business was located on 5th Street between 26th and 27th Avenues and grew to include a foundry and machine shop. Looking to invent more, he turned over active management to Progress Manufacturing in 1888 and began working on a small rotary engine. He sold Progress Manufacturing in 1891 and established Steam <b>Feed</b> <b>Works.</b> The business was incorporated in 1893. In total, Soulé patented over 40 items during his lifetime, including the Success Cotton Seed Huller and an improved version of the sugar mill.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, {{when the}} new Steam <b>Feed</b> <b>Works</b> had become well-established, Soulé found a country home in Santa Rosa County, Florida. He began to turn much of the company over to his son, Clyde, and spent more {{of his time in}} Florida, before {{returning}} to Meridian in 1917, where he stayed until his death on December 21, 1922. During his life he had two wives - Olivia Sherman Warren in 1873 and Constance Gara in 1907, two years after his former wife's death - and nine children. One of his grand children, also named George Soulé, was an influential R&B songwriter in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E

50|$|Soulé Steam <b>Feed</b> <b>Works</b> was {{originally}} {{located at the}} corner of 25th Avenue and 5th Street. The first building built on the company's present lot was built between 1890 and 1892 was formerly the Meridian Candy Factory. After the building was devastated by fire, George Soulé bought it {{and turned it into a}} machine shop, assembly area, and office for the up-and-coming business, which would later relocate there. The two-story building's facade {{was originally}} brick, but a layer of lime cement stucco was added in the 1930s, and a second layer was added in the late 1960s. Inside the building is an 8 ft x 12 ft fireproof vault, which holds the original company records. Above the vault, the company is written in gold. The vault was added after an 1895 fire destroyed George Soulé's office and the records in it.|$|E

50|$|George Wilberforce Soulé, {{founder of}} Soulé Steam <b>Feed</b> <b>Works,</b> {{was born in}} Buffalo, New York in 1849. He was a {{descendant}} of another George Soule who came to America on the Mayflower. At the age of one, he and his father, Isaac, moved to Wisconsin. When young George was 20 years old, his father died, {{and he decided to}} leave the family farm and pursue his own livelihood. Despite having obtained less than one year of formal education, he served as a school teacher for one three-month term before heading south to end up in Morton, Mississippi, in 1875. He had originally missed a ship to Cuba, but stayed at several businesses in Morton and Shubuta, Mississippi, before moving his operations to Meridian in 1879. Businesses operated by Soulé upon entering Meridian included a turpentine company, a lumber company, a cotton gin, and a manufacturer's representative. Before he moved to Meridian, he was involved in a railroad accident in March 1876 in which he lost his left leg and four toes of his right foot.|$|E

30|$|Taking the {{application}} a level further {{is the introduction}} of mobile RSS feature. An RSS <b>feed</b> <b>works</b> by creating a source of data that is machine (computer) readable. RSS uses XML, which stands for eXtensible Markup Language, to encode a variety of information sources in a standardized way. It is very handy for both clients and doctors. The first can be instantly notified and keep track of their lab test results and the latter can be notified about any recently diagnosed patients. Undeniably, the component of mobility could {{save a lot of}} time, but also it consolidates the need of automated services conveying all the “stress” from the user to {{the application}}. The reason for introducing this feature, besides its arising popularity and the reach of mobile technology in general, is the usability that offers to users by subscribing to several RSS feedbacks and by receiving updates without the web browser requirement-a feature that provides an enhanced linkage between mobile phone and health status.|$|E
40|$|As {{we saw in}} Chapter 2, {{they are}} {{excellent}} primary antennas, easily fabricated and reproducibly providing good gain. For higher gains, parabolic dishes are more compact, but horns are attractive as feed antennas for the same reasons. One way {{to think of a}} horn is as an impedance transformer, gradually transitioning from the constrained impedance of a waveguide to the impedance of free space. We can see this experimentally: an open waveguide is not matched, with a typical VSWR of perhaps 1. 4 : 1, while almost any horn provides a better match. The size of the final aperture opening to space determines the gain of the horn. 6. 4. 1 Conical horn feeds In section 6. 3. 1, we saw that a cylindrical waveguide, or “coffee-can, ” <b>feed</b> <b>works</b> well for small f/D reflectors. As the cylinder diameter is increased to provide a larger aperture for narrower beamwidth, additional waveguide modes can propagate and disturb the radiation pattern. If the diameter is increased in a gradual flare, like a funnel, we have a conical horn antenna. The gradual flare reduces the generation of additional waveguide modes and provides a cleaner pattern...|$|E
