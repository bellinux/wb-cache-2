Interfering carriers are identified by distinctive code (signature) modulation of the energy-dispersal waveform of each FDM-FM carrier. Identification presently is accomplished within 10 minutes for ratios of <b>interfering</b> <b>carrier</b> power to noise power down to - 2 dB, and for ratios of <b>interfering</b> <b>carrier</b> power to desired carrier power down to - 17 dB.

The system and method are effective in determining an interference temperature for each of multiple carriers within the UWB signal and classifying {{each one of the}} multiple carriers of the channel as being an <b>interfered</b> <b>carrier</b> or a non-interfered carrier based on the interference temperature for each one of multiple carriers. The desired signal is then transmitted on the <b>interfered</b> <b>carriers</b> at a signal power that is not greater than the power limit of the underlay UWB policy and on the non-interfered carriers at a signal power that is greater than the power limit of the underlay UWB policy...|$|R

Furthermore, though all-band frequency scanning measurement parallelly detects all the training sequences' power level in each timeslot in the measurement frame period, the carrier frequencies with low reuse density, low traffic, and low noise floor could be chosen to the adjustment and optimization of the <b>interfered</b> <b>carrier</b> frequencies. In these ways, the performance of the radio network could be fully enhanced.|$|R
40|$|For the LMSS, the {{required}} beam isolation level necessitates that the computed C/I level under idealized conditions be equal or higher than 27 dB. This {{means that the}} received carrier in the footprint of any reference beam {{should be at least}} 27 dB higher than the aggregate power of the <b>interfering</b> <b>carriers</b> from all other cochannel beams. In order to achieve this beam isolation, the baseline design opts for a 7 -frequency reuse plan in which only one mode of polarization is used. The possibility of using a 4 -frequency and 2 -polarization reuse plan, (i. e., 4 x 2 = 8 diversity), was investigated. The system implications of using a dual polarization scheme, the level of cross-polarization required to insure the desired 27 dB beam isolation, and whether or not the determined level of cross-polarization is achievable with the microstrip feed arrays used in the baseline design are considered...|$|R

When N[*]×[*]L[*]>[*]M[*]+[*]k, k[*]≥[*] 2, then {{there must be}} at least k co-channel interference cell pairs according to the traditional analysis presumption that TCH carrier frequency power level measurement results are equaled to BCCH carrier frequency scanning measurement results. With traditional frequency scanning measurement technology, it cannot distinguish and measure the co-channel TCH carrier signal from different overlaying coverage cells in a specific observation period; it also cannot measure the TCH traffic correlation between them, so it cannot locate whether co-channel interference happens among co-channel cell pair, in which co-channel cell pair the co-channel pair co-channel interference happen, which co-channel cell pair has the most severe co-channel interference, and also could not choose the best carrier frequency to the adjustment and optimization of the <b>interfered</b> <b>carrier</b> frequencies.|$|R

It {{can be seen in}} Fig. 10 that transmission probability of the proposed model is less than that of [1]; it actually indicates increased interference from contending flows and alternately decreased throughput. The proposed model can clearly differentiate between interfering links from transmission and carrier sense range, and we now have established the fact that links <b>interfering</b> from <b>carrier</b> sense range severely affect the throughput of a flow in general multi-hop wireless network.|$|R

Hemoglobin increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood by about 40-fold, with the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen influenced by the partial pressure of {{oxygen in the}} environment, a relationship described in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. When the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen is interfered with, a hypoxic state can result.|$|R

40|$|A memoryless {{interference}} {{network model}} is introduced {{that is based}} on non-linear phenomena observed when transmitting information over optical fiber using wavelength division multiplexing. The main characteristic of the model is that amplitude variations on one carrier wave are converted to phase variations on another carrier wave, i. e., the <b>carriers</b> <b>interfere</b> with each other through amplitude-to-phase conversion. For the case of two carriers, a new technique called interference focusing is proposed where each carrier achieves the capacity pre-log 1, thereby doubling the pre-log of 1 / 2 achieved by using conventional methods. The technique requires neither channel time variations nor global channel state information. Generalizations to more than two carriers are outlined. Comment: 5 pages, to appear in ISIT' 1...|$|R

This phase can be read-out {{with the help of an}} imbalanced interferometer, where such a phase <b>carrier</b> <b>interferes</b> with the reference Fermi sea. As a result of such interference, the same in value but opposite in sign charge is appeared at interferometer's outputs. A phase carrier consists of electron-hole pairs residing on the surface of the Fermi sea. Importantly, these pairs are not only electrically neutral, but in addition do not carry heat. A phase carrier can be created, for instance, with the help of an on-demand single-electron source able to produce excitations with a multiple-peak density profile. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Hole {{conductivity}} and photoluminescence {{were studied}} in Mg-doped InN films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Because surface electron accumulation <b>interferes</b> with <b>carrier</b> type determination by electrical measurements, {{the nature of}} the majority carriers in the bulk of the films was determined using thermopower measurements. Mg concentrations in a "window" from ca. 3 x 1017 to 1 x 1019 cm- 3 produce hole-conducting, p-type films as evidenced by a positive Seebeck coecient. This conclusion is supported by electrolyte-based capacitance voltage measurements and by changes in the overall mobility observed by Hall effect, both of which are consistent with a change from surface accumulation on an n-type film to surface inversion on a p-type film. The observed Seebeck coefficients are understood in terms of a parallel conduction model with contributions from surface and bulk regions. In partially compensated films with Mg concentrations below the window region, two peaks are observed in photoluminescence at 672 meV and at 603 meV. They are attributed to band-to-band and band-to-acceptor transitions, respectively, and an acceptor binding energy of ~;; 70 meV is deduced. In hole-conducting films with Mg concentrations in the window region, no photoluminescence is observed; this is attributed to electron trapping by deep states which are empty for Fermi levels close to the valence band edge...|$|R

In the following sections, the term carrier will refer to one of these N carriers and the term subcarrier will refer to one of the KN frequency domain FFT outputs at the receiver (see Section 3.1). The larger the {{overlapping factor}} K, the more localized the signal will be in frequency. In filter bank-based systems, transmit pulses are localized in time and in frequency. The orthogonality between carriers is maintained by introducing half a symbol period delay between the in-phase and the quadrature components of every complex symbol. The well-adjusted frequency localization of the prototype filter guarantees that only adjacent <b>carriers</b> <b>interfere</b> with each other. This justifies the use of FBMC waveforms in a non-synchronous context and particularly for the fragmented scenario. Nevertheless, adjacent carriers significantly overlap with this kind of filtering. In order to keep adjacent carriers orthogonal, real and pure imaginary values alternate on successive carrier frequencies and on successive transmitted symbols for a given carrier at the transmitter side. In order to maximize spectral efficiency of the offset QAM (OQAM) modulation, the symbol period T is halved.|$|R

Here the pGL 2 - control vector (pGL 2) and pGL 3 -control vector (pGL 3) encoding the firefly luciferase gene and the two corresponding siRNAs (siGL 2 and siGL 3) were used. The ternary complexes of pGL 3 /siGL 3 /α-CDE showed the potent RNAi effects with negligible cytotoxicity compared to those of the transfection reagents in various cells. α-CDE strongly interacted with both pDNA and siRNA, and suppressed siRNA degradation by serum, compared to those of the transfection reagents. α-CDE allowed fluorescent labeled siRNA to distribute in cytoplasm, whereas the transfection reagents resided in both nucleus and cytoplasm in NIH 3 T 3 cells. Furthermore, the binary complex of siRNA/α-CDE provided the significant RNAi effect in NIH 3 T 3 cells transiently and stably expressing luciferase gene.

5000|$|In a {{conventional}} analog optical link, dispersion causes {{the upper and}} lower modulation sidebands, foptical ± felectrical, to slip in relative phase. At certain frequencies, their beats with the optical <b>carrier</b> <b>interfere</b> destructively, creating nulls in the frequency response of the system. For practical systems the first null is at tens of GHz, which is sufficient for handling most electrical signals of interest. Although it may seem that the dispersion penalty places a fundamental limit on the impulse response (or the bandwidth) of the time-stretch system, it can be eliminated. The dispersion penalty vanishes with single-sideband modulation. Alternatively, one can use the modulator’s secondary (inverse) output port to eliminate the dispersion penalty, {{in much the same way}} as two antennas can eliminate spatial nulls in wireless communication (hence the two antennas on top of a WiFi access point). This configuration is termed phase-diversity. [...] Combining the complementary outputs using a maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm results in a transfer function with a flat response in the frequency domain. Thus, the impulse response (bandwidth) of a time-stretch system is limited only by the bandwidth of the electro-optic modulator, which is about 120 GHz—a value that is adequate for capturing most electrical waveforms of interest.|$|R
