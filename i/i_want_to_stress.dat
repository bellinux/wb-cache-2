40|$|Preface The {{aim of this}} master’s thesis {{project was}} to expand the QPhiX library for twisted-mass fermions with and without clover term. To this end, I {{continued}} work initiated by Mario Schröck et al. [63]. In writing this thesis, I was following two main goals. Firstly, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> the intricate interplay of the four pillars of High Performance Computing: Algorithms, Hardware, Software and Performance Evaluation. Surely, algorithmic development is utterly important in Scientific Computing, in particular in LQCD, where it even outweighed the improvements made in Hardware architecture in the last decade—cf. the section about computational costs of LQCD. It is strongly influenced by the available hardware—think of the advent of parallel algorithms—but in turn also influenced the design of hardware itself. The IBM BlueGene series {{is only one of}} many examples in LQCD. Furthermore, there will be no benefit from the best algorithms, when one cannot implement the ideas into correct, performant, user-friendly, read- and maintainable (sometimes over several decades) software code. But again, truly outstanding HPC software cannot be written without a profound knowledge of its target hardware. Lastly, an HPC software architect and computational scientist has to be able to evaluate and benchmark the performance of a software program, in the often very heterogeneous environment of supercomputers with multiple software and hardware layers. My second goal in writing this thesis was to produce a self-contained introduction into the computational aspects of LQCD and in particular, to the features of QPhiX, so the reader would be able to compile, read and understand the code of one truly amazing pearl of HPC [40].

5000|$|Starting on 1 May, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a three-day test at the Mugello Circuit in Italy {{ahead of the}} Spanish Grand Prix. The test gave teams the opportunity to assess major aerodynamic upgrades before racing them. HRT elected not {{to take part in}} the test, instead choosing to concentrate on establishing themselves at their new headquarters in Madrid. Both Lotus's trackside operations director Alan Permane and Red Bull Racing driver Mark Webber questioned the value of testing at the Mugello circuit as the characteristics of the circuit were unlike any of the circuits the championship was due to visit after the test, while Caterham driver Vitaly Petrov was critical of the choice of Mugello as a testing venue as he felt it was not safe enough for Formula One. Petrov's comments came shortly after Fernando Alonso crashed on the final morning of the test. Red Bull Racing and Lotus team principals Christian Horner and Éric Boullier were also critical of the test as they felt that the costs of conducting in-season testing outweighed any benefits, with Horner stating his opposition to continuing mid-season testing in the future.

5000|$|Precisely {{one week}} after the last regular season AFL game --- Sunday, December 7, 1941 --- Pearl Harbor was {{attacked}} by Japanese military forces. The euphoria of a successful season gave way to the realization that the military demands of the American participation in World War II would put the continued success of the AFL (and the NFL, for that matter) into question. As both major football leagues were losing personnel to military service, both made plans for a 1942 season (the AFL as a six team loop with a new Detroit franchise). [...] Ironically, the NFL came close to suspending operations, but continued as a ten-team league, but on September 2, 1942, the AFL suspended operations “until the end of the war.” AFL president William Cox announced the suspension, stating “We do not have the time to go into the football business this fall. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> that there is no financial problem involved.

5000|$|Ellul {{identified}} himself as a Christian Anarchist. Ellul explained his view in this way: [...] "By anarchy I mean first an absolute rejection of violence." [...] And, [...] "...Jesus {{was not only a}} socialist but an anarchist - and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> here that I regard anarchism as the fullest and most serious form of socialism." [...] For him, this meant that nation-states, as the primary sources of violence in the modern era, should neither be praised nor feared, but continually questioned and challenged. For Ellul, human government is largely irrelevant in that the revelation of God contained in Scripture is sufficient and exclusive. That is, being a Christian means pledging absolute allegiance to Christ, which makes other laws redundant at best or counter to the revelation of God at worst. Despite the initial attraction of some evangelicals to his thinking because of his high view of Biblical texts (i.e., generally eschewing the historical-critical method), this position alienated some conservative Protestants. Later, he would attract a following among adherents of more ethically-compatible traditions such as the Anabaptists and the house church movement. Similar political ideas to Ellul's appear in the writings of a corresponding friend of his, the American William Stringfellow, and long-time admirer Vernard Eller, author of Christian Anarchy. Ellul identified the State and political power as the Beast in the Book of Revelation.|$|E

The circumstances of his death are unclear. At least five more people were confirmed dead during the clashes on 22 January, four people perished from gunshot wounds. Medics confirmed bullet wounds to be from firearms such as a Dragunov sniper rifle (7.62mm) and possibly a Makarov handgun (9mm) {{in the deaths of}} Nihoyan and Zhyznevskyi. There are photos of Berkut utilising shotguns (such as the RPC Fort), and reporters verified the presence of shotgun casings littering the ground.

40|$|Several recent {{papers in}} the field of Evolution and Human Behavior rely on {{aggregate}} data when testing their hypothesis on adaptations in humans. This is perhaps most notably the case for studies on pathogen stress, (e. g., DeBruine et al., 2010; Thornhill and Fincher, 2011; Fincher and Thornhill, 2012). These studies predominantly rely on cross-cultural correlations and present p-values in support of their hypotheses. In this opinion article, I demonstrate why p-values can be questionable in this context. I do not wish to single out a particular research area, as the misinterpretation of p in this context seems relatively widespread. But {{for the purpose of this}} opinion article I will largely draw on examples from work relating <b>to</b> pathogen <b>stress,</b> as this research area most prominently appears to rely on aggregated cross-cultural data. <b>I</b> also <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> that this is not a general critique of p-value usage or frequentist statistics (e. g., Johnson, 1999; Anderson et al., 2000; Goodman, 2008; Ziliak and McCloskey, 2008; Wetzels et al., 2011), but rather a critique on the reliance on p-values when using macrolevel data in cases where the sample closely matches the entire range of possible observations. This opinion article is also not a critique of reliance on macrolevel data per se, or of a research programme in particular, but focuses on one particular aspect: statistical inference from macrolevel data when a sample closely matches the entire population...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the current}} {{discussion}} on life extension is reviewed and analyzed {{from the viewpoint}} of philosophy and bioethics. After the publication of Leon Kass's Beyond Therapy (2003), the issue of life extension and age retardation has come to the forefront of current bioethical discussions. I {{take a closer look at}} the discussions by such philosophers as Hans Jonas, Leon Kass, David Gems, John Harris, A. D. N. J. de Grey, John Schloendorn and Steven Horrobin, and criticize some of their arguments. My conclusion is as follows. While the conservatives' argument does not provide a sufficient ground for prohibiting the development of life extension technologies, it successfully shows us the anxiety and suffering we might have to bear in the coming long-life society. Moreover, no matter how long our lifespan may be extended, all of us must die sooner or later, hence, the question of how to die without regret would continue to remain as a central issue even in such a society.
