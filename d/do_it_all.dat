5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Over Again, I'd <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I Could <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E
5|$|Lane advises Joan {{to demand}} a 5% {{partnership}} stake in the company, adding that, when {{he thought he was}} essential {{to the future of the}} firm, he settled for much less than he felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E
25|$|Fred Astaire {{performed}} {{dance in}} four ways. He performed romantic ballroom duets, tap duets, solos, and solos with props. He also usually danced with a partner, for example Ginger Rogers. A {{very well known}} duet with Rogers that he did was “Cheek to Cheek” which is a beautiful dance that looks almost like they are gliding across the dance floor together. He didn’t just perform romantic duets with Rogers. He also did many tap duet numbers with her, like the dance “Let Yourself Go” in Follow the Fleet. Astaire’s tap solos, however, {{seemed to be the}} most popular. People were amazed at the things he could dance with while performing. From coat trees to drum sets, Astaire could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E

25|$|However, the Sotenos {{are best}} known for Tree of Life sculptures. The {{time it takes to}} {{complete}} a Tree depends on size and complexity, anywhere from a day to two months of 15-hour workdays. Sizes can range from twenty centimeters to over a meter in height. The sculptures are made from the reddish and yellow clays found in a nearby community called Ocotitlán. The mined clay is left out to dry and the clumps broken up, sometimes but putting them out into the street for cars to roll over. As needed, the powdered clay is mixed with water and a flower called “tule” to soften and whiten the clay. The small details may be made with molds, but a number of artisans in the family, including Oscar, prefer to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> by hand. Details and branches may be attached or reinforced by wire, but both Oscar and Tiburcio avoid the use of wire as it can break over time. The piece is carefully dried and fired. The largest trees may be fired in separate parts and in stages. Then they painted with anilines, natural pigments, acrylics and sometimes enamel.|$|E

HBO had earlier said that it had put [...] "probably 160 lawyers" [...] onto the task of reviewing the film in anticipation of challenges from the notoriously litigious church. Sheila Nevins of HBO commented {{that she could not}} believe how aggressive the church had been.

In particular, {{the lyrics}} detail the {{personal}} life of Katie Morosky, the character she portrays in the film. Specifically, her troubling relationship with Robert Redford's Hubbell Gardiner is explained, [...] "Memories light {{the corners of}} my mind / Misty watercolor memories {{of the way we}} were" [...] and [...] "Memories may be beautiful and yet". Streisand sings, [...] "What's too painful to remember / We quickly choose to forget", where she longs for nostalgia, which Rolling Stones Stephen Holden described as an implication that [...] "resonate in the current social malaise".

It began as a '{{before and after}}' record, but it's become an 'after' record". The ballad [...] "I'd <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Again" [...] was written by Rae in January 2008 after an argument with her husband. She told NME that writing the rest of the album helped her handle the different emotions she felt after her husband's death: [...] "When I started writing that I was thinking, 'I don't really want this song to go into the world, 'cause it's so naked…' But I had to".

500|$|... "Get Together" [...] {{incorporates}} {{elements from}} Stardust's [...] "Music Sounds Better with You" [...] which also contain samples of Chaka Khan's song [...] "Fate".

The song {{is set in}} common time with moderately fast dance groove tempo and a metronome of 126 beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of A minor. Madonna's voice spans from A3 to A4. It follows in the chord progression of Em–F–G-Am throughout. The song's lyrics portray an anthem-like picture about the different possibilities of finding love on the dance floor. It includes an allusion to The SOS Band's 1980 single [...] "Take Your Time (Do It Right)" [...] in the line [...] "Baby we can do it, we can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> right."

500|$|Before {{releasing}} The Sea, Rae showcased {{songs from}} the album on a preview concert tour in late 2009, playing venues in England, Canada, Los Angeles, and New York. She premiered the songs during a 23 November 2009 performance at The Tabernacle in London, her first complete gig since her hiatus from the music scene. She also showcased its songs on 7 December at New York City's Hiro Ballroom, which was recorded for the public television series Live from the Artists Den. [...] Rae also promoted the album with guest performances on the talk shows Today and Later... with Jools Holland. Three singles were released from the album: [...] "I'd <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Again" [...] on 12 January, [...] "Paris Nights/New York Mornings" [...] on 29 March, and [...] "Closer" [...] on 2 August. Rae's record label EMI sent the singles to music video/radio stations of multiple formats, including urban adult contemporary, smooth jazz and adult album alternative.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by {{the cast and crew}} of The X-Files. Producer J.P. Finn praised the episode and Carter's directing, saying [...] "We were all pretty nervous doing that one, because Chris Carter was a new director. It turned out that he directed very...It was a great script, a great cast, and he ended up directing a home run. One of the charming things about it was the end, where we had these alien heads placed on young children. It was so endearing to see them on the set between takes, playing with Chris and everyone". Actor David Duchovny said of Carter's directing [...] "Chris came in meticulously prepared, which is his nature. I think his first episode was great". Carter himself described it as one of his favorite episodes because [...] "it was a chance for me to sort of <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> and it came out in ways better than I imagined it would".|$|E
500|$|... "Cut Man" [...] {{ends with}} a long action {{sequence}} filmed in a single take. DeKnight called it the [...] "most complicated action scene" [...] in the series, due to the technical difficulty in filming it, and credited Goddard, episodic director Phil Abraham, stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera, and series cinematographer Matt Lloyd with realizing it. He also named [...] films as inspiration for the sequence. There {{were only a few}} days to plan and set up the fight, as opposed to a film which would allow [...] "at least a couple of weeks", and it took 7 or 8 takes to get the shot right. Silvera explained that the scene was always scripted to be a one-shot, and that he had intended to work around it with wipes, but Abraham challenged the team to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> for real, which allowed the fight to feel more grounded by having them [...] "slow down the fight, and just have this raw, animalistic feeling happening." [...] The final shot does include some 'Texas Switches' between actors and stunt doubles, but was ultimately filmed with no cuts.|$|E

500|$|Her {{selection}} {{at the age}} of 16 in late 2006 as wicket-keeper for Barker College First XI, {{the first}} time a girl had been picked to play among boys in the elite private schools' cricket competition in New South Wales, drew press commentary from various sources. This came about after an anonymous person, believed to be a former male student, circulated an email entitled [...] "Save Barker Cricket Now" [...] in the school community attacking the selection as a [...] "disgrace" [...] and calling for gender segregation of the cricket team. The sportsmaster of Barker College condemned the anonymous writer as [...] "gutless" [...] and maintained that Healy's selection was based on merit. Ian Healy and Alex Blackwell, a cricketer for the Australian women's team and former Barker student, also defended the selection and criticised the email author. The emailer was also criticised, and Alyssa Healy commended, by social commentators in newspapers. In 2010, she reflected [...] "I'd <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> again...I really enjoyed playing school cricket with the boys and it definitely helped lift my skills and tighten my technique."

500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E

Opponents claimed running into James was like [...] "hitting steel". [...] Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commentator Robin Brown, who played against James in the OWHA, said of her: [...] "She could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> She had end-to-end speed, she had finesse as a stick handler and her slap shot was harder and more accurate than any female player I have ever seen. [...] She was a pure goal scorer like Mike Bossy and aggressive like Mark Messier. [...] In her prime, she was referred to as the 'Wayne Gretzky of women's hockey'." [...] Capable of playing any position, James was primarily a centre during her senior career, but excelled on defence. [...] In one game where her team was without a goaltender, she played the position and recorded a shutout.|$|E
