The technique provides a fast and simple process for bulk liposome formation.

For all samples produced using ethanol as the solvent, the average <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> ranged from 119 to 207 nm.

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} {{model of the}} ice shattering effects on in-cloud measurements performed with instruments designed with inlets, which have the circular cross-section, is presented. Applications are made for the Polar Nephelometer and PMS FSSP instruments. The model provides rough estimates of the effects on microphysical measurements and assigns the key parameters that govern the efficiency of ice shattering. It is shown that experimental data are less affected by the shattering for clouds that have a lower proportion of large particles. The effects on derived integral microphysical parameters are shown to be very sensitive to the <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> of the ice fragments. The smaller the fragments from a given cloud particle are, the higher their effects are. Errors on Polar Nephelometer measurements were evaluated. It is shown that the ice particle shattering leads to the overestimation of the extinction coefficient. For example, for a given distribution with the <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> of 68 &mu;m and with fragment <b>effective</b> <b>diameters</b> of 10 &mu;m the extinction is overestimated by 25 %. With larger particles having an <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> of 89 &mu;m, the error increases up to 37 %. As for the FSSP- 300 instrument, under the same conditions the extinction coefficient is overrated by 17 % and the number particle concentration is overestimated by 30 %.

The analysis uses a multi-sensor split-window technique relying on the concept of microphysical index applied to the two pairs of channels (12. 05, 10. 6 μm) and (12. 05, 8. 65 μm) to retrieve cirrus microphysical properties (<b>effective</b> <b>diameter,</b> ice water path) at 1 -km pixel resolution. Retrievals are performed for three crystal families selected from pre-computed Look-Up Tables identified as representative of the main relationships between the microphysical indices. The uncertainties in the microphysical indices are detailed and quantified, and the impact on the retrievals is simulated. The possible biases have been assessed through consistency checks based on effective emissivity difference. It has been shown that particle <b>effective</b> <b>diameters</b> of single-layered cirrus clouds can be retrieved, for the first time, down to effective emissivities close to 0. 05 when accurate measured background radiances can be used and up to 0. 95 over ocean, land, as well as over low opaque clouds. The retrieval of the ice water path from the IIR effective optical depth and the <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> is discussed. Taking advantage of the cloud boundaries retrieved by CALIOP, an IIR power law relationship between ice water content and extinction is established for four temperature ranges and shown to be consistent with previous results on average for the chosen data set...|$|R
