5|$|Erosion {{threatens the}} island's very existence, it is {{believed}} that it was around eight acres in 1639 before being reduced to 5.70 acres by 1818.

Vesta is the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) {{of the kind that}} formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere.

5|$|The fungus is saprobic, and so derives {{nutrients}} from breaking down dead plant material, such as leaves, bark, needles, and twigs, that <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> the ground. Fruit bodies are usually found growing in groups or scattered on leaf litter in beech and beech-hemlock forests {{during the summer}} and autumn, although it has been recorded growing on lawns. It is also often found under eastern North American oaks. The distribution includes the US states Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Michigan, and Vermont. It has also been collected in Quebec, Canada.|$|E
5|$|As a {{workaround}} many {{policy makers}} try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more to the level of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> the level of 1950.|$|E
5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million cars have been added to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played a role in this. According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that the subsidy reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E

5|$|Miliband campaigned in the Scottish {{independence}} referendum {{with the}} cross-party Better Together campaign, supporting Scotland's {{membership of the}} United Kingdom. Opinion polls showed solid leads for the 'no' campaign, with a 20 point-lead on 19 August. However, {{by the end of}} the month, the lead <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> just 6 points, with YouGov analysis showing a big shift in support among Labour supporters. Miliband made an unplanned visit to Lanarkshire to draw a contrast between a Labour and Conservative future for Scotland within the UK. A poll on 7 September showed a 2-point lead for the 'yes' campaign, leading to a joint commitment by Miliband, Cameron and Clegg for greater devolution to Scotland through a version of home rule. The results on 19 September showed victory for the 'no' campaign, 55.3% to 44.7%.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} each {{game in the}} Myst series <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> various composers. Originally, the Millers {{believed}} that any music or sound besides ambient noise would distract the player from the game and ruin the sense of reality; Myst, therefore, was to have no music at all. A sound test eventually persuaded the developers that music heightened the sense of immersion rather than lessening it, and as such Robyn Miller composed 40 minutes of synthesized music for the game. He would also produce the music for Riven, which featured leitmotifs {{for each of the}} main characters. Virgin Records bought the rights to the music and produced the soundtracks, which were released in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The region's {{population}} <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> {{less than}} half its peak in the early 20th century. Some 1,200people now live in the Catlins, {{many of them in}} the settlement of Owaka. This is linked to population centres to the north and southwest via the area's only major road, part of the Southern Scenic Route. Owaka contains the area's main school,The Catlins Area School, catering for students from year 1 to year 13. There are three other small primary schools throughout the Catlins district. Owaka also has a medical centre, the nearest hospital being in Balclutha. The Catlins is governed at local level as part of the Clutha and Southland Districts and is represented at national level as part of the Clutha-Southland electorate.|$|E

5|$|Urnula craterium is {{a species}} of cup fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. It is {{parasitic}} on oak and various other hardwood species; it is also saprobic, as the fruit bodies develop on dead wood after it <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> the ground. Appearing in early spring, its distinctive goblet-shaped and dark-colored fruit bodies have earned it the common names devil's urn and the gray urn. The distribution of U.craterium includes eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. It produces bioactive compounds that can inhibit the growth of other fungi. The asexual (imperfect), or conidial stage of U.craterium is a plant pathogen known as Conoplea globosa, which causes a canker disease of oak and several other hardwood tree species.|$|E
5|$|Katarn {{retrieves}} the Valley's {{location and}} travels with Rebel Alliance agent and close friend Jan Ors to Ruusan, the planet {{on which the}} Valley is located. Jerec captures Ors and offers Katarn the choice to execute her or die. The decision Katarn makes here depends on the player's actions within the game up to this point. If Katarn has remained true to the light path he spares Ors, but if he <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> the dark side he kills her. With both paths, Katarn has a final confrontation with Jerec in the Valley of the Jedi's core. If the player chose the light side, the game concludes with Katarn being reunited with Ors and carving a monument to Rahn and his dead father; if the player chose the dark path, the game ends with Katarn becoming the new Emperor.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains {{a minority of}} the sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E
