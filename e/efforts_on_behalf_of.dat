5|$|During {{this period}} of time in her <b>efforts</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the OSA agents, Christman felt {{conflicted}} in her activities, because she supported freedom of speech and she felt her activities constituted censorship. The operator of Xenu.net, Andreas Heldal-Lund, saw Christman's posts on ARS and reached out to her via email on July 14, 2000. The two engaged in communication, and Heldal-Lund explained to Christman his motivation for managing the Operation Clambake site. Christman identified with Heldal-Lund's ideals of free speech, and on July 20, 2000, she announced her intention to leave Scientology in a public post to ARS. She realized she would face repercussions from the organization for her actions, and asked Heldal-Lund for help; he recommended she contact a group of protesters against Scientology called the Lisa McPherson Trust (LMT) who were based in Clearwater, Florida. The LMT was started by Robert Minton and former Scientologists to highlight the controversial death of Scientology member, Lisa McPherson.|$|E
5|$|Nonant {{was elected}} bishop in 1185, {{probably}} in January, and consecrated on 31 January 1188. The long delay between his election and his consecration {{was due to}} Nonant's continued diplomatic <b>efforts</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> Henry II. In 1186, {{he was sent to}} Rome to secure papal permission for the crowning of Prince John as King of Ireland. The bishop-elect was briefly in England from December 1186 until February 1187, but then went with King Henry to the continent and did not return to England until January 1188. However, when Henry returned to France in July 1188, Hugh accompanied the king and did not return until shortly before the coronation of King Richard I of England. Nonant also purchased the offices of Sheriff of Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and Staffordshire. Holding these offices was against canon law, and the bishop's tenure in these offices may have been the cause of his quarrel with Baldwin of Forde.|$|E

5|$|St-Calais {{managed the}} king's case against Anselm at Rockingham in 1095, when Anselm wished {{to go to}} receive his pallium from Pope Urban II. At that time St-Calais opposed Anselm's attempt to appeal to Rome over the issue, and steadfastly {{maintained}} the king's position against Anselm, even advocating that the archbishop be deprived of his lands and sent into exile. Later, when the king was negotiating with Walter of Albano, the papal legate sent by Urban to convey the pallium to Anselm and to secure the king's recognition of Urban as pope, St-Calais was the king's chief negotiator. The clerical reformers, Eadmer among them, who supported Anselm in these quarrels, later tried to claim that St-Calais had supported the king out {{of a desire to}} succeed Anselm as archbishop if Anselm was deposed, but it is unlikely that St-Calais seriously believed that Anselm would be deposed. St-Calais secured grants from the king in return for his services. His <b>efforts</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the king earned him hostile accounts in Eadmer's later writings.|$|E
