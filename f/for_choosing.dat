5|$|The BX was {{launched}} at Soda Creek on Friday May 13, 1910, without ceremony.

5|$|The {{absence of}} a formal {{mechanism}} within the Conservative Party <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to commission to form a government. Eden recommended that she consult Lord Salisbury, the Lord President of the Council. Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir, the Lord Chancellor, consulted the British Cabinet, Winston Churchill, and the Chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, resulting in the Queen appointing their recommended candidate: Harold Macmillan.|$|E
5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E
5|$|A {{love affair}} between Thamarai (Kushboo) and her {{maternal}} uncle Nellaiyankondan (Jayaram) is badly received by their family, {{especially since he}} is not financially well off. Thamarai's father, King Periyamalaikozhundhu Gounder (Vijayakumar), arranges for her marriage to Mandhiyappan (Prakash Raj), ruler of a neighbouring country. Thamarai rejects the arranged marriage, angering Mandhiyappan. She later marries her lover, {{who had come to}} see her marry Mandhiyappan, and challenges her brother Chinna Malaikozhundhu (Ponvannan) to marry his daughters off to her sons (the marriage of cousins is a gounder custom). Periyamalaikozhundhu disowns his daughter <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> Nellaiyankondan and banishes them from his kingdom.|$|E

5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is useful as a legal record of a diving operation, where this is required, {{and in the case}} of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
5|$|According to Kaneko, {{the reason}} <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> the Judeo-Christian god, YHVH, as the game's antagonist, {{was that he}} saw YHVH as the base for all other gods around the world: Having {{observed}} common motives throughout different mythologies, such as the flood {{and the creation of}} the world, he reasoned that they all originated in one single mythology, which had been changed as people took it with them, leading to modern-day myths. He thought the original mythology would be the Old Testament, and therefore considered YHVH the folkloristic base of all gods. Despite casting YHVH as the antagonist, Kaneko noted that he did not intend for YHVH to be evil incarnate in Megami Tensei.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with four}} other {{scientists}} and various military personnel, von Neumann {{was included in the}} target selection committee responsible <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E

5|$|Ephemerides {{with complex}} astrological calculations, and almanacs {{interpreting}} celestial events {{for use in}} medicine and <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> times to plant crops, were popular in Elizabethan England. In 1597, the English mathematician and physician Thomas Hood made a set of paper instruments that used revolving overlays to help students work out relationships between fixed stars or constellations, the midheaven, and the twelve astrological houses. Hood's instruments also illustrated, for pedagogical purposes, the supposed relationships between {{the signs of the}} zodiac, the planets, and the parts of the human body adherents believed were governed by the planets and signs. While Hood's presentation was innovative, his astrological information was largely standard and was taken from Gerard Mercator's astrological disc made in 1551, or a source used by Mercator.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with all}} the success, or because of it, he was resented among some of Johnson's circle. Hawkins, member of Johnson's second club, the Literary Club {{established}} 1764, resigned over a dispute with others of Johnson's circle. The relationship between Hawkins {{and the rest of}} Johnson's friends became so tense that many criticised Johnson <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> Hawkins in 1784 as one of his executors for his will. However, within hours of Johnson's death, Thomas Cadell and William Strahan asked Hawkins to write a biography and an edition of Johnson's literary works.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, Beshear {{announced}} {{a partnership between}} the University of Kentucky, the University of Louisville, and Chicago-based Argonne National Laboratory to construct a research facility in Lexington to develop advanced battery technologies {{that could be used}} to power electric cars. A week later, the National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Battery Cell Manufacture announced they would locate a battery manufacturing plant in Hardin County, citing the nearby research facility as an incentive <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> Kentucky over competing sites. The venture, however, was predicated upon receiving $342 million in federal stimulus funds; in August 2009, those funds were denied, and officials conceded it was unlikely that the plant would be built.|$|E

Having {{received}} a contract {{offer from the}} Panthers, he was speculated to return to Florida, where he spent his summers. He cited being coached by Wayne Gretzky as a strong factor <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> Phoenix. Jovanovski was named to his fourth NHL All-Star Game in the subsequent season, but continued to be plagued with injuries. He missed the last 22 games of the 2006–07 regular season with an abdominal injury, limiting him to 29 points (first among Coyotes defencemen) in 54 games. The Coyotes finished last in the Western Conference with 31 wins and 67 points.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Movement {{consists}} of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games {{according to the}} Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, {{as well as the}} opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events.

5|$|The club {{endured a}} {{difficult}} {{end to the}} season, winning just once {{in a period of}} 12 matches, which prompted the appointment of Alain Perrin as Portsmouth's new manager. Berger was {{one of a number of}} players including Steve Stone and Shaka Hislop whose contracts were due to expire in the summer. Portsmouth successfully avoided relegation close to the end of the season, following a 2–0 loss away at Manchester City on 30 April. In spite of Portsmouth having retained their Premier League status, Berger then joined Aston Villa on a two-year-deal, citing manager David O'Leary as the main reason <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> Villa.|$|E

5|$|The reasons <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> an open {{register}} are varied and include tax avoidance, {{the ability to}} avoid national labor and environmental regulations, {{and the ability to}} hire crews from lower-wage countries. National or closed registries typically require a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens. Conversely, open registries frequently offer on-line registration with few questions asked. The use of flags of convenience lowers registration and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall transportation costs. The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of the American company SeaLand's fleet of 63 ships were foreign-flagged, saving the company up to 3.5 million dollars per ship every year.|$|E
5|$|The {{voting is}} {{conducted}} {{at the end of}} the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10-7-5-3-1 point(s) system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs. The closest the voting for the Hart Trophy has ever come was in the 2001–02 season, when Jose Theodore and Jarome Iginla tied in the total voting. The tiebreaker <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> the Hart Trophy winner in such a case is number of first-place votes: Theodore claimed it, who had 86 first-place votes to Iginla's 82.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the battle}} of Char, in , Raynor and Kerrigan are taken to a secret lab by Valerian to {{evaluate}} the extension of Kerrigan's current power to control the Zergs, until it is attacked by Dominion forces. Raynor is captured by Nova and Mengsk declares that he was executed, much to Kerrigan's grief. However, Mengsk later contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor is still alive and under his custody, using him as a leverage to have her keep the Zerg swarm, now reunited under her command, away from Dominion Territory. Kerrigan then manages to rescue Raynor with the Raiders' help and despite his rejection of Kerrigan at first <b>for</b> <b>choosing</b> to abandon her humanity {{in order to save}} him, he and his forces join the swarm for a final battle on Korhal to overthrow Mengsk, saving Kerrigan once more when the Emperor tries to destroy her with the artifact, ultimately leading to Mengsk's death at her hands. Reconciled with Kerrigan, Raynor bids farewell to her as she leaves with the Zerg swarm to confront Amon, the fallen Xel'Naga which intends to return and exterminate both the Zerg and Protoss races.|$|E
