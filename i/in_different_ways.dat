5|$|Animals produce colour <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> Pigments are {{particles}} of coloured material. Chromatophores are cells containing pigment, which can change their size {{to make their}} colour more or less visible. Some animals, including many butterflies and birds, have microscopic structures in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colours. Other animals including squid and some deep-sea fish can produce light, sometimes of different colours. Animals often use {{two or more of}} these mechanisms together to produce the colours and effects they need.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{subsequent}} vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at {{both ends}} of syllables. Following the reconstruction of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a tonal language, {{based on the fact that}} four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mocho'), but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> Campbell considers this unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during {{the processing of}} the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Interaction with non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) {{was a large}} design focus. When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).|$|E

His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.|$|E
5|$|Maniac Mansion is a 1987 graphic {{adventure}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Lucasfilm Games. It follows teenage protagonist Dave Miller as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend from a mad scientist, whose mind has been enslaved by a sentient meteor. The player uses a point-and-click interface to guide Dave {{and two of his}} six playable friends through the scientist's mansion while solving puzzles and avoiding dangers. Gameplay is non-linear, and the game must be completed <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> based on the player's choice of characters. Initially released for the Commodore 64 and Apple II, Maniac Mansion was Lucasfilm Games' first self-published product.|$|E
5|$|Next, the dissimilarity {{function}} is extended from pairs of points to pairs of clusters. Different clustering methods perform this extension <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> For instance, in the single-linkage clustering method, {{the distance between}} two clusters is defined to be the minimum distance between any two points from each cluster. Given this distance between clusters, a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters.|$|E

They provide {{a large proportion of the}} fish caught for sport. Commercial and recreational fishing together provide millions of people with employment.|$|E
5|$|The village {{name has}} been spelt <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> including: Bentewurda or Bintewurda (12th century) and Bynteworth (c. 15th century). The {{original}} meaning of the name Bent-worth {{may have been a}} place of cultivated land, or a way through land such as woodland. The Swedish scholar Eilert Ekwall argues that a derivation from the Old English bent-grass is unlikely, and suggests a derivation from The tũn of Bynna's people.|$|E
