The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate which type and thickness of Hapla <b>felt</b> <b>padding</b> is the most effective at redistributing plantar pressure of the foot. This case report is the first of its kind. Case presentation: The participant was a healthy 50 -year-old white man with a high peak plantar pressure over the second metatarsal head of both feet; he required removal of a plantar callus on a periodic basis. Conclusions: The reader should note that different types of Hapla <b>felt</b> <b>padding</b> provide different forms of redistribution of plantar pressure on the foot. In the clinic it may be useful to measure peak plantar pressure using F-Scan before deciding on the most appropriate type of <b>felt</b> <b>padding...</b>|$|R

The prick and pounce method involves transferring the design outlines - printed on paper - by pricking the outline with a needle to produce perforations along the lines.

5000|$|Players of bowed string {{instruments}} rub cakes or {{blocks of}} rosin on their bow hair {{so it can}} grip the strings and make them speak, or vibrate clearly. Extra substances such as beeswax, gold, silver, tin, or meteoric iron are sometimes added to the rosin to modify its stiction/friction properties, and (arguably) the tone it produces. Powdered rosin {{can be applied to}} new hair, for example with a <b>felt</b> <b>pad</b> or cloth, to reduce the time taken in getting sufficient rosin onto the hair. Rosin is often applied to the bow before playing the instrument. Lighter rosin is generally preferred for violins and violas, and in high-humidity climates, while darker rosins are preferred for cellos, and for players in cool, dry areas. There are also specific, distinguishing types for basses—for more see Bow (music).|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} routine indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) operations is rarely assessed {{because of the}} limited choice of methods available for quantifying insecticide content in the field. This study, therefore, evaluated a user-friendly, rapid colorimetric assay for detecting insecticide content after routine IRS operations were conducted. This {{study was conducted in}} Tafea Province, Vanuatu. Routine IRS was conducted with lambda cyhalothrin. Two methods were used to quantify the IRS activities: 1) pre-spray application of small <b>felt</b> <b>pads</b> and 2) post-spray removal of insecticide with adhesive. The insecticide content was quantified using a colorimetric assay (Insecticide Quantification Kit [IQK]), which involved exposing each sample to the test reagents for 15 mins. The concentration of insecticide was indicated by the depth of red colour. The IQK proved simple to perform in the field and results could be immediately interpreted by the programme staff. The insecticide content was successfully sampled by attaching <b>felt</b> <b>pads</b> to the house walls prior to spraying. The IRS operation was well conducted, with 83 % of houses being sprayed at the target dose (20 - 30 mg AI/m 2). The average reading across all houses was 24. 4 [*]±[*] 1. 5 mg AI/m 2. The results from the <b>felt</b> <b>pads</b> applied pre-spray were used as a base to compare methods for sampling insecticide from walls post-spray. The adhesive of Sellotape did not collect adequate samples. However, the adhesive of the <b>felt</b> <b>pads</b> provided accurate samples of the insecticide content on walls. The IQK colorimetric assay proved to be a useful tool that was simple to use under realistic field conditions. The assay provided rapid information on IRS spray dynamics and spray team performance, facilitating timely decision making and reporting for programme managers.

5000|$|Besides {{the usual}} {{malfunctions}} common to laser printers with worn rollers or accumulated paper dust, older IIISi and 4Si printers eventually exhibit a [...] "phantom paper jam." [...] On longer documents, the printer will stop and report a paper jam, {{but with no}} visible reason why the paper wasn't feeding correctly. There {{are a couple of}} solenoids at the paper tray input mechanism that have <b>felt</b> <b>pads</b> designed to cushion them when they snap on, and the glue holding these pads in place can migrate to the surface. This delays the release of the solenoid, which causes the paper to start feeding slightly late. The error accumulates with each page printed, and eventually the paper is entering the mechanism so late that the printer believes that a jam has occurred. The tell-tale symptom is a print job with a top margin that shrinks from page to page. This problem is fixed by removing the <b>felt</b> <b>pads,</b> cleaning off the adhesive (isopropyl alcohol works well), and placing some electrical tape or other material to provide a cushion for the solenoid. Unfortunately, accessing the solenoids requires disassembling most of the input mechanism.|$|R

The tile/pad system consists of ceramic tiles bonded to the aluminum skin of the orbiter through a thin nylon <b>felt</b> <b>pad.</b> The pads are a soft nonlinear material which permits large strains and displays both hysteretic and nonlinear viscous damping. Application of the analysis to a square tile subjected to transverse sinusoidal motion of the orbiter skin is presented and the following nonlinear dynamic phenomena are considered: highly distorted wave forms, amplitude-dependent resonant frequencies which initially decrease and then increase with increasing amplitude of motion, magnification of substrate motion which is higher than would be expected in a similarly highly damped linear system, and classical parametric resonance instability...|$|E

An online tension sensor verified the predictions of the model. The key for a successful design is to remove tension variations. We propose to add a wire flattening machine which includes an accumulator and tensioning device, and replace the conventional pneumatic cylinder powering the accumulator with a fluidic muscle. The simulation shows that the new prototype system almost doubles the winding speed with a tolerable tension fluctuation...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using composite felt ceramic materials as combustor liners was experimentally studied. The material {{consists of a}} porous <b>felt</b> <b>pad</b> sandwiched between a layer of ceramic and one of solid metal. Flat, rectangular test panels, which encompassed several design variations of the basic composite material, were tested, two at a time, in a premixed gas turbine combustor as sections of the combustor wall. Tests were conducted at combustor inlet conditions of 0. 5 MPa and 533 K with a reference velocity of 25 m/s. The panels were subjected to a hot gas temperature of 2170 K with 1 % of the total airflow used to film cool the ceramic surface of the test panel. In general, thin ceramic layers yield low ceramic stress levels with high felt ceramic interface temperatures. On the other hand, thick ceramic layers result in low felt ceramic interface temperatures but high ceramic stress levels. Extensive thermal cycling appears to cause material degradation, but for {{a limited number of}} cycles, the survivability of felt ceramic materials, even under extremely severe combustor operating conditions, was conclusively demonstrated...|$|E

Eventually, Volk established himself in the Chicago area, where he became a leader in the art movement and founder of the Chicago Academy of Design. He made close studies of presidential candidates Douglas and Lincoln, executing a Douglas monument in Chicago. Volk made a cast of Lincoln's face and hands in 1860. He was also the first artist to create a bust of the newly elected president. The process was one which Lincoln found "anything but agreeable.
