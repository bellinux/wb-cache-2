We study the spectral stability of solitary wave solutions ϕ_ω(x) e^-iω t. More precisely, we study the presence of point eigenvalues in the spectra of linearizations at solitary waves of arbitrarily small amplitude, in the limit ω→ m. We prove that if f(s) =s^k+O(s^k+ 1), k∈, with k> 3, then one positive and one negative eigenvalue are present in the spectrum of linearizations at all solitary waves with ω sufficiently close to m. This shows that all solitary waves of sufficiently small amplitude are linearly unstable. The approach is based on applying the Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory to the nonrelativistic limit of the equation.

40|$|We present new {{accurate}} CCD uvby light curves for the LMC eclipsing binaries HV 982 and HV 12578, {{and for the}} SMC systems HV 1433 and HV 11284 {{obtained at}} the Danish 1. 5 m telescope at ESO, La Silla. The light curves were derived from DoPHOT photometry, and typical accuracies are between 0. 007 and 0. 012 mag per point. Standard uvby indices have also been established for each binary, primarily for determination of interstellar reddening and absorption. For HV 982 and HV 12578, accurate photometric elements have been established. Both systems consist of two detached components of comparable sizes in an eccentric orbit. Adopting the spectroscopic elements given by Fitzpatrick et al. 2002 for HV 982, we derive absolute dimensions of its components which agree well with their results. A distance modulus of V_ 0 -M_V = 18. 63 +/- 0. 08 is obtained, corresponding to a distance of 52. 6 +/- 2. 0 kpc, which is <b>in</b> <b>formal</b> <b>agreement</b> with (although slightly larger than) their determination. HV 1433 and HV 11284 both consist of two rather close, deformed and quite different stars. As the mass ratios between the components (and their rotation rates) are not known, definitive photometric elements can not yet be obtained, but we present a sample of possible photometric solutions. In a series of forthcoming papers we will combine our uvby observations with high-dispersion spectra from the UVES spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) and present absolute dimensions, chemical abundances and distances for selected LMC and SMC systems, including HV 12578 and refined results for HV 982.

Yet {{it is important to know}} when action rather than symbolism should be more important, and therefore to question whether talkfests such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen in December matter for finding solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change. The conventional wisdom is that Copenhagen is important because global problems require global solutions, and we are told often enough that there is no more global problem than climate change. Therefore, all states, all societies, all corporations, and indeed every man, woman and child on the planet must be part of the solution to it. As the problem is so ubiquitous, so must be the solution, and therefore a ‘result’ from Copenhagen is the next crucial step in achieving it [...] . Read the full article Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|R

40|$|A {{key issue}} in alliances (defined here as any {{cooperative}} or joint activity between {{two or more}} firms) is the payment or compensation structure stated <b>in</b> the <b>formal</b> <b>agreement</b> between the parties. These days, most agreements include a multiplicity of payment types, including royalties, lumpsum payments and returns on equity. The paper outlines reasons for this and presents a general framework for alliance negotiations. A simulation example shows key negotiation variables, together with non-zero-sum tradeoffs between them. Each map of variable pairs indicates a 'zone of mutual benefit' where the joint profits of both partners can increase. There is often a contradiction between profit maximization and other strategic, behavioral, tax and regulatory considerations which themselves point in non-congruent directions for structuring the alliance. No wonder alliances are such fragile things! Nevertheless, alliances are an indispensable part of the management landscape, and negotiators must know how to structure them. The approach outlined in this paper, the simulation method presented, the caveats indicated for non-financial variables, and the behavioral responses to each, will however help companies to craft better and longer-lasting alliances. ...|$|R

The SARS outbreak clearly demonstrated that it is no longer the exclusive privilege of countries to report and respond to infectious diseases occurring in their own territories, but that the global community has also assumed this role, aided by the ease and power of electronic communication through the World Wide Web. This phenomenon has been cited by some scholars as a potential infringement on national sovereignty that compromises the concept that states reign supreme over their territo-ries and peoples.

We review the literature on horizontal collaboration and intergovernmental relations developed by the political economy, public choice, institutional collective action, and network literatures and present a theoretical model that intertwines several arguments from these literatures. The theoretical model suggests {{that the decision to}} collaborate is a product of prior experiences of competition/cooperation between municipal governments, the incentives for efficiency gains derived from cooperation, and the institutional setting in which intergovernmental relations take place. Based on this theoretical model and using a research design inspired by the literatures on international conflicts and coalition governments, we develop and test a series of hypotheses concerning the decision to cooperate by Portuguese municipal governments in face of recent decentralization trends. We find support for our trust and centrality hypotheses as incentives to cooperation, but fragmentation within local governments poses a constraint to collaborative efforts between municipalities.

It was decided that the radioactive waste currently stored in the double-shell tanks (DSTs) contain waste which will become subject to the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) (40 CFR 761). As a result, DOE-ORP directed the River Protection Project tank farm contractor (TFC) to prepare plans for managing the PCB inventory in the DSTs.

There are certain factors which either facilitate or hinder the pre-negotiation phase towards conflict terminaton. For this purpose two cases, Pre-Camp David Phase of Egyptian-Israeli and Post Cold War period of the Syrian-Israeli conflicts are analyzed. Variables borrowed from the negotiation literature are used as analytical tools to investigate the cases. The variables are provided with an operational definition and a propositon, on which the cases are investigated. First, the presence of these variables are tested on the cases and then if they are present their effects are coded, based on the inferences from the two conflicts, as whether being a facilitator or a hinderance towards conflict termination. Finally in the conclusion part whether these results are in accordance with the initial propositions are discussed. The Syrian-Israeli case had a frequency of more facilitating factors.
