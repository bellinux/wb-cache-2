40|$|In {{the design}} of {{hermetic}} compressors for household refrigeration, one {{important part of the}} overall efficiency of the machine comes from a good thermal efficiency of the <b>discharge</b> <b>manifold.</b> It is desired that the heat generated during the compression process and accumulated by the gas in the discharge chamber does not return to the compression chamber walls. If not, this heat returns to the pump, reducing volumetric efficiency. Current technologies like on/off and variable velocity compressors, normally make use of metallic parts in the discharge chamber, such parts having high thermal conduction coefficients making them less efficient. Linear compressor technology, together with the non-use of oil allows the improvement of the <b>discharge</b> <b>manifold</b> system, increasing the thermal insulation of the heat from discharge chamber to compression chamber, improving efficiency. This article aims to show the development of this improved discharge system, tests performed, and results obtained...|$|E
40|$|The AB Wood Underwater Acoustic {{test tank}} at ISVR, University of Southampton, UK is {{outfitted}} with a Venturi-based apparatus for generating bubble clouds containing a large range of bubble sizes. Larger bubbles are allowed to rise out in a settling tank before the nearly opaque bubbly water is pumped into the acoustic test tank through a <b>discharge</b> <b>manifold</b> on the bottom. A series of acoustic attenuation measurements was made at AB Wood in July 2008 in order to estimate the size and spatial distribution of bubbles in the cloud. An acoustic projector transmitted 1 -ms pure tones from 25 to 100 kHz, which were received at a co-linear three-element horizontal array. The receive hydrophones were spaced 0. 5 m apart, with the center hydrophone placed directly over the bubble discharge location. Measurements were taken on-axis with the projector, and at three distances off-axis,in 12 -in. increments. The attenuation measurements were used to estimate the size and spatial distribution of bubbles within the cloud. The bubble size data {{will be used to}} support a study of the effect of nearby bubbles on array performance degradation. Work sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, Code 32...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{model of a}} variable speed rolling piston rotary compressor, with a speed range from 1100 rpm up to 9000 rpm, was developed to study {{the performance of the}} compressor. The mathematical simulation includes (1) a thermodynamic model of the cylinder refrigerant gas based on the principles of conservation of energy and mass, (2) a heat transfer model to predict the transient and steady-state temperatures of the compressor system and the degree of suction gas heating, (3) a one-dimensional compressible unsteady flow model to study the supercharging effects and 2 ̆ 2 wire drawing 2 ̆ 2 loss due to the suction process dynamics, and (4) a linear gas pulsation model based on the Helmholtz resonator approach to investigate the pressure oscillations in the compressor <b>discharge</b> <b>manifolds.</b> The {{computer simulation}} model is capable of being used to predict all the mass flow losses, all the energy losses, the volumetric efficiency, the cylinder process thermodynamic efficiency, and the overall efficiency of the compressor under different speeds. The simulation results were compared to experimental data. ^ A different mathematical model was developed to predict the refrigerant thermodynamic properties in the case of liquid and vapor two-phase refrigerant mixture being compressed in the compressor cylinder. The difference in tolerance to liquid refrigerant among compressors of different mechanisms was analyzed. ...|$|R
40|$|Johnsons Screens was {{required}} to test its underdrain system under backwash flow conditions to assess the uniformity of flow <b>discharge</b> throughout the <b>manifold</b> system. To test the system, a basin was built in St. Anthony Falls Laboratory and the underdrain system components were provided and installed by Johnsons Screens. To assess the uniformity of flow of the manifold system, a measurement technique was developed to determine the flow {{at a number of}} locations at design flows. The technique was a flow-capturing apparatus with an open-topped tank, two tubes, a hose and a pump. Using this apparatus, the flow was captured {{over a period of time}} and weighed to determine the flow rate from each triplet of orifices. The system error under high system flow rate (about 19 cfs) was less than 0. 7 %. Six locations were determined by Johnsons Screens for the testing. At each location, a total of five measurements were taken and averaged under the high system flow rate (about 19 cfs) and an additional five measurements for the low system flow rate (about 4. 4 cfs). The results of the measurements showed that the deviation of the flow measurements from the mean were within ± 5 % under high system flows and ± 7 % under low system flows. Johnsons Screen...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} model {{was developed to}} provide additional insight {{and understanding of the}} factors that influence the simulation and prediction of leak rates from small cracks in pressurized containers. Specifically, the analysis was aimed at developing an {{analytical model}} capable of predicting the hydrogen leak rates from a crack in the combustion chamber coolant <b>discharge</b> <b>manifold</b> on main engine 1 of the Orbiter Challenger that was discovered during flight readiness firings 1 and 2. This model was based on viscous pipe flow analyses and calibrated for the crack geometry by using helium leak-rate data obtained from both low- and high-pressure tests used to simulate the flight readiness firing test conditions. In addition, this model includes the effects of crack width changes caused by different working stresses associated with the different test conditions. Because of the combination of the small crack dimensions and the wide range of pressures used for the test conditions, either laminar or turbulent viscous effects dominated the flows at all test conditions. This model was used to illustrate the sensitivity of the predicted leak rates to considerations of test conditions, viscous flow effects, and geometric features of the crack. In addition, the model was certified by comparing the hydrogen leak-rate prediction for the flight readiness firing test condition to the actual measured leak rate. The prediction was within 9 percent of the measured value...|$|E
40|$|Geometric and {{thermodynamic}} {{simulations of}} a twin screw compressor {{were carried out}} to determine the flows through the suction and discharge ports, and to calculate the compressor performance. As flows through ports are oscillatory in nature, gas pulsations are excited in the suction and discharge manifolds. The thermodynamic activity and the gas pulsation {{interact with each other}} during the process. Gas pulsations not only alter the gas conditions inside the compression chamber and thus change the performance of the compressor, but also cause the compressor structure to vibrate and radiate noise. ^ The acoustic characteristics of the suction and discharge manifolds were described in terms of pressure and volume flow transfer functions. The fundamental physics of gas oscillation was studied by use of a lumped parameter model and a one-dimensional continuous model. However a finite element model was employed in this research to deal with the complicated geometry and large size of the three-dimensional enclosure of a real screw compressor. ^ Results of the mathematical modeling and computer simulation, were checked against the measured data and showed good agreement. Influences of gas pulsation on the compressor performance and the vibration and noise generation were studied. These studies included the calculation of the natural frequencies of the compressor shell and measurements of the acceleration and noise spectra. Acoustic properties of the steel wool demister in the <b>discharge</b> <b>manifold</b> were also measured and their influence was studied. Effects of the over/under pressure condition and the volume ratio unloading mechanism on the compressor performance and gas pulsation were investigated. ...|$|E
40|$|In FY 1998, Pulsating Mixer Pump (PMP) technology, {{consisting}} of a jet mixer powered by a reciprocating air supply, was selected for deployment {{in one of the}} Gunite and Associated Tanks at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to mobilize settled solids. The pulsating mixer pump technology was identified during FY 1996 and FY 1997 technical exchanges between the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Tanks Focus Area Retrieval and Closure program, the DOE Environmental Management International Programs, and delegates from Russia as a promising technology that could be implemented in the DOE complex. During FY 1997, the pulsating mixer pump technology, provided by the Russian Integrated Mining Chemical Company, was tested at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to observe its ability to suspend settled solids. Based on the results of this demonstration, ORNL and DOE staff determined that a modified pulsating mixer pump would meet project needs for remote sludge mobilization of Gunite tank sludge and reduce the cost of operation and maintenance of more expensive mixing systems. The functions and requirements of the system were developed by combining the results and recommendations from the pulsating mixer pump demonstration at PNNL with the requirements identified by staff at ORNL involved with the remediation of the Gunite and Associated Tanks. The PMP is comprised of a pump chamber, check valve, a working gas supply pipe, a <b>discharge</b> <b>manifold,</b> and four jet nozzles. The pump uses two distinct cycles, fill and discharge, to perform its mixing action. During the fill cycle, vacuum is applied to the pump chamber by an eductor, which draws liquid into the pump. When the liquid level inside the chamber reaches a certain level, the chamber is pressurized with compressed air to discharge the liquid through the jet nozzles and back into the tank to mobilize sludge and settled solids...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This report {{describes}} the fabrication and laboratory testing of a 1 / 12 scale {{model of the}} 5 branch converging manifold to be installed {{as a component of}} the Virginia Electric and Power Company 1974 extension of the Yorktown power station. The design of the manifold (see Fig. 1) was supplied by Brown 2 ̆ 6 Root, Inc. The geometry of Branch number 1 as shown on Fig. 1 was modified slightly from the original design after conferring with Browth 2 ̆ 6 Root, Inc. in order to facilitate the fabrication of this branch of the model. In addition to the fabrication of the manifold model, facilities were constructed to carry out the testing of the model. These facilities consisted of: (1) a head box designed to force equal flow rates through all five inlet branches of the manifold (see Fig. 2), (2) five inlet pipes which convey the water from the five units in the head box to each of five branches, (3) a 20 -foot long 14 inch inside diameter pipe which conveyed the <b>discharge</b> from the <b>manifold,</b> and (4) a discharge box with means for controlling the downstream head by means of two gates, one of which closes the discharge pipe and the other controls the water level in the box. The test facilities were located in the hydraulic laboratory of the Utah Water Research Laboratory taking the water supply from one of the 16 inch main supply lines and discharging the flow into a 3 -foot wide channel in the floor of the hydraulic laboratory which conveys the water to the weighing tanks for accurate flow rate determinations.

One {{of the most}} effective and simplest methods to maintain thermal stratification of solar hot water storage tanks during charge and discharge is the use of a rigid porous manifold. The same manifold design can be employed within a novel liquid desiccant solar thermal storage tank to prevent destruction of chemically stored energy during charge and discharge. This type of manifold does not require any moving parts or special materials and thus is particularly appealing for solar thermal storage systems. It has a series of vertical hydraulic resistance elements placed within a perforated tube. At the design operating conditions, the manifold ensures that fluid entering the tank is delivered to the vertical position where it is the same density as the tank fluid. In the present study the utility of a rigid porous manifold is assessed over a range of operating conditions in both a solar hot water and liquid desiccant storage environment. The primary result is the development of a simple relationship between a dimensionless performance indicator and a second dimensionless parameter that represents the operating condition. A simulation model is used to define this relationship between the operating condition and manifold performance and is applicable to manifolds operating in both hot water and liquid desiccant storage tanks. A plug flow tank model is used to approximate transient tank stratification. Initial modeling suggests off-design operation results in low levels of mixing. Finally, a manifold was built and tested within a prototype liquid desiccant tank. Results show that the design returns low density fluid through the bottom of the tank at a significantly reduced mixing rate compared to free <b>discharge.</b> The same <b>manifold</b> design is able to return high density fluid with minimal mixing...|$|R
