5|$|Three {{construction}} {{options were}} evaluated during the project's Environmental Impact Study for {{the portion of}} the line between 11th Street and Hanover Square. One option known as the Shallow Chrystie Option would mainly use cut and cover, while the Deep Chrystie Street and Forsyth Options would use a combination of tunneling by <b>Earth</b> <b>Pressure</b> Balance Machines (EPBMs) and cut and cover. The Shallow Chrystie Option would have used the existing Confucius Plaza tunnel section between Canal and Division Streets, and like the plan from the 1970s, {{there would have been a}} cross-platform transfer to the existing Grand Street station, with the transfer expected to be heavily used. However, this option would require digging up Sara Delano Roosevelt Park to the east as Chrystie Street is not wide enough to fit four tracks. Under this option, a track connection would be built to allow trains from Second Avenue to run via the Manhattan Bridge north tracks to allow service to Brooklyn. The Forsyth Option would curve below the park to Forsyth Street and the station would be built under Forsyth Street, requiring a 200-foot transfer passageway that would be less convenient than the other options. The Deep Chrystie Option would have the Second Avenue Subway run deeper underground, running underneath the existing Grand Street station, with a mezzanine in between the two stations. In order to allow for sufficient room for stairways to transfer to the Second Avenue Line, the Grand Street station would be widened to have twenty foot wide platforms. No track connection would be built under this option, and the Confucius Plaza tunnel section would not be used for subway service, but it instead might be used for ancillary subway facilities. Currently, this is the preferred option.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> during forced vibration tests and earthquakes are studied {{on the basis}} of observations recorded on both sides of a large-scale shaking table foundation. It is found that the <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> {{on both sides of the}} foundation during earthquakes tend to be induced in phase for lower frequencies contained in the surface ground motions, and out-of phase for higher frequencies. It is stressed that the in-phase phenomenon of the <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> can not be explained by a conventional assumption of vertical incidence of seismic waves. It is also revealed that the <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> are induced in relation to the horizontal velocities of the foundation for rather lower frequencies, and to acceleration response for higher frequencies. These observations can well be simulated by a simplified lumped-mass model connected in series equivalently substituted for the lateral layered soil of the foundation...|$|R
40|$|Design of {{retaining}} wall needs the complete knowledge of <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> for both active and passive conditions. Under earthquake condition, the design requires {{special attention to}} reduce the devastating effect of this natural hazard. But under seismic condition, the available literatures mostly give the pseudo-static analytical value of the <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> as an approximate solution to the real dynamic nature of the complex problem. In the present work, a recently developed pseudodynamic method, which incorporates time dependent effect of applied earthquake load and effect of shear and primary waves, is applied to study effect of variation of parameters like soil friction angle, wall friction angle, time period of earthquake ground motion, seismic shear and primary wave velocities of backfill soil and seismic peak horizontal and vertical ground accelerations on the seismic <b>earth</b> <b>pressures.</b> Again a complete analysis between these two design methodologies shows that the time dependent non-linear behaviour of the pressure distribution obtained in the pseudodynamic method results more realistic design values of <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> under earthquake condition...|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} consideration in proper design and installation of retaining walls {{is to recognize}} and counteract the tendency of the retained material to move downslope due to gravity.

25|$|Lateral <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> are zero {{at the top}} of {{the wall}} and – in {{homogenous}} ground – increase proportionally to a maximum value at the lowest depth. <b>Earth</b> <b>pressures</b> will push the wall forward or overturn it if not properly addressed. Also, any groundwater behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes hydrostatic pressure on the wall.

25|$|At rest lateral <b>earth</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{represented}} as K0, is the in situ lateral pressure. It {{can be measured}} directly by a dilatometer test (DMT) or a borehole pressuremeter test (PMT).

25|$|In 1948, Albert Caquot (1881–1976) and Jean Kerisel (1908–2005) {{developed}} an advanced theory that modified Muller-Breslau's equations {{to account for}} a non-planar rupture surface. They used a logarithmic spiral to represent the rupture surface instead. This modification is extremely important for passive <b>earth</b> <b>pressure</b> where there is soil-wall friction. Mayniel and Muller-Breslau's equations are unconservative in this situation and are dangerous to apply. For the active pressure coefficient, the logarithmic spiral rupture surface provides a negligible difference compared to Muller-Breslau. These equations are too complex to use, so tables or computers are used instead.|$|E

The shear strength of soils is primarily derived from friction between the particles and interlocking, which {{are very sensitive to}} the effective stress.

40|$|This {{research}} {{consists of}} scale model shake table tests {{to investigate the}} development of seismic <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> in soft clay. The soft clay was modeled after prototype San Francisco Bay Mud consisting of a mixture of kaolinite, bentonite, class C fly ash and water. A flexible walled testing container founded on a 1 g shake table was used to house the model soil and mimic 1 D site response. An array of accelerometers embedded in the model soil measure during an input earthquake motion. A scale model wall is equipped with pressure sensors to measure the seismic <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> over the duration of an input earthquake motion. A total of 14 time histories were run through this test set up. A single degree of freedom oscillator {{was added to the}} scale model wall and used to mimic the period of a structure. Test results show that for retaining walls with clay soils seismic <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> develop triangularly over the face of the wall with an amplitude of about 3. 8 times the static pressures. For small building structures, the development of seismic <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> depends on height above the base of the wall. Although the pressure distribution is not well defined, localized peaks in pressure are observed at depths of 1 / 3 H and 2 / 3 H below the ground surface. Arias intensity and cumulative absolute velocity correlate linearly with the measured dynamic pressures. Differences between arias intensity and cumulative absolute velocity for each scale model configuration are not pronounced. The simplified Monnobe-Okabe method was also evaluated in this study. Although the Mononobe-Okabe method may be inappropriate for cohesive soils, a seismic coefficient of about 1 / 10 the PGA was back-calculated from empirically measured <b>earth</b> <b>pressures.</b> The results of this investigation provides an empirical basis to the behavior of walls in clay...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Geofoam {{is a type}} of {{cellular}} geosynthetic {{that can be used to}} reduce lateral <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> acting on a wide range of earth-retaining structures (ERSs). There are two distinct geosynthetic-functional ways in which geofoams can provide this benefit: as lightweight fill and as a compressible inclusion. These functions can be implemented either in new construction or retroactively with existing ERSs. Depending on the specific design details chosen, it is possible to reduce lateral <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> acting on an ERS to almost zero under both gravity and seismic loading. Unfortunately, the existence and capabilities of this geotechnology, which has the potential to revolutionize the way ERSs are designed, are still not widely known and thus have been significantly underutilized to date. This paper summarizes the state of knowledge concerning the use of geofoams to reduce lateral <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> on ERSs and addresses both analytical methods (with an emphasis on seismic loading) as well as geofoam materials and products. It is hoped that this will encourage both usage and research of this intriguing geotechnology...|$|R
