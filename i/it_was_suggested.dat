5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, {{representatives of}} the genus were {{assigned}} to the family Azotobacteraceae Pribram, 1933, but then were transferred to the family Pseudomonadaceae based on the studies of nucleotide sequences 16S rRNA. In 2004, a phylogenetic study revealed that A. vinelandii belongs to the same clade as the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and in 2007 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that the genera Azotobacter, Azomonas and Pseudomonas are related and might be synonyms.|$|E

Recommendation 2 : <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> to offer people who inject drugs incentives to increase uptake and completion of the hepatitis B vaccine schedule.

40|$|This essay {{seeks to}} examine the concept of mateship from the {{perspectives}} of consequentialist and virtue ethics. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that mateship <b>is</b> a prominent concept in the way Australians think of themselves. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also <b>suggested</b> that mateship <b>is</b> linked to solidarity and commitment in time of war. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that what we should recognize mateship is one of the factors that facilitates and perpetuates war. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that mateship <b>is</b> also questionable as a character virtue, given what mateship entails. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> that ultimately we need to examine more closely the consequences of the solidarity that we define as mateship, and we need to query more closely what we regard as virtues. Article The phenomenon of mateship is often claimed within public discourse to be a defining characteristic of what <b>it</b> means to <b>be</b> Australian. Recently there was a suggestion that there be a specific reference within the Australian Constitution to the value of mateship for Australians (Howard 1999). One could even suggest tha...|$|R

5|$|In 1976, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} brolga, sarus crane (Antigone antigone) and white-naped crane (Antigone vipio) formed a natural {{group on the}} basis of {{similarities}} in their calls. This was further confirmed by molecular studies of their DNA. These also showed that the brolga is more closely related to the white-naped crane than it is to the morphologically more similar sarus crane.|$|E
