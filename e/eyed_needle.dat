50|$|Technological {{advances}} included significant {{developments in}} flint tool manufacturing, with industries based on fine blades rather than simpler and shorter flakes. Burins and racloirs {{were used to}} work bone, antler and hides. Advanced darts and harpoons also appear in this period, along with the fish hook, the oil lamp, rope, and the <b>eyed</b> <b>needle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A few {{underwater}} {{sites in}} Florida have yielded Paleoindian artifacts of ivory, bone, antler, shell, and wood. A type of artifact found in rivers in northern Florida is the ivory foreshaft. One {{end of a}} foreshaft was attached to a projectile point with pitch and sinew. The other end was pointed, and pressure-fitted into a wood shaft. The foreshafts were made from mammoth ivory, or possibly, in some cases, from mastodon ivory. A shell [...] "trigger" [...] may be from an atlatl (spear-thrower). Other tools include an <b>eyed</b> <b>needle</b> made from bone, double pointed bone pins, part of a mortar carved from an oak log, and a non-returning boomerang or throwing stick made from oak.|$|E
40|$|With its well-preserved archaeological and {{environmental}} records, Aghitu- 3 Cave permits us {{to examine the}} settlement patterns of the Upper Paleolithic (UP) people who inhabited the Armenian Highlands. We also test whether settlement of the region between ∼ 39 – 24, 000 cal BP relates to environmental variability. The earliest evidence occurs in archaeological horizon (AH) VII from ∼ 39 – 36, 000 cal BP during a mild, moist climatic phase. AH VI shows periodic occupation as warm, humid conditions prevailed from ∼ 36 – 32, 000 cal BP. As the climate becomes cooler and drier at ∼ 32 – 29, 000 cal BP (AH V-IV), evidence for occupation is minimal. However, as cooling continues, the deposits of AH III demonstrate that people used the site more intensively from ∼ 29 – 24, 000 cal BP, leaving behind numerous stone artifacts, faunal remains, and complex combustion features. Despite the climatic fluctuations seen across this 15, 000 -year sequence, lithic technology remains attuned to one pattern: unidirectional reduction of small cores geared towards the production of bladelets for tool manufacture. Subsistence patterns also remain stable, focused on medium-sized prey such as ovids and caprids, as well as equids. AH III demonstrates an expansion of social networks to the northwest and southwest, as the transport distance of obsidian used to make stone artifacts increases. We also observe the addition of bone tools, including an <b>eyed</b> <b>needle,</b> and shell beads brought from the east, suggesting that these people manufactured complex clothing and wore ornaments. Remains of micromammals, birds, charcoal, pollen, and tephra relate the story of environmental variability. We hypothesize that UP behavior was linked to shifts in demographic pressures and climatic changes. Thus, by combining archaeological {{and environmental}} data, we gain a clearer picture about the first UP inhabitants of the Armenian Highlands...|$|E

40|$|The {{re-examination}} of {{the rock}} sculptures in Reverdit shelter showed the presence of two successive graphic compositions (Bourdier, 2008). This {{raised the question of}} the chronology of the human occupation, for which only one phase had been identified. In order to test this single-phase model, the archaeological material was analyzed and six 14 C dates were carried out. Reverdit (fig. 1) was discovered in 1878; the early excavations are poorly documented. In 1911 - 1914, Delage (1935) excavated two trenches before the shelter and found two " Magdalénien III " layers (fig. 2). In 1985 - 1987, excavations by Robin and Roussot in the south of the shelter yielded 3 layers with " Magdalénien II-III ". The low-relief parietal composition includes an herbivore (horse ?), a horse and 2 bison (fig. 3). The carving technique is close to that of Cap-Blanc, and the hypertrophic square hump of the bison (fig. 4) is found on other rock art sites of the Middle Magdalenian (MM). One horse was probably sculpted on an earlier bison sculpture (fig. 5). Engraved rocks, probably collapsed from the wall, were found at Reverdit; one of them shows a bison very similar to those of Roc-aux-Sorciers (fig. 6). Thus the Reverdit cave art seems to date to the MM, but its position relative to the occupation layers is uncertain; it might be related to the uppermost levels. Among the 3387 flint artifacts of the Delage collection (tab. 1), burins and endscrapers, usually made on blades, are the dominant tools. The blades are knapped by organic soft hammer percussion, sometimes with a spur preparation. The specific tools of the Upper Magdalenian (UM) are not documented, but there are 39 ogival endscrapers, usually dated to the MM. Curved bladelets with a marginal side retouch (fig. 7 b) were made on flake cores which, when exhausted, appear as carinated burins and endscrapers (fig. 8). This specific bladelet production is known in sites dated to the Lower Magdalenian (LM), but also bears resemblance with Badegoulian products (" Bertonne " cores). Some 90 % of the armatures are simple, straight retouched bladelets (fig. 9) dating to the MM or the UM. Ten scalene bladelets attest to a MM presence and one shouldered point is likely UM. Among the osseous industry of the Delage collection (table 2), the 146 bone artifacts include mostly eyed needles and their blanks and manufacturing waste. Among the 340 antler artifacts, manufacturing waste show the different stages of blank production by groove-and-splinter technique; knapping (debitage by percussion) is attested but marginal. Antler tools (fig. 10 - 11) include three perforated batons, 14 blunt tools, 9 wedges and one large <b>eyed</b> <b>needle.</b> Most of the collection is made of projectile points (fig. 11) with a simple, massive base (except one selfbarbed point). The tool and point types specific of the MM and the UM are absent. Decorated objects are few (fig. 12) and the personal ornaments described by Delage have been lost. An attribution to the LM is suggested for most of the osseous material, although some artifacts hint at the Badegoulian and two decorated objects have parallels in the MM. Six 14 C dates on antler artifacts (table 3) attest an occupation phase ca. 21 - 20 kyr cal. BP and older occurrences of human presence ca 21. 1 - 23. 5 kyr cal. BP. These dates fit into the chronology of the LM and the Badegoulian. This study yielded evidence of several chronocultural entities. Rock art, decorated objects and part of the flint tools attest an occupation during the MM, probably related to the upper, early excavated levels. The osseous industry, another part of the lithic artifacts and the 14 C dates highlight a significant previous occupation phase during the LM and/or the Badegoulian. Nous présentons ici une confrontation des résultats issus des récentes études menées sur le mobilier et l'art pariétal de l'abri Reverdit. L'ensemble des graphismes pariétaux (frise et blocs ornés), de l'industrie lithique et osseuse, de l'art mobilier et des parures a été examiné dans le but de préciser pour chacun les attributions chronoculturelles. L'analyse des graphismes pariétaux et mobiliers confirme l'attribution classique selon laquelle l'abri a vraisemblablement été orné au Magdalénien moyen; pour autant, celle du mobilier lithique et osseux ainsi que les premières datations radiocarbone révèlent que le site a probablement été fréquenté dès l'époque badegoulienne et peut-être jusqu'au Magdalénien supérieur...|$|E
5000|$|Eyed or {{reusable}} needles are needles {{with holes}} called eyes which are supplied separate from their suture thread. The suture must be threaded on site, as is done when sewing at home. The {{advantage of this}} is that any thread and needle combination is possible to suit the job at hand. Swaged, or atraumatic, needles with sutures comprise a pre-packed eyeless needle attached to a specific length of suture thread. The suture manufacturer swages the suture thread to the eyeless atraumatic needle at the factory. The chief advantage {{of this is that}} the doctor or the nurse does not have to spend time threading the suture on the needle, which may be difficult for very fine needles and sutures. Also, the suture end of a swaged needle is narrower than the needle body, eliminating drag from the thread attachment site. In <b>eyed</b> <b>needles,</b> the thread protrudes from the needle body on both sides, and at best causes drag. When passing through friable tissues, the <b>eye</b> <b>needle</b> and suture combination may thus traumatise tissues more than a swaged needle, hence the designation of the latter as [...] "atraumatic".|$|R
