25|$|The Soviet Union {{regarded}} chess as {{a symbol}} of Communist superiority, and hence the Soviet chess world was extremely politicized. As Botvinnik was the first world-class player produced by the Soviet Union, <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> or did (or did not say or do) had political repercussions, and there were rumors that Soviet opponents were given hints that they should not beat him.|$|E
25|$|José Arcadio Buendía's {{second son}} and {{the first person to}} be born in Macondo. He was thought to have premonitions because <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> came true. He {{represents}} not only a warrior figure but also an artist due to his ability to write poetry and create finely crafted golden fish. During the wars he fathered 17 sons by unknown women, all named Aureliano. Four of them later begin to live in Macondo, and in the span of several weeks all of them but one (including those who chose not to remain in Macondo) are murdered by unknown assassins, before any of them had reached thirty-five years of age.|$|E
500|$|Jamie meets Parker, an oncologist, {{and they}} begin dating. After five dates, they consummate their relationship, only {{to break up}} the next morning. Trying to be {{sympathetic}} and to console her, Dylan suggests she travels with him to California over the Fourth of July weekend, while he visits his family. Initially hesitant, Jamie agrees after much persistence from Dylan. They fly to Los Angeles, where Jamie meets his sister Annie, nephew Sammy, and father, who suffers from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. While in California, they begin to develop strong emotional romantic feelings for each other, and share a passionate kiss, which leads to a night of close intimacy unlike any other they had shared before. However, the next day, Jamie overhears a conversation between Annie and Dylan, where Annie suspects Dylan and Jamie like each other, though he insists he otherwise and says Jamie is too [...] "fucked up" [...] for him to date. Hurt, she flies back to New York. A few days later, Dylan returns to New York, trying to reconcile his friendship with Jamie and find out why she has been ignoring him. He finally finds Jamie, and she informs him she overheard <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> and has no interest in maintaining any kind of a friendship with him.|$|E
60|$|She {{was as good}} as her word, too, and {{the next}} night, while Bob 'ad gone out to get some 'bacca, she went off alone with George. It was ten o'clock afore they came back agin, and Gerty's eyes were all shining and 'er cheeks as pink as roses. She shut 'er mother up like a {{concertina}} the moment she began to find fault with 'er, and at supper she sat next to George and laughed at <b>everything</b> <b>'e</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will not}} part," [...] Stephen burst out, instinctively placing {{his back against}} the door, forgetting <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> a few moments before; [...] "I will not endure it. You'll make me desperate; I sha'n't know what I do." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped short}} {{and she went}} on alone. His last words had {{impressed}} her. <b>Everything</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> seemed somehow {{to have a special}} meaning under its obvious conversational sense. Till she went in {{at the door of the}} cottage she felt his eyes resting on her.|$|R
2500|$|Copland's {{willingness}} to foster talent extended to critiquing scores in progress that {{were presented to}} him by his peers. Composer William Schuman writes, [...] "As a teacher, Aaron was extraordinary.... Copland would look at your music and try to understand what you were after [...] He didn't want to turn you into another Aaron Copland.... When he questioned something, it was in a manner that might make you want to question it yourself. <b>Everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was helpful in making a younger composer realize the potential of a particular work. On the other hand, Aaron could be strongly critical." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a guest {{appearance}} on {{an episode of}} the ITV lunchtime chat show, Loose Women, broadcast on 17 August 2015, while discussing the upcoming Labour Party leadership election at the time, Tomlinson said: [...] "I know both of them and I know Andy (Burnham) quite well, and he was my choice right up until I went to listen to Jeremy Corbyn and I went to the Adelphi Hotel where there was 3,000 people there, the room holds 800 and were out into the streets, they couldn't get in". [...] "And <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> with I agreed with you know, leave the National Health Service alone, get rid of Trident, stuff like that, so it doesn't matter to me who gets the Labour leadership, it really doesn't matter. But whatever happens both {{of them will be}} in the Shadow Cabinet." ...|$|E
2500|$|A United Press {{correspondent}} described Robinson's {{speech as}} [...] "the most unrestrained language that ever has been {{heard in the}} Senate." [...] La Follette sat motionless in his chair, even when Robinson began shaking his fist at him. Near the conclusion of his speech, Robinson violated the custom of the Senate and addressed his colleague directly, pointing at La Follette and shouting, [...] "I {{want to know where}} you stand." [...] La Follette was not allowed to take the floor to refute the other Senators before adjournment, though Senator Fall allowed him a brief statement, whereupon he announced he was prepared to substantiate <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> in St. Paul and desired the chance to rebut the charges being made against him by his fellow senators. Throughout the remainder of his term in the Senate, his opponents used procedural maneuvers to ensure he never was allowed to address charges of disloyalty again.|$|E
60|$|I {{asked him}} to explain his meaning; for it now began to appear plain that in <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had been leading up to some very {{important}} matter. It would, of course, {{have been a great}} mistake to suppose that my savage was offering me a blow-pipe and a marketable virgin sister from purely disinterested motives.|$|R
6000|$|The {{fisherman}} grumbled and grumbled, {{and swore}} {{that he would}} not go. The wife said nothing but one thing. She did not argue; she did not lose her temper; she only <b>said</b> to <b>everything</b> that <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "My advice to you is that you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|This was a {{very good}} little girl, and very respectful to her papa, [...] and didn't suspect him of tricks, but just {{believed}} <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> [...] <b>said.</b> And she {{was a very}} pretty little girl, and had red eyes, and [...] blue cheeks, and straight hair, and a curly nose-- ...|$|R
2500|$|The film {{features}} multiple post-credit scenes. The first {{gives the}} Vulture {{a chance at}} redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this [...] "was a really interesting thing {{in the development of}} the story. You couldn’t just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> especially about his family." [...] The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene. This was a [...] "last-minute addition" [...] to the film. Watts completed work on Homecoming at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, [...] "You assume you’ll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn’t really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to." [...] That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school, and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.|$|E
60|$|To <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> Olive {{offered at}} first a {{momentary}} silence, {{but the worst}} of her shyness was apparently leaving her.|$|E
6000|$|Presently {{a splendid}} banquet was served, and the King and his daughters {{sat down to}} it, and as he always {{thought that there was}} some special meaning in <b>everything,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to the eldest: ...|$|E
5000|$|Stephen: Nora's best friend. His {{self-confidence}} is poor due to low CMT. His {{favorite subject}} is English. <b>He</b> has never <b>said</b> one mean or angry thing. He got a higher grade than Nora in everything because Nora purposely had failed in <b>everything.</b> <b>He</b> was <b>said</b> to {{be a good}} friend, but forgets about her when some of his other friends come by.|$|R
6000|$|... "If he did,--then I refused him. He is good-natured; {{but he has}} no more heart than a log of wood. Don't {{talk about}} it any more, dear Mrs. Brownlow. I dare say we shall all be friends again before long, and he'll almost forget <b>everything</b> that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{son will}} be as {{absolutely}} ignorant of <b>everything</b> that <b>he</b> has seen, and of <b>everything</b> that <b>he</b> has <b>said</b> in the trance, {{as if he had}} been at the other end of the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--and didn't {{call him}} a fat little buffer and {{contradict}} <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> and spoil all his stories by breaking in with chestnuts of your own in the middle," [...] I interrupted with bitterness.|$|E
60|$|Matteo {{surpassed the}} others in the outrageousness of his flattery; I thought she must see that he was {{laughing}} at her, but she accepted <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> quite seriously, and was evidently much pleased.|$|E
60|$|And so he {{told his}} story--much that Edna had heard before, a great deal she had not heard. About the treasure, almost <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was new to her. Mrs. Cliff was very eager on this point. She wanted every detail.|$|E
50|$|While amnesia can {{be induced}} very easily, {{there is the}} other side of the spectrum: remembering everything. Take Solomon Shereshevsky, who was sent to {{neurologist}} Aleksandr Luria by someone at a meeting after noticing Shereshevsky was not taking notes but could repeat <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> from that morning verbatim. He could remember things for years.|$|R
2500|$|Pajo denied Corgan's accusations in {{the same}} article. [...] "Pretty much <b>everything</b> that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> has been exaggerated and blown out of proportion," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "The drug stuff in particular. I know there was no heroin." [...] Adds Lenchantin, [...] "I believe that we were a really good team. I am moving on and onward. I hope that our paths will meet again in peace." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{women in}} Block’s {{drawings}} were known for exuding a languid sort of chic. “Gesture {{to me is}} <b>everything</b> in fashion,” <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> His long term companion was Morton Ribyat.|$|R
60|$|He {{answered}} {{that he was}} grieved that his people had {{found it necessary to}} treat me roughly, for he put it in that mild way. <b>Everything,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> short of liberating me, would be done to make my sojourn in El Molino pleasant.|$|E
60|$|Now someone heard Farmer Brown's boy, heard <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> though Farmer Brown's boy didn't know it. It was Unc' Billy Possum, who {{was hiding}} in the very pile of wood on which Farmer Brown's boy was sitting. Unc' Billy pricked up his ears.|$|E
60|$|For days {{together}} {{she would}} follow Matthew with her eyes, watching {{him from behind}} her long lashes, listening in silence to <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> vainly seeking to find points in him. He was unaware of her generous intentions. He had a vague feeling he was being criticised. He resented it even in those days.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got <b>everything</b> fixed," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> jubilantly. [...] "Three {{men will}} start at sunrise. But you look {{as if you had}} been {{discussing}} something important. What's it all about?" ...|$|R
60|$|All {{the monkeys}} chattered; and Toby, believing that <b>everything</b> which <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> had been {{understood}} by the animals, {{went out of the}} door to meet his other taskmaster.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>everything</b> ready," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Just {{before we}} go to bed to-night I shall swear that I hear an aeroplane. You're sure your watch is right to the second, Collins?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The old man," [...] he said, explanatory, [...] "has been preachin' mighty heavy at me {{ever since}} t'other doctor came, and I {{reckoned}} it might please him {{to allow that}} <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was so. You see the old man's bin right soft on me, and between us, doctor, I ain't much to give him in exchange. It's no square game!" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{had been}} trouble at the Board Meeting, and, {{now that it}} was almost over, the {{directors}} of the Grenfell Consolidated sat in dejected silence, listening to the animadversions of one of their comrades. They did not agree with <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but it scarcely seemed worth while to raise minor objections, for they were willing to admit that the situation was desperate.|$|E
6000|$|So axepting Lord Yardham's cortasy, he {{returned}} it by ordering {{another glass of}} gin at his own expence, and they both drank it on the counter, where Jools talked of the affaers of Europ all night. To <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> the Earl of Yardham answered, [...] "Wee, wee;" [...] except {{at the end of}} the evening, when he squeeged his & and said, [...] "Bong swore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come back to dance!" [...] cried Cecily, {{like one}} from whom a spell {{has just been}} broken. And Mr. Direck, {{snatching}} at a vanishing scrap of <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> had not <b>said,</b> remarked, [...] "I shall never forget this evening." ...|$|R
50|$|The Commission {{observed}} that MacKenzie testified in an honest and straightforward manner; {{it did not}} always accept <b>everything</b> that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> but accepted that he offered the truth as he saw it. It found that his superiors' desire to parade his successes as a bona fide hero of the Canadian Forces had impaired his ability to supervise and control matters that were his core responsibilities.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{subsequent}} interview with Rolando Graña on América Noticias, however, Elaskar claimed {{that there had}} been no money laundering or death threats, and that <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> on Lanata's program was untrue. [...] "I lied. I apologize," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> maintained that he had lied because he was [...] "angry" [...] and [...] "young" [...] Fariña, in an interview with Jorge Rial of Intrusos (Intruders), also claimed to have been lying in the videotape aired on Lanata's program. Fariña <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> apologized to Báez, whom he called [...] "a first-rate guy." ...|$|R
