40|$|The {{makers are}} exposing their own {{experiment}} concerning the whole technics of shooting coelioscopic films, under cold light. They used WOLFF's fitting. {{as well for}} the exoflash as for the endoflash. They excluded photos taken under ordinary observation light, which gives very little and under-exposed negatives (<b>diapositive</b> n° 1, with 150 Watts, object lens 50 mm). With a flash, we can use a 110 mm tele-object, and, therefore, get much larger snapshots. The exoflash gives light enough, to allow closely snaps (<b>diapositive</b> n° 2), {{but as soon as}} the tube is within 5 cms from the organ, the photography gets under-exposed (<b>diapositive</b> n° 3), and, that, even if we extend the development to 400 ASA, or if we use very sensitized coloured films (500 ASA). With the endoflash, the light source being intra-abdominal, there is no loss of light and the pelvis panoramic views are very well exposed (<b>diapositive</b> n° 4, flash in position 3). The shooting films within 2 cms are, however, to exclude, because they get over-exposed, even if the flash is in position 1, particularly, for very clear organs.

The final negatives were evaluated under magnification with regard to resolution and contrast of detail in the nerve fibre layer. Complementary information was obtained by means of conventional resolution measurements at high and low contrast levels. The best overall results were obtained by copying colour slides obtained in unfiltered light on a new high-contrast black-and-white film (Kodak Technical Pan), with a Wratten No. 65 A filter. This simple technique produced negatives with a good definition of the nerve fibre layer, suitable as final records...|$|E

This has allowed the use of richly colored, highly stable dyes.It is a reversal process, meaning that it is used in printing transparencies (<b>diapositives).</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{incorrect}} {{to call an}} image a negative solely because it is on a transparent material. Transparent prints {{can be made by}} printing a negative onto special positive film, as is done to make traditional motion picture film prints for use in theaters. Some films used in cameras are designed to be developed by reversal processing, which produces the final positive, instead of a negative, on the original film. Positives on film or glass are known as transparencies or <b>diapositives,</b> and if mounted in small frames designed for use in a slide projector or magnifying viewer they are commonly called slides.|$|R

Some of the earliest stereoscope views, issued in the 1850s, were on glass. In the early 20th century, 45x107 mm and 6x13 cm glass slides were common formats for amateur stereo photography, especially in Europe. In later years, several film-based formats were in use. The best-known formats for commercially issued stereo views on film are Tru-Vue, introduced in 1931, and View-Master, introduced in 1939 and still in production.

5000|$|Color {{reversal}} film produces positive transparencies, {{also known as}} <b>diapositives.</b> Transparencies can be reviewed {{with the aid of}} a magnifying loupe and a lightbox. If mounted in small metal, plastic or cardboard frames for use in a slide projector or slide viewer they are commonly called slides. Reversal film is often marketed as [...] "slide film". Large-format color reversal sheet film is used by some professional photographers, typically to originate very-high-resolution imagery for digital scanning into color separations for mass photomechanical reproduction. Photographic prints can be produced from {{reversal film}} transparencies, but positive-to-positive print materials for doing this directly (e.g. Ektachrome paper, Cibachrome/Ilfochrome) have all been discontinued, so that it now requires the use of an internegative to convert the positive transparency image into a negative transparency, which is then printed as a positive print.|$|R

The focusing properties of these ZPs {{and the evolution}} of the intensity patterns at the plane transversal to the propagation direction are discussed. As it follows from numerical simulation the series of conventional and doughnut-like secondary focuses are observed around the principal focus. The position, depth and the size of these focuses depends on the type of Cantor set and the level of the fractal, which are directly related to the number of the corresponding Fresnel zones. The results obtained by numerical simulations are verified in the experiments. The fractal Cantor ZPs of different levels are implemented with a liquid crystal display and with the <b>diapositives.</b> The experimental results obtained by both types of the dispositives are in good agreement with the theory and numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|Présentation en ligne (45 <b>diapositives)</b> Ongoing {{intensification}} and specialisation {{of livestock}} production lead to increasing volumes of manure to be managed, {{which are a}} source of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Net emissions of CH 4 and N 2 O result from a multitude of microbial activities in the manure environment. Their relative importance depends not only on manure composition and local management practices with respect to treatment, storage and field application, but also on ambient climatic conditions. The diversity of livestock production systems, and their associated manure management, is discussed on the basis of four regional cases (Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, China and Europe) with increasing levels of intensification and priorities with respect to nutrient management and environmental regulation. GHG mitigation options for production systems based on solid and liquid manure management are then presented, and potentials for positive and negative interactions between pollutants, and between management practices, are discussed. The diversity of manure properties and environmental conditions necessitate a modelling approach for improving estimates of GHG emissions, and for predicting effects of management changes for GHG mitigation, and requirements for such a model are discussed. Finally, we briefly discuss drivers for, and barriers against, introduction of GHG mitigation measures for livestock production. There is no conflict between efforts to improve food and feed production, and efforts to reduce GHG emissions from manure management. Growth in livestock populations are projected to occur mainly in intensive production systems where, for this and other reasons, the largest potentials for GHG mitigation may be found...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Low {{birth weight}} is {{associated}} with hypertension and increased cardiovascular mortality, but the mechanism of this association is not known. Hypertension is accompanied by abnormalities of the microvasculature including rarefaction. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that low birth weight {{is associated with}} an alteration in microvascular architecture. DESIGN: A stratified random sample of 100 men aged 64 - 74 years was selected from a cohort of men whose birth weights were known. They were of relatively high or low birth weight ('high' > or = 3700 g, 'low' or = 160 mmHg, low < or = 140 mmHg). METHODS: Retinal arteriolar geometry was {{defined in terms of}} arteriolar bifurcation angles and junction exponents (a measure of the relative diameters of parent and daughter vessels), measured from photographic <b>diapositives</b> using operator-directed image analysis. RESULTS: Members of low-birth-weight groups had significantly narrower bifurcation angles than did members of high-birth-weight groups (74 +/- 1 degree versus 78 +/- 1 degree, P= 0. 017 by analysis of variance). There {{was no significant difference between}} angles in members of groups with high and low blood pressures. Neither birth weight nor blood pressure grouping affected junction exponents. CONCLUSIONS: Narrower bifurcation angles are associated with increased circulatory energy costs and may be related to a lower than normal microvascular density. Our finding of differences in retinal microvascular architecture might reflect a persistent alteration in vascular architecture as a result of an impairment of foetal development and could provide a mechanistic link between low birth weight and subsequently increased cardiovascular risk...|$|R
40|$|This {{landmark}} textbook {{published by}} The MIT Press combines depth {{and breadth of}} coverage with recent, cutting-edge work in all the major areas of modern labor economics. Its command of the literature and its coverage of the latest theoretical, methodological, and empirical developments make it also a valuable resource for practicing labor economists. This second edition has been substantially updated and augmented. It devotes more space {{to the analysis of}} public policy and the levers available to policy makers, with new chapters on such topics as discrimination, globalization, income redistribution, employment protection, and the minimum wage or labor market programs for the unemployed. Theories are explained {{on the basis of the}} simplest possible models, which are in turn related to empirical results. Mathematical appendixes provide a toolkit for understanding the models. The book incorporates examples drawn from many countries, and it presents empirical methods using contributions that have proved to be milestones in labor economics. The data and codes of these research publications, as well as numerous tables and figures (with corresponding data and do files) describing the functioning of labor markets, are all available on this website along with slides that can be used as course aids. For each chapter, we provide 3 sets of slides (with pdf, tex files and figures).

Ktze forests using Landsat imagery. Trough visual interpretation of monochromic images, Araucaria could always be identified by its 10 w reflectance characteristic giving a dark tone wi. ch differentiated it from the surrounding forest. A methodology of analysis was developed using the technique of colour enhancement to define the types of forest and to separate the areas of Paraná Pine {{from the rest of the}} forested areas. Then <b>diapositives</b> were obtained from the television screen used in the 1 - 100 computer analysis system, showing different colour combinations wich enhanced certain analytical features. The analysis revealed that Araucaria absorbs a high level of solar energy giving a dark green characteristic wich differentiates it from other vegetation, principally deciduous forests. The following forest types were defined in the mapping; TYPE I - Araucaria angustifolia pure stands, with 80 to 100 % density TYPE II - Araucaria angustifolia stands with 50 to 80 % density TUPE III - Hardwood forests with a low density of Araucaria angustifolia TYPE IV - Plantations of Araucaria angustifolia TYPE V - Plantations of other species The areas in hectares of each of the Groups identified in the survey are as follows: Group Hectares Percentage I 120. 776, 56 0, 76 II 444. 642, 20 2, 79 III 2. 353. 307, 86 14, 78 IV 13. 379, 73 0, 08 V 121. 879, 70 0, 77 TOTAL 3.
