40|$|DOI: 10. 17014 /ijog. v 7 i 4. 148 Geological {{features}} in Labuhan area were studied {{from the middle}} of October to the middle of November 2011 covering seventy days. Surface and subsurface data were obtained from interpretation of landsat images and shallow <b>hand-auger</b> boreholes. The geological features are distinctly associated with active tectonics. The stratigraphy clearly indicates at least three phases of tectonic activities since the Late Miocene until Holocene. Tectonics of phase one occurred in the Late Miocene; phase two took place in the period from Pliocene to Late Pleistocene, while tectonics phase three is ongoing in the Holocene. Volcanic activity has intensified since the Early Pleistocene. The landsat images show an irregular outline of the northern coast line. This penomenon is interpreted {{to be the result of}} tectonic uplift. On the other hand, the southern coast is linear in plan which is interpreted to correlate with tectonic subsidence. Furthermore, stratigraphic correlation shows that depositional environment changed vertically due to a local subsidence. The northern researched area is occupied by Pleistocene volcanic eruption centres, whilst the younger ones tend to shift southward. This fact tends to indicate that the subduction zone moved southward slowly...|$|E
40|$|Sewage sludges are {{potential}} targets for economic extraction of Au {{because of the}} documented Au content of sewage sludges worldwide, which are {{of the order of}} some ore deposits currently mined for Au. The sewage of Melbourne, Australia, was stockpiled in large, closed, lagoonal tanks from 1898 until 1980. Reeves, Plimer and Foster, 1999, have conducted, and published, an extensive and exhaustive study of the Werribee sewage reserves utilising RNAA, INAA, GFAAS, ICPMS, and FLAAS to determine 31 elements, including Au, Ag, Sb, As, Cd, Hg, Zn, Cu, and Pb. The study was initiated to determine Au, Ag and other metal variations in both space and time and to investigate the economics of chemical extraction of the precious metals. A total of 149 samples from over 50 <b>hand-auger</b> drillholes to a depth up to 4 m were analysed from the stockpiles, with Au assays yielding remarkably consistent results. Average grades of 0. 77 g/t Au and 18. 8 g/t Ag have been documented for a measured resource of 770, 000 m 3. Laboratory-based extractive metallurgy of the Werribee sludges has demonstrated that Au, Ag, and Zn can be removed with relative ease by heap-leaching using modified conventional technology, albeit with prohibitive reagent consumption. The extraction of the precious metals also results in the variable removal of contaminant metals such as Cd, As, Sb, Hg and Cr which may render the sludges fit for sale as agricultural fertiliser, provided organic pollutants and pathogenic organisms are below governmental environmental protection limits...|$|E
40|$|The Pleistocene {{stratigraphy}} {{of an area}} of 116 km 2 {{in western}} Leicestershire was mapped largely {{by means of a}} <b>hand-auger.</b> The investigations revealed the following sequence: Flinty Gravel, Chalky Till, Pennine Till, Cadeby Sand and Gravel Bosworth Clay, Basal Till. The vicinity of the sand and gravel workings at Cadeby was selected as the type site. The sub-drift surface of the area is dominated by the Hinckley valley, a major left bank tributary of the proto Soar. The Basal Till contains erratics of a predominantly, but not exclusively, northern provenance and betokens an ice advance prior to the accumulation of the Bosworth Clay, an extensive glacio-lacustrine formation. This proglacial lake is regarded as part of Lake Harrison which was initiated on the retreat and stagnation of ice following the deposition of the Basal Till. A subsequent readvance of the ice led to the deposition of a large sandur over the lake deposits and subsequently a till sequence comprising both Pennine and Chalky Till varieties. Till macrofabric analysis supports an interpretation of much of the Pennine Till as a lodgement till but overlying 'banded tills' indicate the contemporaneous deposition of chalky material, possibly through melt-out from a compound ice sheet. This sequence of deposits is readily correlated with that described by Shotton in the Avon valley and has been matched with Rice's succession in the Leicester area. The entire sequence is regarded as the product of one Wolstonian stadial. Sands in the cores of Devensian involutions are probably the remnants of a once extensive sheet of aeolian material...|$|E
40|$|During {{the spring}} of 2004, the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of The University of Texas at San Antonio {{conducted}} data recovery excavations at site 41 PR 44 on Fort Wolters. The site had been surveyed and tested by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (Brownlow 2001; Brownlow et al. 1999). The results of that testing suggested that the site contained a high density of burned rock features, chipped stone, and bone that dated to the Late Prehistoric period, with additional material possibly dating to the Late Archaic. Based on the testing, site 41 PR 44 was recommended as eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D. The site has been directly impacted by military traffic, and secondary erosion associated with a dirt road that cut {{through the center of}} the site has further damaged 41 PR 44. As continued use and maintenance of the road would result in continued erosion of the significant deposits, and as avoidance of this site area was not possible, CAR was contracted by the Adjutant Generalâ€™s Office of the Texas Military Forces to develop a data recovery plan that targeted critical data from the Late Prehistoric, and potentially earlier, occupations. That plan was produced in early 2004, and field work was undertaken in March and April. The work was conducted under a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Texas Military Forces and the Texas Historical Commission. CAR personnel excavated 46 shovel and <b>hand-auger</b> tests, 24 1 -x- 1 -m units, and cut four backhoe trenches. We defined 12 thermal features in the field, but subsequent analysis reduced this number to three. A variety of artifacts were collected, including large quantities of sandstone and limestone rock, a variety of lithic tools, 883 pieces of chipped stone debitage, sediment samples, and small quantities of bone, charcoal, and mussel shell. We identified several occupation periods at the site, including use of the location during the Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic periods, as well as earlier Archaic use. The distribution of projectile points, as well as the assessment of context by the project geoarchaeologists, demonstrated that several areas of the site were mixed. Nevertheless, we were able to isolate Late Prehistoric, Late Archaic, and Archaic age deposits that were used to explore a variety of research areas, including aspects of subsistence, chipped stone technology, and feature technology. While limited by less than ideal temporal resolution and low recovery rates, the analysis of the 41 PR 44 data provides a basic description of archaeological material for this understudied portion of Texas. Following laboratory processing and analysis, and in consultation with both the Texas Military Forces and the Texas Historical Commission, selected samples and certain classes of materials collected from 41 PR 44 were discarded. This discard was in conformance with Texas Historical Commission guidelines. Material disposed of included all sandstone and limestone rock collected from non-feature contexts, as well as roughly 75 % of all feature rock. All sediment samples not associated with features were discarded as were all metal items. All remaining archaeological samples collected by CAR, along with all associated documents, notes, and photographs, were prepared for permanent curation at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory in Austin...|$|E
