5|$|Coolidge was <b>frugal,</b> {{and when}} it came to {{securing}} a home, he insisted upon renting. Henry Field had a pew in Edwards Congregational Church, and Grace was a member, but Coolidge never formally joined the congregation.|$|E
5|$|In his {{personal}} life, he {{was described as}} rather <b>frugal</b> in {{his personal}} expenditures, with hunting and reading as his favorite pastimes.|$|E
5|$|Her <b>frugal</b> {{lifestyle}} {{at first}} {{was due to}} being denied pay for her work; however, even after the university began paying her a small salary in 1923, she continued to live a simple and modest life. She was paid more generously later in her life, but saved half of her salary to bequeath to her nephew, Gottfried E. Noether.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshuka Upanishad {{consists}} of a single chapter of five verses. The first verse states that four types of mendicants seek liberation, and these are Kutichaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa and Paramahamsa. The text describes the <b>frugal</b> lifestyle of all four, and asserts that they all pursue their goal of attaining moksha only through yoga practice. The first three mendicant types are mentioned briefly, {{while the majority of}} the text describes the fourth type: Paramahamsa mendicants.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{inherited}} a vast fortune and a prosperous economy {{from his father}} Henry VII, who had been <b>frugal</b> and careful with money. This fortune was estimated to £1,250,000 (£375million by today's standards). By comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms. Although he further augmented his royal treasury through the seizure of church lands, Henry's heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch {{says that}} Pericles stood first among the Athenians for forty years. If this was so, Pericles {{must have taken}} up a {{position}} of leadership by the early 460s BC- in his early or mid-thirties. Throughout these years he endeavored to protect his privacy and to present himself {{as a model for}} his fellow citizens. For example, he would often avoid banquets, trying to be <b>frugal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more <b>frugal</b> {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As the Kennedy administration brought more emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and inventory management. He also created a new Data Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Hammonds {{indicated}} that he would sign if offered a $1.8 million signing bonus, which caused Hammonds to fall to the fourth overall selection, where the Baltimore Orioles selected Hammonds with their first-round draft pick. Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as <b>frugal,</b> held a hard line with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a signing bonus as large as $1 million.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually <b>frugal</b> man, {{told his}} son {{that not only}} must he gain {{admission}} to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but he must also gain a scholarship with a bursary to cover his tuition fees and living expenses. Olivier's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of Elsie Fogerty, the founder and principal of the school. Olivier later speculated that {{it was on the}} strength of this that Fogerty agreed to award him the bursary.|$|E
5|$|Tinne {{was born}} Emily Margaret McCulloch on 21 August 1886 near Calcutta, India. Her father, William McCulloch, was a Presbyterian missionary and {{principal}} at a theological college in nearby Chinsurah, West Bengal. Her {{mother was a}} stern lady, and the family's lack of means and Presbyterian beliefs made for a <b>frugal</b> upbringing. Tinne had two brothers and a sister, and the four were sent to boarding school in 1893, when Tinne was about seven. During the school holidays, the children would live either with Tinne's maternal aunt in Sevenoaks, Kent or grandparents in Edinburgh. Her parents remained in India until the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|While Adams was {{attending}} the ratifying convention, {{his only son}} Samuel Adams, Jr. died at just 37 years of age. The younger Adams had served as surgeon in the Revolutionary War, but had fallen ill and never fully recovered. The death was a stunning blow to the elder Adams. The younger Adams left his father the certificates that he had earned as a soldier, giving Adams and his wife unexpected financial security in their final years. Investments in land made them relatively wealthy by the mid-1790s, but this did not alter their <b>frugal</b> lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|With {{her older}} sister, Elizabeth, Anne {{was sent to}} be raised at Güstrow in Germany by her {{maternal}} grandparents, the Duke and Duchess of Mecklenburg. Compared with the roving Danish court, where King Frederick was notorious for gargantuan meals, heavy drinking and restless behaviour (including marital infidelity), Güstrow provided Anne with a <b>frugal</b> and stable life during her early childhood. Christian was also sent to be brought up at Güstrow but two years later, in 1579, the Rigsraad (Danish Privy Council) successfully requested his removal to Denmark, and Anne and Elizabeth returned with him.|$|E
5|$|A vegetarian, Modi has a <b>frugal</b> {{lifestyle}} {{and is a}} workaholic and introvert. Adept at using social media, he has been since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 34.6 million followers on Twitter as of September 2017), behind Barack Obama (95.6 million followers) and Donald Trump(38.8 million followers). Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, {{as well as for}} a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear <b>frugal</b> and modest.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 18 he {{was given}} a {{separate}} establishment, and in dramatic contrast with his prosaic, scandal-free father, threw himself with zest into a life of dissipation and wild extravagance involving heavy drinking and numerous mistresses and escapades. He was a witty conversationalist, drunk or sober, and showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace. The Prince of Wales turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) from Parliament and an annual income of £50,000 (equivalent to £ today) from his father. It was far too little for his needs – the stables alone cost £31,000 a year. He then established his residence in Carlton House, where he lived a profligate life. Animosity developed between the prince and his father, who desired more <b>frugal</b> behaviour {{on the part of the}} heir apparent. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the prince's adherence to Charles James Fox and other radically inclined politicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{couple had}} still been in debt {{at the time of}} Blanchard's death, so to {{minimise}} her expenses Sophie was as <b>frugal</b> as possible in her choice of balloon. She used a hydrogen-filled gas balloon (or Charlière), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a hot air balloon. A hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Because she was small and light, she was able to cut back on the amount of gas used to inflate the balloon. Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel Francis Maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a <b>frugal</b> diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E
5|$|To {{improve his}} wife's estate, Fownes Luttrell {{obtained}} a sanction from the Court of Chancery {{to sell the}} manors of Heathfield and Kilton, but found no buyers; he subsequently attempted to sell the manor of Minehead, and also offered {{at least one of}} the Parliamentary seats for the Borough of Minehead for £30,000, but there were no serious bidders, largely due to the high prices and the fact that Fownes Luttrell had in fact not inherited much control over the seats he was putting up for sale. However, <b>frugal</b> spending helped to recover the estate and Fownes Luttrell invested in 1760 in the manor of Foremarsh, near Dunster, which he purchased from John Poyntz. He went on to buy the manor of Staunton Fry in 1777 and a number of tenements in Dunster. In leisure, he particularly enjoyed hunting, keeping hounds and horses, and cockfighting.|$|E
5|$|To {{pay for his}} {{military}} campaigns and colonial expansion, Emperor Wu nationalized several private industries. He created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants. These monopolies included salt, iron, and liquor production, as well as bronze-coin currency. The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han. The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly {{throughout the rest of}} the Han dynasty. The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court. The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu's reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d.68 BC). The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy. The Reformists, however, overturned these policies, favoring a cautious, non-expansionary approach to foreign policy, <b>frugal</b> budget reform, and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Evans {{was born}} in Newport, Delaware on September 13, 1755 to Charles and Ann Stalcop Evans. His father was a cordwainer by trade, though he {{purchased}} a large farm {{to the north of}} Newport on the Red Clay Creek and moved his family there when Oliver was still in his infancy. Oliver was the fifth of twelve children; he had four sisters and seven brothers. Little else is known of Evans's early life, and surviving records provide few details as to his formative years. The nature and location of his early education has not been preserved, however his literacy was demonstrably strong from a young age, both as a writer and an avid reader on technical subjects. Aged 17, Evans was apprenticed to a wheelwright and wagon-maker in Newport. An anecdote from the period recalls that his master, an illiterate and extremely <b>frugal</b> man, forbade Evans the use of candles to illuminate his reading in the evenings. Evans found another way by collecting scraps and shavings of wood from his work during the day to serve as fuel for small fires. The Revolutionary War began when Evans was 19. He enlisted in a Delaware militia company, but saw no active service during the war.|$|E

25|$|A running joke local to Sweden, is that Smålandians {{are very}} economical, ranging from {{modestly}} <b>frugal</b> to utterly cheap. Ingvar Kamprad {{said that the}} Smålandian are seen as the Scotsmen of Sweden.|$|E
25|$|An {{extremely}} <b>frugal</b> {{and honest}} man, Francia left the state treasury {{with at least}} twice as much money in it as when he took office, including 36,500 pesos of his unspent salary, the equivalent of several years' salary.|$|E
25|$|Crowe {{resides in}} Australia. In 2011, Crowe {{and his family}} moved to a house in Sydney's Rose Bay. Crowe also owns a house in the North Queensland city of Townsville, {{purchased}} in May 2008. He is rather <b>frugal</b> in his spending and is known to drive an old Jeep.|$|E
25|$|<b>Frugal,</b> honest, competent, and diligent, Francia {{was popular}} with the lower classes of Creoles and native peoples. Despite popularity, Francia's {{dictatorship}} trampled on human rights, imposing a police state based on espionage, threats and force. Under Francia, Paraguay underwent a social upheaval that destroyed the old colonial elites.|$|E
25|$|Early European {{visitors}} were {{amazed by the}} quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This {{stems from the fact that}} Japan itself is rather poor in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron. Thus, the Japanese were famously <b>frugal</b> with their consumable resources; what little they had they used with expert skill.|$|E
25|$|Early {{abolition}} of serfdom, fertile land, and close economic ties with East Prussia contributed to Suvalkija's relative wealth. This situation {{led to the}} ongoing perception that its inhabitants are very rational, clever, and extremely <b>frugal,</b> even greedy. Such stereotypes, also applied to other regions, gave rise to many anecdotes and practical jokes.|$|E
25|$|The {{encyclical}} {{also contains}} {{a proposal for a}} living wage, though not called by that name in the text itself (“Wages ought not to be insufficient to support a <b>frugal</b> and well-behaved wage-earner.”) The U.S. theologian Msgr. John A. Ryan, also trained as an economist, developed this idea in his book A Living Wage (1906).|$|E
25|$|Cao Gun {{settled in}} his princedom in Puyang County in 228 {{during the reign}} of Cao Rui, Cao Pi's son and successor. He was known for being <b>frugal</b> and thrifty. Instead of {{purchasing}} cloth from the market, he instructed his wife and concubines to weave at home. That became a daily activity in his household.|$|E
25|$|Schricker {{left office}} with the state having a $115 million surplus fund due to <b>frugal</b> {{spending}} and his own support of the spending plans. The state's highway system, public schools, and prisons suffered during the years because of their neglect. After leaving office, Schricker cofounded the Wabash Fire and Casualty Insurance Company of Indianapolis.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{many women}} {{were involved in}} charitable organization such as the Ottawa Women’s Canadian Club, which helped provide the needs of soldiers, families of soldiers and the victims of war. Women were deemed ‘soldiers on the home front’, encouraged to use less or nearly everything, and to be <b>frugal</b> {{in order to save}} supplies for the war efforts.|$|E
25|$|After {{installing}} John Crawfurd, {{an efficient}} and <b>frugal</b> administrator, {{as the new}} governor, Raffles departed for Britain in October 1823. He would never return to Singapore. Most of his personal possessions were lost after his ship, the Fame, caught fire and sank, and he died {{only a few years}} later, in 1826, at the age of 44.|$|E
25|$|Frederick's {{goal was}} to {{modernize}} and unite his vulnerably disconnected lands; toward this end, he fought wars mainly against Austria, whose Habsburg dynasty reigned as Holy Roman Emperors almost continuously from the 15th century until 1806. Frederick established Prussia as the fifth and smallest European great power by using the resources his <b>frugal</b> father had cultivated.|$|E
25|$|When {{questioned}} about his wealth, Askin always attributed {{it to the}} salary from his high public office, his <b>frugal</b> lifestyle, good investments and canny punting. After his death the Australian Taxation Office audited his estate, and although it made no finding of criminality, it determined that {{a substantial part of}} it came from undisclosed income derived from sources other than shares or gambling.|$|E
