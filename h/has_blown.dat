As the universe is collapsing, the Doctor uses time travel to solve these problems and ultimately reboot the universe.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler {{team has}} said that Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c are {{probably}} composed mostly of water with a thin hydrogen and helium atmosphere. In comparison to the outer planets of the system, which probably have large hydrogen and helium atmospheres, Kepler-11c's proximity to its star <b>has</b> <b>blown</b> off most of its atmosphere. Kepler-11 and its six-planet system form what NASA considers {{to be the most}} compact and flattest planetary system yet discovered. Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c orbit Kepler-11 with a phenomenon called orbital resonance, a gravitational tugging that keeps their orbit stable at a 5.4 ratio.|$|E

There is a knock at the door. It is a girl who lives in another room in the building. Her candle <b>has</b> <b>blown</b> out, and she has no matches; she asks Rodolfo to light it. She is briefly overcome with faintness, and Rodolfo helps her to a chair and offers her a glass of wine. She thanks him. After a few minutes, she says that she is better and must go. But as she turns to leave, she realizes that she has lost her key.|$|E

60|$|The wind {{continued}} to blow, and the steamer {{continued to}} float and float and float away. A wind {{had come up}} in the night. It <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> Bertha near me; perhaps it <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> her very near me. She had not known it, and I had not known it. Mary Phillips had not known it until it was too late, and now that wind <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> her past me and was blowing her away. For a time there was a flutter of a handkerchief, but only one handkerchief, and then La Fidélité, with Bertha on board, was blown away until she disappeared, and I never saw her again.|$|R
500|$|The {{source of}} this myth is from the {{appearance}} of some destroyed structures after violent tornadoes. When one wall receives the extreme pressure of tornado winds, it will likely collapse [...] This then leads to a considerable [...] pressure on the three remaining walls, which fall outwards as the roof falls down, creating {{the impression of a}} house which has exploded. Indeed, damage surveys of [...] "exploded" [...] houses usually show at least one wall which <b>has</b> <b>blown</b> inward. Additionally, if the roof is lifted before any walls fall, the walls can fall in any direction. If they fall outward, this structure can also appear to have exploded.|$|E
500|$|... "Lovebird" [...] {{was written}} by Bonnie McKee, Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke, and {{produced}} by Josh Abrahams, Oligee, and Coleman (under his production name, Ammo). The song was engineered by Ryan Williams, assisted by Daniela Rivera. [...] "Lovebird" [...] was mixed by Phil Tan at the Ninja Beat Club in Atlanta, Georgia and mastered by Colin Leonard at SING Mastering using SING Technology, both located in Atlanta. The song was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles. [...] "Lovebird" [...] is a power ballad of three minutes and thirty seconds. The song's musical structure bears strong resemblances to one of Lewis' previous singles, [...] "Bleeding Love", from her début studio album Spirit (2007). The track opens with a piano introduction similar to that on [...] "Bleeding Love", and features an [...] "instantly hummable chorus". Lewis informs her lover in the lyrics – with the lines [...] "But the time went on, the wind <b>has</b> <b>blown,</b> and I have grown" [...] – that enough time has passed since their relationship started {{for her to have}} developed as a person. As power ballad beats and [...] "airy synths" [...] play, she sings [...] "Your lovebird's flying away/ Cos my heart's been stuck in a cage". The hook consists of Lewis singing [...] "I've got to sing my song, so pretty/ Dum, dum, diddy".|$|E

As of 2004 only platforms 2 and 3 remained in use, {{but as of}} 2007, Platform 1 has reopened and all platforms have been fitted with new information displays. Other platforms at the station remain unused {{are in a state}} of neglect as sand <b>has</b> <b>blown</b> from the nearby beach onto the lines and formed drifts. Platform 1 is used by only TransPennine Express services to Manchester Airport, platform 2 for Northern services to Barton-on-Humber, and platform 3 for peak hour services to/from Sheffield (including the Saturdays-only service via [...] and Retford).|$|E

Her companion stooped down and passed his arm through hers, looking into her face admiringly.|$|R

2500|$|The revelations in Dirty Politics {{have also}} been {{reported}} in international media.

[...] Also in The Guardian, New Zealand journalist Toby Manhire wrote: [...] "Dirty Politics <b>has</b> <b>blown</b> the National party (election) strategy dramatically off course, propelling the campaign into uncharted territory. Its allegations have dominated news bulletins for the 10 days since its publication, as accusations of dirty tricks, smear campaigns and conspiracy sally in every direction."

2500|$|If {{the pole}} {{used by the}} athlete dislodges the bar from the uprights, a foul attempt is ruled, even if the athlete has cleared the height. An athlete does not benefit from quickly leaving the landing pad before the bar has fallen. The {{exception}} to this rule if the vaulter is vaulting outdoors and has made a clear effort to throw the pole back, but the wind <b>has</b> <b>blown</b> the pole into the bar; this counts as a clearance. This call is made {{at the discretion of}} the pole vault official. [...] If the pole breaks during the execution of a vault, it is considered an equipment failure and is ruled a non-jump, neither a make nor a miss. Other types of equipment failure include the standards slipping down or the wind dislodging the bar when no contact was made by the vaulter.|$|E
2500|$|It Boalserter Nut ("The Bolsward Utility" [...] – {{the name}} of a gentlemen's club), which was {{published}} in De Lapekoer, was Halbertsma's first short story of a more extended length. As is often the case with Halbertsma's stories, it consists of a frame-story in which several other more or less stand-alone components are absorbed, such as the essay It Jild ("The Money"). Miswier ("Continuously Bad Weather") and De Twadde Jûn ("The Second Evening") are also extensive frame-stories, and De Skearwinkel fan Joutebaas ("Boss Joute's Barbershop") is a dialogue, which includes the intriguing and completely stand-alone story Heksershol ("Hole of Witchcraft"– an old nickname for the village of Molkwerum). The only time Halbertsma wrote a literary work entirely without the participation of Eeltsje, was in 1837, when he published Oan Eölus ("To Aeolus"), a story inspired by a great storm in 1830, in which a tornado <b>has</b> <b>blown</b> thoughts and motifs together like whirling leaves. Oan Eölus could perhaps be seen as a clue that Halbertsma harboured greater literary aspirations than would fit in the De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar.|$|E

2500|$|Roma {{is furious}} at Williamson, who <b>has</b> <b>blown</b> a big sale. Levene picks up where Roma left off, and begins {{insulting}} Williamson. Mid-rant, Levene accidentally reveals his knowledge that Williamson {{made up the}} claim about the check being cashed, information {{he could not have}} known unless he had been in Williamson's office. Williamson accuses Levene of robbing the office. Levene quickly folds and admits that he and Dave Moss were the thieves. Levene tries to bribe Williamson, offering half of his future sales. Williamson reveals that the Nyborg sale is worthless, as the couple is elderly, mentally ill and just like talking to salesmen because they're so lonely. Levene asks why Williamson wants him turned in, and why he would give him the lead in the first place. Williamson simply states he doesn't like Levene, for the years of verbal abuse, and the old man's flippant nature. [...] Roma comes back from his interrogation and Williamson goes in the back room to speak with the detective. Alone with a devastated Levene, Roma proposes the two men work together. The door opens and the detective demands to speak with Levene, shoving him into the back room.|$|E
2500|$|MSNBC editor Scott Taves praised Travis Touchdown's {{design as}} richly {{detailed}} and flamboyantly designed. Jason Hill of the Sydney Morning Herald described Touchdown as an [...] "absurd, shallow, and pitiful creature", commenting {{that he is}} an analogue to gamers. Sean Ewing of The Star-Ledger called Touchdown the poster-child for what anti-video game extremists like Jack Thompson think gamers are like. Nintendo Power listed Travis as their 15th favourite hero, stating that he is kind of like them, except that they aren't [...] "lewd, beam katana-wielding assassins". Game Zone editor Stephen Woodward compared Travis to everyday people living in an uber male fantasy, citing him being an otaku and being a luchador fan. PALGN editor David Low described Touchdown as what gamers want to be, though commenting that Suda 51 [...] "accidentally" [...] incorporated the nerdy aspects of his personality into his character. Tampa Bay Online editor Doug Bell found the character rude and detached, but not funny or cool, calling the other assassins better characters. Game Informer editor Matt Miller suggested that there is a connection between sex and extreme violence with Travis, citing a scene where he waits to confess his love to a woman only after she <b>has</b> <b>blown</b> her head off with a grenade. GamesRadar listed him as the seventh greatest assassin, commenting that in spite of his social awkwardness, he is actually a pretty competent assassin. In discussing the [...] "brooding pretty boy" [...] cliché, they used him {{as an example of the}} opposite of this cliché, stating that while he has some qualities of this character type, his personality sets him apart.|$|E
2500|$|My Krazy Life {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on 16 reviews. Brandon Soderberg of Spin called the album [...] "a developed, knotty and, ultimately, deeply moral narrative," [...] {{comparing it to}} Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid, m.A.A.d City. Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "A 46-minute tale of celebrations and regrets, the debut album from West Coast hot property YG is the most ambitious hip-hop concept LP in a minute." [...] Michael Madden of Consequence of Sound said, [...] "YG's Def Jam debut is earning comparisons to The Chronic for its swerving synth-wheeze and good kid, m.A.A.d City for its cinematic elements (skits, storylines, rapped dialogues). Neither is far off, because here, the gritty, prodigiously horny rapper from Compton <b>has</b> <b>blown</b> the ceiling off his once limited-sounding style." [...] Writing for Pitchfork, Craig Jenkins stated, [...] "It's a record that's always posted up in sunny SoCal, and whether it's serving up carefree party anthems or dispensing crass advice on whose houses to knock over and what to take, L.A. feels like {{the capital of the}} country when it’s playing." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "The album's secret weapon is DJ Mustard who offers numerous productions that are pop like Young Money and bottom-heavy with G-Funk as the blueprint. Think of 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin delivered by an inspired rapper in a post-Nicki Minaj world and you're close to the thrill of this inspired debut." ...|$|E
