25|$|Following {{the advent}} of space {{stations}} that can be inhabited {{for long periods of}} time, exposure to weightlessness has been demonstrated to have some deleterious effects on human health. Humans are well-adapted to the physical conditions at the surface of the earth, and so in response to weightlessness, various physiological systems begin to change, and in some cases, atrophy. Though these changes are usually temporary, some do <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> impact on human health.|$|E

25|$|Current {{cannabis}} use {{was found}} to be significantly correlated in a dose-dependent manner with a decline in IQ scores, during the effect of the use. However, no such decline was seen in subjects who had formerly been heavy cannabis users and had stopped taking the drug. The authors concluded that cannabis does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> effect on intelligence. However this is contradicted by the long term longitudinal study, carried out by Otago and Duke universities,which found that regular use of marijuana in teenage years affects IQ in adulthood even when the use stops. The drop in IQ was 8 points. Adults smoking marijuana had no lasting effect on IQ. Effects on fetal development are minimal when compared with the well-documented adverse effects of tobacco or alcohol use.|$|E

The Barnes Theatre was famous for its productions of Chekhov and the other Russian classics, often directed by Theodore Komisarjevsky.

Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told a press conference in the afternoon that the agency's rough estimates have shown {{there is no need for}} people in Iitate to evacuate immediately under criteria set by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan.

25|$|Platinum coins are {{a popular}} investment, {{and each year}} {{the number of such}} coins sold by Sberbank of Russia {{increases}} by 30–50%. Most experts agree that such investments should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> character, as the rise of the platinum price is relatively slow– about 80% over the last 5 years, except for a rapid rise followed by decline in 2008. Also, whereas most banks can sell platinum coins, only a few buy them, as this requires evaluation by an experienced professional. For example, only 5% of offices of Sberbank (the major bank of Russia) in the capital city of Moscow redeem precious metal coins. The selling price is also much affected by visible scratches, spots, patina, and other defects introduced by bad handling. For this reason, most bullion coins are sealed in transparent plastic right after removal from the press. They are then stored in a dry room with relative humidity below 80% and at temperatures between 15 and 40°C. If a coin is removed from its plastic seal, it is recommended not to store it in PVC albums, as PVC molecules gradually break down, releasing organochlorine compounds which produce patina on the coins. These compounds may also form acids by reacting with moisture. Unlike silver, platinum does not corrode. However, as is true for all unprotected coins, platinum coins are prone to contamination which can be caused even by washing with (chlorine-containing) tap water.|$|E

Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, described the Strokes as [...] "a great groove band", and noted that [...] "the beats implode, clashing/resolving with punky brevity and gnarly faux simplicity".

The USN rebuilt carriers such as Franklin that had been completely gutted and the crew decimated by IJN attacks.

However, no citation is ever given for this accident which appears to be a distorted fabrication of Formidable's May 18, 1945, hangar fire. She carried no air group post war, and never carried the 20 mm Corsair. [...] The Royal Navy planned to rebuild most of the armoured carriers in the early postwar period: ...|$|E
