5000|$|Transit-proximate {{development}} is a term used by some planning officials to describe (potentially dense) development that is physically near a public <b>transport</b> <b>node</b> (e.g. a bus station, train station or metro station). This type of development includes transit-oriented development, but, according to some planning officials, can also describe development that is not transit-oriented development. Thus, transit-proximate development can include results where, despite the location of dense development near transit, the development does not {{take full advantage of}} -- or fully encourage the use of -- the public <b>transport</b> <b>node.</b> For example, transit-proximate development could include buildings with extensive parking facilities typical of suburban locations, a lack of [...] "mixed-use development" [...] (housing, workplaces and shopping in the same place), or a lack of extensive pedestrian facilities that {{would make it easier for}} people to reach the public <b>transport</b> <b>node.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified numerical continuation approach for predicting the bifurcation behaviour of aeroelastic systems undergoing aperiodic limit cycles oscillations. Such oscillations can occur {{due to a}} number of nonlinear functions. Here, backlash nonlinearity in the aileron stiffness for a <b>Generic</b> <b>Transport</b> Aircraft is considered. It is shown that classical numerical continuation will fail due to the aperiodic nature of the limit cycles and the inability to perform period scaling and phase fixing. An alternative, approximate numerical continuation method is proposed, based on longer numerical integration sequences and a heuristic method for determining the period of the limit cycle oscillations. The approach is applied successfully to a simulated aeroelastic model of the <b>Generic</b> <b>Transport</b> Aircraft with backlash...|$|R

STCP offers controlled variable reliability, congestion detection and avoidance, and supports multiple applications in the same network. We present the design and implementation of STCP and evaluate the protocol with different scenarios and network characteristics. I.

FDI filter performance and closed-loop controller-filter interaction {{in the presence of}} uncertain dynamics were investigated as was the role of controller robustness on the FDI filter performance. The NASA <b>Generic</b> <b>Transport</b> Model aircraft was considered as a motivating application. Multiple example scenarios were presented to highlight the utility of FDI filter performance metrics. For example, comparing fault detection performance of different filters under identical uncertain plant dynamics and controller, the effect of different controllers on the FDI filter performance, and the effect of model uncertainty on filter performance. The <b>Generic</b> <b>Transport</b> Model aircraft FDI filter results are validated using worst-case analysis and linear simulations. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
