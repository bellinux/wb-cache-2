5|$|Civilian deaths {{caused by}} allied {{operations}} had increased sympathy among Waygal residents for the Taliban, who {{were allowed to}} move into the Quam.

5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was shocked}} to learn of the high {{attrition}} rate due to well-trained German snipers. It was common for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day. The German snipers could not be located, leaving them free to continue shooting from their place of concealment. He was also <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E
5|$|The Port Phillip {{team were}} favourites {{before the game}} began. This was partly owing to their bowlers' use of overarm bowling at pace; by contrast, bowlers in Tasmania {{preferred}} underarm bowling {{at a time when}} roundarm bowling was permitted {{in the rest of the}} world. The match was played at the Launceston Racecourse ground, but the state of the ground was such that the umpires were unsure of the best place to pitch the wickets. The Victorian team were <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state of the pitch, which looked extremely difficult to bat on, and later received an apology from the government of Tasmania.|$|E
50|$|On July 21, 2017, Honda Racing {{issued a}} {{statement}} to the effect that Guy Martin would not be competing at the 2017 Ulster Grand Prix; a decision which was greeted with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> event organisers.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the meeting}} took place, French {{president}} Jacques Chirac declared on 10 March that France would veto any resolution which would automatically lead to war. This caused open displays of <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and British governments. <b>The</b> drive <b>by</b> Britain for unanimity and a [...] "second resolution" [...] was effectively abandoned at that point.|$|R
50|$|Teets's memo was {{forwarded}} to Congress over the Easter weekend, {{but despite the}} congressional recess was met with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> office of Senator Wayne Allard, Republican Senator from Colorado and Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York who have led congressional inquiries into the scandal. Concern was also expressed by Kate Summers of the victims rights group Miles Foundation.|$|R
5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{director}} Martin Campbell {{confirmed the}} possibility of a Green Lantern trilogy. Warner Bros. originally planned on Green Lantern being the first entry of a new DC film franchise, and commissioned a script for a sequel from Greg Berlanti, Michael Green, and Marc Guggenheim while filming for the first film was underway. In August 2010, Michael Goldenberg was still attached to write the screenplay, based on the sequel treatment. The scene in the film's end credits showing a resurgence of the yellow power ring of fear, with Sinestro becoming corrupted by its dark power, teased the planned sequel. In September 2011 Warner Bros., <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> film's negative reviews and disappointing box office return, abandoned plans for sequels.|$|E
25|$|Whilst a success, {{this result}} {{was greeted with}} <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> corps commander, the Earl of Cavan; he was a believer in a more {{traditional}} strongly held static line of defence and felt that Fanshawe {{did not need to}} have given up any ground at all. Fanshawe was quickly relieved of his command and ordered home, leaving Italy four days {{after the end of the}} battle, on 20 June.|$|R
40|$|Extract] There {{have been}} so many tax-related controversies in recent years that one could be forgiven for forgetting the angst that {{surrounded}} the introduction of the personal services income (PSI) rules in Pt 2 - 42 of ITAA 1997 during 2000 / 01. The 45 pages of legislation with their thousands of pages of explanatory memoranda and rulings were greeted with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contracting community, a community that the Government's industry policy had been nurturing...|$|R
60|$|As for ourselves, we {{were filled}} with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hopeless dulness of the town. Instead of being the hustling, rushing gold camp we had {{expected}} to find, it came to light as a little town of tents and shanties, filled with men who had practically given up the Teslin Lake Route as a bad job. The government trail was incomplete, the wagon road only built halfway, and the railroad--of which we had heard so much talk--had been abandoned altogether.|$|R
5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual respect for each other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of unity among the reformers. He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E
5|$|The washed-out Test {{resulted}} in a late change to the schedule and an unprecedented seventh Test was played at Sydney in February 1971. Trailing 0–1 in the series, Australia could retain The Ashes by winning this game. Australia's performances were hampered by playing slow, defensive cricket. In a radical attempt to breathe some aggression into the team, the selectors sacked captain Bill Lawry and appointed Chappell in his stead. <b>Dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> manner of Lawry's dismissal, Chappell responded with an attacking performance as captain, he won the toss, put England in and dismissed them for 184, and Australia led the first innings by 80 runs, but set 223 to win they folded for 160 and lost The Ashes after holding them for 12 years. Chappell gained some consolation {{at the end of}} a dramatic summer when he led SA to the Sheffield Shield, the team's first win for seven years.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 David {{returned}} to England, where food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained in force. <b>Dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{contrast between the}} bad food served in Britain and the simple, excellent food to which she had become used in France, Greece and Egypt, she began to write magazine articles about Mediterranean cooking. They attracted favourable attention, and in 1950, {{at the age of}} 36, she published A Book of Mediterranean Food. Her recipes called for ingredients such as aubergines, basil, figs, garlic, olive oil and saffron, which at the time were scarcely available in Britain. Books on French, Italian and, later, English cuisine followed. By the 1960s David was a major influence on British cooking. She was deeply hostile to anything second-rate, and to over-elaborate cooking and bogus substitutes for classic dishes and ingredients. In 1965 she opened a shop selling kitchen equipment, which continued to trade under her name after she left it in 1973. Her reputation rests on her articles and her books, which have been continually reprinted. Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her literary executor completed a further four that she had planned and worked on.|$|E

500|$|The Robots' Rebellion {{was greeted}} with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Green Party's executive. Despite the {{controversy}} over the press conference and the Wogan interview, they had allowed Icke to address the party's annual conference in 1992—a decision that led one of its principal speakers, Sara Parkin, to resign—but after the publication of The Robot's Rebellion they moved to ban him. Icke wrote to The Guardian in September 1994 denying that The Robots' Rebellion was antisemitic, and rejecting racism, sexism and prejudice of any kind, while insisting that whoever had written the Protocols [...] "knew the game plan" [...] for the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, the Festiniog Railway Company was {{involved}} in a controversial plan to stop the neighbouring Welsh Highland Railway (WHR) being rebuilt, as it was concerned at the effect a nearby heritage railway competitor could have on the FR business. The initial plan would have involved the FR Company buying the original track bed of the WHR from the old company's receiver and giving it to Gwynedd County Council, provided no railway-related developments were allowed on the land. This was greeted with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> WHR (1964) Company, which had been attempting to preserve the line since the 1960s.|$|R
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E
5|$|With the {{departure}} of the Royal Family, Naples descended into anarchy and news reached Palermo in January that the French had entered the city under General Championnet and proclaimed the Parthenopaean Republic. Nelson was promoted to Rear Admiral of the Red on 14 February 1799, and was occupied for several months in blockading Naples, while a popular counter-revolutionary force under Cardinal Ruffo known as the Sanfedisti marched to retake the city. In late June Ruffo's army entered Naples, forcing the French and their supporters to withdraw to the city's fortifications as rioting and looting broke out amongst the ill-disciplined Neapolitan troops. <b>Dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bloodshed, Ruffo agreed to a general amnesty with the Jacobin forces that allowed them safe conduct to France. Nelson, now aboard Foudroyant, was outraged, and backed by King Ferdinand he insisted that the rebels must surrender unconditionally. He took those who had surrendered under the amnesty under armed guard, including the former Admiral Francesco Caracciolo, who had commanded the Neapolitan navy under King Ferdinand but had changed sides during the brief Jacobin rule. Nelson ordered his trial by court-martial and refused Caracciolo's request that it be held by British officers, nor was Caracciolo allowed to summon witnesses in his defence. Caracciolo was tried by royalist Neapolitan officers and sentenced to death. He asked to be shot rather than hanged, but Nelson, following the wishes of Queen Maria Carolina (a close friend of his mistress, Lady Hamilton) also refused this request and even ignored the court's request to allow 24hours for Caracciolo to prepare himself. Caracciolo was hanged aboard the Neapolitan frigate Minerva at 5 o'clock the same afternoon. Nelson kept the Jacobins imprisoned and approved of a wave of further executions, refusing to intervene despite pleas for clemency from the Hamiltons and the Queen of Naples. When transports were finally allowed to carry the Jacobins to France, less than a third were still alive. On 13 August 1799, King Ferdinand gave Nelson the newly created Dukedom of Bronté in the Kingdom of Sicily, in perpetual property, enclosing the Maniace Castle, the accompanying Abbey, and the land and the city of Bronte, this as a reward for his support of the monarchy.|$|E

But Caleb was not in a humour to understand or admit any distinctions.

This was the second attack, the first having been so short as to have caused no trepidations in the world of music; but {{this was supposed to be}} sterner in its nature, and to have caused already great alarm. Before March was over it was published to the world at large that Miss O'Mahony would not be able to sing during the forthcoming week.|$|R

According to Bronson Alcott, the inhabitants left Fruitlands in January 1844; his daughter, Louisa May, wrote that they left in December 1843, which {{is considered to be}} the more accurate date. Alcott was deeply <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> failure of Fruitlands and, moving with his family to live with a nearby farmer, refused to eat for several days. Later, Ralph Waldo Emerson helped purchase a home for the family in Concord.|$|E
25|$|Louis XVI was {{increasingly}} <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{direction of the}} revolution. His brother, the Comte d'Artois and his queen, Marie Antoinette, urged a stronger stance against the revolution {{and support for the}} émigrés, while he was resistant to any course that would see him openly side with foreign powers against the Assembly. Eventually, fearing for his own safety and that of his family, he decided to flee Paris to the Austrian border, having been assured of the loyalty of the border garrisons.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, the boy-scout troops {{take care}} of the {{instruction}} of the Hungarian language. Thanks to a competition won from the Apáczai Public Foundation a teacher sent from Hungary was active in São Paulo in 2001, instructing 80 students to everyone’s satisfaction. In addition, the Lutheran Church maintains a Hungarian-language nursery school. At the beginning of 2003, the ninth candidate applied for a scholarship from the Hungarian Ministry of Education and the Hungarian Boy-Scout Federation Abroad. Interest for applications recently declines because the three candidates who joined the Bálint Balassa Institute in Budapest during the summer period were left without scholarship and lodgings and had to return home.

50|$|In 1935, Caldecott was {{appointed}} governor of Hong Kong. His tenure was the shortest in Hong Kong colonial history, for he {{was appointed}} the second last Governor of Ceylon {{a little more than}} a year later to handle the threat to the British administration caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming national liberation movement in Ceylon. When arriving in Hong Kong to assume the Governorship, Caldecott, unusually, elected to wear civilian dress, something that would not happen again until the arrival, in 1992, of the last colonial Governor, Chris Patten. His departure to Ceylon was met with <b>dismay</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> community as he had become a respected figure.

In response to Conway's concerns, the Colony of British Columbia agreed to build a road from New Westminster to Yale where it would meet the newly completed Cariboo Road.

The Austrian government appointed Feldzeugmeister Joseph Nikolaus De Vins to fill the post on 21 December 1792. Even so, Austria was aware that the French were trying to negotiate a peace with the Sardinians, and the Austrians did not fully trust their ally. The execution of King Louis XVI of France on 21 January 1793 appalled the other crowned heads of Europe and further isolated France.|$|E
25|$|Secretary of the Navy Welles was <b>dismayed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> failure.

His criticism softened only when John Rodgers, who {{was known to be}} a thoroughly competent and aggressive officer, sided with Du Pont. As Rodgers saw it, and as Welles had to agree, Charleston could not be taken by a purely naval assault. It would require a combined operation, with full cooperation of both services, to achieve that.|$|E
