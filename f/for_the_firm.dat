40|$|Abstract This paper {{provides}} an alternative credit risk model {{based on information}} reduction where the market only observes <b>the</b> <b>firm’s</b> asset value when it crosses certain levels, interpreted as changes significant enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm’s</b> management to make a public announcement. For a class of diffusion processes {{we are able to}} provide explicit expressions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm’s</b> default intensity process and its zero-coupon bond prices...|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} block {{model is a}} tool <b>for</b> amortizing <b>the</b> expenditure of a regulated firm {{in such a way}} that the expected net present value of the cash-flow of <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> is zero. <b>For</b> this to be achieved, the regulator must choose the cost of capital to reflect the correct cost of capital or discount rate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> associated cash-flow stream of <b>the</b> <b>firm.</b> This is usually carried out by estimating a weighted average cost of capital <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cash-flow stream of <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> as a whole. Under the standard regulatory approach in Australia where the tax liabilities of <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> are handled as an additional element in <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> revenue equation, <b>the</b> appropriate weighted average formula is the simple [...] "plain vanilla" [...] formula, consisting of a weighted average of the cost of capital <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> equity and <b>the</b> cost of capital <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> debt. <b>The</b> cost of capital <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> debt is usually estimated by observing the currently prevailing return in <b>the</b> market <b>for</b> corporate bonds of a similar credit rating and duration. The cost of capital <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm's</b> equity is usually estimated using the capital asset pricing model.|$|R

5|$|After graduation, Brundage {{began work}} as a {{construction}} superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird & Roche. In the three years he worked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm,</b> he supervised the construction of $7.5million in buildings—3percent of the total built in Chicago in that time-frame. He disliked {{the corruption of the}} Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer {{was in a position to}} benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.|$|E

He married his second wife, Hilda May Beman, in December 1925, but he never had children. He maintained a loose connection with cricket; he appeared at a birthday dinner for Pelham Warner, at a centenary celebration for the Free Foresters Cricket Club and in a radio broadcast for Jack Hobbs's 80th birthday.

5|$|González-Gordon worked most of {{his life}} for the family company González Byass, which specializes in making sherry. He was the fifth {{generation}} of the family to chair the company. While working <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> he was involved in the making, tasting and commercialisation of sherry and in later years he also helped the company expand into producing brandy and several sorts of wine. Immediately after he finished his studies in 1946 he joined the business and started at the bottom with the picking and crushing of grapes. During this time he also learned about the solera system, which is used to age different type of liquids. His interest in oenology had only developed after visiting California the year he graduated. He visited California after previously being sent to New York by boat with twelve containers of wine. In 1955 he founded the first research center for viticulture and winemaking in Spain by establishing one at González Byass. For twenty years he was occupied as head of wine selection at the company. González-Gordon also served on the board of González Byass beginning in 1961, and was president of the company between 1993 and 1999. During this period González-Gordon managed to expand the business by exporting all over the world, including to the United States, United Kingdom, China and East Asia. After his time as president he continued to serve as an advisor to his son, Mauricio Junior, who took over his position. Apart from his work at González Byass González-Gordon also diverted some of his time towards the regulatory council of the sherry making industry, serving for 24 years.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, {{he moved to the}} United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1902. He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including {{as a member of the}} Cambridge rowing crew that won the Boat Race in 1904. Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the Henley Royal Regatta) and write on the subject for much of his life. Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered. During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in the London with the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co. His work <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> took him to Mexico in 1908 and Colombia in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.|$|E

5|$|Mandela {{obtained}} work as {{an attorney}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> Terblanche and Briggish, {{before moving to the}} liberal-run Helman and Michel, passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney. In August 1953, Mandela and Tambo opened their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg. The only African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of police brutality. Disliked by the authorities, the firm was forced to relocate to a remote location after their office permit was removed under the Group Areas Act; as a result, their clientele dwindled. As a lawyer of aristocratic heritage, Mandela was part of Johannesburg's elite black middle-class, and accorded much respect from the black community. Although a second daughter, Makaziwe Phumia, was born in May 1954, Mandela's relationship with Evelyn became strained, and she accused him of adultery. He may have had affairs with ANC member Lillian Ngoyi and secretary Ruth Mompati; various individuals close to Mandela in this period have stated that the latter bore him a child. Disgusted by her son's behaviour, Nosekeni returned to Transkei, while Evelyn embraced the Jehovah's Witnesses and rejected Mandela's preoccupation with politics.|$|E
