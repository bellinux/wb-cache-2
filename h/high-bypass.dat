5|$|One of the {{principal}} technologies that enabled an aircraft {{as large as the}} 747 to be drawn up was the <b>high-bypass</b> turbofan engine. The engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier turbojets while consuming a third less fuel. General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later. Pratt & Whitney was also working on the same principle and, by late 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop a new engine, designated the JT9D to power the 747.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is a <b>high-bypass</b> {{turbofan}} engine (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.|$|E
25|$|If {{it is not}} {{possible}} to arrange a single straight path for the driveshaft, it may be arranged in two sections and linked by an intermediate gearbox. This is most commonly required for <b>high-bypass</b> turbofans with large diameter fans.|$|E
25|$|The Rolls-Royce RB211 is a British {{family of}} <b>high-bypass</b> {{turbofan}} engines made by Rolls-Royce plc. Mismanagement {{of the development}} and consequent cost issues led to the effective nationalisation of Rolls-Royce Limited {{in order to save}} the workforce and the engine businesses important to the nation, and many other aerospace and aircraft operating companies.|$|E
25|$|The CF6-50 {{series are}} <b>high-bypass</b> {{turbofan}} engines rated between 51,000 and 54,000lb (227.41 to 240.79kN, or '25 tons') of thrust. The CF6-50 was developed into the LM5000 industrial turboshaft engines. It {{was launched in}} 1969 to power the long range McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, and {{was derived from the}} earlier CF6-6.|$|E
25|$|The MD-90 is a mid-size, medium-range {{airliner}} {{that was}} developed from the MD-80 series. It is a , updated version of the MD-88 with similar electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and more powerful, quieter and fuel efficient IAE V2500 engines instead of the JT8D engines, which power the MD-80 series. This made the MD-90 the first derivative variant of the DC-9 to use a <b>high-bypass</b> turbofan engine. Typical seating for the MD-90 ranges from 153 to 172 passengers, depending on the cabin configuration and interior layout.|$|E
25|$|The Kawasaki P-1 is a {{purpose-built}} {{maritime patrol}} aircraft equipped with four engines. The P-1 is powered by four podded IHI F7-10 turbofan engines underneath the low-set wings. The four-engine low-wing loading design adopted for the P-1 results in a flight profile with better maneuverability and stability at low-speed, low-altitude flight and allows the aircraft to continue its mission {{in the event of}} a single engine failure as well as greater operational survivability, the <b>high-bypass</b> engines provide for quiet, fuel-efficient operation. The P-1 has reduced transit times in comparison to turboprop-powered competitors, and the turbofans are quieter, making it more difficult for submerged submarines to detect it acoustically.|$|E
25|$|In 1864 Boulton {{looked at}} the {{problems}} of combustion at constant pressure, {{in connection with the}} operation of an industrial gas turbine. His British patent, No. 1636 of 1864, contains points of interest. He realized that the high velocity of the gas jet exiting his combustion chamber nozzle offered a practical difficulty, and proposed to remedy this by the use of successive induced jets of increasing volume and consequently lower velocity. This was shown in his drawing, with gases being delivered through collinear nozzles of increasing diameter, with the outer nozzles operating at increased gas volumes with reduced velocities, similar to the exhaust of a <b>high-bypass</b> turbofan jet engine.|$|E
500|$|On 30 June 2005, {{the airline}} {{confirmed}} {{an order for}} six new Boeing767-300ER aircraft, powered by General Electric CF6-80C2 <b>high-bypass</b> turbofan engines. [...] The three freighter and three passenger models, valued at approximately US$800 million at list prices, were delivered between 2007 and 2008.|$|E
500|$|The first post-B-70 {{strategic}} penetrator {{study was}} known as the Subsonic Low-Altitude Bomber (SLAB), which was completed in 1961. This produced a design that looked more like an airliner than a bomber, with a large swept wing, T-tail, and large <b>high-bypass</b> engines. This was followed by the similar Extended Range Strike Aircraft (ERSA), which added a variable-sweep wing, then in vogue in the aviation industry. ERSA envisioned a relatively small aircraft with a [...] payload and a range of , with [...] being flown at low altitudes. In August 1963, the similar Low-Altitude Manned Penetrator design was completed, which called for an aircraft with a [...] bomb load and somewhat shorter range of [...]|$|E
500|$|Research {{into the}} next {{generation}} of commercial jet engines, <b>high-bypass</b> ratio turbofans in the [...] "10-ton" [...] (20,000lbf; 89kN) thrust class, began in the late 1960s. SNECMA, who had mostly built military engines until then, was the first company to seek entrance into the market by searching for a partner with commercial experience to design and build an engine in this class. They considered Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, and GE Aviation as potential partners, and after two company executives, Gerhard Neumann from GE and René Ravaud from SNECMA, introduced themselves at the 1971 Paris Air Show a decision was made. The two companies saw mutual benefit in the collaboration and met several more times, fleshing out the basics of the joint project.|$|E
500|$|The CFM International CFM56 (U.S. {{military}} designation F108) {{series is}} a family of <b>high-bypass</b> turbofan aircraft engines made by CFM International (CFMI), with a thrust range of [...] CFMI is a 50–50 joint-owned company of Safran Aircraft Engines (formerly known as SNECMA), France, and GE Aviation (GE), United States. Both companies are responsible for producing components and {{each has its own}} final assembly line. GE produces the high-pressure compressor, combustor, and high-pressure turbine, SNECMA manufactures the fan, gearbox, exhaust and the low-pressure turbine, and some components are made by Avio of Italy. The engines are assembled by GE in Evendale, Ohio, and by SNECMA in Villaroche, France. The completed engines are marketed by CFMI. Despite initial export restrictions, {{it is one of the}} most common turbofan aircraft engines in the world, in four major variants.|$|E
2500|$|The General Electric CF6 is {{a family}} of <b>high-bypass</b> {{turbofan}} engines produced by GE Aviation. [...] Based on the TF39, the first high-power <b>high-bypass</b> jet engine, the CF6 powers {{a wide variety of}} civilian airliners. The basic engine core also powers the LM2500, LM5000, and LM6000 marine and power generation turboshafts.|$|E
2500|$|The CF6-80 {{series are}} <b>high-bypass</b> {{turbofan}} engines with a thrust range of 48,000 to 75,000lb (214 to 334kN). [...] Although the HP compressor still has 14 stages, GE did {{take the opportunity}} to tidy-up the design, by removing the empty air passage at compressor exit.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{success for}} GE was his guiding {{the design and}} {{development}} of the huge <b>high-bypass</b> turbofan jet engines (or simply called [...] "fanjets") that now power the largest commercial and military cargo aircraft. These include the TF39, CF6, and (in 50/50 collaboration with SNECMA) the CFM56.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Porter {{proposed}} {{expanding the}} airport further and modifying the operating agreement {{to allow it}} to use Bombardier CS100 <b>high-bypass</b> turbofan jet planes at the airport. The proposal, estimated to cost [...] billion in public expenditure, went to Ports Toronto for further study. In November 2015, after the 2015 Canadian federal election, the new government announced that it would not re-open the tripartite agreement to allow jets. Ports Toronto subsequently cancelled the expansion proposal studies.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, the Trident was {{becoming}} {{the backbone of}} the BEA fleet and BEA wanted an even larger aircraft. [...] offered two new designs in 1965: a larger 158-seat two-engine aircraft otherwise similar to the Trident known as the HS132; and the 185-seat HS134, which moved the engines under the wings, a design very similar to the Boeing 757. Both were to be powered by a new <b>high-bypass</b> engine under development at the time, the Rolls-Royce RB178. BEA instead opted for Boeing 727s and 737s to fill the roles of both the BAC 1–11 and Trident, but this plan was vetoed by the British government.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 June 1967, [...] Rolls-Royce offered Lockheed the RB211-06 for the L-1011. The {{new engine}} {{was to be}} rated at [...] thrust and {{combined}} features of several engines then under development: the large high-power, <b>high-bypass</b> design from the RB207 and the triple-spool design of the RB203. To this was added one new piece of technology, a fan stage built of a new carbon fibre material called Hyfil developed at the RAE Farnborough. The weight saving was considerable over a similar fan made of titanium, and gave the RB211 an advantage over its competitors in terms of power-to-weight ratio. Despite knowing that the timetable was challenging for an engine incorporating these new features, Rolls-Royce committed to putting the RB211 into service in 1971.|$|E
2500|$|Boeing {{engineer}} Mark Gregoire led {{a design}} team, which cooperated with CFM International to select, modify and deploy a new engine and nacelle {{that would make}} the 737-300 into a viable aircraft. They chose the CFM56-3B-1 <b>high-bypass</b> turbofan engine to power the aircraft, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise, but also posed an engineering challenge, given the low ground clearance of the 737 and the larger diameter of the engine over the original Pratt & Whitney engines. Gregoire's team and CFM solved the problem by reducing the size of the fan (which made the engine slightly less efficient than it had been forecast to be), placing the engine ahead of the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides of the engine pod, giving the engine a distinctive non-circular [...] "hamster pouch" [...] air intake. Earlier customers for the CFM56 included the U.S. Air Force with its program to re-engine KC-135 tankers.|$|E
5000|$|For {{reasons of}} fuel economy, {{and also of}} reduced noise, almost all of today's jet airliners are powered by <b>high-bypass</b> turbofans. Although modern combat {{aircraft}} tend to use low-bypass ratio turbofans, military transport aircraft (e.g., C-17 [...] ) mainly use <b>high-bypass</b> ratio turbofans (or turboprops) for fuel efficiency.|$|E
