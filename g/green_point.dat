Especially the atmospheric dust pollution will be reduced by construction of new plants greenery on roofs of buildings. We use a area-covered quadratic grid (200 m, 200 m) proposed by the Humboldt-University at Berlin (Institute for Econonomy-Engineers). The decisions for carrying out or omission of actions for reduction of environmental pollution depend on various factors. Not all these factors can be simulated by the computer. In the following new <b>green</b> <b>points</b> denote grid-points, where new plants greenery on the roofs of buildings are planed to be constructed. According to the environmental demands we have to formulate some adequate performance indices: 1. {{the number of new}} <b>green</b> <b>points</b> with small distance to defined clusters is to be maximized 2. the total construction-costs are to be minimized 3. the number of new <b>green</b> <b>points</b> with maximum dust-deposition is to be maximized 4. th e number of new <b>green</b> <b>points,</b> where investments are planed, is to be maximized 5. the number of new <b>green</b> <b>points</b> with maximum traffic-immission is to be maximized.

The North Head– South Head indicator loop had been giving faulty signals since early 1940, and as civilian traffic regularly passed over the loop, readings were often ignored.|$|E

60|$|After the {{accounts}} given by Barrow, Carmichael, Basil Hall, and W.B. Clarke of the geology of this district, I shall confine {{myself to a}} few observations on the junction of the three principal formations. The fundamental rock is granite (In several places I observed in the granite, small dark-coloured balls, composed of minute scales of black mica in a tough basis. In another place, I found crystals of black schorl radiating from a common centre. Dr. Andrew Smith found, in the interior parts of the country, some beautiful specimens of granite, with silvery mica radiating or rather branching, like moss, from central points. At the Geological Society, there are specimens of granite with crystallised feldspar branching and radiating in like manner.), overlaid by clay-slate: the latter is generally hard, and glossy from containing minute scales of mica; it alternates with, and passes into, beds of slightly crystalline, feldspathic, slaty rock. This clay-slate is remarkable from being in some places (as on the Lion's Rump) decomposed, even to the depth of twenty feet, into a pale-coloured, sandstone-like rock, which has been mistaken, I believe, by some observers, for a separate formation. I was guided by Dr. Andrew Smith to a fine junction at <b>Green</b> <b>Point</b> between the granite and clay-slate: the latter at the distance of {{a quarter of a}} mile from the spot, where the granite appears on the beach (though, probably, the granite is much nearer underground), becomes slightly more compact and crystalline. At a less distance, some of the beds of clay-slate are of a homogeneous texture, and obscurely striped with different zones of colour, whilst others are obscurely spotted. Within a hundred yards of the first vein of granite, the clay-slate consists of several varieties; some compact with a tinge of purple, others glistening with numerous minute scales of mica and imperfectly crystallised feldspar; some obscurely granular, others porphyritic with small, elongated spots of a soft white mineral, which being easily corroded, gives to this variety a vesicular appearance. Close to the granite, the clay-slate is changed into a dark-coloured, laminated rock, having a granular fracture, which is due to imperfect crystals of feldspar, coated by minute, brilliant scales of mica.|$|E
