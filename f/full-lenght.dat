40|$|The {{shortage}} of human {{tissues and organs}} for allotransplantation can be overcome by xenotransplantation. As a source of organs, the miniature pig is convenient. However, the presence of pathogens transmissible to the recipients, especially porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), represents a threat for successfull xenotransplantation. Infectious PERVs contain three classes of envelope glycoprotein. Two classes, PERV-A and PERV-B are polytropic, they can infect human, pig and mink cells in vitro. PERV-C is evolutionary young, ecotropic isolate that can infect pig only. We previously detected a new <b>full-lenght,</b> but replication-defective PERV-A isolate dubbed (MAMBA) with high transcriptional activity in Large-White pig from a Czech breed. To support our results with PERV-MAMBA epigenetic regulation in pig tissues, in vitro DNA methylation essay was accomplished. Methylated or non-methylated reporter plasmids containing provirus 5 ' LTR were transfected into 293 T cells and luciferase activity was measured. In both cases, methylated LTR decreased significantly expression of luciferase. Thus, PERV LTR-driven transcription is sensitive to DNA methylation.

40|$|International audiencePrions are {{infectious}} proteins {{responsible for}} a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases. In mammals, prions reproduce themselves by recruiting the normal cellular protein (PrPC) and inducing its conversion to the disease-causing isoform denominated PrPSc. Recently, anti-prion antibodies have been shown to permanently cure prion-infected cells. However, the inability of <b>full-lenght</b> antibodies and proteins to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) hampers their use in the therapy of TSEs in vivo. Alternatively, brain delivery of prion-specific scFv by adeno-associated virus (AAV) transfer delays the onset of the disease in infected mice, although protection is not complete. We investigated the anti-prion effects of a recombinant anti-PrP (D 18) single-chain variable fragment (scFv) by direct addition to scrapie infected cell cultures or by infection with both lentivirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV) transducing vectors. We show that recombinant anti-PrP scFv is able to reduce proteinase K-resistant PrP content in infected cells. In addition, we demonstrate that lentiviruses are more efficient than AAV in gene transferring of the anti-PrP scFv gene and in reducing PrPSc content in infected neuronal cell lines. Finally, we have used a bioinformatic approach to construct a structural model of D 18 scFv-PrPC complex. Interestingly, according to the docking results, ArgPrP 151 (Arg 151 from prion protein) is the key residue for the interactions with D 18 scFv, anchoring the PrPC to the cavity of the antibody. Taken together, these results indicate that combined passive and active immunotherapy targeting PrP might be promising strategies for therapeutic intervention in prion diseases...|$|E
40|$|Aminoglycosides {{are widely}} used for the {{treatment}} of cystic fibrosis (CF), a fatal, autosomal, recessive genetic disease characterized by persistent pulmonary infection and extensive lung inflammation. In addition to their role as antibiotics, aminoglycosides have been shown to act as suppressors of nonsense mutations that generate premature translation termination (PTCs). PTCs constitute the molecular basis of many genetic diseases, including CF (5 - 10 % of cystic fibrosis alleles contain PTCs) as lead to the synthesis of truncated non-functional or partially functional protein. Suppression of translation terminations at PTCs (read-through) has been developed as a therapeutic strategy to restore <b>full-lenght</b> protein in several genetic diseases. Phenotypic consequences of PTCs can be exacerbated by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway that detect and degrade PTC containing mRNA. Modulation of NMD, therefore, is also of interest as a potential target for the suppression therapy. Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, normally used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infection in CF patients. In the present study we have investigated, on one hand, the properties of Tobramycin as a modulator of the expression of IL- 8 associated with inflammation of the CF airway pathology in CF IB 3 - 1 cells induced with pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- α. On the other hand, by using the yeast as a genetic system, we have examined the ability of Tobramycin to suppress PTCs {{as a function of the}} presence or absence of NMD. Results demonstrate that Tobramycin is a good inhibitor of IL- 8 expression and exhibits read-through ability on PTCs in conditions in which NMD is not operating in the cell...|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} is an {{end point}} of a signal transduction programme leading to irreversible cell cycle arresst accompanied by characteristic alterations to cell morphology, biochemical properties and gene expression profile. This phenotype can be triggered {{by a variety of}} stimuli including telomere shortening, DNA damage or activated oncogenes. Senescence is now recognised as a tumour suppressor mechanism mediated by p 53 and pRB pathways which act to prevent the proliferatio of cells that are at risk of tumourigenic transformation. RUNX 1 is a transcription factor essential for definitive hematopoiesis and is frequently targeted in human leukaemias by chromosomal rearrangements. RUNX 1 has been also demonstrated to act as a dominant oncogene in mice and the ectopic expression of RUNX 1 in murine embryonic fibroblasts has been shown to cause senescence. The central aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the mechanism of senescence induction by RUNX 1 and its fusion derived leukaemogenic oncoproteins in primary fibroblasts. My work showed that RUNX 1 induces a strong senescence-like response in murine and human primary fibroblasts that requires intact DNA binding, CBFB interaction and C-terminal transcriptional activation/repression domains. However, surprising differences were found between the major RUNX 1 fusion oncoprotein derivatives. The N-terminal fusion protein TEL-RUNX 1 fails to induce senescence despite retention of a virtually <b>full-lenght</b> RUNX 1 moiety, while the senescence-inducing potential is exaggerated in the truncated C-terminal fusion protein RUNX 1 -ETO (AML 1 -ETO). The potential to drive senescence is retained by the deletion mutant RUNX 1 -ETO[] 469 which lacks critical corepressor binding sites suggesting that the repression of target genes may be a primary mechanism implicated in RUNX 1 -ETO induced senescence. Interestingly, CBFB-MYH 11 fusion oncoprotein that affects RUNX 1 indirectly by targeting CBFB cn also induce senescence when ectopically expressed in human primary cells. The RUNX 1 and RUNX 1 -ETO induced senescent phenotypes differ from archetypal H-Ras [superscript v 12] as arrest occurs without a preliminary phase of proliferation and the arrested cells lack prominent foci of DNA strand breaks and chromatin condensation. Notably however, RUNX 1 and RUNX 1 -ETO display differences in their potency and the extent of engagement of p 53 and Rb effector pathways. RUNX 1 -ETO is highly dependent on p 53 function and unlike RUNX 1 drives senescence in cells lacking intact p 16 Ink 4 a. RUNX 1 -ETO appears to exert its unique effects through potent induction of reactive oxygen species and p 38 MAPK phosphorylation. These findings illustrate the heterogeneous manifestations of senescence-like growth arrest and elucidate the distinctive biology and oncogenic properies of RUNX 1 and its fusion derivatives.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that transient receptor potential channels (TRP-channels) participate in ligand gated Ca^(2 +) entry in non-excitable cells. To analyze the physiological relevance of TRP-channels human neutrophile granulocyte were chosen {{as a model for}} non-excitable cells. The activation of neutrophiles is accompanied by membrane depolarisation and by a rise of the [Ca^(2 +) ]i. Until now the identity of the proteins which initiate the activation of neutrophile granulocytes is not known. Among the TRP-channels, the LTRPC 2 is predominantly expressed by neutrophile granulocytes. To investigate the relevance of LTRPC 2 for the function of neutrophile granulocytes, LTRPC 2 was cloned by the RT-PCR technique and was then heterologously transfected in CHO- and in HEK 293 cells for functional characterisation. Two splice variants of the LTRPC 2 were identified in human neutrophile granulocytes. These splice forms were used to construct four alternative variants with deletions at the N-terminal and/or C-terminal domain (LTRPC 2; LTRPC 2 -deltaC; LTRPC 2 -deltaN; LTRPC 2 -deltaN-deltaC) using an appropriate cloning strategy. Fluorometric measurments of the [Ca^(2 +) ]i and measurment of ionic currents of heterologously transfected cells with patch clamp revealed no activation of the LTRPC 2 variants in dependence of an intracellular Ca^(2 +) store depletion. This stands in contrast to the classical TRP-proteins. Since NAD^(+) and its metabolite ADP-ribose have recently been reported to activate LTRPC 2, I analysed the response of LTRPC 2 variants to NAD^(+) and ADP-ribose. Whereas no activation by NAD^(+) was observed in any LTRPC 2 variant, ADP-ribose exerted a stimulating effect exclusively on the <b>full-lenght</b> LTRPC 2. Since ADP-ribose can be formed from NAD^(+), and NAD^(+) is elevated during oxidative stress, it was tested wether the various LTRPC 2 channel variants mediate cation influx in response to an oxidant. Therefore ion currents and the [Ca^(2 +) ]i were measured after stimulating transfected cells with H 2 O 2 as a model of oxidative stress. A stimulation with H 2 O 2 could be observed in cells transfected with full-length LTRPC 2 or transfected with the variant LTRPC 2 -deltaC. Thus the activation of LTRPC 2 by H 2 O 2 is independent of ADP-ribose because the splice variant LTRPC 2 -deltaC was exclusively activated by H 2 O 2, while full-length LTRPC 2 could be activated by ADP-ribose as well. Since intracellular application of the antioxidant mannitol prevented a stimulation of LTRPC 2 and LTRPC 2 -deltaC by H 2 O 2, it can be concluded that H 2 O 2 does not act directly on the channel but by intracellular oxidation reactions. It is possible that the activation of LTRPC 2 plays a role for the stimulation of neutrophile granulocytes during inflammation, when neutrophiles become activated by H 2 O 2...|$|E
40|$|Cryptochromes are photolyase-like blue/UV-A light receptors that {{regulate}} various light developmental responses in plants. Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (Atcry 2) {{is the major}} photoreceptor mediating blue light regulation of flowering induction. Although the biological role of crys in plants is well-known, the initial photochemistry underlying cryptochrome activation and regulation remain poorly understood. In the present work we addressed several aspects in the early activation events of cry 2. Many members of the photoreceptor families and components of the light signalling transduction pathway dimerize. Therefore, we studied wheter Atcry 2 dimerizes, too. Immunoprecipitation studies of transgenic Arabidopsis extracts expressing both, cry 2 -GFP and cry 2 revealed that <b>full-lenght</b> Atcry 2 is a homodimer in vivo in a light-independent fashion. The identity of the domains involved in cry 2 homodimerization were investigated, and both CNT 2 and CCT 2 were found as monomers. Because of the sequence similarity of cry 2 with cry 1, heterodimerization between cry 1 and cry 2 was also studied, but no cry 1 -cry 2 heterodimers were found in our experiments. The in vivo effect of dimerization was investigated using Arabidopsis transgenic lines expression either CCT 2 -GFP or cry 2 -GFP in addition of the endogenous cry 2. Cry 2 -GFP dimers showed phosphorylation and degradation under blue light {{in the same way}} as the endogenous cry 2, whereas under the same conditions the CCT 2 -GFP monomers remained stable and unphosphorylated. Moreover, cry 2 -GFP was able to promote early flowering in plants kept under short day conditions. Whereas under the same conditions CCT 2 -GFP expressing transgenic Arabidopsis flowered as late as wild-type. Crys purified from Escherichia coli contain two chromophores, which were identified as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and methenyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF), whereas the presence of MTHF was not found for Atcrys purified from an eukaryotic source as insect cells. The detailed knowledge of which chromophore(s) are attached under natural conditions is important for the interpretation of spectroscopic data of these receptors. Therefore, we overexpressed epitope-tagged cry 2 in planta. Specific immuno-precipitation of the tagged cry 2 protein allowed purification of sufficient amounts of the photoreceptor to identify its chromophores. Based on fluorescence emission data we found that cry 2 binds indeed FAD and MTHF in planta. In addition, energy transfer from MTHF to FAD was observed. Because of their similarity in aminoacid sequence and structure, photolyases have been taken as a model for crys photocycle. However, crys were shown to undergo a photocycle in which semireduced flavin (FADHo) accumulates upon blue light irradiation in contrast to photolyase that accumulates fully reduced FADH-. Green light irradiation of cry 2 causes a change in the equilibrium of flavin oxidation states, and attenuates cry 2 -controlled responses such as flowering. Here, we provided in vivo evidence for semireduced flavin (FADHo) being the active FAD redox state in Atcry 2 by analysis of the expression of flowering genes, linking in vitro with physiological studies. In order to address further insight into the role of phosphorylation on Atcry 2 activity, cry 2 protein purification from the plant source following mass spectroscopy was performed. Pitifully, the obtained amounts were too small to allow clear results. Genes that are specifically blue-light induced in cell cultures were identified by PCR and qRT-PCR that can be used in future studies as reporters for transient studies monitoring cry activity...|$|E
40|$|Harold Pinter najvažniji je britanski dramatičar od sredine prošlog stoljeća naovamo, što je prepoznao i Odbor za dodijelu Nobelove nagrade dodijelivši mu 2005. godine nagradu za književnost. Premda je i prije dobio brojne britanske i međunarodne nagrade i priznanja, Nobelova nagrada za književnost svakako je najprestižnija, a objava o dodijeli simbolično se poklopila s obilježavanjem njegova života te na njegov lik i djelo bacila novu svjetlost. Harold Pinter započeo je svoju karijeru kao pjesnik i glumac, te se etablirao kao dramski pisac, kazališni redatelj i filmski scenarist. Prva dramska djela kritika mu je smatrala l'art pour 'lartističkima i avangardnima, a potom ih uvrstila u teatar apsurda. Neki kritičari držali su da Pinterovim dramama najbolje pristaje žanrovska odrednica komedije prijetnje (comedies of menace). Sve do godine 1982. Pinterov rad uglavnom se doimao apolitičnim, a potom su kritičari i teatrolozi u njemu počeli prepoznavati izrazito politički angažiranog pisca te revalorizirati njegove ranije drame s tog gledišta. Iza naoko posve privatnog svijeta Pinterovih drama naslućuju se i vrebaju osnovni politički problemi: zloupotreba moći, borba za opstanak, okrutnost, strah, teror. Kao Židov iz istočnoga Londona, Pinter je iskusio nasilje, strah i borbu za opstanak uoči i nakon Drugoga svjetskog rata, što je ostavilo neizbrisiv trag na njegovu psihu i kasnije se odrazilo u njegovu djelu. Čovjekov egzistencijalistički strah i strepnja – ne kao apstrakcija niti nadrealistička fantazmagorija, nego kao nešto stvarno, psihofizičko i svakodnevno – nalazi se u srži Pinterova kazališta. Osim toga zaokupljen je i problemima identiteta, motivacije, ovjerovljenja, dokaza – a to su osnovni problemi filozofije i književnosti 20. stoljeća (tj. Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre i dr.). Pinter je bio impresioniran književnošću Kafke, Joycea i Becketta te spisima Markiza de Sadea i žanrom "gangsterskog filma", što se može iščitati iz njegovih drama. Razvio je, međutim, svoj osobni stil danas poznat kao "pintereskni" (Pinteresque). Njegov je dramski jezik jedinstven spoj poetičnosti i okrutnosti, koja je pritajena u gotovo svim dijaloškim situacijama. Pinterov dijalog i likovi odgovaraju uobičajenim standardima realističkoga kazališta, ali unatoč tome u tekstovima prevladava dojam tajanstvenosti, neizvjesnosti, poetske dvosmislenosti. Osim toga, u njegovim dramama jednako su važne i stanke, jer, kako je rekao, najbolje se komunicira onim što nije rečeno, tišinom. Zaokupljenost okrutnošću u svim njezinim manifestacijama, kako verbalne tako i fizičke te psihološke, s učestalom pojavom likova terorista, mučenika i krvnika, prožimlje svekolik Pinterov rad te čini jednu od njegovih glavnih tematskih niti. S te strane, Harold Pinter istinski je predstavnik 20. stoljeća – stoljeća genocida, atomske bombe, imperijalističkih i totalitarnih režima. Ovim doktorskim radom nadam se približiti djelo Harolda Pintera hrvatskoj znanstvenoj i kulturnoj sredini, odrediti njegove dramske teme i pokazati kako se od tzv. apolitičnog i l'art pour l'artističkog pisca preko predstavnika teatra apsurda razvio u politički angažiranog pisca i pripadnika kazališta okrutnosti – unatoč činjenici da nije bio upoznat s teorijom Antonina Artauda. I. Introduction This chapter {{consists}} of 3 parts: 1. Harold Pinter's Reception in Great Britain From his first written one-act play, The Room, in 1957 until the last, Celebration, in 2000, Harold Pinter experienced various reception {{in his native}} country. His very first work was praised by the critics and viewers as something anew, then the second <b>full-lenght</b> play The Birthday Party was severely attacked which, however, did not prevent him from writing new plays. Over time Pinter was recognized as a distinguished and unique playwright {{in the context of}} not only British but European as well as the world contemporary drama. 2. Harold Pinter's Reception in Croatia Harold Pinter's plays were produced in Croatia soon after their world premiers/openings in Great Britain. At the very beginning the critics were not favourable to his plays, although from their quoted reviews it is evident that they approached to his plays with an interest and serious engagement. The critics often compared Pinter to Beckett and Ionesco as well as Kafka, but they also recognized his distinguished poetics and an authentic dramatic voice. 3. Commentary The part of the chapter depicts differences and similarities between Pinter's reception in Great Britain and Croatia. II. Theatre of Cruelty 1. The Theory A French poet and theatre person Antonin Artaud was first to establish this term and conceived a ceremonial theatre of magic purgation that has a profound influence on avant-garde writers and directors. In the number of manifestos Artaud passionately rejected the fossilized psychological theatre of words and proposed a theatre inspired by the sacred ritual of the Orient. What he found in the Oriental theatre was a primitive mentality that exposed the human soul and the condition in which it lives in a drama of cruelty. Artaud longed to reinstate the theatre's primordial dignity by magically exercising the dramatic power of reality in order to affect man's senses so that he/she might understand his/her desires and acts from a larger perspective. Artaud's conception of the theatre is a functional one to overwhelm the spectator {{in such a way that}} he/she cannot be left intact. By liberating man's instictual preoccupation with crime and eroticism, Artaud hoped to achieve a therapeutic transformation in the spectator. In order to experience true feelings the spectator must participate emotionally in the dramatic action, which {{consists of}} an event, or happening. Artaud wished to create a sort of collective delirium and even a physical shock in order to reveal the fundamental cruelty that is at the basis of every dramatic action. The cruelty of which Artaud spoke was not one of bloody killings onstage but rather a cruelty of lucid determination to which we are all necessarily submitted. 2. The Practice In order to put his ideas in practice Artaud produced Les Cenci, his adaptation of text by Stendhal and Shelly, Although the production was a failure, it had an impact on Artaud's Collaborators like Roger Blin and Jean-Louis Barrault. 3. The Legacy Apart from France, Artaud's influence spread over to the United States especially after his book The Theatre and its Double was translated into English and published in New York in 1958. Polish directors Jerzy Grotowski and Tadeusz Kantor were also influenced by Artaud as well as British director Peter Brook. Croatian theatre directors were also attracted by Artaud's theory and several plays were produced with a reasonable success. III. Analysis of Harold Pinter's plays with the elements of the "theatre of cruelty" 1. Introduction Although Harold Pinter was not acquainted with Artaud's theory, in his plays one can find many great elements of cruelty – verbal, physical and psychological. The lebel "comedies of menace" which has been applied to Pinter's plays is correct as far as it goes, yet behind the menace there stands the consciousness of an anxiety about the cruelty of the post-Holocaust, postnuclear world itself. In the same way the frantic search for territory of one's own, a safe haven from which that world can be excluded – the territorial element of Pinter's work – also emerges as merely an aspect of the basic realization of the ruthless brutality/cruelty of the times, a panic-striken desire to shelter from a world pervaded by terror and torture. 2. Verbal and physical cruelty In Pinter's plays from the first stage of his work like The Room, The Dumb Waiter, The Birthday Party, A Night Out, The Carataker and The Homecoming – there are elements of explicite verbal and physical cruelty, as well as in the plays of his later phase: One for the Road, Mountain Language. These plays are analysed as such and in the context of Artaud's "theatre of cruelty". 3. Verbal and psychological cruelty Pinter depicted not only the working classes, but as well the middle and upper classes which lifestyle and enviroment did not prevent them of cruel behaviour. However, their kind of cruelty was less physical but more psychological. The plays analyzed as such are: A Slight Ache, The Collection, No Man's Land, The Hothouse, Ashes to Ashes and Celebration...|$|E
