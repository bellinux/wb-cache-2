5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local alignment.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> driven wheel, a torque must {{be applied}} to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, {{of which there are}} many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, {{the increase}} in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E

5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are {{used to determine the}} final result.

5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
