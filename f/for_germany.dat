5|$|After Germany was {{eliminated}} in the semi-finals by Italy, Kahn {{was given the}} start for the third place play-off held on 8 July 2006, which Germany won 3–1 against Portugal. In what was his last international appearance <b>for</b> <b>Germany,</b> he also received the captaincy of the team {{in the absence of}} the injured Michael Ballack. Although overshadowed by Bastian Schweinsteiger’s game-winning performance in the match, Kahn played to a high standard, pulling off several saves. Kahn deflected a shot by Portuguese forward Pauleta after he beat the German defence, and later saved Deco's shot made from just inside the penalty area. Following the match, Oliver Kahn announced his retirement from the German National Team. Throughout his international career he earned 86 caps <b>for</b> <b>Germany,</b> including 49 as team captain. He never won a World Cup, but finished as runner-up in 2002 and third in 2006.|$|E

Because of this, Austrian and Swiss skiers boycotted the events, although some Austrians decided to compete <b>for</b> <b>Germany.</b>|$|E

5|$|By early 1916, the British {{blockade}} of Germany {{was beginning to}} have an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined <b>for</b> <b>Germany</b> than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not.|$|E

The revolutionaries formed a Soldiers' Council (Soldatenrat) and flew the red flag over the Brussels Kommandantur while many officers, including the Governor-General, left the city <b>for</b> <b>Germany.</b> Fighting in the streets soon broke out between German loyalists and revolutionaries. With the German police no longer keeping order, anarchy broke out in the city which was only restored when Belgian troops arrived. The remaining German forces in Belgium began moving eastwards towards the German border, gradually evacuating more territory. The final German troops left the country on 23 November.|$|E
