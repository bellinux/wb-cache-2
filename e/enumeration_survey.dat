40|$|Background Urban heat island (UHI) effect, the {{ubiquitous}} consequence of urbanization, {{is considered to}} play a major role in population expansion of numerous insects. Cryptotympana atrata and Hyalessa fuscata are the most abundant cicada species in the Korean Peninsula, where their population densities are higher in urban than in rural areas. We predicted a positive relationship between the UHI intensities and population densities of these two cicada species in metropolitan Seoul. Methods To test this prediction, <b>enumeration</b> <b>surveys</b> of cicada exuviae densities were conducted in 36 localities located within and in the vicinity of metropolitan Seoul. Samples were collected in two consecutive periods from July to August 2015. The abundance of each species was estimated by two resource-weighted densities, one based on the total geographic area, and the other on the total number of trees. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors critical for the prevalence of cicada species in the urban habitat. Results C. atrata and H. fuscata were major constituents of cicada species composition collected across all localities. Minimum temperature and sampling period were significant factors contributing to the variation in densities of both species, whereas other environmental factors related to urbanization were not significant. More cicada exuviae were collected in the second rather than in the first samplings, which matched the phenological pattern of cicadas in metropolitan Seoul. Cicada population densities increased measurably with the increase in temperature. Age of residential complex also exhibited a significantly positive correlation to H. fuscata densities, but not to C.  atrata densities. Discussion Effects of temperature on cicada densities have been discerned from other environmental factors, as cicada densities increased measurably in tandem with elevated temperature. Several mechanisms may contribute to the abundance of cicadas in urban environments, such as higher fecundity of females, lower mortality rate of instars, decline in host plant quality, and local adaptation of organisms, but none of them were tested in the current study. Conclusions In sum, results of the <b>enumeration</b> <b>surveys</b> of cicada exuviae support the hypothesis that the UHI effect underlies the population expansion of cicadas in metropolitan Seoul. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms for this remain untested...|$|R

50|$|The use of {{alternative}} enumeration strategies is increasing {{but these are}} not so simple as many people assume and only occur in developed countries. The Netherlands has been most advanced in adopting a census using administrative data. This allows a simulated census to be conducted by linking several different administrative databases at an agreed time. Data can be matched and an overall enumeration established accounting for where the different sources are discrepant. A validation survey is still conducted in a similar way to the post <b>enumeration</b> <b>survey</b> employed in a traditional census.Other countries which have a population register use this as a basis for all the census statistics needed by users. This is most common amongst Nordic countries but requires a large number of different registers to be combined including population, housing, employment and education. These registers are then combined and brought up to the standard of a statistical register by comparing the data in different sources and ensuring the quality is sufficient for official statistics to be produced.A recent innovation is the French instigation of a rolling census programme with different regions enumerated each year such that the whole country is completely enumerated every 5 to 10 years. In Europe, in connection with the 2010 census round, a large number of countries adopted alternative census methodologies, often based on the combination of data from registers, surveys and other sources.|$|E

Our objective was to determine how often statistical tests {{have been reported in}} such articles in two prominent journals that publish these types of studies. Methods For this observational study, we used electronic searching to identify all survey studies published in Academic Medicine and the Journal of General Internal Medicine in which an entire population was studied. We tallied whether inferential statistics were used and whether p-values were reported. Results Eighty-four articles were found: 62 in Academic Medicine and 22 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. Overall, 38 (45 %) of the articles reported or stated that they calculated statistics: 35 % in Academic Medicine and 73 % in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

40|$|In this article, we sketch {{procedures}} {{for taking the}} census, making adjustments, and evaluating the results. Despite what you read in the newspapers, the census is remarkably accurate. Statistical adjustment is unlikely to improve on the census, because adjustment can easily put in more error than it takes out. Indeed, error rates in the adjustment {{turn out to be}} comparable to—if not larger than—errors in the census. The data suggest a strong geographical pattern to such errors, even after controlling for demography—which contradicts a basic premise of adjustment. The complex demographic controls built into the adjustment mechanism turn out to be counter-productive. Proponents of adjustment have cited “loss function analysis ” to compare the accuracy of the census and adjustment, generally to the advantage of the latter. However, these analyses make assumptions that are highly stylized, and quite favorable to adjustment. With more realistic assumptions, loss function analysis is neutral or favors the census. At the heart of the adjustment mechanism, there is a large sample survey—the post <b>enumeration</b> <b>survey.</b> The size of the survey cannot be justified.

In this talk we illustrate the usefulness of taking such an "integrating" approach when tackling a complex statistical problem. The problem itself is easily described - it is how to approximate, as closely as possible, a "perfect census", and in particular, how to obtain census counts that are "free" of underenumeration. Typically, underenumeration is estimated by carrying out a post <b>enumeration</b> <b>survey</b> (PES) following the census. In the UK in 1991 the PEF failed to identify the full size of the underenumeration and so demographic methods were used to estimate {{the extent of the}} undercount. The problems with the "traditional" PES approach in 1991 resulted in a joint research project between the Office for National Statistics and the Department of Social Statistics at the University of Southampton aimed at developing a methodology which will allow a "One Number Census" in the UK in 2001. That is, underenumeration will be accounted for not just at high levels of aggregation, but right down to the lowest levels at which census tabulations are produced. In this way all census outputs will be internally consistent, adding to the national population estimates. The basis of this methodology is the integration of information from a number of data sources in order to achieve this "One Number"...|$|E

This paper describes a new measure of QoL in older age, the Older People's QoL Questionnaire (OPQOL), which is unique in being derived from the views of lay people, cross-checked against theoretical models for assessment of comprehensiveness. Its performance was assessed cross-sectionally and longitudinally. It was compared with two existing QoL measures in the cross-sectional studies {{in order to identify}} the optimal measure for use with older populations. Methods: Analyses of the performance of the OPQOL were based on three surveys of older people living at home in Britain in 2007 - 8 : one population survey of people aged 65 +; one focused <b>enumeration</b> <b>survey</b> of ethnically diverse older people aged 65 +; one follow-up of a population survey of people aged 65 + at baseline in 1999 / 2000. Measures: QoL (OPQOL, CASP- 19, WHOQOL-OLD), health, social and socio-economic circumstances. The CASP- 19 and WHOQOL-OLD were not administered to the longitudinal sample in order to reduce respondent burden. Results: Psychometric tests were applied to each QoL measure. The OPQOL, CASP- 19 and WHOQOL-OLD performed well with the cross-sectional samples. Only the OPQOL met criteria for internal consistency in the Ethnibus samples. Conclusion: The OPQOL is of potential value in the outcome assessment of health and social interventions which can have a multidimensional impact on people's lives.

Responses underwent a narrative synthesis and descriptive <b>enumerations.</b> RESULTS: The <b>survey</b> was completed by 88 individuals, unevenly distributed in 22 of 31 countries. Physicians were mandated to report child maltreatment in 16 of 22 countries. All of 88 responding physicians described multidisciplinary involvement in the clinical and forensic management of suspected child maltreatment. Practitioners involved in physical examinations included general physicians, paediatricians, forensic medical examiners, gynaecologists and paediatric surgeons. Paediatricians were required to undergo child protection training according to 30 of 86 respondents in 14 of 22 countries. CONCLUSION: This survey demonstrates that there were wide variations in the organisation of child maltreatment paediatrics in Europe. The differing legislative frameworks and models of care are pertinent to consider when comparing epidemiology of maltreatment reported from across European countries...|$|R
40|$|Context: Despite a {{high number}} of {{unwanted}} pregnancies in Kenya, contraceptive use among adolescents is very low. Establishing the nature of sexuality discussions is critical to determine perceptions and barriers affecting contraceptive use among adolescents. Methods: The study used systematic random sampling to collect data to examine sexuality information and knowledge that affect perception and barriers on contra-ceptive use among 1119 adolescents aged 15 - 19 years in Nairobi. The survey was conducted using the 2009 Kenya Demographic and Health <b>Survey</b> <b>enumeration</b> areas and projections based on the 1999 population census. Data were collected using structured interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) among adolescents, parents and teachers. Quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software while qualitative information was analyzed using iT Atlas. Results: Although teachers were identified as a primary source of sexuality information, they were poorly prepared to teach the subject. While the study found negative perceptions on sexuality education, most FGDs and IDIs supported the need for its integration in the school curriculum. Most adolescents who used con- traceptives had perceptions that their parents approved. Source of sexuality information, living arrangement and perceptions on contraceptives for unmarried adolescents were statistically associated with contraceptive use. Conclusion: The study showed that sexuality information from parents and teachers was biased against adolescents using contraceptives. There is need to address attitudes in discussing contraceptive use for adolescents by parents and teachers to enhance positive perceptions and increase contraceptive use by adolescents. </p...|$|R
