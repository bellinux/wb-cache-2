500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And <b>I</b> <b>swallowed</b> my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
