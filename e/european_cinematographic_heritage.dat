25|$|This impasse {{resulted}} in the Yaoundé Declaration of November 9, 2016 through which African Photography Initiatives and other subscribers intended to generate {{a greater understanding of}} the value of photographs and films and analogue as well as digital archives for the studies in historic, human and social sciences. The declaration calls on the government and other stakeholders in Cameroon to make every effort in order to protect and make accessible for public use the country’s photographic and <b>cinematographic</b> <b>heritage.</b> As a first step, the Yaoundé Declaration recommends the recognition of the CPPA-B and the National Photo Library Yaoundé as cultural property as intended in the law on Cultural Heritage in Cameroon from 18 April 2013.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to address the {{different}} production strategies and formal solutions proposed by two European films by German-Turkish directors, Auf der anderen Seite (The Edge of Heaven, Fatih Akin, 2007), and Almanya: Willkommen in Deutschland (Almanya: Welcome to Germany, Yasemin and Nesrin Samdereli, 2011). The article will analyze {{the role of the}} spatial configurations and the temporal fragmentations in the representation of cultural conflicts and problematic identities. Both narratives address migration and border crossing issues, exploring the contemporary relations between (neutral) Germany and (exotic) Turkey. However, the approaches of the two films to these issues are very different, also because of the context of production and distribution. The analysis of these films will therefore be conducted in relation to the <b>European</b> <b>cinematographic</b> market, spatial-temporal configurations, and border thinking. It will be shown how European cinema responds to deep changes on imaginary, economic, and social levels, representing geopolitical mutations through narrative, formal, and productive choices...|$|R
50|$|The {{criteria}} whereby a film {{qualifies as}} European {{are based upon}} the <b>European</b> Convention on <b>Cinematographic</b> Co-production, Appendix II, issued by the Council of Europe. This definition might be extended for Israeli and Palestinian works and nationalities.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 she {{was awarded}} the Feodor-Lynen Research Grant of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation to conduct {{research}} on early cinema in Russia where she benefitted from the guidance of her Moscow mentor, Naum Kleiman.https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/pls/web/pub_hn_query.humboldtianer_details?p_externe_id=7000184755&p_lang=de&p_pattern=drubek Her next project {{grew out of a}} cooperation with the NIIK, the Research Institute of Film Art in Degtiarnyi pereulok, Moscow. It was a Marie Curie Fellowship at the Film School FAMU in Prague with the project: [...] "Hypertextual Film Presentation. Digital Editions for the <b>European</b> <b>Cinematographic</b> Heritage" [...] (2006-2008). With film historian Nikolai Izvolov, head of film history at NIIK, Natascha Drubek co-authored the method Hyperkino. Hyperkino is a standardized system of annotating films on digital carriers - attaching related content and analysis to individual frames. The pilot DVD of Alexander Hackenschmied`s Aimless Walk (1930) - finished in 2008 - was never published. A version of Drubek’s annotations appeared in the journal Bohemia. In 2012, in cooperation with Izvolov, Drubek published the Hyperkino the ibook “Happiness” (on Aleksandr Medvedkin’s 1934 film Happiness), the first scholarly filmbook with moving images.https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/happiness/id574212198?mt=11 Drubek served as a member of film festival juries at Docaviv (2016) and Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (2012, 2014).|$|R
40|$|Historic film genre serves {{here as a}} model {{example of}} a {{demanding}} film project in contemporary European cinematography. We want to explore the problems of development and financing of historic films. The basis of the research {{is the idea that}} historic films are mostly producer projects because of their commercial potential. The genre of historic film is explained here from two different points of view: Film theory and film history. The concept of <b>European</b> <b>cinematographic</b> work and the ways of financing European co-production films are shortly presented. Further we describe what a producer follows and influences during his work on a historic film. The gained knowledge is then applied on five case studies. Reflections of the film producers form a part of these studies. The result of the research is the statement that the quality and artistic value of a film go across the film genres just as the producer's or the director's approach to a film project do. To shoot arthouse oriented historic films is more risky from the commercial point of view. At the same time only in this way the film will be unique, can survive for decades and can really be successful all over the world...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} receive Eurimages support, a project {{has to be a}} European Film, a {{characteristic}} defined in the <b>European</b> Convention of <b>Cinematographic</b> Coproduction and in Eurimages' Regulations. Eurimages provides a conditionally reimbursable interest-free loan. The maximum amount that can be allocated to a project is €700.000. The loan is reimbursed from the first € of each co-producer’s net receipts - at the rate of the percentage of Eurimages support.|$|R
50|$|An {{increase}} in the number of countries with which Australia has co-production agreements may also encourage greater levels of co-production. Australia recently entered into agreements with China and Singapore, increasing the number of agreements to 11. Further, Australia has signed agreements with a number of European countries which are parties to the <b>European</b> Convention on <b>Cinematographic</b> Co-production. Indirectly, this convention may provide further opportunities for collaboration with other European Union countries.|$|R
40|$|Just at a {{time when}} Spanish cinema is getting closer to Hollywood than ever – this year’s Goya winners Celda 211 and Agora {{illustrate}} how a Hollywood blockbuster can be made in Europe – revisiting the cinema of J. A. Bardem would certainly remind us that the practise of imitating Hollywood –whether in terms of genre and narrative conventions, the use of specific technical devices and tricks, or even the importance given to the star-system – is not only unique to post-modern European narratives. In the 1950 s, Bardem’ s early films were directly influenced by narratives and themes found in previous European (Neo-) realist films, and impregnated with a clear flare for Hollywood’s spectacular generic conventions and technicalities. The ‘organised’ hotchpotch derived from that practise resulted in a cinema of difficult classification. It is perhaps that spectacularisation of the storytelling via the different elements of the mise-en-scéne what best defines Hollywood cinema, in contrast with the sincerity, proximity, and ‘anti-artificiality’ sought in European storytelling and filmmaking. However, when these two modes blend, we are faced with an inter-cultural hybrid cinema which hardly belongs to neither of the cinemas that created it. Esa Pareja Feliz/That Happy couple (1951), Muerte de un ciclista/Death of a cyclist (1955), Calle Mayor/Main Street (1956), La venganza/Revenge (1957) are perfect examples of a cinema that harmonised elements inherent to opposed national cinemas such as Spanish, Italian, French and American. This paper will examine the process of hybridisation and the elements that take part in it {{in order to make a}} new Spanish cinema that seemed everything but Spanish: a mode of representing reality with a finger in Hollywood and another in <b>European</b> <b>cinematographic</b> experiences. This process of hybridisation leads us to concepts of pastiche, adaptation, alien influences, cross-cultural dialogues, appropriation of style, and identity...|$|R
