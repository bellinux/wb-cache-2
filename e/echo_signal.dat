Discriminating between acoustic echoes from linear scatterers, such as tissue, and nonlinear scatterers, such as contrast microbubbles, based on their frequency content {{is also an important}} topic in ultrasound contrast imaging.

In contrast to existing nonparametric discrete-Fourier-transform- (DFT-) based spectral estimation techniques used in the ultrasonic literature, this method is able to estimate the number of spectral components as well as their amplitudes and frequencies.
