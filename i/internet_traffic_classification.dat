Recent researches on <b>Internet</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>classifications</b> have developed several methods for identifying types of application, which have advantages in certain types of network traffic.

40|$|Abstract — In {{recent times}} machine {{learning}} algorithms are used for <b>internet</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>classification.</b> The infinite number of websites in the internet world can be classified into different categories in different ways. In educational institutions, these websites can be classified into two categories, educational websites and non-educational websites. Educational websites are used to acquire knowledge, to explore educational topics while the non-educational websites are used for entertainment and {{to keep in touch}} with people. In case of blocking these non-educational websites students use proxy websites to unblock them. Therefore, in educational institutes for the optimum use of network resources the use of non-educational and proxy websites should be banned. In this paper, we use five ML classifiers Naïve Bayes, RBF, C 4. 5, MLP and Bayes Net to classify the educational and non-educational websites. Results show that Bayes Net gives best performance in both full feature and reduced feature data sets for intended classification of internet traffic in terms of classification accuracy, recall and precision values as compared to other classifiers.

40|$|Abstract—The need {{to quickly}} and {{accurately}} classify <b>Internet</b> <b>traffic</b> for security and QoS control {{has been increasing}} significantly with the growing <b>Internet</b> <b>traffic</b> and applications over the past decade. Pattern recognition by learning the features in the training samples to classify the unknown flows {{is one of the}} main methods. However, many methods developed in the previous works are too complicated to be applied in real-time, and the prior probabilities based on the training samples are severely biased. This paper uses the SVM (Support Vector Machine) method to train 7 classes of applications of different characteristics, captured from a campus network backbone. A discriminator selection algorithm is developed to obtain the best combination of the features for classification. Our optimized method yields approximately 96. 9 % accuracy for un-biased training and testing samples. For regular biased samples, the accuracy is about 99. 4 %.

30|$|Flow-based {{analysis}} {{has been the}} de facto standard for <b>Internet</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>classification</b> and has yielded great success in the past [29],[30]. Typically, ‘flows’ are constructed based on the 5 -tuple: <Src. IP, Dest. IP, Src. port, Dest. port, Proto><Src. IP, Dest. IP, Src. port, Dest. port, Proto> (where ‘Src.’ stands for ‘source’, ‘Dest.’ stands for ‘destination’, and ‘Proto’ implies the transport layer protocol (TCP or UDP)). The direction of the flow {{is determined by the}} direction in which the first packet is seen. An important difference between flows of P 2 P applications and traditional client-server applications is that P 2 P traffic is inherently bi-directional in nature. This differentiating factor has been leveraged by some recent works [24],[25] as well.|$|E

We also present a preprocessor for our classifiers that predicts, after the reception of {{only a small number}} of packets, whether a flow will be ‘large ’ (as defined by a network operator).

30|$|Traditionally, <b>Internet</b> <b>traffic</b> {{has been}} {{classified}} using port numbers, payload and host-based techniques. Port-based techniques are unreliable and antiquated, {{largely due to}} the use of dynamic port negotiation, tunneling and misuse of port numbers assigned to well-known applications for obfuscating traffic and avoiding firewalls [54, 109, 176, 286]. In contrast, payload-based techniques are designed to inspect application payload. Though, they are computationally intensive and complicated due to encryption, supervised and unsupervised ML has been successfully applied for <b>traffic</b> <b>classification</b> with high accuracy. Generally, unencrypted handshake payload is used for <b>traffic</b> <b>classification,</b> which is infeasible for high data rate links. On the other hand, long-lived UDP traffic lends itself to supervised payload-based <b>traffic</b> <b>classification,</b> where payload is inspected randomly in an observation window [146].

Similarly, host-based <b>traffic</b> <b>classification</b> is highly susceptible to routing asymmetries.|$|R

Network <b>Traffic</b> <b>Classification</b> is the process of analysing the nature of the traffic flows on the networks, and classifies these flows mainly on the basis of protocols (e. g.

Network <b>Traffic</b> <b>Classification</b> has the capability to address fundamentals to numerous network management activities for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their equipment vendors for better Quality of Service (QoS) treatment.

It is essential that network operators understand the trends in their networks so that they can react quickly to support their business goals. <b>Traffic</b> <b>classification</b> can also be a part of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) where the main goal of such systems is to detect a wide range of unusual or anomalous events, and to block unwanted traffic. In this thesis, we have investigated several key issues related to the problem of accurate and effective network <b>traffic</b> <b>classification.</b> We were particularly motivated by the specific problems associated with network <b>traffic</b> <b>classification</b> based on machine learning and Transport Layer Statistics (TLS).

Significant recent research has revealed that TLS data allows the machine learning classification-based techniques to rely on sufficient information. In light of these findings, we focused our efforts on the modelling and improvement of network <b>traffic</b> <b>classification</b> based on the concept of machine learning and TLS data. This thesis is concerned with improving the accuracy and the efficiency of network <b>traffic</b> <b>classification.</b> Four research issues are being addressed to achieve the main aim of this thesis. The first research task is to optimize various feature selection techniques for improving the quality of the Transport Layer Statistics (TLS) data. The second research is intended to identify the optimal and stable feature set in the temporal-domain and the spatial-domain networks. The third research task is related to the development of preserving the privacy framework to help network collaborators in the spatial-domain network to publish their traffic data and making them publicly available. The final research task is related to automatically provide sufficient labelled traffic flows for constructing a <b>traffic</b> <b>classification</b> model with good generalization ability, and to evaluate the generated <b>traffic</b> <b>classification...</b>|$|R
