40|$|Abstract. The {{resurgence}} and {{visibility of}} homeiessness since the 1980 s have become significant {{social and political}} issues, widely debated in academic circles and in the popular press. The composition of tho homeless population has changed markedly in this period, and now includes more women and children, {{and more of the}} dcinstitutionalised mentally ill. The lives of street kids in the city of Newcastle, Australia show patterns of structured behaviour and territorial and social organisation. They have a distinctive group identity and moral order. Tlicir subculture is complex with strains of nonpatriarchal and patriarchal relations combined with little tolerance of forms of difference. The mora! code of the youth subculture may be a form of resistance to their histories of abuse but is also conservative in reproducing aspects of the culture that they resist. The social networks generated on the street provide a self-maintaining force which contri-butes to a culture of chronic homelcssness. Homelessness in Australia Homeiessness is a growing political and social issue in Australia {{as it is in the}} USA, the United Kingdom, and many parts of continental Europe. The factors which encourage homeiessness are occurring simultaneously in many late-capitalist societies. Most significantly, these economies have undergone a marked ideological shift to the New Right, which emphasises the primacy of market forces. Australia's economy, highly subject to external influences, has been severely affected by the impact of <b>global</b> <b>economic</b> restructuring, <b>deregulation,</b> and microeconomic reform (Australia...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The ideological {{foundations}} of traditional U. S. trade unionism {{have been called}} into question by world and domestic events. The post-World War II labor movement, founded on a social truce with capital and the apparent inevitability of a rising living standard, has hit a bulkhead-piercing iceberg of dramatic proportions. The <b>global</b> economy, <b>economic</b> restructuring, <b>deregulation,</b> and privatization have wrought destruction on U. S. unions. In the wake of this devastation, it has become common, even for union leaders, to define unionism in objectively negative terms (e. g., without a union, you have no protection from arbitrary management). As a movement, we have offered {{little in the way}} of a comprehensive explanation of what we stand for. The upheaval has forced new questions and problems to the surface and has set the stage for an internal debate about the future. The dialogue has included little that is fundamentally new. There have always been disagreements over labor strategy and tactics, the relationship of unions to capital, and the appropriate form of organization for the labor movement. This debate has taken on new urgency since the mid- 1980 s, however, and has concentrated on whether there is a viable alternative to the prevailing form of business unionism, which appears to be leading workers nowhere...|$|R

40|$|Latham, William R. IIIBowers, Helen M. I exploit American <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> in the entertainment, {{petroleum}} {{and natural}} gas, utilities, telecommunications and transportation industries {{to examine how}} the innovation activities of firms in these five industries changed following deregulation. By using a difference-in-differences method and using number of patents filed by firms through 1967 - 2004 {{as a proxy for}} innovation behavior, I find evidence that, in aggregate, following deregulation, the number of patents filed by firms in the five deregulated industries examined decline from 13. 3 % to 17. 3 % in the subsequent one to five years after deregulation. Deregulation solely led to a 19. 4 % decline in innovation behavior, while the net increasing competition decreased innovation by 4. 5 %. Therefore, the results of this paper enrich current economic and corporate finance literatures by providing evidence of the effects of <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> and show that <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> has a negative effect on innovation activities of firms in the five deregulated industries. A further industry-by-industry analysis finds that, following deregulation, the innovation activity pattern of the petroleum and natural gas industries is different from the activity pattern of other four industries.

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} corporate dividend policy {{in response to the}} changing operating environment induced by <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> from the 1970 s- 1990 s. Specifically, I examine the impact of deregulation on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s propensity to pay dividends, dividend payout ratio, the sensitivity of corporate dividend policy to current and past earnings, changes in the information content of dividends, and changes in corporate financing behavior along the deregulation process. Empirical results reveal that <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> per se does not have significant impacts on firms 2 ̆ 7 propensity to pay dividends. However, it seems that firms reduce dividend payout along the deregulation process and adjust their payout ratio closer to that of non-regulated firms. I also find that deregulated firms 2 ̆ 7 dividend policy becomes more sensitive to past and current earnings following deregulation. In addition, deregulated firms become more active in external financing activities in the new operating environment, which subjects them to more frequent and closer monitoring of financial markets. The findings are in general consistent with predictions of the agency theory of dividends. However, the empirical results fail to provide support to hypotheses based on the information content theory and the clientele theory of dividends in the setting of <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{frequently}} claimed that {{high levels of}} generalised trust are conducive for economic reforms. In contrast, the "traditional view" on institutional and political constraints on the executive (IPCE) postulates that high IPCE tend to paralyse the decision-making process, thus blocking required policy changes. By stressing credibility issues of economic reforms and transaction cost for special interest groups, a more positive view however sees IPCE as potentially conducive to reforms. This paper empirically explores {{the significance of these}} claims for the case of <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation.</b> In particular, it elaborates on the hypotheses that IPCE do not impact on economic reforms in an environment of high generalised trust and that the positive impact of trust increases with the extent of IPCE. The results provide evidence in favour of the traditional view on IPCE. However, it is also shown that IPCE are an obstacle for economic policy liberalisation only in relatively low trusting environments. In contrast, a robust positive correlation of generalised trust with the extent of <b>economic</b> <b>deregulation</b> is isolated, and trust unfolds a particular strength with increasing levels of IPCE...|$|R
