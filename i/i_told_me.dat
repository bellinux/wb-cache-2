6000|$|... "The Catholic Church? what Church else?" [...] {{said the}} young lady. [...] "But <b>I</b> forgot--they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{you are a}} heretic. Is that true, Mr. Osbaldistone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} get poor Harry into a scrape, shall <b>I?</b> He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that you said}} so, last spring, and I feared you judged me too truly." ...|$|R
60|$|My father, <b>I</b> say, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he {{was more}} pestered with the clamours of these people than of those who were truly refugees, and fled in {{distress}} merely for conscience.|$|R
6000|$|They both {{stopped and}} looked at me. 'On the very day when I last saw him,' said <b>I,</b> 'he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he had, and that his affairs were long since settled.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. MEGAN. [With faint eagerness.] Yes, sir, an' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{you about}} <b>me</b> vi'lets--it was a luvly spring-day.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. Oh, well, we must {{go forward}} there. <b>I</b> thought you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{yesterday}} the firm's balance was over four hundred.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{dare say}} not, Mr Melmotte. When I'm {{at home in}} San Francisco, I make {{acquaintance}} with a great many gents whom I don't remember afterwards. My partner <b>I</b> think <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that he went to}} your house with his friend, Sir Felix Carbury.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never could}} have {{imagined}} it! Never! Even <b>I,</b> when mother <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> thought I should have fainted, and ALL would have been revealed!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The young officer's {{eyes opened}} wide. [...] "Ah! <b>I</b> see. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{at the time}} that they were friends of the Secretary. That {{explains}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must apologize," [...] the {{newcomer}} said, [...] "for my intrusion. Your housekeeper, I presume it was, whom <b>I</b> saw below, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to come up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> {{thought you}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> awhile ago {{that as soon}} as a husband could afford it he {{relieved}} his wife and daughters from all household work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I thought," [...] said she, [...] "that {{they were}} going to put the Number One road company under your charge. <b>I</b> thought you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’Ow much?" [...] ses the conjurer, with a start. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> wish you’d <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that afore you lent it to me. Eighteenpence is my price." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] Deane answered, with {{a little}} bow. [...] "But <b>I</b> thought you <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> Miss Sinclair, that you were {{probably}} leaving us before long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ow much?" [...] ses the conjurer, with a start. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> wish you'd <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that afore you lent it to me. Eighteenpence is my price." ...|$|R
6000|$|Violet Wayne nodded gravely. “Still, Godfrey Palliser {{sent you}} {{to school with}} Tony. You were always good friends, though <b>I</b> think he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you were born abroad?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Alethea, laughing, 'your {{compliment}} rather surprises me, for <b>I</b> {{thought you}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that your brother Claude {{was on the}} duty side of the question.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “He was startled. And so was <b>I</b> {{after he}} <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> It’s a search party. They are {{out looking for}} a man. Willie’s soft heart’s enlisted in the cause.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Erin Gruwell is {{the woman}} who began the Freedom Writers and {{compiled}} her students’ stories into The Freedom Writers Diary. She started teaching {{in the fall of}} 1994 at Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, California. In interviews, she has said that she thinks she is the one who changed the most. “Everything <b>I</b> was <b>told</b> not to do, <b>I</b> did. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not to smile. <b>I</b> smiled. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> never to show emotion. How could I not be a person, though? How could I not be compassionate and give a student a hug when they were hurting? I changed the most. I became the student.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been doing? <b>I</b> thought you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that you had quite {{finished}} the two pictures, the day you came to say good-bye before you started for Brussels." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Arthur,' says <b>I,</b> 'you never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you'd {{had another}} love-affair. But Mrs. Gurley did,' I went on, {{to let him}} know I knew. I hate to hear a man lie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you? Really, <b>I</b> forget; you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> such {{a lot of}} things, Doctor," [...] he {{answered}} coolly enough, only unfortunately the colour that rose in his cheeks betrayed his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] said Jimmy, {{who looked}} at him with sudden sympathy. [...] "Still, <b>I</b> fancied you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you had no near relatives. What are you wearing those clothes for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jim, thoughtfully. [...] "I've {{never left}} Canada, {{but a man}} I knew {{used to talk about}} Langrigg. <b>I</b> expect he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about these things; he is dead now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--I suppose--I don't know--yes, of course, I do! What {{a stupid}} ass <b>I</b> am. Luke <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{himself that he}} was going to see his uncle at the Something Club in Shaftesbury Avenue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O--h!" [...] drawled out Miss Gusset {{with a very}} {{significant}} tone. [...] "I suppose {{she is one of}} your playing-up ladies. <b>I</b> think you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> she was only on a visit here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I will go, if necessary," [...] {{answered}} Morris. [...] "But <b>I</b> {{thought you}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{a few months}} ago that it was quite impossible to execute those alterations, on account of the expense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” said Harding {{a trifle}} dryly, “I don’t quite know. <b>I</b> think Nettie <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{there was a}} warrant out for you, and I believe it’s quite {{difficult}} to get round the police in your country.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am rather," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "In fact, {{a jeweler}} <b>I</b> once knew <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> had a natural gift in that direction. And so, of course, Sir Thomas was pretty {{grateful}} to your father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor dear! {{she cried}} heartily at first; {{but after a}} time she cheered up, and quite made friends with <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> which were Mr. Morville's favourite songs, and sang little scraps of them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That nice old gentleman over there, now," [...] he said, [...] "you wouldn't {{think that}} was a case of almost starvation. Proud old family, <b>I</b> guess. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he hadn't eaten a thing for three days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Whew!' De Forest whistled. 'I did {{not know}} that! <b>I</b> wish you'd <b>told</b> <b>me</b> before. MacDonough's Song may have had its uses when it was composed, {{but it was an}} infernal legacy for any man to leave behind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Lord Henry. [...] "I fancy {{that the}} boy will be well off. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, <b>I</b> know. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so. And... his mother was very beautiful?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. But you see nearly {{everybody}} {{again that}} you meet in your travels. That friend of his--that Mr. Gregory--he {{seems to have}} dropped out, too. <b>I</b> believe you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you used to know him in America." ...|$|R
6000|$|A mutual {{acquaintance}} whom <b>I</b> subsequently met <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that at the}} top of the Jungfrau he {{had said}} to him, his eyes fixed the while upon a small snow plateau enclosed by precipices a few hundred feet below them-- ...|$|R
