40|$|The {{continuing}} {{growth of}} digital {{technology has been}} accompanied by an explosion in digital data generation. This data is processed, stored, managed and exchanged in data centres, which have become the <b>driving</b> <b>hub</b> of the economy and in some ways of society. This article outlines the origins and characteristics of data centres and offers an exploratory discussion of their locational dynamics and their changing geography within the UK. The findings reveal that while data centres were initially concentrated in London, a range of new urban, suburban and remote rural locations are becoming increasingly important. That said, while the geography of data centres may be changing the need to design ever more sustainable centres, which increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, seems likely to remain constant...|$|E
40|$|A {{peristaltic}} pump is disclosed {{which includes a}} roller assembly on which is mounted a series of pump rollers. As the roller assembly is rotated by a drive gear the pump rollers are driven in reverse rotation {{by means of a}} stationary ring gear and pump roller gears. An upper pressure shoe plate and a lower pressure shoe plate are positioned above sets of flexible tubing. The tubing is sandwiched between the pressure shoe plates and the pump rollers. A highly compact pump is provided having twice as many fluid channel lines as is conventional. The {{peristaltic pump}} device may be remotely operated by means of a rotary actuator which rotates a <b>driving</b> <b>hub</b> to move the shoe plates by means of eccentrically mounted links. The pressure shoe plates may be moved by the rotary actuator to a loaded position in which the fluid lines are pinched by the pump rollers and fluid is pumped to an unloaded position in which the fluid lines are maintained in an undeformed, uncrimped configuration so that no creases or crimps are set into the fluid lines during periods of prolonged nonuse...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{growth of}} digital {{technology has been}} accompanied by an explosion in digital data generation. These data are processed, stored, managed and exchanged in data centres but there is limited general awareness appreciation of the role such centres play as the <b>driving</b> <b>hub</b> of the economy. With this in mind, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to provide a simple review of the data centre property market and the changing geography of such centres and to review a number of the environmental and planning issues associated with the development of new data centres. Design/methodology/approach – The paper begins with a description of the characteristics and origins of data centres, outlines the data centre property market and the changing geography of new purpose built data centres within the UK and discusses a range of the environmental and planning issues associated with the development of such centres. Findings – The paper reveals that four different types of data centre can be recognised, that relationship between supply and demand within the data centre property market is a contested issue and that the geography of new data centre development is changing. Data centre developers are increasingly looking for designs that increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide and the planning issues associated with such developments include classifying the use class, environmental and design considerations and employment generation. Research limitations/implications – The paper provides an accessible review of the development of data centres in the UK and as such it will be of interest to those working in, engaging with, and studying the data centre market. Originality/value – The paper provides an accessible review of the development of data centres in the UK and as such it will be of interest to those working in, engaging with, and studying data centres...|$|E
50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with locking hubs. A CAD system spins the axle shafts, spider gears, and side gears in the carrier during normal <b>driving.</b> Locking <b>hubs</b> disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as locking hubs, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{increasing}} {{attention has}} been focused on the investigation of the human brain connectome that describes the patterns of structural and functional connectivity networks of the human brain. Many studies of the human connectome have demonstrated that the brain network follows a small-world topology with an intrinsically cohesive modular structure and includes several network hubs in the medial parietal regions. However, most of these studies have only focused on undirected connections between regions in which the directions of information flow are not taken into account. How the brain regions causally influence each other and how the directed network of human brain is topologically organized remain largely unknown. Here, we applied linear multivariate Granger causality analysis (GCA) and graph theoretical approaches to a resting-state functional MRI dataset with a large cohort of young healthy participants (n = 86) to explore connectivity patterns of the population-based whole-brain functional directed network. This directed brain network exhibited prominent small-world properties, which obviously improved previous results of functional MRI studies showing weak small-world properties in the directed brain networks in terms of a kernel-based GCA and individual analysis. This brain network also showed significant modular structures associated with 5 well known subsystems: fronto-parietal, visual, paralimbic/limbic, subcortical and primary systems. Importantly, we identified several <b>driving</b> <b>hubs</b> predominantly located in the components of the attentional network (e. g., the inferior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, insula and fusiform gyrus) and severa...|$|R
40|$|Adult {{stem cells}} have the unique ability to either self-renew or differentiate, thus giving them {{tremendous}} therapeutic potential. These tissue-specific {{stem cells are}} directed to self-renew by signals from the local microenvironment termed the stem cell niche. While reconstitution assays have demonstrated the existence of stem cell niches in many adult organs, unambiguous identification of the resident stem cells and their niche cells {{continues to be a}} challenge. Accordingly, the mechanisms that direct specification and formation of a stem cell niche in vivo remain unclear. The Drosophila testis has emerged as a powerful system in which to study stem cell-niche interactions. The niche cells, called hub cells, form a small aggregate at the apical tip of the testis. Hub cells promote attachment and self-renewal in the germline stem cells and cyst stem cells, which are organized in a radial array around the hub. The signaling pathways that direct the maintenance and differentiation of these lineages have been well characterized; however, the initial specification and organization of the niche is still being elucidated. It was previously shown that Notch activation in a subset of somatic gonadal precursors specifies them as hub cells in the embryonic gonad. Here we use genetic analysis to show that Notch signaling activates a branched pathway for hub cell differentiation. Along one arm of the pathway, the Maf factor Traffic jam is downregulated to allow for niche signaling and adhesion. Along a separate arm, the transcription factor Bowl, promotes the assembly of hub cells at the anterior of the gonad where they recruit and organize stem cells. We also use live imaging to reveal two phases of niche morphogenesis; 1) a sorting and guidance phase in which hub cells are directed to the anterior by an extra-gonadal cue and 2) a compaction phase characterized by the formation of an acto-myosin cable around the compacting hub concomitant with the onset of oriented GSC divisions. These observations suggest a model in which the germ cells shape their own niche by <b>driving</b> <b>hub</b> compaction. These findings greatly advance our understanding of how a stem cell niche develops within a tissue. ...|$|E
50|$|When such a hub is pedaled forwards, the {{sprocket}} {{drives a}} screw which forces a clutch to move along the axle, <b>driving</b> the <b>hub</b> shell or gear assembly. When pedaling is reversed, the screw drives the clutch {{in the opposite}} direction, forcing it either between two brake shoes and pressing them against the brake mantle (which is a steel liner within the hub shell), or into a split collar and expanding it against the mantle. The braking surface is often steel, and the braking element brass or phosphor-bronze, as in the Birmingham-made Perry Coaster Hub. Crude coaster brakes also exist, usually on children's bicycles, where a serrated steel brake cone grips {{the inside of the}} hub shell directly, with no separate brake pads or mantle. These offer a less progressive action {{and are more likely to}} lock the rear wheel unintentionally.|$|R
50|$|The adapter is mechanical, {{although}} early examples were motorized, with a battery. It has {{an internal}} hub {{to engage with}} the VCR mechanism in {{the location of a}} normal full-size tape <b>hub,</b> <b>driving</b> the gearing on the VHS-C cassette. Also, when a VHS-C cassette is inserted into the adapter, a small swing-arm pulls the tape out of the miniature cassette to span the standard tape path distance between the guide rollers of a full-size tape. This allows the tape from the miniature cassette to use the same loading mechanism as that from the standard cassette.|$|R
40|$|The {{industrialization}} of {{new energy}} vehicles {{is an important}} way to promote the sustainable development of automobile industry, {{and it is also}} the key measure to solve the problems of energy and environment. As an important type of new energy vehicles, electric vehicles will {{play an important role in}} the future competition in the automotive industry, especially in the field of electric vehicle driven by wheel. With the advantages of compact structure, high power density, low working noise and good heat dissipation performance, the AFPM motor has gradually become the preferred object of the <b>hub</b> <b>driving</b> device. Based on the statement of the technical development and research status about AFPM motor, this paper mainly analyzes the engineering application and technical problems of AFPM motor in hub drive, especially the matching of AFPM motor with other systems and the problem of heat dissipation at high load conditions, and looks forward to the key role in the future development of the automotive industry. This paper will play a certain reference and guiding role in the application of AFPM motor in the field of new energy vehicles...|$|R
50|$|Current {{vehicle bodies}} are {{designed}} around the mechanicals of existing engine/transmission setups. It is restrictive {{and far from}} ideal to install petro-hydraulic mechanicals into existing bodies not designed for hydraulic setups. One research project's {{goal is to create}} a blank paper design new car, to maximize the packaging of petro-hydraulic hybrid components in the vehicle. All bulky hydraulic components are integrated into the chassis of the car. One design has claimed to return 130 mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator which is also the structural chassis of the car. The small hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel <b>hubs</b> <b>driving</b> the wheels and reversing to claw-back kinetic braking energy. The hub motors eliminates the need for friction brakes, mechanical transmissions, drive shafts and U joints, reducing costs and weight. Hydrostatic drive with no friction brakes are used in industrial vehicles. The aim is 170 mpg in average driving conditions. Energy created by shock absorbers and kinetic braking energy that normally would be wasted assists in charging the accumulator. A small fossil fuelled piston engine sized for average power use charges the accumulator. The accumulator is sized at running the car for 15 minutes when fully charged. The aim is a fully charged accumulator which will produce a 0-60 mph acceleration speed of under 5 seconds using four wheel drive.|$|R
