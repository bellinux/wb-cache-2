Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating <b>ground</b> <b>clutter</b> (radar) returns.|$|E
5|$|The VPAF High Command {{immediately}} scrambled two {{flights of}} four MiG-17 fighters from the VPAF 923rd Fighter Regiment, {{followed by two}} MiG-21 fighters from the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment at 2:51pm. The MiG-21 force was led by Nguyen Nhat Chieu with Nguyen Van Coc, {{who had participated in}} the VPAF's disastrous mission during Operation Bolo, as the wingman. The first and second MiG-17 flights were commanded by Cao Thanh Tinh and Nguyen Van Tho respectively. Once airborne, North Vietnamese pilots maneuvered their aircraft into positions to deploy their new tactic which required the MiG-17 fighters to act as bait, while the MiG-21 fighters attacked from the rear. After Chieu and Coc had departed from Phuc Yen Air Base, they flew at low level and stayed in the <b>ground</b> <b>clutter</b> to avoid detection by airborne radars employed by U.S aircraft. However, the MiG-21’s transponders were detected by an orbiting EC-121 airborne early warning radar surveillance aircraft, and their positions were relayed to the F-4 fighters that were escorting the strike formation, but they did not respond.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{his usual}} tactic, the British crew {{approached}} {{from behind and}} below. Suddenly the Heinkel lurched into a tight left-hand turn allowing the gunners to fire a broad-side. The bomber disappeared into the mist. Cunningham asked GCI for help. They tracked the Heinkel flying north near Shaftesbury. Engaging again the German pilot managed {{to turn into a}} head-on position and dive past almost upside down. He continually evaded Cunningham by turning in underneath him at near-impossible angles. Cunningham and Rawnsley came to understand they were not dealing with a novice. Soon a turning match began and then the German attempted to escape by twisting and diving. Cunningham forced him down to 900 feet but Rawnsley and GCI lost contact when the <b>ground</b> <b>clutter</b> hid the Heinkel's signal. Cunningham returned to base. News soon came through the He 111 had crashed onto the slopes on Cranborne Chase. Apparently, the Heinkel had broken through the clouds at only a hundred feet and dived vertically into the ground near the isolated village of Alvediston at 17:05. Intelligence later determined that the machine was a He 111H-6, Werknummer 4627, code 6N+FR, from 7./KGr 100. The bomber disintegrated upon impact. The pilot, Staffelkapitän ("squadron leader") Hauptmann Siegried Langer was killed along with his crew; Oberfeldwebel G. Schmidt, Feldwebel D. Hoffmann, P. Gaidies and Gefreiter W. Worring. It was a unique victory for Cunningham. He had not fired his guns in the 150-minute chase.|$|E

500|$|In 1963, the USAF {{asked for}} {{proposals}} for an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) to replace its EC-121 Warning Stars, which {{had served in}} the airborne early warning role for over a decade. The new aircraft would take advantage of improvements in radar technology and in computer aided radar data analysis and data reduction. These developments allowed airborne radars to [...] "look down", detect the movement of low-flying aircraft (see Look-down/shoot-down), and discriminate, even over land, target aircraft's movements—previously this had been impossible, due to the inability to discriminate an aircraft's track from <b>ground</b> <b>clutter.</b> Contracts were issued to Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed, the latter being eliminated in July 1966. In 1967, a parallel program was put into place to develop the radar, with Westinghouse Electric and the Hughes Aircraft being asked to compete in producing the radar system. In 1968, it was referred to as Overland Radar Technology (ORT) during development tests on the modified EC-121Q. The Westinghouse radar antenna was going to be used by whichever company won the radar competition, since Westinghouse had pioneered in the design of high-power RF phase-shifters.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to quantify the}} ground penetrating radar rough <b>ground</b> surface <b>clutter</b> by numerical modeling of wave scattering, and establish a strategy to suppress the clutter for given test signals. The goal {{is to improve the}} GPR detection statistics for small, buried, low-contrast nonmetallic antipersonnel mines. Using a model of an experimentally measured impulse GPR signal, we simulate the ground surface and buried low-contrast mine target scattered re-sponses. We employ a 2 D finite difference time domain (FDTD) method to analyze the pulse shape, delay, and amplitude characteristics of the scattered waves—with and without buried nonmetallic mine targets—as a function of roughness parameters. Five hundred Monte Carlo simulations of various test cases of specified ground root mean square height and correlation length were run to generate statistics for the clutter and target signal variations. In addition, the effectiveness of identifying and removing the <b>ground</b> surface <b>clutter</b> signal for detecting subsurface targets is presented. Results indicate that even with moderate roughness, statistics can be generated to enhance the detection of small, shallow, low-contrast targets. Key Words.

2500|$|Although torpedo boats have {{disappeared}} from {{the majority of the}} world's navies, they remained in use until relatively recently in a few specialised areas, most notably in the Baltic. The close confines of the Baltic and <b>ground</b> <b>clutter</b> effectively negated the range benefits of early ASMs. Operating close to shore in conjunction with land based air cover and radars, {{and in the case of}} the Norwegian navy hidden bases cut into fjord sides, torpedo boats remained a cheap and viable deterrent to amphibious attack.

40|$|Considered is {{an attempt}} to render a {{conventional}} meteorological radar an ability of continuous vertical profiling of high temporal and spatial resolution. Two chief obstacles that keep a conventional radar from proper vertical profiling are pointed. First one is an antenna construction that causes essential power side lobes and thus <b>ground</b> <b>clutters</b> interference and expands first Fresnel zone beyond 1 km range. The second one is a peculiar amplitude response of the conventional radar's receiver tract that, on the one hand, enables the radar to process back scattered pulses from both remote and close targets, but on the other hand, causes a bias in estimation of average power values for the fine radar reflectivity analysis. Two inexpensive ways to overcome the obstacles are proposed. The adjusting procedure to make the reflectivity estimates unbiased is developed using statistical simulation procedures. Vertical pointing is substituted with scanning along the close vertical line with corresponding modification of data processing hardware and algorithms. Testing results of actual snowfall field observations showed that the profiling permits to analyze and correlate fine reflectivity details with precipitation particles structure. That suggests potential of conventional radar for applications to remote precipitation analysis both separately or combined with validation problems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{iterative}} Time-Reversal Mirror (TRM) {{method is}} proposed to Detect and Image the buried target beneath ground surface. Unlike the conventional TRM methods which treat the information of the <b>ground</b> as <b>clutters</b> and directly delete them, the iterative TRM imaging method proposed {{in this paper}} utilizes the information of rough ground surface as a useful knowledge. The new approach is consisted of two TRM procedures. In the first TRM procedure, it aims to image the rough surface where the propagation environment for electromagnetic wave is free space. The second TRM procedure aims to image the buried target. In this step, the information of the rough surface estimated by the first TRM procedure will be treated as newly updated propagation environment. Then conventional TRM is applied to image the buried target. By applying this iterative TRM method, the information of the rough ground can be well considered in the whole TRM procedure. Numerical simulations prove that this method performs significantly better image contrast comparing with the results obtained by using conventional TRM. 4 – 5 dB improvement on the imaging SNR has been achieved. Furthermore, the target can be located more accurately...|$|R
