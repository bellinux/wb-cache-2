5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that it was supernatural affairs and Paulinus' persuasion alone that caused Edwin to convert.

One story relates that during a stay with Edwin and Æthelburg at their palace in Yeavering, Paulinus spent 36days baptising new converts. Paulinus also was an active missionary in Lindsey, and his missionary activities help show the limits of Edwin's royal authority.|$|E
