500|$|Gumbo {{is cooked}} {{for a minimum}} of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned {{beforehand}} and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. [...] Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. [...] When these have turned to mush (more commonly called cooked down), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water and/or stock, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached. Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, and salt, are added to taste. [...] According to Nobles, [...] "proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art". Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot {{until the end of the}} process. [...] As the gumbo finishes cooking, <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, filé powder is added last.|$|E
