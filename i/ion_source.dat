25|$|Signal {{intensity}} may {{be dependent}} on many factors, especially {{the nature of the}} molecules being analyzed and how they ionize. The efficiency of ionization varies from molecule to molecule and from <b>ion</b> <b>source</b> to <b>ion</b> <b>source.</b> For example, in electrospray sources in positive ion mode a quaternary amine will ionize exceptionally well whereas a large hydrophobic alcohol will most likely not be seen no matter how concentrated. In an EI source these molecules will behave very differently. Additionally there may be factors that affect ion transmission disproportionally between ionization and detection.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ion</b> <b>source</b> is {{the part}} of the mass {{spectrometer}} that ionizes the material under analysis (the analyte). The ions are then transported by magnetic or electric fields to the mass analyzer.|$|E
25|$|Different {{types of}} <b>ion</b> <b>source</b> result in {{different}} arrays of fragments produced {{from the original}} molecules. An electron ionization source produces many fragments and mostly single-charged (1-) radicals (odd number of electrons), whereas an electrospray source usually produces non-radical quasimolecular ions that are frequently multiply charged.

25|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} (AP) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is an ionization technique (<b>ion</b> <b>source)</b> that {{in contrast}} to vacuum MALDI operates at normal atmospheric environment. The main difference between vacuum MALDI and AP-MALDI is the pressure in which the ions are created. In vacuum MALDI, ions are typically produced at 10 mTorr or less while in AP-MALDI ions are formed in atmospheric pressure. In the past the main disadvantage of AP MALDI technique compared to the conventional vacuum MALDI has been its limited sensitivity; however, ions can be transferred into the mass spectrometer with high efficiency and attomole detection limits have been reported. AP-MALDI is used in mass spectrometry (MS) {{in a variety of}} applications ranging from proteomics to drug discovery. Popular topics that are addressed by AP-MALDI mass spectrometry include: proteomics; mass analysis of DNA, RNA, PNA, lipids, oligosaccharides, phosphopeptides, bacteria, small molecules and synthetic polymers, similar applications as available also for vacuum MALDI instruments. The AP-MALDI <b>ion</b> <b>source</b> is easily coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer or any other MS system equipped with ESI (electrospray ionization) or nanoESI source.|$|E
25|$|Several {{techniques}} use ions {{created in}} a dedicated <b>ion</b> <b>source</b> injected into a flow tube or a drift tube: selected ion flow tube (SIFT-MS), and proton transfer reaction (PTR-MS), are variants of chemical ionization dedicated for trace gas analysis of air, breath or liquid headspace using well defined reaction time allowing calculations of analyte concentrations from the known reaction kinetics {{without the need}} for internal standard or calibration.|$|E
25|$|A common {{combination}} is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS or GC-MS). In this technique, a gas chromatograph {{is used to}} separate different compounds. This stream of separated compounds is fed online into the <b>ion</b> <b>source,</b> a metallic filament to which voltage is applied. This filament emits electrons which ionize the compounds. The ions can then further fragment, yielding predictable patterns. Intact ions and fragments pass into the mass spectrometer's analyzer and are eventually detected.|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of powerful, efficient gyrotron RF generators strongly suggests their use to drive {{electron cyclotron resonance}} (ECR) <b>ion</b> <b>sources.</b> The high frequency available from gyrotrons (e. g., 28 to 140 GHz) and corresponding ECR magnetic field strengths (1 to 5 tesla) should produce higher ion beam currents and higher charge states than observed from present ECR <b>ion</b> <b>sources</b> driven by klystrons (6 to 20 GHz). A program to investigate frequency and magnetic field scaling of ECR <b>ion</b> <b>sources</b> operating at gyrotron frequencies has been initiated as a collaboration between Spire Corporation and the MIT Plasma Fusion Center.

25|$|Similar to gas {{chromatography}} MS (GC/MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS or LC-MS) separates compounds chromatographically {{before they are}} introduced to the <b>ion</b> <b>source</b> and mass spectrometer. It differs from GC/MS in that the mobile phase is liquid, usually a mixture of water and organic solvents, instead of gas. Most commonly, an electrospray ionization source is used in LC/MS. Other popular and commercially available LC/MS ion sources are atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and atmospheric pressure photoionization. There are also some newly developed ionization techniques like laser spray.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring of {{detector}} response {{during this}} experiment should yield a constant signal {{appropriate to the}} concentration of infused species. Once the sample has been injected, a drop in signal intensity (or a negative response) should be observed any time a species is ionised in the <b>ion</b> <b>source.</b> This should allow the retention time of any such species under the analytical parameters of the assay to be determined. Any species causing a negative response may {{be considered to be}} contributing to ion suppression, but only if such species co-elute with the analyte of interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} to simple molecules (i.e. H2 for hydrogen) is required prior to IRMS measurement for stable isotopes.

50|$|Liquid metal <b>ion</b> <b>sources</b> (LMIS) {{based on}} field {{ionization}} or field evaporation {{were introduced in}} the late '60s and quickly became widespread as simple, cheap <b>ion</b> <b>sources</b> {{for a number of}} applications. In particular, the use of LMIS operated on gallium, indium, alkali metals or alloys has been standard practice in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) since the '70s.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} of the MALDI technology and comparable instruments are today produced for very different purposes. From more academic and analytical, to more industrial and high throughput. The MS field has expanded into requiring ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry such as the FT-ICR instruments {{as well as more}} high-throughput instruments. As many MALDI MS instruments can be bought with an interchangeable ionization source (Electrospray ionization, MALDI, Atmospheric pressure ionization, etc.) the technologies often overlap and many times any soft ionization method could potentially be used. For more variations of soft ionization methods go to Soft laser desorption or <b>Ion</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ion {{mobility}} spectrometry (IMS) is {{a technique}} of ion separation in gaseous phases based on their differences in ion mobility when an electric field is applied providing spatial separation prior to MS analysis. With the introduction of DESI as an <b>ion</b> <b>source</b> for ion mobility mass spectrometry, applications for IMS have expanded from only vapor-phase samples with volatile analyses to also in tact structures and aqueous samples. When coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, analysis of proteins is also possible. These techniques work in tandem to one another to investigate ion shapes and reactiveness after ionization. A key characteristic of this setup {{is its ability to}} separate the distribution of ions generated in DESI prior to mass spectrometry analysis.|$|E
25|$|In mass spectrometry, {{ionization}} {{refers to}} the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the <b>ion</b> <b>source.</b> There are several ion sources available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, electron ionization (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to HPLC, i.e. LC-MS, since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.|$|E

50|$|Most {{widespread}} {{instruments are}} using liquid metal <b>ion</b> <b>sources</b> (LMIS), especially gallium <b>ion</b> <b>sources.</b> <b>Ion</b> <b>sources</b> based on elemental gold and iridium are also available. In a gallium LMIS, gallium metal {{is placed in}} contact with a tungsten needle, and heated gallium wets the tungsten and flows {{to the tip of}} the needle, where the opposing forces of surface tension and electric field form the gallium into a cusp shaped tip called a Taylor cone. The tip radius of this cone is extremely small (~2 nm). The huge electric field at this small tip (greater than 1 x 108 volts per centimeter) causes ionization and field emission of the gallium atoms.|$|R

The experiments evaluated the power requirements of the different ion emitters to produce approximately 10 (mA) of current and tested the effects of using an Osmium-Ruthenium coating to increase the work function of the emitter surface. Lifetime tests of the different ion emitters were also performed. Analysis of the experimental findings showed that Lithium <b>ion</b> <b>sources</b> with a lifetime of 93 hours and Potassium <b>ion</b> <b>sources</b> with a lifetime of 44 hours produced acceptable current levels for use in spacecraft charge control devices.

25|$|As the {{production}} of radioactive atoms by the ISOL technique depends on the free atom chemistry of the element to be studied, there are certain beams which cannot be produced by simple proton bombardment of thick actinide targets. Refractory metals such as tungsten and rhenium do not emerge from the target even at high temperatures due to their low vapour pressure. In order to produce these types of beams, a thin target is required. The Ion Guide Isotope Separator On Line (IGISOL) technique was developed in 1981 at the University of Jyväskylä cyclotron laboratory in Finland. In this technique, a thin uranium target is bombarded with protons and nuclear reaction products recoil out of the target in a charged state. The recoils are stopped in a gas cell and then exit through a small hole {{in the side of}} the cell where they are accelerated electrostatically and injected into a mass separator. This method of production and extraction takes place on a shorter timescale compared to the standard ISOL technique and isotopes with short half-lives (sub millisecond) can be studied using an IGISOL. An IGISOL has also been combined with a laser <b>ion</b> <b>source</b> at the Leuven Isotope Separator On Line (LISOL) in Belgium. Thin target sources generally provide significantly lower quantities of radioactive ions than thick target sources and this is their main drawback.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} example {{describes the}} operation of a spectrometer mass analyzer, which is of the sector type. (Other analyzer types are treated below.) Consider a sample of sodium chloride (table salt). In the <b>ion</b> <b>source,</b> the sample is vaporized (turned into gas) and ionized (transformed into electrically charged particles) into sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Sodium atoms and ions are monoisotopic, with a mass of about 23 u. Chloride atoms and ions come in two isotopes with masses of approximately 35 u (at a natural abundance of about 75 percent) and approximately 37 u (at a natural abundance of about 25 percent). The analyzer part of the spectrometer contains electric and magnetic fields, which exert forces on ions traveling through these fields. The speed of a charged particle may be increased or decreased while passing through the electric field, and its direction may be altered by the magnetic field. The magnitude of the deflection of the moving ion's trajectory depends on its mass-to-charge ratio. Lighter ions get deflected by the magnetic force more than heavier ions (based on Newton's second law of motion, F = ma). The streams of sorted ions pass from the analyzer to the detector, which records the relative abundance of each ion type. This information is {{used to determine the}} chemical element composition of the original sample (i.e. that both sodium and chlorine are present in the sample) and the isotopic composition of its constituents (the ratio of 35Cl to 37Cl).|$|E
25|$|Radioactive {{beams of}} {{specific}} isotopes {{are widely used}} {{in the fields of}} experimental physics, biology and materials science. The production and formation of these radioactive atoms into an ionic beam for study is an entire field of research carried out at many laboratories throughout the world. The first isotope separator was developed at the Copenhagen Cyclotron by Bohr and coworkers using the principle of electromagnetic separation. Today, there are many laboratories around the world that supply beams of radioactive ions for use. Arguably the principal Isotope Separator On Line (ISOL) is ISOLDE at CERN, which is a joint European facility spread across the Franco-Swiss border near the city of Geneva. This laboratory uses mainly proton spallation of uranium carbide targets to produce a wide range of radioactive fission fragments that are not found naturally on earth. During spallation (bombardment with high energy protons), a uranium carbide target is heated to several thousand degrees so that radioactive atoms produced in the nuclear reaction are released. Once out of the target, the vapour of radioactive atoms travels to an ionizer cavity. This ionizer cavity is a thin tube made of a refractory metal with a high work function allowing for collisions with the walls to liberate a single electron from a free atom (surface ionization effect). Once ionized, the radioactive species are accelerated by an electrostatic field and injected into an electromagnetic separator. As ions entering the separator are of approximately equal energy, those ions with a smaller mass will be deflected by the magnetic field by a greater amount than those with a heavier mass. This differing radius of curvature allows for isobaric purification to take place. Once purified isobarically, the ion beam is then sent to the individual experiments. In order to increase the purity of the isobaric beam, laser ionization can take place inside the ionizer cavity to selectively ionize a single element chain of interest. At CERN, this device is called the Resonance Ionization Laser <b>Ion</b> <b>Source</b> (RILIS). Currently over 60% of all experiments opt to use the RILIS to increase the purity of radioactive beams.|$|E
