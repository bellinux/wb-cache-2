ARC manages all three major {{refugee camps in}} Rwanda, providing health care, water, construction, and sanitation services as well as programs combating gender-based violence and HIV/AIDS. ARC also manages successful income generation programs in the camps and hires and trains refugees wherever possible. In 2005, the government of Rwanda asked ARC to build a refugee camp at Nyabiheke to accommodate 5,000 new refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. ARC quickly constructed roads, bridges, shelters, latrines, storage warehouses, and health centers, and began receiving refugees within a month of the request. The culminating achievement of the construction efforts was the <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>borehole</b> to tap an aquifer, which provides 100,000 liters of naturally purified, filtered water per day. In the fall of 2007, ARC expanded Nyabiheke Camp to receive 2,000 more people fleeing increased violence.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} a project {{conducted by the}} Bureau of Mines in which the accurate directional <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>borehole</b> was demonstrated {{with the objective of}} intercepting a designated target. The project was conducted at Navajo Dam in northern New Mexico {{at the request of the}} Bureau of Reclamation. Borehole survey and drill logs are provided in an appendix. The trajectory of the demonstration borehole was designed to intercept a 5 -ft-radius target at the final or "punchout" distance of 885 ft. The elevation of the borehole at this distance was within the target; the borehole punchout coordinates were 8. 81 Ft southwest of the target. As a result of the demonstrated accuracy, the Bureau of Reclamation has contracted the accurate drilling of boreholes as long as 600 ft from the inside of a short tunnel, to control water seepage in the right abutment. This resulted in a substantial cost savings compared to the original plan of constructing a longer tunnel and drilling 150 - ft boreholes.

40|$|AbstractA prebored pressuremeter test (PMT) {{requires}} a predrilled vertical smooth surface borehole of a constant diameter. Two methods for {{the preparation of}} predrilled boreholes are included in ASTM D 4719. The first method is drilling a borehole using a rotary rig. While this method provides a constant diameter and a vertical borehole, it is costly and time consuming. The second method is the <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>borehole</b> by a hand auger (Iwan type). While this is a low cost, rapid method, it may not provide a vertical borehole of constant diameter {{in a variety of}} soils. An innovative mechanical drilling system (MDS) has been developed for the preparation of vertical smooth surface borehole of constant diameter for the pressuremeter testing. The PMT was conducted in boreholes drilled by MDS, rotary rig (RR) and hand auger (HA) at a site that comprised clayey silt (CL-ML) and sandy silt (ML) deposits. The PMT curves thus obtained were compared in terms of quality, cost and time. The comparison indicates that good quality and cost effective PMT curves can be obtained by using MDS in broader strain range (up to 40 %) for the stiffness and limit pressure determination...|$|E

40|$|Deep {{geothermal}} exploration in the UK in the 1980 s resulted {{in only one}} operative borehole (in Southampton). In 2004, a 995 m deep borehole was drilled into the Weardale granite in County Durham. This project differed markedly from the earlier ‘hot dry rock’ investigations in the granites of Cornwall, in that it deliberately targeted possible high natural permeability derived from large fault zones. The new approach met with success, discovering what {{is believed to be}} the highest natural permeability ever found in granite anywhere in the world. <b>Drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second <b>borehole</b> at Eastgate in 2010 confirmed that high permeability is preferentially associated with major west–east geological faults. Further deep drilling is now targeting similar faults cutting nearby sedimentary sequences. Meanwhile, renewed interest is being shown in Cornish prospects, as well as in previously unexplored resources in Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is also significant interest in the possible geothermal exploitation of hot brines, which are co-produced with hydrocarbons in existing oilfields.

40|$|The <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep <b>borehole</b> {{across the}} {{actively}} creeping Parkfield {{segment of the}} San Andreas Fault Zone (SAFZ), California, and collection of core materials permit direct geological study of fault zone processes at 2 – 3 km depth. The three drill cores sample both host and fault rocks and pass through two currently active, narrow (1 – 2 m wide) shear zones enclosed within a broader (ca. 240 m wide) region of inactive foliated gouges. The host rocks preserve primary sedimentary features and are cut by numerous minor faults and small, mainly calcite-filled veins. The development of Fe-enriched smectitic phyllosilicate networks following cataclasis is prevalent in the presently inactive foliated gouges of the main fault zone and in minor faults cutting clay-rich host rocks. Calcite, anhydrite and minor smectitic phyllosilicate veins are interpreted to have formed due to local fluid overpressuring events prior to, synchronous with and after local gouge development. By contrast, the active shear zone gouges lack mineral veins (except as clasts) and contain numerous clasts of serpentinite. Markedly Mg-rich smectitic phyllosilicates are the dominant mineral phases here, suggesting that the fault zone fluids have interacted with the entrained serpentinites. We propose that weakening of the SAFZ down to depths of at least 3 km {{can be attributed to}} the pervasive development of interconnected networks of low friction smectitic phyllosilicates and to the operation of stress-induced solution-precipitation creep mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Cold CO 2 gas {{emission}} sites in rainwater-filled pools, so called mofettes, are widely distributed all over Italy. Their gas reservoirs, mostly having a high CO 2 content, have a magmatic and/or metamorphic origin. Temporal variations in fluid expulsions were observed at the mofettes of Caprese Michelangelo {{during the period}} from 2002 to 2005. These observations were made possible by using a new approach: photographic time-series. <b>A</b> first interpretation <b>of</b> these fluid expulsionswas based on meteorological/hydrogeological explanations. However, our long-term observations show that these processes may merely be a side effect. The probable main reason for the anomalous emissions is the long-term variation in the long-distance fluid transport process from the reservoir induced by the local tectonic settings. In {{the northern part of the}} Alto Tiberina Fault, a fault intersection was reactivated by a seismic sequence which started on 2001 November 26, and continued for approximately four months.

A geophysical study based on the new ERT (Electric Resistivity Tomography) technique was recently performed, the resistivity tomography data being integrated with gravity, magnetics and previous VES (Vertical Electric Sounding) measurements (Ursu, 1994).

40|$|El bloque de San Guillermo forma una superficie elevada de 17. 800 km² en el oeste de la provincia de Santa Fe y el borde noreste de la provincia de Córdoba. Debido a su posición topográfica, durante el Cuaternario estuvo sujeto a sedimentación eólica, sin influencia de sedimentación o erosión fluvial, algo atípico en la Pampa Norte. Está limitado por fallas con rechazos del orden de los 30 metros, y tiene una definida identidad estratigráfica, sedimentológica y geomorfológica que lo diferencia de las áreas vecinas. Una perforación de estudio hasta 102 m de profundidad realizada en la localidad de San Guillermo (en un punto típico del mismo) atravesó 53 metros de loess primario y una unidad limo arcillosa de edad probablemente pleistocena, sedimentados en discordancia sobre la Fm Paraná (arenas y pelitas miocenas). El paquete loéssico está representado por tres formaciones, cuya mineralogía está dominada en forma casi excluyente por tres formas de cuarzo: policristalino, en microaglomerados y monocristalino. El mineral arcilloso dominante es la illita. La fuente de origen de dichos materiales es probablemente un loess antiguo situado al sur. El tamaño de grano dominante es el limo, que representa el 65 % del total. La perforación se realizó con un sistema ad hoc que combina perforación rotativa directa con muestreo por percusión tipo SPT, lo que permitió obtener 15 muestras inalteradas y 91 muestras comunes, aptas también para análisis. Un estudio {{regional}} utilizando descripciones de más de 100 pozos anteriores existentes en la región del centro de Santa Fe y este de Córdoba, cubriendo unos 50. 000 km², permitió determinar que en el bloque de San Guillermo la columna estratigráfica se mantiene constante y que varía fuera de sus límites por procesos de erosión y sedimentación fluvial. An {{investigation on}} the regional distribution of loess in the North Pampa {{resulted in the}} identification of the San Guillermo Elevated Block. The pivotal work of the project was the <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> research <b>borehole</b> at the town of San Guillermo (30 ° 15 ´ lat. S and 61 ° 50 ´ long. W), North Pampa. This work is part of the "FLAGS Project" founded by the National Agency of Science Promotion, Argentina. The borehole (101. 50 m depth) comprises the entire Quaternary column of the region and part of Tertiary sedimentary rocks. <b>A</b> total <b>of</b> 91 sediment samples were collected continuously at 1 m depth intervals. 15 oriented undisturbed tube cores were recovered at intervals of 6 m. Also geoelectric and gamma profiles were made. The borehole revealed 54 m of loess which begins at the surface. A Quaternary paludal unit (between 54 and 60. 3 m deep) separates the loess column from a Miocene littoral sedimentary unit (Paraná Formation). The Quaternary section is composed of three primary (not reworked) loess units, and an underlying clayey silt. The upper loess unit is the well known Tezanos Pinto Formation (OIS 2). The other two loessic units are composed of dominant silt (average textural composition: 65 % silt), with subordinated clay and scarce fine sand; the segregations of CaCO 3 are abundant. Colour varies from 7, 5 YR 6 / 3 (light brown) to 7, 5 YR 7 / 3 (pink). The mineralogic composition of the very fine sand fraction is dominated by three forms of quartz: polycrystalline, forming microagglomerates and monocrystalline quartz. X-ray diffractions of total samples indicate <b>a</b> dominance <b>of</b> quartz, with scarce feldspars and illite. The source of the loessic units is probably an old loess located at the south. Such a thick aeolian profile of the borehole provides detailed information on the Pampean Eolian System (PES), mainly considering that outcropping loess-paleosols sequences from North Pampa hardly reach 10 m. The section is representative <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relatively elevated flat area with <b>a</b> surface <b>of</b> 17, 800 km² covering the NW of Santa Fe Province and the NE belt of Córdoba Province. That area is limited by fractures and has a marked stratigraphic, sedimentological and geomorphological identity, different to the surrounding region. It is identified here as the San Guillermo Elevated Block, which during the Quaternary underwent only eolian influence, in contrast {{to the rest of the}} North Pampa, which was subject mainly to fluvial and alluvial influence of currents arriving from the west and the north. According to the complementary information obtained from more than 100 previous <b>boreholes</b> covering <b>an</b> area <b>of</b> 50, 000 km², the stratigraphic column of the San Guillermo Elevated Block is clearly different to the stratigraphic column of the area located to the east.
