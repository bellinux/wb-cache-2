5|$|At {{the other}} end of the river, the Millennium Bridge was opened in 2001. There was once a ferry at this point, before 1865, which gave access to the Victoria Dock, opened in 1850.

50|$|In 1995, the Consortium {{proposed}} {{and went on}} to create the vCard and vCalendar technologies. vCards were intended to make <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> many people using computers connected to the Internet to exchange contact information, while vCalendars were intended to make <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> people to swap scheduling information.|$|R

5|$|Hippopotamus lemerlei bones {{have been}} mostly {{discovered}} in the rivers and lakes of western Madagascar, suggesting a riparian lifestyle, {{very similar to that}} of the modern hippopotamus of modern Africa. H. lemerlei also shared the high-orbits that make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the hippopotamus to see while in the water. The skull of H. lemerlei also resembled that of the modern hippopotamus, but with consistent size differences, indicating that H. lemerlei was a sexually dimorphic species.|$|E

5|$|Krüper's {{nuthatch}} {{is threatened}} by urbanisation and development in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and made <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{solubility}} of cerium is {{much higher}} in methanesulfonic acid. Cerium(III) and terbium(III) have ultraviolet absorption bands of relatively high intensity compared with the other lanthanides, as their configurations (one electron more than an empty or half-filled f-subshell respectively) make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the extra f electron to undergo f→d transitions instead of the forbidden f→f transitions of the other lanthanides. Cerium(III) sulfate {{is one of the}} few salts whose solubility in water decreases with rising temperature.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them.

Development of the atlatl during this period made <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E

5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as {{a major source of}} employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} {{that lead to}} the shift to modern globalization was the development of a more politicized system. Proto-globalization period marked a steady expansion of larger states from the Indonesian islands to northern Scandinava. The settlement of these individuals made <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> governments to tax, develop an army, labor force, and create a sustainable economy. The development and streamlining of these cultural aspects lead to an increase in peripheral players in the game of globalization. The stable legal institutions developed in the late proto-globalization and early modern globalization period established economic advances, intellectual property rights (more predominantly in England), general geographical stability, and generational societal improvement.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E

In September 2006, CBS and YouTube struck a strategic content and advertising partnership, and the YouTube CBS Brand Channel started including daily contributions from the Showtime network, including promotional video clips from its critically acclaimed original series, such as Dexter. On October 28, after the first few episodes had aired, Showtime made <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> viewers {{to catch up with the}} show by dedicating a whole night to showing the first five episodes.|$|E
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, Leicester Square {{was known}} as an {{entertainment}} venue, with many amusements peculiar to the era, including Wyld's Great Globe, which was built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 and housed a giant scale map of the Earth. The construction of New Coventry Street made <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> traffic to access the square, resulting in private residences being replaced by shops, museums and exhibition centres. Savile House at No.5–6, built in 1683 for Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, had become a museum by this time, and was ultimately destroyed by fire in 1865. It was rebuilt as the Empire Theatre.|$|E

5|$|Chapman also {{advocated}} {{the use of}} white footballs and numbered shirts, as well as adding hoops to Arsenal's socks to make <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> players to pick each other out. He later made a further change to Arsenal's kit, adding white sleeves to the previously all-red shirt and brightening the colour, before a match against Liverpool on 4 March 1933; the same kit theme of red with white sleeves or trim survives to this day. The tradition of both teams walking out together at the FA Cup Final was started in 1930 due to Herbert Chapman's involvement with both clubs, and has continued since.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, making <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> {{them to move}} on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking {{on a variety of}} surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E
5|$|In August 1915, Spinks {{was tapped}} {{to join a}} consultative panel of notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help develop a new handicapping system for balkline billiards, {{organized}} by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, {{at that time the}} organizers of the World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers. The system was expected {{to level the playing field}} in other ways, especially making <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks.|$|E
