50|$|The {{catalyst}} {{used for}} the ebullated bed is typically a 0.8-mm diameter extrudate, and is held in a fluidized state through the upward lift of liquid reactants and gas. The liquid and gas enter in the reactor plenum, and are distributed across the bed through a distributor and <b>grid</b> <b>plate.</b> The height of the ebullated catalyst bed can be controlled by the rate of liquid recycle flow. This liquid rate is adjusted by varying {{the speed of the}} ebullating pump, a canned centrifugal pump which controls the flow of ebullating liquid obtained from the internal vapor/liquid separator inside the reactor. Fresh catalyst can be added, and spent catalyst withdrawn, to control the level of catalyst activity within the reactor. The capability of regular addition of a small quantity of catalyst is instrumental to ebullated-bed reactors' consistent product quality over long time periods. To adjust operation and/or different feedstocks, the type of catalyst used can also be changed without shutting down the reactor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A novel {{technique}} is presented for the accurate, rapid, high frequency, predictive modeling of parallel <b>plate</b> capacitors with <b>gridded</b> <b>plates</b> manufactured in a multilayer low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) process. The method is empirical {{in nature and}} is based on the concept of incrementally constructing the model for a structure from well characterized individual building blocks. Building blocks are characterized by the use of test structures and measurements, and are modeled using passive lumped circuit elements. This method is applied to the predictive modeling of deeply embedded <b>gridded</b> parallel <b>plate</b> capacitor structures. The procedure has been experimentally verified, with accurate predictions of behavior obtained up to the second self resonance for large area <b>gridded</b> parallel <b>plate</b> capacitors. Since lumped element circuits are generated by this method, structure prediction speed is determined by circuit size and simulator small signal analysis time. The method is versatile and is well suited for circuit design applications.

The main objective of this research study is to propose a new approach of fractal concept (circle <b>grid</b> perforated <b>plate)</b> for internal rapid mixing by determining the coefficient of variation (COV). This study was implemented by fully numerical simulations. The simulations of mixing fluid were carried out {{with the help of}} commercial computational fluid dynamic (CFD) package ANSYS CFX 14. 0 software. The simulation was done primarily in cylindrical pipe with insertions of circle <b>grid</b> perforated <b>plate</b> with porosity of 50 % and 75 %.

However, other materials are often used to reinforce concrete e.g. organic and inorganic fibres, composites in different forms. While compared to its compressive strength, concrete is weak in tension. Thus adding reinforcement increases the strength in tension.
