Two of these creeks, the Ginninderra and Tuggeranong, have similarly been dammed to form Lakes Ginninderra and Tuggeranong. Until recently the Molonglo River <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> sometimes calamitous floods; the area was a flood plain prior to the filling of Lake Burley Griffin.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Augustus, Beirut was {{established}} under the name Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus (and granted the status of Ius Italicum) as a colony for Battle of Actium veterans from the fifth Macedonian and the third Gallic legions.

5|$|Ford {{later said}} his {{biological}} father <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> hitting his mother. James M.

Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man.|$|E
5|$|Hailstorms have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> {{significant}} damage in Australia. Since records on insured losses by the Insurance Disaster Response Organisation began in 1967 three other hailstorms — Sydney in 1986 and 1990, {{as well as}} Brisbane in 1985 — feature on the top-ten list of most insured damages caused by a single natural disaster, {{in addition to the}} 1999 storm. Hailstorms have caused more than 30% of all insured damages inflicted as a result of natural disasters in Australia during this period, and around three quarters of all hailstorm damage has occurred in New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Horner {{also pointed out that}} the tyrannosaur lineage <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> steadily improving binocular vision. It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators.|$|E

The school <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> producing high-caliber international basketball players, including Enes Kanter and Nikola Vučević. However, N'Diaye {{was not allowed to}} play the sport during his first year in the high school because of California Interscholastic Federation rules. As a sophomore, he was officially granted the permission to transfer to another high school.|$|E

5|$|The Government of Finland held {{a crisis}} meeting, and {{declared}} a national day of mourning for September 24, with ministers agreeing that Finland's laws pertaining to gun ownership should be reviewed. Suggestions included introducing legislation to aid {{police officers in}} accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses, and the right to request further information if the applicant <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> using medication. The question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns was also raised.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Seismic Zone has not <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> regular {{earthquake}} activity. Earthquakes {{are rarely}} above 4.5in magnitude, because Virginia is {{located away from}} {{the edges of the}} North American Plate. The largest earthquake, at an estimated 5.9magnitude, was in 1897 near Blacksburg. A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Virginia on August 23, 2011, near Mineral. The earthquake was reportedly felt as far away as Toronto, Atlanta and Florida.|$|E

5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> {{run-ins with}} the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came {{while he was}} president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for wearing their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to blow up the strip club. They changed their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E
5|$|In late 2004, a man {{allegedly}} gave Murray's {{father a}} rusty, stained knife {{that belonged to}} the man's brother, who had a criminal past and lived {{less than a mile from}} where the car was discovered. His brother and his brother's girlfriend were said to have acted strangely after the disappearance, and the man's brother claimed he believed the knife had been used to kill Murray. Several days after the knife was given to Fred Murray, the man's brother allegedly scrapped his Volvo. Family members of the man who turned in the knife claimed he had made up the story in order to obtain reward money in the investigation, and that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> drug use.|$|E

5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, and the right to request further information if the applicant <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Red River <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> {{seasonal}} flooding, {{aggravated by}} the broad ancient lake bed {{that formed the}} Red River Valley. The 1997 Red River Flood caused extensive damage in the city. Fargo was upstream from {{the bulk of the}} flood waters that season, and Winnipeg had built an extensive system of flood control structures in the 1960s. In 1997 Grand Forks suffered the most damage of any major city in the Red River Valley. During the height of the flooding, a major fire destroyed eleven buildings in the downtown area. The government began developing a new levee system to protect the city, which was completed ten years later. It required the relocation of numerous residents as some neighborhoods were emptied for this construction.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance left {{a legacy}} across {{intellectual}} fields including poetry, historical writing and architecture, which {{continued into the}} seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A growing number of Scottish scholars emerged who had an increasing confidence in their own literature. Part of the explanation for the sudden flowering of the Scottish Enlightenment, is that the country already <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> achievements in philosophy, poetry, music, mathematics and architecture and was in close touch with intellectual trends in the rest of Europe. From this period Scotland would make major contributions in the fields of medicine, law, philosophy, geology and history. Among these ideas the limitation of royal sovereignty over the people remained present in Scottish intellectual life and resurfaced to contribute to the major debates of the eighteenth century.|$|E
