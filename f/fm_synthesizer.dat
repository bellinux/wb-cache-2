The Z80 processor is primarily used to control both sound chips to produce stereo music and sound effects. Most revisions of the original system contain a discrete YM2612 and a separate YM7101 VDP; the functionality of these two chips was later integrated into a single custom ASIC (FC1004) for the model 2 and later revisions.|$|E

5000|$|The System 1 and its {{games are}} noted {{for the use}} of [...] "raw" [...] {{sounding}} <b>FM</b> <b>Synthesizers</b> for sound effects and music: that is, the music many times used instruments that had the modulation settings turned too high or too low to emulate realistic sounding instruments, instead creating a warbly or noisy sound.|$|R
5000|$|Yamaha's {{engineers}} began adapting Chowning's algorithm {{for use in}} {{a commercial}} digital synthesizer, adding improvements such as the [...] "key scaling" [...] method to avoid the introduction of distortion that normally occurred in analog systems during frequency modulation, though it would take several years before Yamaha were to release their <b>FM</b> digital <b>synthesizers.</b> In the 1970s, Yamaha were granted a number of patents, under the company's former name [...] "Nippon Gakki Seizo Kabushiki Kaisha", evolving Chowning's early work on FM synthesis technology. Yamaha built the first prototype <b>FM</b> digital <b>synthesizer</b> in 1974. Yamaha eventually commercialized FM synthesis technology with the Yamaha GS-1, the first <b>FM</b> digital <b>synthesizer,</b> released in 1980.|$|R

It came with graphical music software for digital synthesis and a sequencing, capable of synthesizing and sequencing sounds and rhythms, with its internal <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizer</b> or external MIDI devices. It provided synthesis, composition tools, and a 4-track MIDI sequencer, available on different cartridges.|$|E

50|$|Yamaha CX5M is an MSX-system {{compatible}} computer that expands upon the normal features expected from these systems {{with a built-in}} eight-voice <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizer</b> module, introduced in 1984 by Yamaha Corporation.|$|E
50|$|The FS1R {{synthesizer}} has {{an impressive}} set of new wave forms over the earlier DX line of <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizers,</b> which {{have since been}} incorporated into the new Montage line from Yamaha (with {{the exception of the}} Formant wave form). These wave forms include Sine, All1, All2, Odd1, Odd2, Res1, Res2, and Formant. The new wave forms are each constructed with a very LARGE number of inherent harmonics making FM synthesis far more efficient. Each one of these operator wave forms can replace an entire column of operators in a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer algorithm.|$|R
50|$|The Yamaha TX81Z is a rack {{version of}} Yamaha DX11 and {{rack-mounted}} (keyboard-less) frequency modulation music synthesizer, which {{was released in}} 1987. Unlike previous <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizers</b> of the era, the TX81Z {{was the first to}} offer a range of oscillator waveforms other than just sine waves, conferring the new timbres of some of its patches when compared to older, sine-only FM synths. The TX81Z has developed a famous reputation, largely based on some of its preset bass sounds. A keyboard version with more onboard editing abilities was released the following year as the Yamaha DX11.|$|R
50|$|This {{cartridge}} featured <b>FM</b> sound <b>synthesizer,</b> Sound sampler (ADPCM with 32 kB sample RAM), MIDI interface, audio & MIDI I/O connectors, {{and also}} built in software (Music-BOX, CALL MUSICBOX).|$|R

50|$|Legacy support {{includes}} an OPL3 <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizer,</b> Sound Blaster Pro (22 kHz 8-bit Stereo) emulation and MPU-401 compatible MIDI interface. In addition to OPL3, DOS applications running under Windows 9x/Me {{can also use}} the XG tone generator.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Sound Blaster 16 cards feature either a discrete Yamaha YMF262 OPL-3 <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizer,</b> or a CT1747 chip which has this synthesizer integrated. Some post-1995 cards (notably the CT2910) feature the fully compatible YMF289 FM synthesis chip instead.|$|E
50|$|The Yamaha DX1 is the {{top-level}} {{member of}} Yamaha's prolific DX series of <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizers.</b> It features {{two sets of}} the same synthesizer chipset used in the DX7, allowing either double the polyphony, split of two voices, or dual (layered) instrument voices. In addition, it contains twice the amount of voice memory as the DX7. It has an independent voice bank for each of two synth channels (engines). Each of 64 performance combinations can be assigned a single voice number, {{or a combination of}} two voice numbers - one from channel A and one from channel B.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1990s, ESS {{started working}} on making PC audio, and later, video chips, and created the Audiodrive line, used in {{hundreds}} of different products. Audiodrive chips were at least nominally Creative Sound Blaster Pro compatible. Many Audiodrive chips also featured in-house developed, OPL3-compatible <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizers</b> (branded ESFM Synthesizers). These synthesizers were often reasonably faithful to the Yamaha OPL3 chip, which was an important feature for the time as some competing solutions, including Creative's own CQM synthesis featured in later ISA Sound Blaster compatibles, offered sub-par FM sound quality. Some PCI-interface Audiodrives (namely the ES1938 Solo-1) also provided legacy DOS compatibility through Distributed DMA and the SB-Link interface.|$|R
50|$|The TX81Z was {{designed}} as a low-cost FM machine and has always been relatively inexpensive compared to most other <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizers.</b> The TX81Z is built around a single FM chip, the Yamaha YM2414B aka OPZ, while 6-op machines like the DX7 have separate envelope/frequency and algorithm/wave chips and created LFOs in software; this large workload in the OPZ is probably why it has fewer operators and notes. A 63B03 CPU allocates voices and generates auxiliary LFOs, in parallel with MIDI and user interface, which might be why e.g. a pitch EG was omitted; the later DX11 splits responsibilities between 2 CPUs and adds a PEG.|$|R
50|$|Adlib Tracker II {{has been}} {{steadily}} updated since the late 1990s and has become open source on Google Code in 2012. In January 2015, Adlib Tracker II released its most robust update to date with many new features to control the <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizer</b> chip.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the music}} in the game was {{composed}} by Fletcher Beasley using the G.E.M.S. system (Genesis Emulation Music Software), which could communicate with the Yamaha 2612 <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizer</b> chip on the Sega Genesis and {{could be used to}} directly play back the sounds through the Genesis.|$|E
50|$|It has a small-sized {{keyboard}} with 32 minikeys and a pitch-bend wheel, vibrato {{and sustain}} buttons, an internal Frequency modulation (usually {{referred to as}} <b>FM)</b> <b>synthesizer</b> offering 25 different voices with 6-note polyphony, two operators, and a very basic chord sequencer. It also has a loudspeaker.|$|E
5000|$|The SY/TG {{range as}} a whole was {{discontinued}} sometime between 1995 and 1997. The SY77 and SY99 were replaced as the flagship Yamaha synthesizer workstations by the W7 and W5, respectively. However, the SY77 and SY99 were the last Yamaha [...] "flagship" [...] workstations to be natively capable of the fully fledged FM synthesis that had been introduced with the DX line. Yamaha's later FS1r was the most advanced of their <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizers,</b> adding 8-operator synthesis and formant synthesis (hence FS), but it was a rack-mounted module and never received much attention, and so it was discontinued rapidly, with the result that units today are both hard to find and expensive.|$|R

50|$|The Yamaha GS-1, {{the first}} {{commercial}} <b>FM</b> digital <b>synthesizer,</b> released in 1980, was programmed using a proprietary Yamaha computer, {{which at the time}} was only available at Yamaha's headquarters in Japan (Hamamatsu) and the United States (Buena Park).|$|R
5000|$|It was succeeded the {{following}} year with the more expensive Yamaha V50 workstation which contained an onboard sequencer and additional sampled ROM drum sounds, making the DX11 Yamaha's last <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizer</b> to bear the classic [...] "DX" [...] title up until the release of their DX200 module in 2001.|$|E
50|$|ESFM is {{available}} in ESS sound chips starting with the ISA-based ES1688 AudioDrive, up to the PCI-based ES1938 Solo-1, whereas earlier chips required an external <b>FM</b> <b>synthesizer</b> chip (typically a Yamaha YMF262). ESS's Maestro series of PCI-based sound chips rely on a software implementation of FM synthesis that lacks ESFM's special features.|$|E
50|$|The Yamaha SHS-10 {{from the}} late 1980s has a small {{keyboard}} with 32 minikeys and a pitch-bend wheel, an internal Frequency modulation (usually referred to as <b>FM)</b> <b>synthesizer</b> offering 25 different voices with 6-note polyphony. Onboard voices include a range of keyboard instruments (pipe organ, piano, electric piano, etc.); strings (violin, guitar, double bass, etc.); and wind and brass (clarinet, flute, trumpet, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Released in 1979, the Casio VL-1 was {{the first}} {{commercial}} digital synthesizer, selling for $69.95. Yamaha eventually commercialized their FM synthesis technology and released the first <b>FM</b> digital <b>synthesizer</b> in 1980, the Yamaha GS-1, but at an expensive retail price of $16,000.|$|R
50|$|Yamaha's GS-1, {{the first}} <b>FM</b> digital <b>synthesizer,</b> was {{released}} in 1980. To program the synthesizer, Yamaha built a custom computer workstation designed {{to be used as}} a sequencer for the GS-1. It was only available at Yamaha's headquarters in Japan (Hamamatsu) and the United States (Buena Park).|$|R
50|$|The SFG-01 <b>FM</b> Sound <b>Synthesizer</b> Unit, {{released}} in 1983, uses several chips, including a Yamaha YM2151 FM sound chip, YM3012 stereo DAC, YM2210 MIDI communications chip, YM2148 keyboard scanning chip, and YM2148 MIDI UART. It also has stereo audio outputs, an input for a purpose-built four-octave keyboard, {{and a pair}} of MIDI Input/Output ports. It had limited MIDI support on the original CX5M model, with only management of data from a Yamaha DX7 digital synthesizer. The YIS-303, CX5, YIS-503 and CX5M computers could be upgraded with the SFG-01 <b>FM</b> Sound <b>Synthesizer</b> Unit II sound module, {{released in}} 1984, featuring an upgraded Yamaha YM2164 sound chip and full MIDI support, which could be used for normal MIDI. The SFG-05 module came integrated with the second CX5M revision, the CX5M II.|$|R
