40|$|It {{is almost}} common {{knowledge}} that foreign trade in Europe is characterized by an acceptance of prices set by the world market. Coupled with a constant profit share in domestic sectors this makes European exports vulnerable to vagaries of international demand and prices {{as well as to}} crowding out in the wake of shocks to supply. These circumstances have been used to legitimate special measures geared towards shielding the sector from adverse shocks and <b>general</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> in the past. In fact econometric evidence is not totally at odds with this view. However, neither exports in a large European economy like Germany nor in a small open one, like Norway, are characterized by price taking behavior. On the contrary, both nations show strong evidence of monopolistic power in the process governing external prices, implying that supply shocks to a large extent can be passed on to prices. On the other hand exports seem to be heavily subject to the vicissitudes of international trade, a feature compatible with exports determined by demand ex post for prices fixed ex ante.

This deviated in a number of cases of the recommendation of the Panel Peck, and turned out some strict and sometimes less severe.

In an article initially printed in Kommersant and then reprinted {{several times in the}} West, he writes:"Ours-ism" [...] does not know national or ethnic boundaries. The former chancellor of a foreign country (Gerhard Schröder) is made a member of the corporation and becomes [...] "our man in Europe." [...] Meanwhile, a Russian businessman (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) who created a company that brought billions into the national treasury turns out to be an [...] "other" [...] and is exiled to the depths of Siberia.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a {{framework in which}} the optimal admissions policy of a purely academicquality oriented college implements <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> {{in favor of the}} student from the deprived socioeconomic background which maximizes the competition between candidates. We find that the exact form of the <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> admissions policy matters for student incentives and hence for student-body diversity in equilibrium. <b>Preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> policy in college admissions often takes, or is perceived to take, an additive form where the score of the applicant from the deprived background is augmented by a fixed number of points. Such a <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> policy fails to incentivize students from the deprived background. Despite the affirmative action, the level of <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> that achieves academic excellence leaves student-body diversity unchanged compared with a background-blind admissions policy and leads to a higher intergroup score gap...|$|R
