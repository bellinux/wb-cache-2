40|$|Abstract. A {{low power}} 32 -bit {{microcontroller}} using {{different kinds of}} low-power techniques {{to adapt to the}} dynamically changing performance demands and power consumption constraints of battery powered applications is designed and tested. Four power domains and six power modes are designed to fulfill low-power targets and meet different functional requirements. Varieties of low power methods such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), multiple supply voltages (MSV), power gating (PG) and so on are applied. A novel zero steady-state current POR circuit which makes excellent performance in the chip’s <b>OFF</b> <b>mode</b> is also integrated. The SoC occupies 20 mm 2 in a 0. 18 um, 1. 8 V nominal-supply, CMOS process. Test results show that the microcontroller works normally at the frequency of 70 MHz and performs well in different power modes. Yet it only consumes 1. 67 µA leakage current in the <b>OFF</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeWe {{describe}} {{the influence of}} vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with standard mode and rapid cycling mode on sleep related breathing in two patients with epilepsy. MethodsTwo VNS treated patients underwent digital video-polysomnography for three nights (night 1 : rapid cycling mode; night 2 : standard mode; night 3 : <b>off</b> <b>mode).</b> ResultsIn patient 1, on <b>off</b> <b>mode,</b> apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 11. 1 /h, respiratory effort-related arousal index (RERAI) 0. 9 /h, flow limitation index (FLI) 0. 9 /h and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) 10. 2 /h. On standard mode, AHI was 5. 5 /h, RERAI 1. 7 /h, FLI 4. 1 /h and ODI 5. 5 /h. On rapid cycling mode, AHI was 10. 4 /h, RERAI 7. 9 /h, FLI 17. 3 /h and ODI 10. 3 /h. In patient 2, on <b>off</b> <b>mode,</b> AHI was 1. 6 /h, RERAI 0. 8 /h, FLI 2. 2 /h and ODI 0 /h. On standard mode, AHI was 2. 9 /h, RERAI 2. 4 /h, FLI 2. 6 /h and ODI 2. 9 /h. On rapid cycling mode, AHI was 0. 7 /h, RERAI increased to 15. 4 /h, FLI to 52. 0 /h and ODI was 0. 7 /h. ConclusionsThe number of RERAs {{as well as the}} number of flow limitations were higher with the rapid cycling mode compared to standard <b>mode</b> and stimulation <b>off</b> and might be related to the higher impulse frequency...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of surface breaking defects in conducting materials {{is an important}} aspect of nondestructive evaluation (NDE). Eddy current NDE methods have been used effectively for the {{detection of}} fatigue cracks and other surface breaking flaws in conducting materials [1], however, a detracting characteristic is that the eddy current transducer must be placed in close proximity to the test specimen. Since millimeter wave energy can propagate in air and does not require a couplant, millimeter wave NDE offers an alternative technique with the significant advantage of detection in a stand <b>off</b> <b>mode</b> of operation. Millimeter wave NDE {{has been shown to be}} effective at detecting small cracks [2 – 3], however, some methods under study require that the transducer be in close proximity with the specimen and thus suffer from the same disadvantages as eddy current techniques. This paper compares the detection capabilities of surface breaking flaws on conducting materials for millimeter wave NDE in the stand <b>off</b> <b>mode</b> and conventional eddy current NDE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a convex optimization approach {{to control the}} density distribution of autonomous mobile agents with two control modes: ON and OFF. The main new characteristic distinguishing this model from standard Markov decision models is {{the existence of the}} ON control mode and its observed actions. When an agent is in the ON mode, it can measure the instantaneous outcome of one of the actions corresponding to the ON mode and decides whether it should take this action or not based on this new observation. If it does not take this action, it switches to the <b>OFF</b> <b>mode</b> where it transitions to the next state based on a predetermined set of transitional probabilities, without making any additional observations. In this decision-making model, each agent acts autonomously according to an ON/OFF decision policy, and the discrete probability distribution for the agent's state evolves according to a discrete-time Markov chain that is a linear function of the stochastic environment (i. e., transition probabilities) and the ON/OFF decision policy. The relevant policy synthesis is formulated as a convex optimization problem where hard safety and convergence constraints are imposed on the resulting Markov matrix. We first consider the case where the ON mode has a single action and the <b>OFF</b> <b>mode</b> has deterministic transitions (rather than stochastic) to demonstrate the model and the ideas behind our approach, which is then generalized to the case where ON mode has multiple actions and <b>OFF</b> <b>mode</b> has stochastic transitions.
