This paper seeks to highlight how the RTK GPS from Trimble is being employed at Gold Fields Ghana Limited, Tarkwa Mine to provide accurate drill depth and drill pattern design. The usage, problems, processing and efficiency of this system in a mining environment is also explored. It also looks at the level of accuracies provided by this system. Before the introduction of RTK GPS into the blasting process, the current blast fragmentation was resulting in sub-optimal feed size to crushers on the Mine and an unfriendly floor conditions resulting in excessive sheeting of digging floor to prevent tyre damage. It was decided to use RTK GPS to improve the fragmentation through accurate drill depth and design pattern in order to achieve a constant throughput to the north heap leach crusher of 1500 t/hr, a 5 % increase in pit loading efficiency and a 50 % decrease in <b>rock</b> <b>breaker</b> hours, equipment damage costs and in-pit sheeting costs respectively. This paper is intended to take the reader through the application of RTK GPS in accurate drill depth and drill pattern which have resulted in a 10 % reduction in loading times, of which half has been attributed to improved fragmentation, as well as a substantial increase in blasted stocks whiles <b>rock</b> <b>breaker</b> hours have also decreased resulting in substantial financial gains to the company.

40|$|The {{influence}} of springy impact interface and of curved drill rods on energy transfer in percussive rock drilling was studied. Analytical models for pneumatic and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rock</b> drills were introduced, {{in which the}} springy piston-rod impact interface was taken into account. A nonlinear model for the springy impact interface was also implemented in a computer simulation program for percussive rock drilling systems. Laboratory tests were performed and the experimental results were compared with the results by three theoretical models. The agreement between theoretical and experimental incident stress waves {{was found to be}} satisfactory. The factors affecting the rock drilling efficiency were analysed. For the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rock</b> drills investigated, it was found that a springy impact interface slightly decreases the drilling efficiency. For pneumatic rock drills, however, the analysis showed that an appropriate springy impact interface might increase the drilling efficiency significantly. The reflection and transmission of harmonic stress waves at a constant curvature bend of an ilifinite uniform bar was analysed theoretically. The energy fluxes of the reflected and transmitted extensional and flexural waves were obtained for an incident wave which may be either extensional or flexural. Results are shown in polar radiation diagrams for an incident extensional wave. It was found that for bends of small angles, the radius of curvature has little effect on the transmission of extensional stress waves and a significant amount of extensional wave energy is transmitted through the bends. Furthermore, the efficiency of percussive rock drilling with a bent drill rod was investigated using a combined approach of FFT and matrix method. In percussive rock drilling with slightly bent rods (bend angle up to 100), {{it was found that the}} efficiency is practically the same as with straight rods. It was also found that the efficiency can remain high even if the rod is significantly bent (bend angle up to 30 °). Godkänd; 1993; 20070429 (ysko...|$|R

30|$|Profiles {{for the two}} {{properties}} highlight {{that both}} geothermal sites share noticeable similarities. Inverted properties of the best models show common general trends and in particular, the decoupling of behaviors between the thermal and <b>hydraulic</b> cap <b>rocks.</b> Both sites show a blanketing effect from the whole sedimentary cover, whereas {{the top of the}} convective cells (i.e., the bottom of the <b>hydraulic</b> cap <b>rock)</b> is at the transition between the upper and lower sediments. The other similarity between both geothermal sites concerns the rock properties. The reservoir permeability is similar between both sites, about 1.0  ×  10 ^- 14 m^ 2 in the granitic basement and the lower sediments. The permeability is also very close in the deep granites, about 6.0  ×  10 ^- 15 m^ 2.

40|$|Modeling the {{mechanical}} deformations of {{porous and fractured}} rocks requires a stress–strain relationship. Experience with inherently heterogeneous earth materials suggests that different varieties of Hooke’s law should be applied within regions of the rock having significantly different stress–strain behavior. We apply this idea by dividing a rock body conceptually into two distinct parts. The natural strain (volume change divided by rock volume at the current stress state), rather than the engineering strain (volume change divided by the unstressed rock volume), {{should be used in}} Hooke’s law for accurate modeling of the elastic deformation of that part of the pore volume subject to a relatively large degree of relative deformation (i. e., cracks or fractures). This approach permits the derivation of constitutive relations between stress and a variety of mechanical and/or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rock</b> properties.

A new electric plant was also installed.A new lead furnace was blown in on 21 January 1908. However in 1908 there was hardly a mine operating outside of the company mines as an outcome of wage increases with the emergence of unions and declining copper prices. The new copper furnace was blown in on 20 February 1908 and the converter plant was operating effectively by early March that year. Much better lead recoveries were noticeable after the second converter was introduced into the line, and ores had to be preliminarily roasted as well. At a cost of £70,000 the Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company Pty Limited could treat sulphide ores from its Mungana mines as well as public ore. They could also treat the Penzance (Redcap), Boomerang (Calcifer) and Calcifer slag dump material, along with self-fluxing mixture with Ruddygore ore. To achieve this the company had to extend its tramline from the Chillagoe railway at Harper Siding to the Boomerang and Calcifer slag dump.|$|R
