5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> she sank.|$|E

5|$|Umbriel's heavily cratered surface has {{probably}} been stable since the Late Heavy Bombardment. The only signs of the ancient internal activity are canyons and dark polygons—dark patches with complex shapes measuring from tens to hundreds of kilometers across. The polygons were identified from precise photometry of Voyager 2s images and are distributed more or less uniformly {{on the surface of}} Umbriel, trending northeast–southwest. Some polygons correspond to depressions of a few kilometers deep and may have been created during an early episode of tectonic activity. Currently there is no <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> Umbriel is so dark and uniform in appearance. Its surface may be covered by a relatively thin layer of dark material (so called umbral material) excavated by an impact or expelled in an explosive volcanic eruption. Alternatively, Umbriel's crust may be entirely composed of the dark material, which prevented formation of bright features like crater rays. However, the presence of the bright feature within Wunda seems to contradict this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Unlike wasps in the {{subfamily}} Polistinae, Stenogastrinae {{are unable}} to construct peduncles for their nests. Being forced to choose sites with already made suspensions severely limits their options for suitable nesting sites. This also provides a reasonable <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> wasps belonging to this family tend to nest in clusters. When one suitable site is located, many wasps can benefit from the same site.|$|E
25|$|Darwin's {{theory of}} {{evolution}} by natural selection is the only scientific <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> an animal's behaviour is usually well adapted for survival and reproduction in its environment. However, claiming that a particular mechanism is well suited to the present environment is different from claiming that this mechanism was selected for in the past due to its history of being adaptive. The literature conceptualizes the relationship between function and evolution in two ways. On the one hand, function and evolution are often presented as separate and distinct explanations of behaviour.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss {{the use of a}} {{validated}} behavioral model across multiple contexts. We show that such a model can be used to distinguish between classes of <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> that behavior occurs. Specifically, we compare between state and trait <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> students game. We use the behavior model to predict each student’s gaming frequency in a set of 35 tutor lessons, and then use linear models and the Bayesian Information Criterion to determine which class of explanations predicts gaming behavior more successfully. ...|$|R

Kurkjian offered another <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> Donati robbed the museum: he felt unsafe on the streets as long as Ferrara remained in custody, and hoped to use the art to bargain for his freedom, as Connor had done to reduce his sentence by arranging {{for the return of}} the BMFA's Rembrandt 15 years earlier.|$|E
25|$|However, the Greenlee-Thomas model (Greenlee & Thomas, 1993) {{suffers from}} two failings {{as a model}} for the effects of set-size in VSTM. First, it has only been empirically tested with {{displays}} composed of one or two elements. It has been shown repeatedly in various experimental paradigms that set-size effects differ for displays composed of a relatively small number of elements (i.e., 4 items or less), and those associated with larger displays (i.e., more than 4 items). The Greenlee-Thomas (1993) model offers no <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> this might be so. Second, while Magnussen, Greenlee, and Thomas (1997) are able to use this model to predict that greater interference will be found when dual decisions are made within the same perceptual dimension, rather than across different perceptual dimensions, this prediction lacks quantitative rigor, and is unable to accurately anticipate the size of the threshold increase, or give a detailed explanation of its underlying causes.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} ignorance, by Lionel Robbins, {{focuses on the}} market failure as causes for lack of {{economic}} development. It describes the purpose of governments as the distribution of resources. As resources are scarce, the regime has to allocate those resources wisely to encourage economic growth. Therefore, lack of economic growth {{is caused by the}} inability to carry out correct decisions in allocating economic resources. For example, the previous president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, focused his policies only on developing the country's industries, {{which turned out to be}} disastrous to the economy. His successor, Kofi Abrefa Busia, knowing the mistakes of Nkrumah, still carried out the same expansionary economic policy, not because he did not know what policy was good or bad—because of ignorance—but because the institutional design in Ghana pushed him to do so. This example demonstrates that ignorance oversimplifies the situations and cannot offer a satisfactory <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> nations fail. First, this theory assumes that rulers are benevolent, and ignore the possibility that rulers intentionally carry out bad economic decisions for personal interests. Second, if a leader's ignorance is the cause, then by having a better and less ignorant leader, the country will witness greater economic growth. Yet, this isn't always the case.|$|E

500|$|An <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> the {{expansion}} of the Universe is accelerating remains elusive. It is often attributed to [...] "dark energy", an unknown form of energy that is hypothesized to permeate space. On a mass–energy equivalence basis, the density of dark energy (~ 7 × 10−30 g/cm3) is much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies. However, in the present dark-energy era, it dominates the mass–energy of the universe because it is uniform across space.|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} examines {{one component}} of worry, elevated subjective probabilities of negative events, and attempts to elucidate the cognitive processes on which this is based. The {{results suggest that the}} pessimistic subjective probabilities shown by chronic worriers can be understood using general theories of judgment, specifically, by the use of the availability heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973). However, it is the availability of a particular pattern of cognitions [...] an increased accessibility of <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> a negative event would occur, combined with a reduced accessibility of <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>why</b> it would not [...] that is important.
