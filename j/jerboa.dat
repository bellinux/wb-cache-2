Species include Karoo short-eared elephant shrew, northern Luzon giant cloud rat, western spotted skunk, golden-headed lion tamarin, Mohol bushbaby, Damaraland mole-rat, lesser Egyptian <b>jerboa,</b> long-tailed chinchilla, Harris's antelope squirrel, California mouse, green acouchi, and woodland dormouse.|$|E
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian <b>jerboa</b> (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|E

The fore limbs usually have five digits, including an opposable thumb, while the hind limbs have three to five digits. The elbow gives the fore arms great flexibility. The majority of species are plantigrade, walking on both the palms and soles of their feet, and have claw-like nails. The nails of burrowing species tend to be long and strong, while arboreal rodents have shorter, sharper nails. Rodent species use {{a wide variety of}} methods of locomotion including quadrupedal walking, running, burrowing, and climbing, bipedal hopping (kangaroo rats and hopping mice), swimming, and even gliding.|$|E

2500|$|Family Dipodidae: <b>jerboas</b> {{and jumping}} mice (Africa, Eurasia, North America) ...|$|R
50|$|Dipodids {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} rodents, ranging from 4 to 26 cm in body length, excluding the tail. They are all adapted for jumping, although to varying degrees. The <b>jerboas</b> have very long hind legs which, in most species, include cannon bones. They move either by jumping, or by walking on their hind legs. The jumping mice have long feet, but lack the extreme adaptations of the <b>jerboas,</b> {{so that they}} move by crawling or making short hops, rather than long leaps. Both <b>jerboas</b> and jumping mice have long tails to aid their balance. Birch mice have shorter tails and feet, but they, too, move by jumping.|$|R
2500|$|Jumping (saltation) can be {{distinguished}} from running, galloping, and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch. Many terrestrial animals use jumping (including hopping or leaping) to escape predators or catch prey—however, relatively few animals {{use this as a}} primary mode of locomotion. Those that do include the kangaroo and other macropods, rabbit, hare, <b>jerboa,</b> hopping mouse, and kangaroo rat. Kangaroo rats often leap 2m and reportedly up to 2.75m at speeds up to almost [...] They can quickly change their direction between jumps. The rapid locomotion of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat may minimize energy cost and predation risk. Its use of a [...] "move-freeze" [...] mode may also make it less conspicuous to nocturnal predators. Frogs are, relative to their size, the best jumpers of all vertebrates. The Australian rocket frog, Litoria nasuta, can leap over , more than fifty times its body length.|$|E

All told, well more than 600 different species {{have been identified as}} prey of Eurasian eagle-owls.

5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of jumping rodents {{belonging}} to the family Dipodidae {{can be found in}} China.

50|$|The Dipodidae, or dipodids, are {{a family}} of rodents found across the Northern Hemisphere, the sole family in the {{superfamily}} Dipodoidea. This family includes over 50 species among the 16 genera.They include the <b>jerboas,</b> jumping mice, and birch mice. Different species are found in grassland, deserts, and forests. They are all capable of saltation (jumping while in a bipedal stance), a feature that is most highly evolved in the desert-dwelling <b>jerboas.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{superfamily}} Dipodoidea (Rodentia, Myomorpha) in {{its current}} interpretation contains a single family subdivided into six subfamilies. Four of them include morphologically specialized bipedal arid-dwelling <b>jerboas</b> (Dipodinae – three-toed <b>jerboas,</b> Allactaginae – fivetoed <b>jerboas,</b> Cardiocraniinae – pygmy <b>jerboas</b> and Euchoreutinae – long-eared <b>jerboas),</b> {{the other two are}} represented by more generalized quadrupedal taxa (Zapodinae – jumping mice and Sminthinae – birch mice). Despite considerable effort from morphologists, the taxonomy as well as the phylogeny of the Dipodoidea remains controversial. Strikingly, molecular approach has never been envisaged to investigate these questions. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships among the main dipodoid lineages were reconstructed for the first time using DNA sequence data from four nuclear genes (IRBP, GHR, BRCA 1, RAG 1). No evidence of conflict among genes was revealed. The same robustly supported tree topology was inferred from the concatenated alignment whatever the phylogenetic methods used (maximum parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods). Sminthinae branches basally within the dipodoids followed by Zapodinae. Monophyletic Cardiocraniinae is sister to all other <b>jerboas.</b> Within the latter, the monophyly of both Dipodinae and Allactaginae is highly supported. The relationships between Dipodinae, Allactaginae and Euchoreutinae should be regarded as unresolved trichotomy. Morphological hypotheses were confronted to findings based on the presented molecular data. As a result, previously proposed sister group relationships between Euchoreutes and Sicista, Paradipus and Cardiocraniinae as well as the monophyly of Cardiocaniinae + Dipodinae were rejected. However, the latter association is consistently supported by most morphological analyses. The basis of the obvious conflict between genes and morphology remains unclear. Suggested modifications to the taxonomy of Dipodoidea imply recognition of three families: Sminthidae, Zapodidae and Dipodidae, the latter including Cardiocraniinae, Euchoreutinae, Allactaginae and Dipodinae as subfamilies.
