5|$|Wolfgang {{prepared}} for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> play apparently without any tuition whatsoever. As for more general preparation, the children delighted in making music together, something they never lost. On tour, even during the busiest travelling days they would fit in their daily practice, appearing to thrive on the hectic schedule. Before the journey could begin, Leopold needed the consent of his employer, the prince-archbishop. Leopold had only been appointed deputy Kapellmeister in January 1763; nevertheless the archbishop's consent to an extended leave of absence was granted, {{on the grounds that}} the Mozarts' successes would bring glory to Salzburg, its ruler, and to God.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tokyo, Japan, on July 5, 1968, Ito became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} four. He began to learn to play the piano, becoming interested in it after hearing piano music coming from a classroom he passed by daily with his mother. He was also interested in Electone music, but was discouraged from learning it by a piano teacher. By the time he began composing at the age of ten, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> play alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano, and was interested in becoming a singer/songwriter. When he was close to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he asked a professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of Dragon Quest III. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square.|$|E
5|$|After finding {{most of the}} Melodies, Ninten is harassed at a karaoke bar by Teddy, {{the boss}} of a local gang. Teddy surrenders after losing to Ninten in a duel, and joins Ninten's party {{with the intent to}} avenge the deaths of his parents, who were killed at Holy Loly Mountain. Lloyd stays behind. In a cottage at the base of Holy Loly Mountain, Ana pulls Ninten aside and asks him to be with her always. The two dance and profess their mutual love. When about to leave, the party is {{attacked}} by a powerful robot that knocks out the entire party. Lloyd arrives with a tank and destroys the robot, but accidentally attacks the party and critically wounds Teddy, so Lloyd rejoins the party. They take a boat out on Holy Loly Lake and a whirlpool pulls them into an underwater laboratory where they find a robot who claims to have been built by George to protect Ninten. When the laboratory floods, they leave for the mountain and the robot helps them ascend. On the way, they find a cave with human prisoners including Ana's mother. They need to defeat the Mother Ship to free the prisoners. Another robot (implied to be an upgraded version of the one fought at the cabin) attacks at the summit, and George's robot self-destructs to destroy it, leaving behind the seventh melody. After learning this melody, the party is warped to Magicant, where Ninten sings the melodies <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> Queen Mary. She recalls the rest of the song and reminisces about an alien named Gyiyg that she loved as her own child. Queen Mary reveals that she is George's wife, Maria, and vanishes. Magicant, a mirage created by her conscience, vanishes with her.|$|E

25|$|John Daniell began {{experiments}} in 1835 {{in an attempt}} to improve the voltaic battery with its problems of being unsteady and a weak source of electric current.

Daniell had solved the problem of polarization. In his laboratory <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> alloy the amalgamated zinc of Sturgeon with mercury.

25|$|In January 1969, McLain was {{selected}} as the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year. He created more disruption when he was named as the starting pitcher for the American League in the 1969 All-Star Game in Washington, DC, but missed the start of the game because of a dental appointment in Detroit. The appointment was scheduled for Wednesday the 23rd, the day after the All-Star game, but because of a rainout on the scheduled date, the game was played on the 23rd. McLain was a nonconformist and liked to play by his own rules. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> fly and purchased an airplane. Having kept his dental appointment, he then flew himself to Washington, arriving at the game during the second inning. He pitched in the fourth inning, but by then the National League had already built a 9-2 lead. McLain created more dissension when he clashed with Tigers' manager Mayo Smith over the latter's role in the firing of Johnny Sain as the team's pitching coach. Despite the troubles, McLain had another productive season in 1969, winning 24 games and a second consecutive Cy Young Award, tying with Baltimore's Mike Cuellar, marking the first time two players had shared the award. It was the last award of his major league career.|$|E

To assist his son, Feller senior started growing wheat on his farm, a less labor-intensive crop than corn, to allow his son more time to play baseball. Originally the Fellers were Roman Catholics but converted to Methodism after Feller's father was reprimanded by their parish priest for letting him play on Sundays. Feller later suggested that his arm strength and ball speed during his major league career came from his childhood work milking cows, picking corn, and baling hay. He recalled his childhood fondly: [...] "What kid wouldn't enjoy the life I led in Iowa? Baseball and farming, and I had the best of both worlds." [...] The family's farm is on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
