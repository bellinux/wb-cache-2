50|$|One of the Indigo Forms software's {{innovations}} when it {{was introduced}} was its ability to have its forms installed into Laserjet font cartridges. This meant that the product only had to send forms data to the printer; since the form was already encoded in the <b>font</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Given the slow printer interfaces used at that time, this greatly reduced print times.|$|E
50|$|Type 4 is {{a format}} {{that was used}} to make fonts for printer <b>font</b> <b>cartridges</b> and for {{permanent}} storage on a printer's hard disk. The character descriptions are expressed in the Type 1 format. Adobe does not document this proprietary format.|$|R
5000|$|Designs {{are made}} from {{components}} stored on cartridges. Each cartridge comes with a keyboard overlay and instruction booklet. The plastic keyboard overlay indicates key selections for that cartridge only. However recently Provo Craft has released a [...] "Universal Overlay" [...] that is compatible with all cartridges released after August 1, 2013. The purpose of the universal overlay is to simplify the process of cutting by only having to learn one keyboard overlay {{instead of having to}} learn the overlay for each individual cartridge. Designs can be cut out on a PC with the Cricut Design Studio software, on a USB connected Gypsy machine, or can be directly inputed on the Cricut machine using the keyboard overlay. There are two types of <b>cartridges</b> shape and <b>font.</b> Each <b>cartridge</b> has a variety of creative features which can allow for hundreds of different cuts from just one cartridge. There are currently over 275 cartridges that are available (separately from the machine), containing fonts and shapes, with new ones added monthly. While some cartridges are generic in content, Cricut has licensing agreements with Disney, Pixar, Nickelodeon, Sesame Street, DC Comics and Hello Kitty. The Cricut line has a range of prices, but the cartridges are interchangeable, although not all options on a cartridge may be available with the smaller machines.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the American NDS version was released, an unavoidable bug was discovered in the game. The bug occurs on the ninth floor of the tower, during the second play through. The game crashes after talking to an opponent named Jon, who has to be defeated in order to finish the game. On June 6, SNK announced that the replacement cartridge would be available in stores on June 25 and began the process of implementing a recall. These cartridges have been sent by mail along with a package of five King of Fighters trading cards. The recall ended in January 2008. Fixed versions of the game features {{a black and white}} graphic behind the title <b>font</b> on the <b>cartridge's</b> label, while bugged versions feature the label in full color. The European version of the game did not contain the above-mentioned glitch.|$|R
