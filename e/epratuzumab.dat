METHODS: A phase IIb, multicentre, randomised controlled study (NCT 00624351) was conducted with 227 patients (37 - 39 per arm) receiving either: placebo, <b>epratuzumab</b> 200 mg cumulative dose (cd) (100 mg every other week (EOW)), 800 mg cd (400 mg EOW), 2400 mg cd (600 mg weekly), 2400 mg cd (1200 mg EOW), or 3600 mg cd (1800 mg EOW). The primary endpoint (not powered for significance) was the week 12 responder rate measured using a novel composite endpoint, the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) -based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA). RESULTS: Proportion of responders was higher in all <b>epratuzumab</b> groups than with placebo (overall treatment effect test p= 0. 148).

40|$|AbstractEpratuzumab is a B-cell-directed non-depleting {{monoclonal}} antibody that targets CD 22. It {{is currently being}} evaluated in two phase 3 clinical trials in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease associated with abnormalities in B-cell function and activation. The mechanism of action of <b>epratuzumab</b> involves perturbation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling complex and intensification of the normal inhibitory role of CD 22 on the BCR, leading to reduced signalling and diminished activation of B cells. Such effects may result from down-modulation of CD 22 upon binding by <b>epratuzumab,</b> as well as decreased expression of other proteins involved in amplifying BCR signalling capability, notably CD 19. The net result is blunting the capacity of antigen engagement to induce B-cell activation. The functional consequences of <b>epratuzumab</b> binding to CD 22 include diminished B-cell proliferation, effects on adhesion molecule expression, and B-cell migration, as well as reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL- 6 and TNF. Studies in patients treated with <b>epratuzumab</b> have revealed a number of pharmacodynamic effects that {{are linked to the}} mechanism of action (i. e., a loss of the target molecule CD 22 from the B-cell surface followed by a modest reduction in peripheral B-cell numbers after prolonged therapy). Together, these data indicate that <b>epratuzumab</b> therapy affords a unique means to modulate BCR complex expression and signalling...|$|E

40|$|The humanized anti-CD 22 antibody, <b>epratuzumab,</b> has {{demonstrated}} therapeutic activity {{in clinical trials}} of lymphoma, leukemia and autoimmune diseases, treating currently over 1500 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemias, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, Sjögren’s syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Because <b>epratuzumab</b> reduces on average only 35 % of circulating B cells in patients, and has minimal antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and negligible complement-dependent cytotoxicity when evaluated in vitro, its therapeutic activity may not result completely from B-cell depletion. We reported recently that <b>epratuzumab</b> mediates Fc/FcR-dependent membrane transfer from B cells to effector cells via trogocytosis, resulting in a substantial reduction of multiple BCR modulators, including CD 22, CD 19, CD 21, and CD 79 b, as well as key cell adhesion molecules, including CD 44, CD 62 L, and b 7 integrin, {{on the surface of}} B cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from normal donors or SLE patients.

40|$|Background: CD 22 is {{a surface}} {{molecule}} exclusively expressed on B lymphocytes involved in adhesion and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. By recruiting a tyrosine-phosphatase to its intracellular tail {{it acts as}} an inhibitory co-receptor of the BCR via dephosphorylation of signaling molecules, such as spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). Phosphorylation of Syk is essential upon BCR engagement and upstream of BCR-triggered Ca 2 + flux. <b>Epratuzumab,</b> a humanized anti-CD 22 monoclonal antibody is currently being investigated in clinical trials of SLE patients. Although it has been recently published that the antibody affects B-cell proliferation {{as well as the}} expression of adhesion molecules and B-cell migration, its potential impact on intracellular signaling events needs to be delineated. Therefore, the current study investigated the influence of <b>epratuzumab</b> on downstream kinases and BCR-induced Ca 2 + flux on human B cells. Methods: The in vitro effects of <b>epratuzumab</b> on BCR-induced Ca 2 + signaling were evaluated by Ca 2 + flux assays. Purified B cells were pre-incubated with F(ab’) 2 -epratuzumab or medium only and were subsequently stimulated with anti-F(ab’) 2 IgM and IgG. Intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations were monitored by flow cytometry over 10 minutes after activation. Subsequently, the influence of <b>epratuzumab</b> on the phosphorylation of the BCR signaling molecules Syk and PLC-γ 2 linked to Ca 2 + flux were studied in vitro. Results: BCR-activation induced an initial peak of Ca 2 + flux that occurred within the first 10 seconds which was moderately increased by <b>epratuzumab.</b> Notably, pre-incubation of <b>epratuzumab</b> strongly reduced Ca 2 + flux in B cells after the initial period compared to controls treated with medium only which exhibited increased Ca 2 + during sustained BCR-triggering. At corresponding time points of the Ca 2 + monitoring, phosphorylation status of Syk and PLC-γ 2 after BCR-stimulation was measured. Pre-treatment with <b>epratuzumab</b> as well as its F(ab') 2 -fragments led to a substantial reduction of the phosphorylation of Syk and of PLC-γ 2 upon BCR stimulation as compared to controls after 8 minutes. These differences in Syk and PLC-γ 2 were not found during the initial Ca 2 +-peak at 10 seconds as well as at 1 minute consistent with the notion that they were not yet fully activated. Notably, effects on the phosphorylation of Syk and PLC-γ 2 were observed in CD 27 - naïve and CD 27 + memory B cells. Conclusion: The data support that <b>epratuzumab</b> is able to exert inhibitory effects on BCR signaling by a sustained reduction of Ca 2 + flux and reduction of Syk and PLC-γ 2 phosphorylation upon BCR engagement consistent with a potential that CD 22 targeting may reduce the characteristic B-cell hyperreactivity in SLE...|$|E

Research has recently provided us with {{a better understanding of}} the immunologic alterations of SLE, leading to the creation of immunomodulatory agents designed to disrupt specific cell targets and pro-inflammatory pathways. Despite the improvement in the prognosis of SLE in the last 50 years with the use of immunosuppressive therapy such as cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, cytotoxicity remains a major complication of these medications and the need for more specific targeted immunotherapy is increasing. Early recognition and treatment of SLE with targeted immunotherapy has the potential to improve quality of life and reduce the risk of disease flare-ups and complications. In this review, we will explore the role of B-cells in the pathogenesis of SLE highlighting current insights into SLE development and management. In addition, we will discuss epratuzumab’s role in the treatment of SLE. <b>Epratuzumab</b> is a humanized anti-CD 22 monoclonal antibody that targets CD 22 on B-cell and its role in B-cell modulation, migration, function, and inhibition of B-cell receptor signaling. <b>Epratuzumab</b> is currently in a Phase III study evaluating its efficacy in the management of moderate to severe SLE.

The bsAbs demonstrated higher antibody-dependent cellulary cytoxicity (ADCC) activity than the parental mAbs, but not complement-dependent cytoxicity (CDC) of the parental CD 20 mAb. Cross-linking both CD 20 and CD 22 with the bsAbs resulted in the prominent redistribution of not only CD 20 but also CD 22 and BCR into lipid rafts.

Rituximab is a chimeric (human-mouse) anti-CD 20 antibody that induces responses in approximately half of the patients with relapsed indolent lymphomas and a third of patients with relapsed aggressive lymphomas when used as a single agent. Response rates appear even higher (up to 70 %) for newly diagnosed patients treated with Rituximab monotherapy. Other promising antibodies for treatment of B cell malignancies include <b>epratuzumab</b> (anti-CD 22), CAMPATH- 1...|$|E
40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) {{is a classic}} autoimmune disease characterized by a myriad of immune system aberrations, most likely resulting from pathogenic autoantibody production, immune complex deposition, and subsequent end-organ damage. B cells {{play a key role}} in the pathogenesis; therefore, B-cell-targeted therapies, including B-cell depletion and blockage of B-cell survival factors such as B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), are potential therapeutic targets for SLE. In uncontrolled clinical trials from approximately 20 studies, rituximab - a mouse-human chimeric anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody that effectively depletes B cells - has been demonstrated to reduce disease activity and decrease serum autoantibodies, with a clinical response of 86 % in a case series of approximately 400 SLE patients with refractory disease, with or without concomitant use of cyclophosphamide. <b>Epratuzumab,</b> a humanized anti-CD 22 monoclonal antibody that partially depletes B cells, has also been shown to reduce disease activity but not to decrease autoantibody levels in patients with moderately active SLE. Randomized controlled phase I/II trials in patients with active SLE have documented that belimumab, a humanized anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody, reduces B-cell numbers, inhibits disease activity and decreases anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibody in SLE patients. All these therapies are well tolerated, but accompanying infectious complications have been observed. Other B-cell-targeted therapies such as 'humanized' monoclonal antibodies to CD 20 (e. g. ocrelizumab) and agents that interrupt B-cell/T-cell interactions also have potential, and the efficacy of these, along with rituximab, belimumab and <b>epratuzumab,</b> needs to be determined by randomized controlled trials...|$|E
40|$|Wedeterminedwhether {{therapeutic}} responses using a bispecific antibody that pretargeted 90 Y-hapten-peptide radioimmunother-apy or a directly radiolabeled, humanized, 90 Y-anti-CD 20 IgG (veltuzumab) {{could be}} improved by combining these treatments with unlabeled humanized antibodies against CD 22 (<b>epratuzumab),</b> CD 74 (milatuzumab), or veltuzumab. Methods: Nude mice bearing established subcutaneous Ramos human Burkitt lymphoma were treated with antibodies alone or in combination with pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PT-RAIT) or radioimmu-notherapy, and tumor growth was monitored. Biodistribution studies examined the effect that predosing with unlabeled veltu-zumab had on radioimmunotherapy and PT-RAIT targeting. Re-sults:None of the unconjugated antibodies was effective against established and rapidly growing xenografts, but PT-RAIT, at ap-proximately 30 % of its maximum tolerated dose, and radioim...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevention}} of chronic organic damage and complete inhibition of inflammatory {{activity of the}} disease are the main goals {{in the treatment of}} systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Current therapies of SLE are not effective enough and they may cause various serious side effects. Biological therapies, affecting important pathogenetic disturbances in the immunological system of SLE patients, give hope {{for the development of a}} new treatment for SLE. Currently the most advanced clinical trials are being conducted with anti-lymphocyte B drugs, such as rituximab, belimumab and <b>epratuzumab.</b> Belimumab as the first biological agent was registered for treatment of the active, seropositive form of SLE. The advances in immunology and rheumatology nowadays raise the hope of finding effective and safe treatment for SLE. In our article we present an overview of data concerning perspectives of biological treatment in SLE...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} an optimal radioimmu-notherapy agent for further development against non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. We sought to establish the stability profile of 90 Y-labeled humanized LL 2 (hLL 2) monoclonal antibody (mAb) when prepared with different chelating agents and, from these data, to estimate the dosimetric improvement to be expected from use of the most stable 90 Y-chelate-hLL 2 complex. Methods: The complementarity-determining region–grafted (humanized) anti-CD 22 mAb, hLL 2 (<b>epratuzumab),</b> was conjugated to 3 dif-ferent chelating agents, 2 of which were derivatives of diethyl-enetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and 1 {{of which was the}} macrocyclic chelate 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). The 3 hLL 2 conjugates were radiola-beled with 90 Y and tested for stability in vitro against a 10, 000 -fold molar excess of free DTPA over 9 d. They were also teste...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{past decade}} {{witnessed}} the rapid development of adult B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. Beyond {{the development of}} chemotherapy regimens, immunotherapy is starting a new era with unprecedented complete remission (CR) rate. Targeting B-lineage-specific surface markers such as CD 19, CD 20, CD 22, or CD 52, immunotherapy has been demonstrating promising clinical results. Among the immunotherapeutic methods, naked monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), bispecific T cell engager (BiTE), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are the main types. In this review, we will examine the emerging preclinical and clinical development on (1) anti-CD 20 naked mAbs rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab; (2) anti-CD 19 ADCs SAR 3419 and SGN-CD 19 A and anti-CD 19 BiTE blinatumomab; (3) anti-CD 22 naked mAb <b>epratuzumab</b> and anti-CD 22 ADC inotuzumab ozogamicin; (4) anti-CD 52 naked mAb alemtuzumab; and (5) anti-CD 19 CAR T cells. We will discuss their efficacy, adverse effects, as well as future development...|$|E
40|$|Autoimmune cytopenias are a {{frequent}} complication in CLL, occuring in approximately 5 - 10 % of the patients. The most common manifestation is autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, followed by immune thrombocytopaenia and only rarely pure {{red blood cell}} aplasia or autoimmune granulocytopaenia. Initial treatment is as for the idiopathic autoimmune cytopenias, with most patients responding to conventional corticosteroid therapy. Patients not responding after 4 – 6 weeks of conventional therapy should be considered for alternative immunosuppression, monoclonal antibody therapy or splenectomy.   While randomized trials demonstrating the benefit of rituximab in CLL-related autoimmune diseases are still lacking, there are considerable data in the literature that provide evidence for its effectiveness. The monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab also displays considerable activity against both the malignant disease and the autoimmune complication in patients with CLL, although {{at the expense of}} greater toxicity. A number of new monoclonal antibodies, such as ofatumumab, GA- 101, lumiliximab, TRU- 016, <b>epratuzumab,</b> and galiximab, are currently investigated in CLL and their activity in CLL-related autoimmune cytopenias should be evaluated in future studies...|$|E
30|$|A {{clinical}} study {{was performed on}} ten patients, including six patients with HCC treated by hepatic SIRT using TheraSphere® (MDS Nordion) or SIR-Spheres® (Sirtex Medical), and four patients with B lymphoma treated using anti-CD 20 Zevalin® (Bayer) or anti-CD 22 <b>epratuzumab</b> (Immunomedics, Inc., Morris Plain, NJ, USA) 90 Y-based RAIT. Among the six HCC patients, five had macroscopic lesions, and one had a diffuse liver disease. Among the four lymphoma patients, two had a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and one had a follicular lymphoma receiving RAIT as consolidation treatment after an induction therapy. The other patient had a follicular lymphoma and was undergoing first-line treatment with Zevalin® (Bayer). All patients underwent a 30 -min PET imaging session with all acquisition parameters identical {{to those of the}} phantom study. Reconstructions were performed with or without TOF information with one or three iterations. For those who underwent radioembolization, the total amount of reconstructed activity was compared to the theoretical activity injected to the patient, as measured by the dose calibrator before injection.|$|E
