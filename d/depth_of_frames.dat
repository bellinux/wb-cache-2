50|$|A {{coping saw}} {{consists}} of a thin, hardened steel blade, stretched between the ends of a square, c shaped, springy-iron frame to which a handle is attached. The blade is easily removed from the frame so that the blade can be passed through a drilled hole {{in the middle of}} a piece <b>of</b> wood. The <b>frame</b> is then re-attached to the blade and the cut starts from the middle of the piece. Long cuts perpendicular to the edge of the material are possible but the shallow <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frame</b> rather limits how far from the edge one may cut.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} system to obtain the <b>depth</b> order <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> in image {{sequences}} using motion occlusion cues. The system first computes the forward and backward flows with the previous and next frames and estimates the occluded points. To obtain a region representation of the image, a Binary Partition Tree (BPT) is cre-ated for each frame. To estimate occlusion relations in the image, projective flow models are fitted to all regions in the image. The depth order solution is obtained by minimizing over the tree struc-ture a cost function based on occlusion relations {{and the number of}} regions. Results show that optical flow algorithms can be used directly to estimate occlusion points. Promising results are obtained combining motion occlusions and region information by means of a BPT. Eval-uation is performed comparing current state-of-the-art algorithms on figure/ground assignments, showing that the performance of the pro-posed system is comparable to current algorithms.

50|$|The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the C-shaped <b>frame</b> {{is called}} the throat. The largest {{machines}} have throat sizes of 120 cm (48 inches), while smaller machines have throat sizes of about 60 cm (24 inches). The C stands vertically and {{is supported by a}} frame. The throat size usually determines the largest size of metal sheet that the operator can place in the machine and work easily. On some machines, the operator can turn the top wheel and anvil 90 degrees to the frame to increase the maximum size of the work piece. Because the machine works by an amount of pressure between the wheels through the material, and because that pressure changes as the material becomes thinner, the lower jaw and cradle <b>of</b> the <b>frame</b> that holds the anvil roller is adjustable. It may move with a hydraulic jack on machines designed for steel plate, or a jackscrew on machines designed for sheet metals. As the material thins, the operator must adjust the pressure to compensate.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel 2 D-to- 3 D video {{conversion}} method for 3 D entertainment applications. 3 D entertainment {{is getting more}} and more popular and can be found in many contexts, such as TV and home gaming equipment. 3 D image sensors are a new method to produce stereoscopic video content conveniently and at a low cost, and can thus meet the urgent demand for 3 D videos in the 3 D entertaiment market. Generally, 2 D image sensor and 2 D-to- 3 D conversion chip can compose a 3 D image sensor. Our study presents a novel 2 D-to- 3 D video conversion algorithm which can be adopted in a 3 D image sensor. In our algorithm, a depth map is generated by combining global depth gradient and local depth refinement for each <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> 2 D video input. Global depth gradient is computed according to image type while local depth refinement is related to color information. As input 2 D video content consists of a number of video shots, the proposed algorithm reuses the global <b>depth</b> gradient <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> within the same video shot to generate time-coherent depth maps. The experimental results prove that this novel method can adapt to different image types, reduce computational complexity and improve the temporal smoothness of generated 3 D video...|$|R

The purpose of the present numerical study was to determine, in a basic way, how the relative size of a single horizontal frame member mounted in the center of the window affects this convective heat transfer rate. A recessed window has been considered. The flow has been assumed to be steady and both laminar and turbulent flows have been considered. Fluid properties have been assumed constant except for the density change with temperature that gives rise to the buoyancy forces, this being dealt with using the Boussinesq approach. The governing equations have been solved using the FLUENT commercial cfd code. The k-epsilon turbulence model with standard wall functions and with buoyancy force effects fully accounted for has been used in the calculations. The solution has the following parameters: the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, the dimensionless horizontal distance between the inner window surface and the inner surface of the wall in which the window is mounted (the dimensionless recess depth), and the dimensionless width and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frame</b> member. Results have only been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0. 74, which is effectively the value for air, and for single values of the dimensionless window recess <b>depth</b> and <b>of</b> the dimensionless <b>frame</b> height.

This methodology is embedded in a larger visual mapping framework aiming to produce accurate and dense topometric urban maps. Our method is based on two main filtering stages. Firstly, we perform a segmentation process considering both geometric and photometric image constraints, followed by a regularization step (spatial-integration). We then proceed to a fusion stage where the geometric information is further refined by considering the <b>depth</b> images <b>of</b> nearby <b>frames</b> (temporal integration). This methodology can be applied to other projective models, such as perspective stereo images. Our approach is evaluated within the frameworks of image registration, localization and mapping, demonstrating higher accuracy and larger convergence domains over different datasets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} novel compact {{representation}} for stereoscopic videos- a 2 D video and its depth cues. Depth cues {{are derived from}} an interactive labeling process during 2 D-to- 3 D video conversion, they are contour points of foreground objects and a background geometric model. By using such cues and image features of 2 D video <b>frames,</b> <b>depth</b> maps <b>of</b> the <b>frames</b> can be recovered. Compared with traditional 3 D video representation, the proposed one is more compact. We also design algorithms to encode and decode the depth cues. The representation benefits both 3 D video generation and coding. Experimental results demonstrate that the bit rate can be saved about 10 %- 50 % in coding 3 D videos compared with multi-view video coding and 2 D+depth methods. A system coupling 2 D-to- 3 D video conversion and coding (CVCC) is proposed to verify advantages of the representation. 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of {{managers}} and manager-owners in decisions to engage the community and select particular social causes. This exploratory study aims to investigate why and how individuals impact on corporate community involvement (CCI) in their organisations. This is of significance in New Zealand as corporate philanthropic funding to the non-profit sector accounts for only three percent, which is low by international comparisons (Tennant, O’Brien & Sanders, 2008). The role of managers and their influence on CCI has been vociferously debated, with some arguing that personal impact should be limited and CCI decisions should be made solely according to profit maximisation. This perspective has used a rational and cognitive model of decision making paired with the Expectancy or reward/reinforcement theory in motivation to argue that management rationally considers the firm and then selects the best strategic option. This study turns to contemporary psychology to propose that managers may use ‘hot’ mental processing, including making CCI decisions based on values, emotions, ideologies and {{their own sense of}} identity. This study utilises a two-stage mixed method approach. The first stage investigated six respondents utilising a phenomenology approach to give a detailed description <b>of</b> each manager’s <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference and how this <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference impacted CCI outcomes. The second stage of this study progressed from a description to offering a theoretical explanation of the phenomenon, investigating the variables influencing how managers expressed their personal <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference in behaviour and the consequential impact on CCI decision making. This study found that managers and manager-owners held a strong sense of values, well defined ideologies, emotions, preferences and opinions regarding social issues which constructed the <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference surrounding their organisations community involvement. However, the existence <b>of</b> the personal <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference did not consistently impact the visible behaviour of individuals or their organisation’s corporate community involvement. Cold or rational thinking was shown to mitigate the impact of hot processing or alternatively post-justify decisions based on hot mental processing to validate the initial decision or alter how it was communicated within the organisation. Whether the personal <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference impacted CCI decision-making was influenced by the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference, the internal mental dialogue regarding the acceptability of effectiveness of hot or cold decision making and task, organisational, and personal variables. This study offers a critique of extant research based on rational cognitive models and offers an alternative explanation for why and how managers champion CCI in their organisations. Further, through providing {{a deeper understanding of the}} roles of managers this thesis provides recommendations for non-profit organisations strategising to target the corporate sector for funding and provides some insights into how to mitigate or encourages the use of hot mental processing within CCI decision making...|$|R
40|$|We propose Human Pose Models that {{represent}} RGB and <b>depth</b> images <b>of</b> human poses independent of clothing textures, backgrounds, lighting conditions, body shapes and camera viewpoints. Learning such universal models requires training images where all factors are varied for every human pose. Capturing such data is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we develop {{a framework for}} synthesizing the training data. First, we learn representative human poses from a large corpus of real motion captured human skeleton data. Next, we fit synthetic 3 D humans with different body shapes to each pose and render each from 180 camera viewpoints while randomly varying the clothing textures, background and lighting. Generative Adversarial Networks are employed to minimize the gap between synthetic and real image distributions. CNN models are then learned that transfer human poses to a shared high-level invariant space. The learned CNN models are then used as invariant feature extractors from real RGB and <b>depth</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> human action videos and the temporal variations are modelled by Fourier Temporal Pyramid.
