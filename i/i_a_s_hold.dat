40|$|In Liouville quantum gravity (or 2 d-Gaussian multiplicative chaos) one {{seeks to}} define a measure μ^h = e^γ h(z) dz where h is an {{instance}} of the Gaussian free field on a planar domain D. Since h is a distribution, not a function, one needs a regularization procedure to make this precise: for example, one may let h_ϵ(z) be the average value of h on the circle of radius ϵ centered at z (or an analogous average defined using a bump function supported inside that circle) and then write μ^h = _ϵ→ 0 ϵ^γ^ 2 / 2 e^γ h_ϵ(z) dz. If ϕ: D̃→ D is a conformal map, one can write h̃ = h ∘ϕ + Q |ϕ'|, where Q = 2 /γ + γ/ 2. The measure μ^h̃ on D̃ is then <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> equivalent to the pullback via ϕ^- 1 of the measure μ^h on D. Interestingly, although this <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>holds</b> for each given ϕ, nobody has ever proved that it <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>holds</b> simultaneously for all possible ϕ. We will prove that this is indeed the case. This is conceptually important because one frequently defines a quantum surface to be an equivalence class of pairs (D, h) (where pairs such as the (D,h) and (D̃, h̃) above are considered equivalent) and {{it is useful to}} know that the set of pairs (D,μ^h) obtained from the set of pairs (D,h) in an equivalence class is itself an equivalence class with respect to the usual measure pullback relation.

For a given class of properties and p, we say that G(n,p) obeys the zero-one law if any formula from the class either <b>a.</b> <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>holds</b> or <b>a.</b> <b>a.</b> <b>s.</b> does not <b>hold</b> in G(n,p).

Zero-one laws for properties of quantifier depth k we call the zero-one k-laws. The main results of this paper concern the zero-one k-laws for monadic second order properties (MSO properties). We determine all values α> 0, for which the zero-one 3 -law for MSO properties does not hold. We also show that, contrary to the case of the 3 -law, there are infinitely many values of α for which the zero-one 4 -law for MSO properties does not hold. Studying these zero-one laws forces us to analyze the evolution of certain properties of G(n,p), which may be of independent interest...|$|R
