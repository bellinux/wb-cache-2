A new structure, a step well QC structure, was proposed. Under such an arrangement, there are three main energy levels within the step well, where {{the transition from the}} upper state to the middle state is at the THz radiative spacing and the transition from the middle state to the lower state is at or near the LOphonon energy (~ 36 meV in GaAs). Because of the inherent difficulties in using rate equations for this type of transport analysis, a Monte Carlo simulation was developed. Step well injectors were modeled and shown to be capable of high <b>injection</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (~ 90 %), higher than previously obtained. Comparisons to conventional square well LOphonon structures are made, including a Monte Carlo analysis of a high power THz QCL.

40|$|Abstract—Current <b>injection</b> <b>efficiency</b> and {{internal}} quantum ef-ficiency (IQE) in InGaN quantum well (QW) based {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs) are investigated. The analysis is based on current continuity relation for drift and diffusion carrier transport across the QW-barrier systems. A self-consistent 6 -band method {{is used to calculate}} the band structure for InGaN QW structure. Carrier-photon rate equations are utilized to describe radiative and non-radiative recombination in the QW and the barrier regions, carrier transport and capture time, and thermionic emis-sion leading to carrier leakage out of the QW. Our model indicates that the IQE in the conventional 24 -Å In Ga N-GaN QW structure reaches its peak at low injection current density and reduces gradually with further increase in current due to the large thermionic carrier leakage. The efficiency droop phenomenon at high current density in III-nitride LEDs is thus consistent with the high-driving-current induced quenching in current <b>injection</b> <b>efficiency</b> predicted by our model. The effects of the monomolec-ular recombination coefficient, Auger recombination coefficient and GaN hole mobility on the current <b>injection</b> <b>efficiency</b> and IQE are studied. Structures combining InGaN QW with thin larger energy bandgap barriers such as Al Ga N, lattice-matched Al In N, and lattice-matched Al In Ga N have been analyzed to improve current <b>injection</b> <b>efficiency</b> and thus mini-mize droop at high current injection in III-nitride LEDs. Effect of the thickness of the larger energy bandgap barriers (AlGaN, AlInN and AlInGaN) on <b>injection</b> <b>efficiency</b> and IQE are inves-tigated. The use of thin AlGaN barriers shows slight reduction of quenching of the <b>injection</b> <b>efficiency</b> as the current density increases.
