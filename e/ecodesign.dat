40|$|National audienceThe {{growing demand}} for {{environmentally}} friendly products {{has been on the}} list of the main topics in the past decades. Design to Environment (DtE) proposes integrated methods to encourage the development of <b>ecodesigned</b> products during the design process. Several environmental methods have been developed and introduced in the strategies and design processes of industries. However it is still uncertain how effectively their contribution helps to assist in the up-growth of <b>ecodesigned</b> products during product designers' activities. This paper explores some available information systems offering support in environmental integration across and into the activities involved during the design process. Some relevant information models characteristics are highlighted to help integrating the DtE since early stages in the product design process. Such designed product (or service) would bring environmental values into the society as well as some other possible benefits such as cost reduction and quality improvements during the product lifecycle. An industrial case study is under development to formalise and validate a proposition based on linking and relating these characteristics...|$|R
40|$|ISSN 2212 - 8271 International audienceDesign to Environmental (DtE) proposes an {{environmental}} parameter optimisation {{among the other}} design parameters to support the emergence of <b>ecodesigned</b> products that bring environmental value to the society. Numerous information systems {{have been developed to}} support the integration of domain-specific parameters. However, it is still unclear how well they perform together in supporting the emergence of <b>ecodesigned</b> products. This research focusses on identifying the information model characteristics needed to change a conventional design process into a DtE process. A framework for industry to find out the proper information models that will support their DtE practice is proposed through a modelview-controller structure, accessed from an operational level. Supporting frequent environmental information sharing, encouraging environmental and product designers operational initiatives, as well as measuring the environmental performance of the DtE process through local operational indicators are fondamental characteristics required for supporting product designers and environmental expertise successful collaboration in DtE. The novelty of this research is to provide a clear method to industries to find out in their information system a environmental optimisation support...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ecodesigning</b> {{a product}} {{consists}} (amongst other things) in assessing what its environmental impacts will be throughout its life (that {{is to say}} from its design phase to its end of life), in order to limit them. Some tools and methods exist to (eco) design a product, just like methods that assess its environmental impacts (more often, a posteriori). But it is now well accepted {{that these are the}} early design decisions that will initiate the greatest consequences on the product’s end-of-life options and their impacts. Thus, the present work aims at analysing traditional design tools, so as to integrate end-of-life possibilities in the form of recommendations for the design step. This proposal will be illustrated by means of a wind turbine design. EcoSD networ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} {{the barriers}} to the ecological transition of lighting, notably the ones faced by European firms, notably SMEs, when trying to produce <b>ecodesigned</b> LED systems that can substantially reduce the ecological impacts of lighting. The multilevel perspective (MLP) is used to analyse these barriers and their interactions, {{as well as to}} suggest strategies and policies to overcome them. The ecological impacts of lighting technologies concern pollutions, the exhaustion of resources, and global environmental changes, and occur at each phase of the lifecycle. ( [...] .) New lighting solutions such as <b>ecodesigned</b> LED can contribute to overcome these ecological challenges by reducing the use of energy a nd other raw materials as well as lighting wastes. They can also help overcome societal challenges by creating jobs in a cleaner economic sector and by reducing the lighting gap, as evidenced by the diffusion of LED systems fuelled by renewables in develop ing countries (Adkins et al. (2010), Harish et al. (2013)). As Hall et al. (2014 : 5) underline, "approximately two billion people currently {{do not have access to}} electricity and have to rely on candles and kerosene - based lighting, a dangerous, unhealthy, e xpensive and poor quality alternative". Besides providing strategy and policy recommendations to European LED firms and policy makers, from an academic perspective this study is the first of its kind to study barriers to ec o - innovation in the LED sector. This paper also brings out specific features of the LED sector by contrasting it with other sectors for which barriers to eco - innovation have been analysed. Finally, it also 50 constitutes a first attempt to construct solutions to overcome barriers to eco - in novation by using the multilevel perspective...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMost of methodologies, {{concepts}} and tools, which integrate Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) systems and aim at <b>ecodesigning,</b> are generally oriented {{to the environmental}} assessment. The environmental improvement is treated only in a few works; however it is a pivotal phase in the eco-design process. In this paper, we propose a new environmental improvement process based on the remaining Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) for CAD designer on which he can act to eco-design his/her CAD model. The originality in this process is {{the expression of a}} CAD model environmental impacts in function of CAD designer DoFs, aiming at help non environment experiment designer to eco-design products in CAD phase. For this, first, we present the concept of DoFs and we use it to identify the CAD designer action zone. Second, we establish the impact matrix of DoFs in each life phase, then; we develop the global impact matrix. The assembly of EIs by linear summation of the matrix columns shows the most impacting ones. Finally, we consider a case study to valid our proposed approach and results are shown in function of DoFs...|$|R
40|$|Completed {{the first}} decade, {{we can go}} back and analyze the rapid changes {{occurring}} in our society {{in the early years of}} this century. Concepts such as technological development and consumerism, which emphasize the need to acquire new products, are giving way to new anti system trends based on the sharing of goods in search of new opportunities to maximize and reuse of resources. Concepts and design methodologies such as Cradle to Cradle begin to fall short: The new ideas are proposed toward new behaviors and new attitudes. Within this idiosyncrasy, society and the arts see the rise of terms such as "anarchism of the object" or the so-called "sensemaking. " Anarchism of the object tries to turn the paradigm imposed temporarily by producers. It advocates for the opposition against the objects themselves, as they are understood today, and their system. On the other hand, the "sensemaking " is defined as the process by which a person gives meaning to the world he perceives, creating a self-knowledge. Objects are static, materialized, while otherwise,. the ideas on which they rely do not have a tangible reality, which gives us a very valid business tool. Since we can reverse the process, the time of the objects imbued with new ideas beyond to what they were intended. This presentation describes the historical regression resulting in the need to develop these new concepts, rooted in the pursuit of consumer activism in favor of finding new models and systems, trying to get the product designed to transcend the development of <b>ecodesigned</b> 2 FROM THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TO THE ERA OF IDEAS: EMERGENCE OF “ANARCHISM OF THE OBJECT” products, reaching to the development of new attitudes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceArchitecturology is a {{scientific}} french {{field of research}} in architecture anchored within the cognitive and the design sciences. Specific {{to the field of}} architecture, Architecturology offers {{a scientific}} systemic language that describes how shapes and measurements are attributed to the architectural and/or urban space. It primarily serves to implement research methods by which examining cases of arc hitecture and urban space design, with the aim to explain the cognitive operations undertaken by designers to conceive their shapes. This paper presents an outline of these research methods implemented to understand the ways in which it is possible to design ecological spaces. It is built on previous works which draw kinds of identity cards on the possibilities to consider ecology in giving shapes and measurements of future space. These works decorticate pioneer texts of Sitte, Cerdà and Unwin and show that, even before an awareness of issues related to environmental protection and sustainability, theories of urban design took into account this dimension. They also explain how Hammarby Sjöstad, GWL terrein, the neighborhood of Vauban and Bedzed were <b>ecodesigned.</b> The study analyzed here is the current typically French case of Sénart, a New Town close to Paris, within which diverse eco neighborhoods are in design. Methods of collecting and analyzing data are explained and the first results are presented. It shows how the requirements and perspectives of regional policies are involved in the design, what are the mechanisms for judging architecture developed in these cases and what are the preferred cognitive operations of designing ecological urban spaces. It al so identifies the mechanisms of cooperative and collaborative design involved in these cases and approaches the analysis to the Pattern language of Alexander and his team...|$|R
