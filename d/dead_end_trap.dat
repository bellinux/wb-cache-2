40|$|Obstacle {{avoidance}} is {{an important}} part of an autonomous navigation system. One method of obstacle avoidance is the use of simple vector fields. Simple vector fields used for obstacle avoidance consist of a repulsive force centred on the obstacle (obstacle vector field) that guides the vehicle away from the obstacle. This is added directly to an existing vector field (environmental vector field) that guides the vehicle towards the goal to produce a resultant force on a vehicle. This method has been shown to avoid obstacles but does have limitations, the most common of which is that the vehicle can become trapped in a ‘U’ shaped dead end. This study outlines a method of vector field navigation that blends the environmental and obstacle vector fields instead of adding them directly together. The navigation method will also use rotational vector fields for obstacle avoidance instead of repulsive forces. It will be shown that this method can be used for avoiding obstacles as well as evading the ‘U’ shaped or <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> <b>trap.</b> Tommie Liddy, Tien-Fu Lu, Peter Lozo, David Harve...|$|E

The laboratory was a second home, and many friends have left, as I am now leaving. I am glad to have this opportunity to name some of those people who have had the most outstanding impacts. First and foremost I must thank Charlie for all of the guidance and mentorship he has provided as my advisor. He granted me great freedom to devise solutions and even to set some questions. He did not however leave me alone, but pointed out the <b>dead</b> <b>ends</b> and <b>traps,</b> and offered ways forward. As I started in the lab, Cristian Staii was in his post-defense time.

After the militants cornered the combined U.S.-Afghan patrol in a <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> street, the <b>trapped</b> soldiers were forced to call in airstrikes in order to escape. A spokesman for the United States military in Afghanistan confirmed that after receiving heavy fire 'from multiple directions' {{in the village of}} Boz Qandahari, west of Kunduz, service members responded in order to defend themselves, and U.S. Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft were called in to conduct airstrikes as part of the operation, in addition to support from AH-64 Apache helicopters. According to a local Afghan source, the insurgents were successful in initially surrounding the patrol, forcing them to call for air support.|$|R

50|$|Later that day, {{the party}} is rejoined by Fflewddur on the run and by Taran's pet crow Kaw on the wing. Kaw has spotted Magg and Eilonwy on horse and Taran determines to pursue alone rather than return to Dinas Rhydnant or {{try to find the}} {{official}} party. Kaw leads them to the river Alaw and some recent tracks of Magg and Eilonwy's horses. Further, Rhun finds Eilonwy's golden bauble - the Golden Pelydryn - near a rock, where it appears that they dismounted and fetched a boat. The companions build a hasty raft to follow downstream, but it disintegrates before reaching the mouth. Harvesting young willows for repairs, Rhun manages to tumble into a deep pit, and his attempted rescue prompts a landslide that traps all four, but the pit then opens up into spectacular caverns. None of {{the party is}} able to light the bauble, but it glows for Taran after he has given up and turned his thoughts to Eilonwy. They explore by its light and eventually find Glew, who is trapped by his giant size. The companions promise him Dallben's aid and persuade him to show them a way out, but he leads them to a <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> tunnel and <b>traps</b> them. Sobbing pitifully, he explains that he knows the recipe for a potion that will diminish him, but he must kill one of them for a final ingredient - the victim shall be their choice.|$|R

40|$|It is known, {{that the}} {{existence}} of <b>dead</b> <b>ends</b> (of arbitrary depth) in the Cayley graph of a group depends on the chosen set of generators. Nevertheless there exist many groups, which do not have <b>dead</b> <b>ends</b> of arbitrary depth with respect to any set of generators.

Only few examples of groups with unbounded <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> depth are known. We show that the Houghton group H 2 with respect to the standard generating set is a further example.

40|$|AbstractAlthough alkaline-surfactant-polymer {{flooding}} is {{proved to}} be efficient for oil recovery from petroleum reservoirs, effects of existence of <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> pores on this process need more discussions. In this work, several ASP flooding tests constituted from 4 polymers, 1 surfactant and 1 alkaline were performed on micromodels designed in four various <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> pore distributions initially saturated with crude oil. The results showed that although using ASP solution constituted from hydrolyzed polymers at high molecular weights significantly increases oil recovery factor due to increasing apparent viscosity of the solution, using sulfonated polymers in ASP solution increases oil recovery much more because of their capability to increase viscosity even in saline solutions. In addition, {{it was concluded that}} the number of <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> pores as well as their distribution with respect to the flow direction are two main characteristics that identify the efficiency of brine and ASP floods in <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> porous media. Moreover, although in ASP flooding, since the viscosity is higher and the front is flatter, the role of the number of <b>dead</b> <b>ends</b> on the recovery efficiency is more identifiable than the role of dead ends’ distribution, in waterflooding, since the mobility ratio is not low enough, the role of <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> direction with respect to the flow direction plays a more significant role in recovery process. So, considering the efficient direction of injection is too important during waterflooding and chemical EOR especially in reservoirs that have a remarkable percentage of <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> pores in their geological structure...|$|R
