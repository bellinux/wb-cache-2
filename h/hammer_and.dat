5|$|This emblem was in turn {{replaced}} by a new one in 1950. The central feature of this symbol is a crossed <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> sickle, a universal Communist symbol symbolizing the unity of workers and peasants. Below this symbol, a sun is shown rising behind a globe. The insignia is framed by ears of wheat, each ear ending in flowers; clover {{on the left and}} flax on the right. A red ribbon is wrapped around the ears of wheat, reminiscent of the red flag used by the Communist movement. The base of the emblem shows the letters БССР. The ribbon features the phrase Workers of the World, Unite! The left side inscribed in Belarusian, the right side in Russian. The red star of Communism is featured above the <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> sickle. The 1950 version was designed by Ivan Dubasov, a People's Artist of the USSR. Article 119 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR defines the design of the emblem.|$|E

In 2014, he {{announced}} that he had funding and was working on assembling his team, and that the film would be called The Birth of a Nation, in an ironic reappropriation of the infamously racist 1915 film of the same name. In addition to writing and directing, Parker cast himself as Turner. Aja Naomi King, Armie <b>Hammer</b> <b>and</b> Gabrielle Union were also cast in key roles.|$|E

5|$|The flag {{does not}} differ {{significantly}} from {{the flag of the}} Byelorussian SSR, other than the removal of the <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> sickle and the red star, and the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern. While there is no official interpretation for the colors of the flag, an explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation's forefathers, while green represents life.|$|E

5|$|When Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, Fuchs {{decided to}} leave Kiel, where the NSDAP was {{particularly}} strong {{and he was a}} well-known KPD member. He enrolled at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. On 28 February, he took an early train to Berlin for a KPD meeting there. On the train, he read about the Reichstag fire in a newspaper. Fuchs correctly assumed that opposition parties would be blamed for the fire, and quietly removed his <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> sickle lapel pin.|$|E
5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Tomás Eloy Martínez {{published}} Santa Evita, a fictionalized work propounding {{many new}} {{stories about the}} escapades of the corpse. Allegations that her body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Coronel Koenig and his assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that her body had been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that the corpse had been damaged with a <b>hammer,</b> <b>and</b> {{that one of the}} wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the main}} event, Triple H faced Kevin Nash inside Hell in a Cell for the World Heavyweight Championship, with Mick Foley as the guest referee. During {{the start of}} the match, both men used a steel chair, a <b>hammer,</b> <b>and</b> the cell to their advantage. Eventually, Nash hit Triple H with a barbed wire bat many times before Triple H hit him with the steel steps. As Triple H brought a {{sledgehammer}} into the ring, Foley attempted to take it away from him, resulting in Triple H hitting Foley and Nash with a steel chair. Triple H followed up, Pedigreeing Nash. During this time, Foley had recuperated and was able to officiate the pinfall made by Triple H on Nash, thus Triple H retained the World Heavyweight Title.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{killed at}} least three people in Singapore and Thailand, and may have killed others in Belize, Mexico, and the United States. His modus operandi was to pose as a tourist and {{converse}} with another randomly chosen caucasian, either aboard their flights or while waiting at airports. He stayed in the same hotels as his victims in a room near theirs. Once he had an excuse {{to be in their}} rooms, he used an electroshock weapon to immobilise them before killing them by striking their heads with a <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> cutting them up in their bathrooms. He chose caucasians as his victims because they were vacationing far away from their home countries, which made him less likely to be discovered. His motive apparently included money, as large amounts were withdrawn using the credit cards of Gerard Lowe and Timothy MacDowall.|$|E
