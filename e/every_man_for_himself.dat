25|$|Not all the {{soldiers}} were agreed to stay together. They began grumbling and thinking {{that it was going}} to be <b>every</b> <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>himself</b> as the bison hunters described it. Two men fell behind and were lost to Nolan. Through the pounding heat and endless march, men began to fall. Nolan continued to assign the strongest with the weakest. The desire for water stood above all else as Nolan headed south-east toward where he knew water was.|$|E

500|$|Witnesses {{maintained}} that {{immediately after the}} bomb blast there was an exchange of gunshots between police and demonstrators. Accounts vary widely as to who fired first and whether any of the crowd fired at the police. Historian Paul Avrich maintains that the police fired on the fleeing demonstrators, reloaded and then fired again, killing four and wounding as many as 70 people. What is not disputed is that {{in less than five}} minutes the square was empty except for the casualties. According to the May 4 New York Times demonstrators began firing at the police, who then returned fire. In his report on the incident, Inspector Bonfield wrote that he [...] "gave the order to cease firing, fearing that some of our men, in the darkness might fire into each other". An anonymous police official told the Chicago Tribune, [...] "A very large number of the police were wounded by each other's revolvers. ... It was <b>every</b> <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>himself,</b> and while some got two or three squares away, the rest emptied their revolvers, mainly into each other." ...|$|E
500|$|While the captain's {{attention}} was fully occupied in vain attempts to impose order, {{a group of}} the ship's engineers, led by Chief Engineer J. W. Rogers, quietly appropriated {{one of the two}} remaining lifeboats. They maintained they required the boat for a final attempt at plugging the leaks; anyone who questioned their intentions, or attempted to board the boat, was threatened with firearms. [...] With ample food and water, this boat left the ship half full, occupied entirely by engine room staff. [...] Of the ship's officers only Luce and Fourth Officer Francis Dorian now remained; [...] virtually all the engineers and seamen had left. Around 300 people were still on board, with a single lifeboat. As a final measure to give at least some of these a chance of survival, Luce ordered the building of a raft. The fore and main yardarms, with various beams, spars and other wooden artifacts, were collected and lowered into the sea where Dorian, in the remaining boat, attempted to supervise the raft's construction. [...] Despite Dorian's entreaties, his boat was rapidly overwhelmed; to save it he cut loose, leaving a final terrified scramble for whatever security the half-finished raft could provide. [...] Among those who found safety in Dorian's boat was a fireman, Patrick Tobin. According to his later account: [...] "It was <b>every</b> <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>himself.</b> No more {{attention was}} paid to the captain than to any other man on board. Life was as sweet to us as to others".|$|E
2500|$|On a 2005 co-headlining {{tour with}} Velvet Revolver, the band {{received}} a chilly reception from some audiences and {{rumors of a}} feud between Robb and Velvet Revolver frontman Scott Weiland were soon filling Internet message boards. [...] "If I Were You" [...] from <b>Every</b> <b>Man</b> <b>for</b> <b>Himself</b> addressed the whole affair. Robb later {{said in an interview}} with MTV News online that he has nothing against Scott Weiland or any other member of Velvet Revolver.|$|E

60|$|If <b>every</b> <b>man</b> {{produced}} <b>for</b> <b>himself,</b> or {{with his}} capital employed others to produce, everything which he required, customers and their wants {{would be a}} matter of profound indifference to him.

5000|$|... "The Yellow Streak" [...] is an {{internal}} story of class snobbery, racism and frail human {{nature in the}} face of death. Izzart is an insecure snob with a secret who is put in charge of the safety of Campion, a mining engineer hired by the Sultan of fictional Sembulu to discover mineral possibilities in Borneo. Drink, vanity, carelessness and self-doubt bring Izzart to cracking point when an incident with a tidal wave on the river means it's <b>every</b> (white) <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>himself.</b> Not only his weakness, but his inner torment is clear to the more experienced Campion.|$|R
2500|$|Their {{third album}} <b>Every</b> <b>Man</b> <b>for</b> <b>Himself</b> was {{released}} in May 2006 and debuted at No.12 on the Billboard chart. [...] Three singles, [...] "If I Were You", [...] "Inside of You", and [...] "Born to Lead", were released. Another single, [...] "If Only", was planned to be released but was canceled for unknown reasons, possibly because of the low chart achievements {{of the first three}} singles. Despite this, the album has been certified Gold in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Charles {{managed to}} muster enough English archers {{to form a}} last line of defence before the camp, but these were routed before a bow could be bent, their {{commander}} shot by a Swiss skirmisher. Traditionally, the Duke of Somerset is identified as {{the commander of the}} English archers. However, the only Duke of Somerset, Edmund Beaufort who was known to have been in Burgundian service died in 1471 at Tewkesbury in England and therefore could not have been at Murten five years later. [...] Then it was <b>every</b> <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>himself</b> as Charles ordered the army to fall back which was interpreted as a retreat, which in turn became a rout as all organized resistance ended.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese {{closed in}} on Đà Nẵng amid the chaos caused by Thiệu's {{confused}} leadership. Within a few days I Corps was beyond control. The South Vietnamese tried to evacuate from the other urban enclaves into Đà Nẵng, but the 1st Division collapsed after its commander, Brigadier General Nguyễn Văn Diệm, angered by Thiệu's abandonment, told his men, [...] "We've been betrayed ... It is now sauve qui peu (<b>every</b> <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>himself)</b> ... ee you in Đà Nẵng." [...] The overland march, pummeled by communist artillery the entire way, degenerated into chaos as the 1st Division descended into anarchy as it moved toward Đà Nẵng. The remainder of the force deserted or began looting. Only a minority survived and some disillusioned officers committed suicide.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Whether {{the world}} {{would have been a}} gainer or a loser by the {{exchange}} [...] is a question which <b>every</b> <b>man</b> must answer <b>for</b> <b>himself,</b> according to [...] his own tastes and opinions; but the possibility of such a change in [...] the course of events warrants us in treating what would otherwise be a [...] strictly private matter as one of public interest.|$|R
60|$|<b>Every</b> <b>man</b> braced <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> the shock. Henrik Gjertsen, {{the sailor}} at the wheel, spread his legs, {{crouched}} down, and stiffened {{his shoulders and}} arms to hand-grips on opposite spokes of the wheel. Several of the crew fled from the waist to the poop, and others of them sprang into the main-rigging. Daughtry, {{one hand on the}} rail, with his free arm clasped the Ancient Mariner around the waist.|$|R
5000|$|The Social Contract is a {{theoretical}} construct of political philosophy which explains {{the origins and}} legitimacy of government {{in general and the}} origins and legitimacy of nations as political entities in particular. It is both a hypothetical and actual agreement among individuals to create a cooperative, civil society and thus form a larger, interdependent political unit. The term “social contract” is derived from various political philosophers such as John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-Jacque Rousseau. A famous phrase attributed to Thomas Hobbes states that prior to the creation of government by means of the social contract, humans were in a “state of war”, where <b>every</b> <b>man</b> lived <b>for</b> <b>himself.</b> In such an environment, life was characterized as “nasty, brutish, and short.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Writing for The New Yorker, Richard Brody {{called the}} film [...] "Godardian", {{comparing}} it to Pierrot le Fou (1965), <b>Every</b> <b>Man</b> <b>for</b> <b>Himself</b> (1980), Alphaville (1965), and Germany Year 90 Nine Zero (1991), four classic films by French director Jean-Luc Godard. However, he suggested the film fell short of reaching the same cinematic mastery, adding, [...] "it's {{not a good idea}} for a filmmaker to get in the ring with Mr. Godard". Thematically, he also compared it to Opening Night (1977) by John Cassavetes. Brody said that the actors played in [...] "the sort of modern naturalism, without eccentricity of gesture, excess of expression, or heightened and formalistic precision, that is the business-casual of contemporary cinema." [...] In his critical comments on the film, he concluded that the film [...] "trade on facile, casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce" [...] and [...] "deliver a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama".|$|E
2500|$|For example, when Edward and Richard {{are urging}} York {{to break his}} oath to Henry, Edward says, [...] "But for a kingdom, any oath may be broken;/I would break a {{thousand}} oaths to reign one year" [...] (1.2.16–17), thus showing the attraction that power has for the characters, and what {{they would be willing}} to do to attain it. Later, echoing Warwick's statement about his reasons for joining the Lancastrians, Richard outlines why he has remained loyal to the Yorkists; [...] "I stay not for the love of Edward but the crown" [...] (4.1.125), again showing the attraction of power and the subversion of all other concerns, including familial relations. Another example is when Prince Edward is killed in Act 5, Scene 5. His death is brought about because he taunts the Plantagenet brothers, and they lose their temper with him, not because they are exacting revenge for an ongoing feud with his family. Similarly, when Richard kills Henry, his motives have nothing to do with the conflict between his family and Henry's. He murders him simply because Henry stands in the way of his attempts to gain the throne. As Michael Hattaway writes, [...] "family loyalties may have been the initial cause of the feuds, but an audience watching 3 Henry VI is likely to feel that individual ambition rather than family honour is what fuels the vendettas that inform the play. Both [...] seem to have forgotten that the quarrel between [...] originally was a dynastic one: their claims to legitimacy and authority in this play are now validated only by the forces they can muster" [...] As Jane Howell, director of the BBC Shakespeare adaptation argues, [...] "anarchy is loosed and you're left with a very different set of values – <b>every</b> <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>himself.</b> You're into a time of change in which there is no code except survival of the fittest – who happens to be Richard." ...|$|E

5000|$|But farther, this question, (Who {{shall be}} judge?) cannot mean, {{that there is}} no judge at all: for where there is no {{judicature}} on earth, to decide controversies amongst men, God in heaven is judge. He alone, it is true, is judge of the right. But <b>every</b> <b>man</b> is judge <b>for</b> <b>himself,</b> as in all other cases, so in this, whether another hath put himself into a state of war with him, and whether he should appeal to the Supreme Judge, as Jeptha did.|$|R
60|$|With this there went, on the {{psychological}} side, the further assumption of a general selfishness or self-seeking as the principal motive of the individual in the economic sphere. Oddly enough this assumption--the most warrantable of the lot--was the earliest to fall under disrepute. The plain assertion that <b>every</b> <b>man</b> looks out <b>for</b> <b>himself</b> (or at best <b>for</b> <b>himself</b> and his immediate family) touches the tender conscience of humanity. It is an unpalatable truth. None the less {{it is the most}} nearly true of all the broad generalizations that can be attempted in regard to mankind.|$|R
50|$|In Michigan, {{there is}} a two to six player variant {{in which there are}} no teams and <b>every</b> <b>man</b> plays <b>for</b> <b>himself.</b> Two boxes are placed next to each other. Multiple {{different}} color washers are used and all players throw towards the two boxes from a distance of twenty feet. Initial player order is randomly determined {{at the start of the}} game and after the first round, is then determined by the player with the most points throwing first, second most - second, and so on. In turn, each player throws all three of his/her washers. Total points are then calculated like a normal washer game with the exception that there are two boxes, and each box scores itself. Scoring and rebutting occurs after all washers have been thrown by all players. The first individual player to 21 points is the winner. Have to win by two. This variation will create team dynamics within the game as the game leader can easily be targeted minimizing their points.|$|R

60|$|The Earl of Dumbarton {{advancing}} towards him, at {{the same}} time, by long marches, while he endeavoured to secure himself by rivers, surprised him passing the Clyde {{in the village of}} Killern, as he was marching towards Lenox. Dumbarton coming upon them at night, would have stayed till the next day to attack the rebels, but they gave him not so much time, for they passed the river in the night, in such confusion, that being overcome by fear, they dispersed as soon as over. Argyle could scarce rally so many as would make him a small guard, which was soon scattered again; Dumbarton having passed the river, and divided his forces to pursue those that fled. Argyle had taken guides to conduct him to Galloway; but they mistaking the way, and leading him into a bog, most of those that still followed him quitted their horses, <b>every</b> <b>man</b> shifting <b>for</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|R

Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats. Now you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month" [...] (.|$|R

With the exception of the sentries, who were changed every hour, the rest slept until late in the afternoon; then the horses were again fed and groomed, and another meal was eaten.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, that {{is their}} lookout.

2500|$|Darwin {{continued}} to play a leading part in the parish work of the local church, but from around 1849 would {{go for a walk}} on Sundays while his family attended church. Though reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he responded that he had never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a god, and that generally [...] "an Agnostic would be the more correct description of my state of mind." [...] He went as far as saying that [...] "Science {{has nothing to do with}} Christ, except insofar as the habit of scientific research makes a man cautious in admitting evidence. For myself, I do not believe that there ever has been any revelation. As for a future life, <b>every</b> <b>man</b> must judge <b>for</b> <b>himself</b> between conflicting vague probabilities." ...|$|R
6000|$|Towards {{the close}} of the evening, however--the poet still {{remaining}} moody, not to say positively grumpy--Senator Wrengold proposed a friendly game of Swedish poker. It was the latest fashionable variant in Western society on the old gambling round, and few of us knew it, save the omniscient poet and the magazine editor. It turned out afterwards that Wrengold proposed that particular game because he had heard Coleyard observe at the Lotus Club the same afternoon that it was a favourite amusement of his. Now, however, for a while he objected to playing. He was a poor man, he said, and the rest were all rich; why should he throw away the value of a dozen golden sonnets just to add one more pinnacle to the gilded roofs of a millionaire's palace? Besides, he was half-way through with an ode he was inditing to Republican simplicity. The pristine austerity of a democratic senatorial cottage had naturally inspired him with memories of Dentatus, the Fabii, Camillus. But Wrengold, dimly aware he was being made fun of somehow, insisted that the poet must take a hand with the financiers. [...] "You can pass, you know," [...] he said, [...] "as often as you like; and you can stake low, or go it blind, according as you're inclined to. It's a democratic game; <b>every</b> <b>man</b> decides <b>for</b> <b>himself</b> how high he will play, except the banker; and you needn't take bank unless you want it." ...|$|R
