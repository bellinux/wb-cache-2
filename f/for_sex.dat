A {{tradition}} of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records of homosexual activity in Greece. In the West, gay men have been using bathhouses <b>for</b> <b>sex</b> since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when homosexual acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in homosexual acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting cruising areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, movie theatres, public lavatories (cottages or tearooms), and gym changing rooms where they could meet other men <b>for</b> <b>sex.</b> Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex between patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet homosexual activity.|$|E

5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Sex</b> Research, who published an in-depth report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Sex</b> Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E

Caracalla's maternal aunt, Julia Maesa, successfully instigated a revolt among the Legio III Gallica to have her eldest grandson (and Caracalla's cousin), Elagabalus, declared emperor in his place. Macrinus was defeated on 8 June 218 at the Battle of Antioch.

40|$|Sex workers {{receive a}} price premium <b>for</b> {{unprotected}} <b>sex.</b> Research has inferred {{that the source}} of this premium is a compensating differential for STI risk. I introduce a compensating differential for pregnancy risk as a novel source of this price premium through a simple model that predicts the price <b>for</b> unprotected <b>sex</b> increasing with the probability of pregnancy through decreased unprotected sex. I empirically test this using a rich panel dataset of 19, 041 sexual transactions by 192 sex workers in Busia, Kenya collected during 2005 and 2006. I use the probability of pregnancy as an instrument <b>for</b> unprotected <b>sex</b> and run two-stage least-squares (2 SLS) regression and find that a compensating differential for pregnancy risk is a source of the price premium <b>for</b> unprotected <b>sex.</b> The price premium for pregnancy risk is as high as USD 122 or about 16 times average price. I also test for a compensating differential for STI risk and clients' disutility for condoms, the other competing theories, and find that a compensating differential for STI risk is also a source of the price premium <b>for</b> unprotected <b>sex,</b> however, I do not find evidence for clients' disutility for condoms as a source of the price premium <b>for</b> unprotected <b>sex.</b> Identifying and estimating sources of the price premium <b>for</b> unprotected <b>sex</b> will allow policymakers to implement interventions that will reduce both the supply and the demand <b>for</b> unprotected <b>sex.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|The largest {{study to}} date {{followed}} {{over a thousand}} people for eight years; it showed an 87% increased risk of death compared to the normal population.

Apart from cardiovascular disease, this study also showed an increased risk of death from lung disease.|$|E
5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire <b>for</b> <b>sex,</b> increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E
5|$|Based on Kinsey's scale where 0 {{represents}} {{a person with}} an exclusively heterosexual response and 6 {{represents a}} person with an exclusively homosexual one, and numbers in between represent a gradient of responses with both sexes, 6% of those interviewed ranked as a 6: exclusively homosexual. Apart from those who ranked 0 (71%), the largest percentage in between 0 and 6 was 1 at approximately 15%. However, the Kinsey Report remarked that the ranking described a period in a person's life, and that a person's orientation may change. Among the criticisms the Kinsey Report received, a particular one addressed the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Sex</b> Research's tendency to use statistical sampling, which facilitated an over-representation of same-sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey's qualifications of data.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange <b>for</b> <b>sex</b> out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

5|$|The Satanic Bible is {{composed}} of four books: The Book of Satan, The Book of Lucifer, The Book of Belial, and The Book of Leviathan. The Book of Satan challenges the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. The Book of Lucifer holds most of the philosophy in The Satanic Bible, with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In The Book of Belial, LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those <b>for</b> <b>sex,</b> compassion, or destruction. The Book of Leviathan provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee's Enochian keys), provided in both Enochian and translated to English.|$|E

50|$|In Kenya where <b>sex</b> <b>for</b> fish {{has been}} well documented, poverty among the fishing {{communities}} has been constantly listed as factors contributing {{to the practice of}} <b>sex</b> <b>for</b> fish. <b>Sex</b> <b>for</b> fish practice in Kenya is popularly referred to as Jaboya system. Jaboya in Luo tribe dialect means customer, however, due to the transactional involvement of fishermen with women fish traders, the locals coined the term Jaboya system to refer to <b>sex</b> <b>for</b> fish phenomenon. Fishmongers in lake side city of Kisumu, have sex with fishermen to get stock to sell {{in order to make a}} living. They have alluded to having children to feed and having to pay rent and school fees as drivers <b>for</b> exchange of <b>sex</b> <b>for</b> fish. In Kenya’s third largest city of Kisumu, Dunga Beach along the shores of Lake Victoria young girls have become the new attraction for fishermen who use their fish catch as a bait to lure these vulnerable group into <b>sex</b> <b>for</b> fish practice fees. The cycle of poverty and vulnerable ensures that older women introduces their younger daughters or orphaned girls to <b>sex</b> <b>for</b> fish trade. In return the young girl sleeps with the fisherman that offers the best deal. In many cases the young girls do have sex with multiple partners and are exposed to STD’s and potentially HIV infections.|$|R
