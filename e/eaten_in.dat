40|$|Abstract: Objective: To {{establish}} what {{is known}} about binge <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> children and adoles-cents and to identify unresolved questions. Method: We reviewed relevant studies to high-light and synthesize salient research findings. Discussion: Available research has suggested that loss of control over eating may be more important than consumption of an objectively large amount of food in the assessment of binge <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> children. In addition, dieting may not be associated consistently with binge <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> children. Behavioral correlates of binges may include <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> the absence of hunger, <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> response to strong emotions or external cues, and <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> secret. On the basis of available research, provisional research criteria for binge <b>eating</b> disorder (BED) <b>in</b> children are suggested to stimulate further study of pediatric samples. We emphasize the need for prospective studies on the relationships among aberrant eating, weight and mood, and the inclusion of boys and girls of differen...|$|R

40|$|Is {{desire to}} <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> {{response}} to positive emotions an 'obese' eating style: a style {{more prevalent in}} people with obesity? In other words: Is Kummerspeck (German: sorrow-fat) for some people a misnomer? This question was addressed in three studies on women. Study 1 (n = 188) tested the moderator effect of subjective well-being on the association of BMI with the scale on desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions (DEBQ-E). Study 2 tested in women (n = 832) whether items on desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to positive emotions loaded on the same factor as those in response to negative emotions and body mass. Study 3 assessed in the total sample (n = 203) and an overweight subsample (n = 40) a) whether self-reported desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to positive emotions predicted actual food intake and b) whether this also held true over and above self-reported desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions. Study 1 showed only for women with low positive affect a significant positive association of BMI with DEBQ-E. In Study 2, only items on desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions loaded on the same factor as BMI. Study 3 : In the total sample, the significant effect on food intake of the scale on desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to positive emotions disappeared when a scale on desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions {{was added to the}} model. In the overweight-subsample there was only an effect on food intake for desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions. It is concluded that only desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions is an 'obese' eating style, suggesting that Kummerspeck is not a misnomer...|$|R

40|$|The ﬁrst aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{association}} between different dimensions of family func- tioning and dysfunctional <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> a sample of Italian adolescent boys and girls. The second aim was to investi- gate whether gender moderates the relationship between family functioning and dysfunctional eating. Seven hun- dred and twenty seven adolescents (500 boys and 227 girls) with ages ranging from 15 to 18 years completed a survey of self-report measures. Findings from hierarchical multi- ple regression analysis suggested that aspects of family functioning such as ﬂexibility, cohesion, disengagement, enmeshment, rigidity and chaotic were related to dys- functional <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> adolescents. Additionally the results indicated differences between boys and girls, <b>in</b> particular dysfunctional <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> adolescent boys seemed to be more affected by dimensions of enmeshment and disengagement than dysfunctional <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> girls. This research highlights the important role of various aspects of family functioning in relation to dysfunctional <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> adolescents...|$|R

The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is <b>eaten</b> <b>in</b> many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are <b>eaten</b> <b>in</b> several countries {{around the world}}, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that octopuses can experience pain. Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.|$|E
