40|$|Abstract — Standardization <b>of</b> <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design {{procedures}} enables {{designers to}} develop their own jib crane automation modules for entire jib crane design applications. Since main effort and time for implementation <b>of</b> the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design procedures are generally spent for interpretation and explanation <b>of</b> the available <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design standards, a computer-automated access by using parametric modeling to the available standards may improve speed, reliability and quality of the design procedures. Starting from the fact that components <b>of</b> <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> are generally composed of similar mechanical and electrical sub-components independent <b>of</b> the <b>crane</b> type, a general component tree <b>of</b> <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is developed for automation purpose. Design Modules <b>of</b> <b>cranes</b> are defined from the developed component tree <b>of</b> the <b>cranes</b> based on the available design procedures. Independent Design Procedures are defined as atomic design modules <b>of</b> the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> design procedures by considering computational approaches and rules in the "F. E. M. Rules " for each jib crane component. The "F. E. M. rules " is selected for this purpose because of its widespread use and established popularity among the jib crane manufacturers. Access to the "F. E. M. Rules " from any design procedure is fully automated by using a systematic approach of parametric modeling. The parametric model can be used for various jib crane design cases as well as further for optimization. “Ref. [6]...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a wider {{analysing}} methodology for construction and static-dynamic behaviour <b>of</b> specific <b>crane’s</b> type – jib crane is given. A considerated methodology is applyable also on other types <b>of</b> <b>cranes,</b> what gives a certain width and expediency of its consideration. An application of CAD technologies and calculation numerical methods to this complex structures is {{of a great}} importance, which gives modern access in the actual design and constructive diagnostics. In this work a comparative analysis of several concept solutions <b>of</b> <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is given, with application of KOMIPS system, as well as detail analysis of a selected solution. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>jib</b> <b>crane's</b> design is given also by application of the I-DEAS 11 NX Series software.

40|$|An {{iterative}} {{learning control}} (ILC) strategy is proposed, and implemented on simple pendulum and double pendulum models <b>of</b> an overhead <b>crane</b> undergoing simultaneous traveling and hoisting maneuvers. The approach {{is based on}} generating shaped commands using the full nonlinear equations of motion combined with the iterative learning control, to use as acceleration commands to the <b>jib</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crane.</b> These acceleration commands are tuned to eliminate residual oscillations in rest-to-rest maneuvers. The performance of the proposed strategy is tested using an experimental scaled model <b>of</b> an overhead <b>crane</b> with hoisting. The shaped command is derived analytically and validated experimentally. Results obtained showed that the proposed ILC control strategy is capable of eliminating travel and residual oscillations in simple and double pendulum models with hoisting. It is also shown, in all cases, that the proposed approach has a low sensitivity to the initial cable lengths...|$|R

The impact sent the helicopter plunging towards the ground, where it exploded, killing Barnes and a pedestrian, Matthew Wood, 39. A further thirteen people were injured. Barnes, {{who had been}} en route from Redhill to Elstree to collect a passenger, was flying across London in low clouds and freezing temperatures, and had asked Air Traffic Control {{for a change of}} route and permission to land at the London Heliport in Battersea. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch announced an inquiry into the incident, while David Cameron said there would be a review into the rules governing helicopter flights over central London. The crash was the first fatal helicopter crash in central London since records began in 1976. A report published by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch on 23 January indicated the client Barnes was to collect had expressed concerns about the weather and twice suggested he delay take-off, but Barnes had already started his engines.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{work had}} progressed {{sufficiently}} {{on the support}} structures, a giant [...] "creeper crane" [...] was erected {{on each side of}} the harbour. These cranes were fitted with a cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into position to allow for erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the arches, tunnels were excavated on each shore with steel cables passed through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to stop them collapsing as they extended outwards.Arch construction itself began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on ahead of the northern end, to detect any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would [...] "creep" [...] along the arches as they were constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. In less than two years, on Tuesday, 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched for the first time. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support cables to be removed. On 20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of Australia and the United Kingdom from the <b>jibs</b> <b>of</b> the creeper <b>cranes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The study involves: 1) {{formation}} of an array of geometry, weight and variable data for the automated synthesis <b>of</b> articulated <b>jib</b> systems; 2) development of methodology of calculation and determination of rational design parameters <b>of</b> the articulated <b>jib</b> systems, depending on the main technical parameters <b>of</b> the portal <b>crane</b> (maximum and minimum working radius, cargo lift height, tail radius value, carrying capacity of crane); 3) conducting {{of the study of}} the methodology adequacy on computer portal crane models. Methodology. To determine the kinematic characteristics of each link <b>of</b> the articulated <b>jib</b> system (boom, arm, jib tie, counterweight, load) we developed a dynamic and mathematical models that allow us to describe the movement <b>of</b> the articulated <b>jib</b> system when luffing.

40|$|Abstract-The study {{includes}} {{an investigation of}} the stresses, deflections, shear capacity and lateral-torsional buckling behavior of regular I section cantilever beam <b>of</b> <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> subjected to a uniformly distributed load (self-weight) and a concentrated load at the free end. The lateral torsional buckling is the main failure mode that controls the design of “slender ” beams. Different shapes of cantilevers are proposed in this study with different cross section, web shapes and materials. Finite element analysis and experimental study are carried out on both types (i. e. Regular and proposed beam) to calculate and validate results. An optimization technique is used to optimize the solution from proposed different designs. The thickness of the web and flange is constant for all specimens with length 3 to 6 m and tested for 250 Kg and 500 Kg load lifting capacity. Structural analysis is done to examine the influence of the section dimension due to point load at the free end and uniformly distributed load on cantilever. Using the study it is observed that not only the web thickness, but also the shape of web and sectional cross section of cantilever beam influences the resistance to lateral torsional buckling and bending...|$|R
