His breakthrough performance came at the Swiss national Oyama Cup in 1979 {{at the age of}} fifteen when he defeated several opponents much older than himself to take the tournament crown. In 1981, Hug had an upsurge in competition as {{he was part of the}} Swiss team that defeated the Dutch in the finals to win the 4 Countries Team Tournament and recorded his first international success by taking a bronze medal at the 5th Dutch Kyokushin Championships in the 80 kg/176 lb middleweight division in Weert, Netherlands as he lost out to Koen Scharrenberg in the semi-finals. He also won the Swiss Oyama Cup for a second time that year, beating Heinz Muntweiler in the final, before further establishing himself as the country's top Kyokushin fighter by winning the 1982 Swiss Championships at middleweight. After reaching the round of sixteen in both the 2nd European Championships and the 6th Dutch Open, being eliminated by Jean-Pierre Louisset and Kenneth <b>Felter</b> respectively, Hug closed out the year by being crowned champion at the 1st Ibusz Oyama Cup in Budapest, Hungary where he defeated Mark Niedziokka in the final.|$|E

2500|$|At that time, two Dutch Reformed congregations, one in West New Hempstead, New York (known informally as the Brick Church) and {{the other}} in Ramapo, New Jersey were united as a single church with the Rev. James D. Demarest as their pastor since September 21, 1809. Demarest joined the secession movement, and on June 11, 1824, he led 68 members of the two congregations, {{including}} two elders, out of the Dutch Reformed Church. The people who seceded from the Brick Church established themselves as a new independent congregation in Monsey and were therefore referred to as the Seceder church. Its first elders were Garret Serven (Sarven), Joseph Iserman, Teunis VanHouten, and Peter C. VanHouten, and its deacons were Peter Serven (Sarven), Stephen VanOrden, and Cornelius Springsteen. One of the members was Jacob <b>Felter,</b> a veteran of the War of 1812 buried in the Historic Monsey Cemetery. On April 26, 1825, the Monsey Church petitioned Classis Hackensack of the newly formed True Reformed Dutch Church to receive them into care, and this was granted.

Despite his short stature and unimposing appearance (earning him the nickname, [...] "Mouse"), he becomes a highly capable officer.

40|$|Felt has {{a unique}} history as both a craft medium and an {{industrial}} material. Recently, {{it has become a}} material of intense interest to architects and designers. Felt is a very ancient and primitive material, made by simply matting together wool fibers with moisture and friction. It is a manufactured product, yet it shares many properties with purely natural materials. As a raw material for design, felt has incredible range — it can be made thin and translucent, or very dense and thick, even hard. Its plasticity is inviting a shift in the relationship of textiles to architecture and design. Claudy Jongstra is a Dutch designer and felt-maker who is known for her particularly rawlooking felt fabrics. Through intense experimentation with the wool fleece and the felting process, she has developed a completely unique style which is highly refined in its craftsmanship, yet feels primal, with the gravitas of a natural material like wood or stone. Early in her career, Jongstra made a very active decision to produce felt on an architectural scale. When Anni Albers wrote “The Pliable Plane” in 1957, she expressed a vision for an integrated, rather than decorative, role for textiles in architecture, and Claudy Jongstra has come very close to realizing that goal. In the past five years, she has created works for some of Holland’s most important public buildings - the prime minister’s residence, The Hague, the Kunsthal in Rotterdam, the new Central Library in Amsterdam — and all of these buildings prominently feature her felts not as works of art commissioned to adorn public spaces, but rather as architectural materials which serve specific technical, as well as aesthetic, functions. Jongstra’s home and studio are on an acre of land north of Amsterdam, in a village called Spannum. She keeps a flock of 200 sheep, mostly Drenthe Heath, an endangered species indigenous to The Netherlands. She practices non-invasive farming techniques, and her herd is used as part of a managed grazing system designed to maintain the delicate moor ecology of Friesland. She uses only natural dyes, and has begun growing her own dyestuffs. She employs a shepherd and shearer, four to six <b>felters,</b> two dyers, three design assistants, and a business manager. The humbleness and charm of the farm environment belie the scale she is working on. Jongstra has collaborated on many architectural projects in Europe requiring literally tens of thousands of square feet of felt...|$|R

5000|$|... “The {{origin of}} the {{department}} {{dates back to the}} burning of a barn in {{the lower part of the}} village on the property of George E. DeNoyelles on January 24, 1854. This event demonstrated the necessity of some sort of an equipped. And organized department, in order that the citizens of those days would be better able to guard their homes and property against the ravages of fire. The DeNoyelles fire occurred on a Sunday evening just as the late reverend A. S. Freeman was about to deliver his sermon. One of the congregation sitting near the door and hearing the alarm became so excited that he arose in his pew and shouted, “We are all on fire!” To tell it as the doctor afterwards described the incident: “There was a sudden vision of coat tails flying out behind and a precipitous retreat of men, women and children, and finding myself standing in the pulpit facing empty seats 1 concluded to suspend the services with the benediction.” Although the good people never said so, it can be safely assumed that he joined the rest of his congregation in fighting the fire and organizing the first company of the department. So, the days following the DeNoyelles fire striking posters in the biggest type then in vogue were distributed throughout the village. These posters or dodgers read: “FIRE, FIRE, FIRE ”!! ■‘Citizens of Haverstraw, will you meet with us on Saturday evening next, January the twenty-eighth, at the ball-room of the American Hotel, and assist in raising [...]an amount of money sufficient to purchase the necessary apparatus for a hook and ladder company “Signed: James Creney, Samuel Cosgrove, Samson Marks, John Begg, John <b>Felter.</b> C.
