5|$|Joyce concocted {{a number}} of money-making schemes during this period, {{including}} an attempt to become a cinema magnate in Dublin. He frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were {{for a long time}} displayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> their premises in Dublin. Joyce's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, nativists {{returned}} in greater numbers. During the rally, {{it began to}} rain, and the meeting was moved into a nearby market. The inflammatory remarks continued inside the market, where fighting broke out between the local Irish Catholics and the nativists. Fighting spilled outside the market, where nativists were shot at by people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> nearby buildings. One or two nativists were reportedly killed. George Shiffler, an 18 year old leather worker, was the first nativist killed in the riots of 1844. A mob of nativists attacked the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity and several Catholic homes before the riot ended. Numerous people were injured, and two more nativists were killed.|$|E
5|$|The Decorated Gothic style, with traceried windows, {{is further}} {{subdivided}} dependent upon whether the tracery is Geometric or Curvilinear. Many cathedrals have important {{parts in the}} Geometric style of the mid 13th to early 14th centuries, including much of Lincoln, Lichfield, the choir of Ely and the chapter houses of Salisbury and Southwell. By the late 13th century the style of tracery evolved to include {{a greater number of}} narrow shapes that adapted easily to Gothic openings in combination with circular shapes as can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the chapter house of York, the Octagon of Ely and the west window of Exeter.|$|E

25|$|After the {{execution}} the mob became violent {{and began to}} stone the City Guard. Accounts of events are confused, but what is certain is that Captain Porteous instructed his men to fire above {{the heads of the}} crowd but, in so doing, they shot and wounded people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the high tenement buildings opposite. The crowd became increasingly violent and, as panic set in, Captain Porteous ordered the guard to shoot into the mob, which led to the deaths of six people in all.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression, Prestini was {{sometimes}} laid off by Washington Brick & Lime {{for several months}} at a time. For {{a couple of years}} he drifted and worked odd jobs in Chicago, San Francisco, Mexico, Hawaii, and various other places. Although he had long been sculpting original terra cotta art pieces, he didn't begin painting seriously until his return to Clayton in 1936. He was likely inspired in part by Charles Sater, a fellow terra cotta modeler who did religious-themed oil paintings. Prestini's early work was in the Regionalist style popular at the time, but had a strange, dark cast, reflecting his deep forebodings over the growth of mechanization and the rise of fascism in Europe. In 1940 a series of paintings he called the Pages of History was briefly displayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> a downtown Spokane stationery store before public complaints over their grim content led to their removal. These same works were better received when he took them to Los Angeles, earning a laudatory article in the Sunday Los Angeles Times.|$|E
25|$|The guard room above {{included}} an iron cell for drunks and less dangerous prisoners including women. Due to the courthouse's small size, the county needed to rent additional office space nearly immediately after completion. The building's inadequate space {{combined with a}} leaking roof would cause repairs and improvements to consume the majority of commissioners' time after 1982. In 1883, county commissioners denounced the building as too small and {{badly in need of}} repairs. After publishing an invitation for bids to construct a new, two-floor facility, they accepted one offered by Keesey due to his original land donation. One month later, after political infighting that resulted in the resignation of the county judge, all bids were then rejected. In the aftermath, the next meeting of the Commissioners Court called for a new tax levy to provide additional rooms for the jail and county clerk's office and five iron cages for upper jail cell. Although the cages were indeed installed, there is little proof that the building underwent any further expansion. In 1884, glass was installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the clerk's office, and the sheriff was ordered to remove the water closet and fill the well in the courtyard.|$|E

25|$|The {{stained glass}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the south aisle depict the eleven apostles without Judas Iscariot. They were donated {{in the middle}} of the 19thcentury by the Stubbs family, {{industrialists}} in Warrington. The east window of the Daniell chapel includes characters from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The window was erected following a memorial fund to celebrate the centenary of Carroll's birth in 1935. It was designed by Geoffrey Webb and dedicated on 30 June 1935 by Herbert Jones (Bishop of Warrington). The upper panels depict a nativity scene surmounted by eight angels, the leftmost panel showing Lewis Carroll himself accompanied by Alice Liddell. The windows incorporate symbolic panels relating to Carroll's life, including the Cheshire wheatsheaf, the arms of Rugby School and Christ Church, Oxford, and mathematical instruments. Across the base of the window are five panels which include characters from the Alice books together with words from Carroll's poem Christmas Greetings. The characters are based on the illustrations by John Tenniel. On the south wall are windows designed by Trena Cox depicting The Flight into Egypt and The Annunciation which were donated to the church in 1960 in memory of the Broome family of Preston-on-the-Hill.|$|E
25|$|Provided is {{an excerpt}} from Mansions and Manors of Herefordshire {{describing}} his home, and burial in the church of Bodenham Devereux: The manor-house, formerly called “Devereux Court” and now the “Moat,” is situated near the Church, and is a timber mansion of great antiquity. It probably formed the residence of Sir Walter Devereux who was the Sheriff, 50 and 51 Edward III, and whose monument was {{to be seen in}} the church forty years ago. Dingley (Hist. from Marble. Part I, ccxxxvi.) gives a sketch of it, from which we gather that it represented a knight in chain-armour with a sleeveless surcoat over the hawberk. The sword is on the right side and attached to a jeweled belt. The hands are crossed above the breast, on which are depicted the arms of Devereux. These are repeated at intervals on the upper plinth, where a French inscription is partially legible. Sir Walter obtained licence for a market and fair at his manor of Bodenham, and probably contributed largely to the re-building of the church, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> which were to be seen the arms of Devereux and the cognizance of Richard II – the white hart lodged – together with the arms of that monarch and those of Delabere, Lucy, and Brydges. All these memorials have now perished; the alabaster slab, on which the effigy of Sir Walter was incised, was broken into fragments at the restoration of the church in 1834.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, a Rolling Stone {{magazine}} interviewer asked The Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme about {{a possible}} sequel. Demme responded that Thomas Harris, author of The Silence of the Lambs, {{had been working on}} the follow-up for [...] "seven or eight years". Demme had an idea even at that time {{that it would not be}} a straight follow-up. Harris had told Demme: [...] "I imagine Doctor Lecter going somewhere in Europe... strolling round the streets of Florence or Munich, gazing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> watchmakers..." [...] Demme stated his intention to be involved in the film adaptation of Hannibal in 1998, less than a year before the novel was published.|$|E
500|$|Born in Fort Smith, Arkansas on January 24, 1917, Sims {{was one of}} 12 children. The family soon {{relocated}} to Los Angeles, California, where he was raised. Describing his childhood, Sims said, [...] "It was just a whole big dancing family." [...] He learned to dance from his father, {{and said he was}} dancing as soon as he could walk. He began tap-dancing at the age of 3. He attributed some of his early love for tap dancing in particular to his mother, exasperated that he kept wearing out the toes of his shoes, putting steel taps on the shoes. Along with his brothers, Sims was dancing on the sidewalks of Los Angeles from a young age. At the age of 14, peeping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> a dance school got Sims arrested for loitering, but he was able to dance his way to freedom, convincing a judge that his reason for being on that street was legitimate.|$|E
500|$|During {{his junior}} year, Presley began {{to stand out}} more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline. In his free time, he would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis's {{thriving}} blues scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing them. Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual [...] "Minstrel" [...] show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with [...] "Till I Waltz Again with You", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: [...] "I wasn't popular in school... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that." ...|$|E
