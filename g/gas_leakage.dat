25|$|There {{have also}} been some {{concerns}} over possible problems related to hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>leakage.</b> Molecular hydrogen leaks slowly from most containment vessels. It has been hypothesized that if significant amounts of hydrogen gas (H2) escape, hydrogen gas may, because of ultraviolet radiation, form free radicals (H) in the stratosphere. These free radicals would {{then be able to}} act as catalysts for ozone depletion. A large enough increase in stratospheric hydrogen from leaked H2 could exacerbate the depletion process. However, the effect of these leakage problems may not be significant. The amount of hydrogen that leaks today is much lower (by a factor of 10–100) than the estimated 10–20% figure conjectured by some researchers; for example, in Germany, the leakage rate is only 0.1% (less than the natural gas leak rate of 0.7%). At most, such leakage would likely be no more than 1–2% even with widespread hydrogen use, using present technology.|$|E

Since workers do not travel long distances, the gas concentration was measured by stationary devices with long tubes. This method allows to accurately measure the <b>gas</b> <b>leakage</b> through the gaps between the mask and the face.

50|$|Another {{widely used}} method to seal through glass with low {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion {{is the use}} of strips of thin molybdenum foil. This can be done with matched coefficients of thermal expansion. Then the edges of the strip also have to be knife sharp.

This can lead to low <b>gas</b> <b>leakages.</b> In the tube to tube knife edge seal the edge is either outside, inside, or buried into the glass wall.|$|R

2500|$|A 2011 {{study by}} noted climate {{research}} scientist, Tom Wigley, {{found that while}} carbon dioxide (...) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy, it also found that additional methane (CH4) from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in [...] forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. The study looked at methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due {{to changes in the}} emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced [...] emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small. Petron et al. (2013) and Alvarez et al. (2012) note that estimated that leakage from gas infrastructure is likely to be underestimated. These studies indicate that the exploitation of natural gas as a [...] "cleaner" [...] fuel is questionable. A 2014 meta-study of 20 years of natural gas technical literature shows that methane emissions are consistently underestimated but on a 100-year scale, the climate benefits of coal to gas fuel switching are likely larger than the negative effects of natural <b>gas</b> <b>leakage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{location}} of the initial fire, its source of ignition, {{and the source of}} fuel remain subjects of debate. The cause of the accident has never been determined conclusively, although many hypotheses have been proposed. Sabotage theories notwithstanding, one hypothesis often put forth involves a combination of <b>gas</b> <b>leakage</b> and atmospheric static conditions. Escaping hydrogen gas (in this specific case from incomplete or damaged vents {{along the top of the}} vessel and especially near the rear upper tail fin) will typically burn after mixing with air and will explode when mixed with air in the right proportions. This, along with the high static collected from flying within stormy conditions could have combined to ignite the leaking gas and down the airship. In addition, a certain amount of gas may have been inexplicably lost out the top of the vessel for, at the same time, water ballast was noticeably released to slow the rate of descent. The initial explosion would therefore have been the result of the quickening fire reaching the gas bags themselves via the compromised aft-most vent at the vessel's stern. Another more recent theory involves the airship's outer covering. The silvery cloth covering contained material including cellulose nitrate which is highly flammable. This theory is controversial and has been rejected by other researchers because the outer skin burns too slowly to account for the rapid flame propagation and gaps in the fire correspond with internal gas cell divisions, which wouldn't be visible if the fire spread across the skin first. Hydrogen fires had previously destroyed many other airships.|$|E
