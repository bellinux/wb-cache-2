2500|$|Jerry Springer made a cameo {{appearance}} in [...] as himself during {{an episode of}} his show featuring <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> and his estranged son Scott Evil.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, {{the show}} was parodied in the film , with <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> and his son Scott {{discussing}} being evil. [...] Along with Jerry, Steve Wilkos and Todd Schultz played themselves in the movie.|$|E
50|$|The MOD sends Austin back to 1969 {{with its}} own time travel device, a {{convertible}} Volkswagen New Beetle. Austin arrives {{at a party in}} his London pad and with the assistance of a CIA agent, Felicity Shagwell, escapes an assassination attempt by two of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> operatives. Austin and Felicity are pursued by Mustafa, another of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> henchmen; when caught he reveals the existence of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> secret volcano lair.

5000|$|Live and Let Die (1973): <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evils</b> shark tank is an {{allusion to}} Kanangas shark tank.|$|R
500|$|The exaggerated {{nature of}} the plot and space station {{sequence}} has seen the film parodied on numerous occasions. Of note is the Austin Powers spoof film [...] (1999) which whilst a parody of other James Bond films, pays reference to Moonraker by <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> lair in space. The scene in which Drax is shot by the cyanide dart and ousted into space is parodied by Powers' ejection of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> clone Mini-Me into outer space in the same way.|$|R
2500|$|After three seasons, What's New, Scooby-Doo was {{replaced}} in September 2006 with Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!, a major revamping {{of the series}} which debuted on The CW's Kids' WB Saturday morning programming block. In the new premise, Shaggy inherits money and a mansion from an uncle, an inventor who has gone into hiding from villains trying to steal his secret invention. The villains, led by [...] "Dr. Phibes" [...] (based primarily upon <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> from the Austin Powers series, and named after Vincent Price's character from The Abominable Dr. Phibes), then use different schemes {{to try to get}} the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone. Fred, Daphne, and Velma are normally absent, but do make appearances at times to help. The characters were redesigned and the art style revised for the new series. Scott Menville voiced Shaggy in the series, with Casey Kasem appearing as the voice of Shaggy's Uncle Albert. Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! ran for two seasons on The CW.|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Reuters writer Daniel Carlson {{said the}} show was [...] "exactly {{as bad as you}} would fear". Carlson said the jokes were bad and that delivery from the actors is too exaggerated; although he praised Matt Lucas, he said Maguire and Lucas were inappropriately over-the-top. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe called the show a [...] "relentless, mediocre spoofery that so desperately wants to remind us of Monty Python and the Holy Grail". However, Gilbert said the show might work better in half-hour increments, rather than in the one-hour premiere with [...] "Wench Trouble" [...] and [...] "Golden Powers". Kate Ward of Entertainment Weekly said although the show's premise had promise, she did not particularly like the execution. Ward said Matt Lucas's character [...] "came off as <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> light", but said Sean Maguire was charming and that she laughed at some of the [...] "juvenile jokes", including Horst Draper, the name of a prisoner accused of raping horses. Boston Herald reviewer Mark A. Perigard complimented the show's high production values, but said, [...] "What was spent on sets didn't go into the script." [...] He also said the concept of a comedy swords-and-fantasy show is redundant because even serious shows, like [...] and , are comedies to an extent.|$|E

50|$|The film {{contains}} several {{references to}} The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! including the steamroller scene and <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> finger pointing move.|$|R
5000|$|While No. 2 {{talks about}} the {{business}} ventures he created during <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> absence, he mentions the Franklin Mint Cheeses of the World Series Commemorative Plates; ...|$|R
50|$|Following a {{successful}} investment by Number 2, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> lair in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is atop the Space Needle in Seattle, portrayed {{to be the}} Starbucks headquarters; later, it is housed first in a volcano with <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> face carved into it on a Caribbean island (a homage to both You Only Live Twice and Live and Let Die), {{and then on the}} moon (the film's final villainous homage, to Moonraker). He also has a spaceship that resembles a penis and two testicles.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, British spy Austin Powers (Mike Myers) thwarts an {{assassination}} attempt by his nemesis <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> (also played by Mike Myers) in a London nightclub. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> escapes in a space rocket disguised as a Big Boy statue, and cryogenically freezes himself. Powers volunteers to be placed into cryostasis in case <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> returns in the future.|$|E
50|$|Powers and Kensington {{attempt to}} {{infiltrate}} the Virtucon headquarters but are soon apprehended by Dr. Evil's henchman, Random Task (Joe Son). Meanwhile, the United Nations accede {{to the demands}} of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> who proceeds with Project Vulcan regardless. Powers and Kensington are placed in a death trap by <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> but they easily escape, and Kensington is sent for help. While searching for <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> Powers is confronted by the fembots, whom he defeats by counter-seducing them with a striptease. Led by Kensington, British forces raid the underground lair, while Powers finds the doomsday device and deactivates it. Powers confronts <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> but Fagina arrives holding Kensington hostage. They are interrupted by Number 2, who attempts to betray <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> by making a deal with Powers. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> uses a trap door to eliminate Number 2, then activates the base’s self-destruct mechanism and escapes. Powers and Kensington flee just as a nuclear explosion destroys the lair.|$|E
50|$|Austin, Foxxy and Mini-Me {{infiltrate}} the submarine, but Austin is captured. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> prepares {{to activate the}} tractor beam, but Foxxy has stolen the key and frees Austin. Austin prepares to shoot <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> when Nigel appears and reveals <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> and Austin are brothers, separated when they were toddlers when an assassination attempt killed their mother, and <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> was found and raised by Belgians. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> and Austin embrace, enraging Scott, who flees to pursue his own vengeance, whilst Goldmember commandeers the tractor beam's controls, unzipping his pants to reveal his gold-covered genitals to be a spare key. Goldmember activates the tractor beam, but Austin and <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> work together to reverse its polarity, destroying the meteor and saving the world. The heroes arrest Goldmember, who turns to the camera to reveal the entire string of events was adapted into a film by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Cruise as Austin, Kevin Spacey as <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> Danny DeVito as Mini-Me, and John Travolta as Goldmember. Austin, Foxxy, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> Mini-Me and Nigel are in the audience of a Hollywood theater watching the film. Upon exiting the theater they run into Fat Bastard, now thinner but flabby, thanks to the Subway diet. As Austin and Foxxy kiss, in Dr. Evil's Hollywood lair, Scott - now completely bald, dressed like and laughing {{in a manner similar}} to his father — declares he will get his revenge on Austin and begins dancing like Michael Jackson.|$|E
5000|$|In Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> evil plan {{involved}} using {{a tractor}} beam to crash a golden asteroid into the Earth, causing a torrential flood.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Bigglesworth {{has since}} that time been bald, played by a Sphynx cat named Ted NudeGent. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> {{miniature}} clone, Mini-Me, has a kitten named Mini Mr. Bigglesworth.|$|R
5000|$|According to his {{own account}} in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, {{delivered}} in a group therapy session with his estranged son Scott, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> upbringing went as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1969, he {{is seen to}} {{work for}} <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> and is {{considerably}} more loyal and respectful than he is in 1999. Nevertheless, his own ambition (and far superior talent as a leader) have occasionally shown through, angering <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil.</b> When <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> is busy arguing with Scott, Number 2 asks him if [...] "they can set aside the family squabbles, and get down to serious business", which <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> takes as an insolent remark. When the supervillain mocks him and asks him if [...] "he wants to wear the daddy pants", young Number 2 quickly apologizes and denies {{that he wants to}} lead the company himself.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> {{carries on}} a {{strained}} {{relationship with his}} son Scott. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> liquidates their therapy group, accusing them of being [...] "insolent". Scott is also known for pointing out Dr. Evil's incompetence and immaturity as well as obvious mistakes and flaws in Dr. Evil's plans. For instance, when <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> asks why Austin Powers always foils their plans, Scott says [...] "Because you never kill him {{when you have the}} chance and you're a big dope". <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> mocks Scott and ignores his corrections, which often leads to failure. Scott later grows more [...] "evil", thus losing his hair; this gains his father's respect momentarily, especially after Scott provides him a pool filled with [...] "sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their frickin' heads". When <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> switches sides to help Austin save the world, Scott takes over {{as the head of the}} evil organization.|$|E
5000|$|Out {{of all his}} henchmen and assistants Farbissina {{is perhaps}} closest to <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil.</b> In praising <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> Farbissina commented, [...] "Dr. Evil {{is a man of}} great {{intelligence}} - able to step on a bug and say too bad! ...|$|E
5000|$|While Austin and Vanessa are {{escaping}} <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> underground lair {{which is}} about to explode, the guard Austin hypnotized earlier in the movie shows up and gives Austin a container of orange Sherbet.|$|R
5000|$|There are two notable omissions: [...] "Secret Agent Man", {{which is}} played during {{the attack on}} <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> compound, and [...] "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'", which plays during the Fembot presentation.|$|R
5000|$|In Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> first lair is {{underground}} in the Nevada desert, [...] "somewhere outside Las Vegas"; {{which are}} obvious homages to You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever.|$|R
5000|$|Mini-Me {{has almost}} no {{dialogue}} in the films, beyond an occasional frightened [...] "Eeeee!". Otherwise, he is silent except {{for when he}} does his evil laugh with <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil.</b> He also likes to lip-synch the occasional line when <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> raps. In the beginning of Goldmember, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> asks him to [...] "Use your words like a big boy clone!". At one point, he asks <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> to hug him after meeting Fat Bastard, who wants to eat him. Mini-Me often uses the middle finger {{as a means of}} insulting someone (even though he only uses it once during the third movie). On most other occasions, Mini-Me prefers to express himself through written notes.|$|E
50|$|Austin {{visits the}} imprisoned <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> who {{tells him that}} Goldmember is behind the abduction. Time-travelling to 1975, Austin infiltrates Goldmember's roller disco club and is reunited with his former lover, FBI agent Foxxy Cleopatra, who is {{undercover}} as a disco singer. With Foxxy's help, Austin locates his father, but is unable to rescue him. Goldmember takes Nigel through Dr. Evil's time machine into the present day. Foxxy wants revenge on Goldmember for murdering her partner, and accompanies Austin in his pursuit. In the present, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> and Mini-Me instigate a riot in their prison, allowing them to escape. A British Intelligence mole named Number 3 informs Austin that <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> has {{moved to a new}} lair near Tokyo. Austin and Foxxy travel to Tokyo and confront Fat Bastard, who is now a sumo wrestler, but still does work for <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil.</b> Fat Bastard explains that a Japanese business man, Mr. Roboto, is working on a device for <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> and Goldmember.|$|E

5000|$|Immediately {{after one}} of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> {{security}} guards is crushed by a steam roller driven by Austin and Vanessa, the security guard's wife (played by former Bond Girl Lois Chiles) and stepson are informed of his death.|$|R

50|$|A NATO {{monitoring}} facility {{observes the}} return of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> confronting his son Scott, and then starting a riot, on The Jerry Springer Show, and informs British intelligence. At Dr. Evil's Seattle headquarters, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> is presented with a one-eighth-size clone of himself whom he calls Mini-Me.|$|E
5000|$|Before <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> {{was sent}} {{back in time to}} 1969, his minions made him a clone. The clone was {{identical}} in every way, but he was [...] "one-eighth his size". Upon being introduced to his clone, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> immediately declared, [...] "Breathtaking. I shall call him... Mini-Me".|$|E
50|$|The {{character}} <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil,</b> the antagonist of Austin Powers {{in three}} films, has mannerisms and a speaking style based on Lorne Michaels. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil</b> was created and portrayed by SNL alumnus Mike Myers, {{who was at}} least partially influenced by fellow SNL performer Dana Carvey's impression of Michaels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> {{handyman}} extraordinaire is Random Task, a Korean ex-wrestler whose {{personality and}} assassination style is a parody {{to that of}} Oddjob from Goldfinger, except he throws his shoe instead of his hat. His names themselves are synonyms of 'odd' and 'job'. Task repetitively cracks his neck and it is often his job to silently move dead bodies away and move <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> chair. Random Task attempts to kill Austin in his Honeymoon suite unsuccessfully as Austin uses the Swedish-made penis enlarger pump on him before Vanessa Kensington breaks {{a bottle of champagne}} over his head to subdue him. His unconscious but broadly-grinning body is then placed on a trolley and pushed along the corridor of the hotel.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1997 American spy action comedy film Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, {{the song}} is used {{in one of the}} final battle scenes when Austin and Vanessa save the world from being drilled through with <b>Dr.</b> <b>Evil's</b> Project Vulcan drill.|$|R
50|$|Two heroes from a war-weary future {{travel back}} in time to stop the war in its origins. The 'Time Boys' confront the <b>evil</b> <b>Dr.</b> Crankshaft, <b>evil</b> monkeys and ally {{themselves}} with the lovely Samantha.|$|R
