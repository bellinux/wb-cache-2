50|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, Volkswagen {{introduced}} the Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG), a type of dual clutch transmission. It is an automated semi-automatic transmission, drivable like a conventional automatic transmission. Based on the gearbox found in the Group B S1, the system includes dual <b>electrohydraulically</b> controlled clutches instead of a torque converter. This is implemented in some VW Golfs, Audi A3, Audi A4 and TT models where DSG is called S-tronic.|$|E
50|$|The E46 M3 {{was offered}} with a {{standard}} 6-speed Getrag transmission, but optionally came with a SMG drivelogic transmission (also known as the SMG II). This is the standard 6-speed Getrag transmission with an <b>electrohydraulically</b> actuated clutch (no clutch pedal). Shifts are made via the SMG gear knob or the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters. The engine had a redline of 8,000 rpm. As with most M engines, the S54 again had 6 independent throttle bodies and this time electronically operated throttles (drive-by-wire throttle with no cable).|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{standard}} M3, which was offered {{with a standard}} 6-speed Getrag transmission, or optionally a SMG drivelogic transmission (also known as the SMG II), the CSL was offered only with the SMG II transmission. This is {{the standard}} 6-speed Getrag transmission with an <b>electrohydraulically</b> actuated clutch pedal, similar to a Formula One style transmission. However, the CSL received a more advanced drivelogic software package than the standard M3 that was capable of making shifts in 0.08-second. This advanced CSL Software package can also be uploaded to the standard M3 SMG DME to get the CSL gear shift performance increase.|$|E
50|$|The {{semi-automatic}} transmission may {{be derived from}} a conventional automatic; for instance Mercedes-Benz's AMG Speedshift MCT {{semi-automatic transmission}} {{is based on the}} 7G-Tronic manumatic, however the latter's torque converter has been replaced with a wet, multi-plate launch clutch. Chevrolet's Torque-Drive was based on GM's conventional Powerglide, but lacked the vacuum modulator that controls automatic gear changes. Other semi-automatic transmissions have their roots in a conventional manual; the SMG II drivelogic (found in the BMW M3 (E46) is a Getrag 6-speed manual transmission, but with an <b>electrohydraulically</b> actuated clutch pedal, similar to a Formula One style transmission. The most common type of semi-automatic transmission {{in recent years has been}} the dual clutch type, since single-clutch types such as the SMG III have been criticized for their general lack of smoothness in everyday driving (although being responsive at the track).|$|E
40|$|Destructive {{effects of}} {{ultrasonic}} waves on microorganisms and the observed reduction in renal infections after {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}} {{led to the}} idea of testing the bactericidal effect of shock waves (up to 150 MPa). A possible application could be a new (acoustic) non-thermal food preservation process. The bactericidal effect of <b>electrohydraulically</b> generated shock waves was evaluated on Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 and Listeria monocytogenes L 8 suspensions in isotonic saline solution. Our results indicate that pressure variations, shock wave-created cavitation and the radiation resulting from the underwater shock wave-generating spark significantly reduce the viability of these microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|The <b>electrohydraulically</b> {{actuated}} slotted-plate {{bypass valve}} {{used to control}} {{the position of the}} normal shock during wind-tunnel investigations of supersonic inlets also {{has proven to be a}} valuable device for determining inlet dynamics and creating airflow disturbances. Operation of previous valves at high frequencies (to 100 Hz) for extended testing has resulted in numerous failures. An improved bypass-valve design is presented which increases the cyclic tolerance of the device considerably over past designs. The use of dynamic limit criteria to obtain an optimum actuator-piston size results in a frequency response which is flat within + or - 3 decibels to 120 Hz for a peak-to-peak variation of 20 percent of full area...|$|E
40|$|The stress-strain-permeability {{behavior}} of artificial specimens with different pore proportioning was investigated <b>electrohydraulically</b> by servo-controlled MTS 815 rock test system. The influences of pore proportioning, porosity and seepage on rigidity and peak strength of artificial specimens were systematically studied by comparing testing results. The relationship between pore proportioning, porosity and permeability was thus obtained {{to set up}} an equation expressing how the hydraulic pressure and porosity weaken the rigidity and peak strength of artificial specimens. A reference was therefore provided to describe quantitatively the relationship between rock's porosity, permeability and peak strength. Experimental results showed that the coarse particles in proportioning and macro pore affect obviously the porosity and initial permeability and water weakens the rigidity and strength of specimens more significantly with increasing porosity. 應用電液伺服巖石力學試驗系統,研究了不同孔隙配比的人工巖芯試件的應力應變滲流特性,比較系統地分析了孔隙分布配級、孔隙度、滲流作用對強度、剛度的影響. 試驗得到了孔隙配比、孔隙度與初始滲透性的關系,建立了水壓和孔隙度對試件強度弱化的關系方程,對于定量描述孔隙結構與滲流率、試樣強度的關系,具有一定的參考價值. 試驗結果表明,粗顆粒比例和大孔徑孔隙對孔隙度和滲透性影響較大,隨著孔隙度增加,水對試件的強度弱化程度更加顯著. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Use {{of surface}} {{floating}} dredgers in deep inland reservoirs and continental shelves, either for dredging or mining is restricted by several operational limitations and mobilization problems. Ladder length {{is a major}} constraint {{and in the absence}} of good approach roads, transportation of bigger surface floating dredgers to inland areas is difficult. In shelf areas, dredging operation is less precise due to currents, waves and winds. Use of small, modular comparatively less expensive submersible dredgers/ miners is a suitable solution to some of the above-mentioned problems. A collaborative research project between Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada and Excavation & Equipment Manufacturing (P) Ltd., India was set up to develop, design, build and test a small prototype of a modular walking submersible dredger suitable for deep inland reservoirs. The full-scale <b>electrohydraulically</b> operated prototype was remotely operated on land for all the full-scale prototype tests. This paper describes the theoretical gait plans developed for the designed vehicle to perform straight line and curvilinear locomotion on natural terrain. Representative results showing the comparisons between the theoretical and experimental results for the gait plans are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal {{shock waves}} {{are known to}} stimulate the {{differentiation}} of mesenchymal stem cells toward osteoprogenitors and induce the expression of osteogenic-related growth hormones. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if and how extracorporeal shock waves affected new bone formation, bone microarchitecture, and the mechanical properties of bone in a healthy rat model, in order to evaluate whether extracorporeal shock wave therapy might be a potential treatment for osteoporosis. METHODS: Thirteen rats received 1000 <b>electrohydraulically</b> generated unfocused extracorporeal shock waves to the right tibia. The contralateral, left tibia was not treated and served as a control. At two, seven, twenty-one, and forty-nine days after administration of the shock waves, in vivo single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning was performed to measure new bone formation on the basis of uptake of technetium-labeled methylene diphosphonate ((99 m) Tc-MDP) (n = 6). Prior to and forty-nine days after the extracorporeal shock wave therapy, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans were made to examine the architectural bone changes. In addition, mechanical testing, microcrack, and histological analyses were performed. RESULTS: Extracorporeal shock waves induced a strong increase in (99 m) Tc-MDP uptake in the treated tibia compared with the uptake in the untreated, control tibia. Micro-CT analysis showed that extracorporeal shock waves stimulated increases in both trabecular and cortical volume, which resulted in higher bone stiffness compared with that of the control tibiae. Histological analysis showed intramedullary soft-tissue damage and de novo bone with active osteoblasts and osteoid in the bone marrow of the legs treated with extracorporeal shock waves. Microcrack analysis showed no differences between the treated and control legs. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a single treatment with extracorporeal shock waves induces anabolic effects in both cancellous and cortical bone, leading to improved biomechanical properties. Furthermore, treatment with extracorporeal shock waves results in transient damage to the bone marrow, which might be related to the anabolic effects. After further examination and optimization, unfocused extracorporeal shock waves might enable local treatment of skeletal sites susceptible to fracture...|$|E
