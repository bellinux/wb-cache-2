5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an <b>environmental</b> <b>claim</b> lacks honesty {{can have a}} {{negative}} effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E

Summary and conclusion - the operation, province and limits of tort liability and the way forwardThe role of civil liability including tort law in addressing <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> in India had until recently been minimal. Tort law remedies with its limited scope had not been pursued or seriously considered for <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> until the Bhopal gas disaster in 1984 - 85. It is only after 1995 that tort law remedies have been explored to overcome inadequacies of the existing environmental liability regime based predominantly on public law liability tools in India.. Notwithstanding the difficulties in the use of tort law for addressing <b>environmental</b> <b>claims,</b> in recent years the Supreme Court, and most recently, the Parliament, have categorically re-engaged with tort law to utilise its functions and remedies to address <b>environmental</b> <b>claims.</b> Although the Supreme Court of India has used the public law liability tools to address most <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> by recognising a constitutional environmental right, reiterating a constitutional duty and statutory liability it has simultaneously recognized an environmental constitutional tort within the same case. As research indicates, tort law remedies and functions have been increasingly adopted by the Supreme Court to vindicate <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> by allowing for compensatory and reparative award of damages. In addition, the National Green Tribunal Act 2010 [NGTA] recognizes civil liability for environmental damage arising from the violation of the seven specific laws enumerated under Act. It allows the victims to seek compensation for personal injury and damage to property arising from violation of the person’s environmental right and/or regulatory laws listed under the Act. This new liability regime for <b>environmental</b> <b>claims,</b> therefore, includes features of public law liability and private law liability for vindication of <b>environmental</b> <b>claims.</b> The mixed liability approach adopted by the Supreme Court as discussed above indicates a reengagement with tort law. In this context, the question that this thesis addresses is the extent and ambit of civil liability and tort law to address <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> and interests in India. The thesis proceeds to examine the role, function and nature of tort law within environmental context. It emphasises the inadequacies and gaps within the existing legal liability instruments and processes and highlights the potential advantages, limitations and connections that tort has in dealing with certain <b>environmental</b> <b>claims.</b> It establishes that the manner in which tort functions of compensation and deterrence have become amalgamated with the objectives of environmental law, the boundaries between public and private law have blurred. It is argued that within the current environmental jurisprudence, civil liability instruments including tort can play a positive role to supplement the public law liability tools used to address <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> in India.

Examples of court action relating to the use of consumer protection laws for <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> in several countries are described.

Moreover the report acknowledges that several attempts have been made towards harmonisation across countries concerning environmental criteria, mainly concerning eco-labelling schemes and organic agriculture standards. There appear to be strong incentives for this type of cross-country certification, including reduced administrative costs and a potential for increased trade of environmentally-certified goods. This makes further harmonisation of criteria for self-reported <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> a real possibility. The ongoing pursuit of harmonisation regionally, or bilaterally, might be a first step forward in such a process...|$|R

The present findings reveal that <b>environmental</b> <b>claim</b> type, country disposition, and ecocentric orientation all exert significant influences on communication effectiveness. Specifically, it is shown that substantive environmental claims generate greater communication effectiveness than associative environmental claims for both high-involvement and low-involvement purchases.

Finally, the present study also reveals that country disposition and ecocentric orientation jointly exert significant moderating effects on the claim type-effectiveness relationship in high-involvement purchases.

The Gulf War of 1990 – 91, {{precipitated by}} Iraq’s invasion and occupation of Kuwait, resulted in massive environmental damage to neighbouring countries. After the Gulf War, the UN Security Council established the United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) to process claims for war reparations, including <b>claims</b> for <b>environmental</b> damage. The <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> were unprecedented. This thesis explores (a) whether key actors influenced the rules and <b>environmental</b> <b>claims,</b> and if so, what means they used to achieve their goals, (b) how key actors used these means to influence the rules and <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> and (c) {{the extent to which}} the <b>environmental</b> rule and <b>claims</b> might have been different if the UNCC had adopted more transparent, inclusive and accountable processes. The thesis argues that <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> and rules are as much the product of human interactions as they are of legal principles. Key actors influenced the UNCC rules and <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> by advocating for or against four principles. The principles they advocated or opposed were effective and expeditious justice for the victims of war, due process for Iraq, secrecy and transparency. They did so through the predominant mechanism or tool of modelling which they deployed through webs of dialogue and coercion. Key actors sometimes displaced political conflict on to procedural terrain. The thesis asserts that the UNCC was a transitional institution somewhere between a tribunal administering victor’s justice and an independent and impartial international judicial body.

40|$|The {{marketplace}} {{orientation in}} which consumer decisions toward product purchase, use, and disposal {{are shaped by}} a desire to preserve and protect the environment is growing. As such, environmental attitudes of consumers have influenced clothing purchase decisions. The concern over the interdependencies among human societies and the environment has brought environmentalism to the forefront of business marketing strategies. The textiles and apparel industry has been challenged by such ecological concerns as pollution of air and water in the textile manufacturing process, waste disposal problems with textile fibers, and potential shortage of raw materials from production of synthetic fibers. Many apparel companies have embraced the 2 ̆ 2 green marketing 2 ̆ 2 concept in an effort to capture the new environmentally responsible market. However, environmental claims in ads can be confusing to consumers and may not lead to favorable consumer response;Borrowing theoretical frameworks from advertising, a process model of consumer response toward apparel products in environmental ads was developed. A path model was hypothesized in accordance with several ad processing theories. The path model explains consumer environmental attitude and behavior in relation to apparel products and advertisements;A convenience sample of undergraduate students (N = 274) at a midwestern university was randomly distributed an advertisement portfolio (an experimental ad and three filler ads) and a questionnaire. The experimental ad promoted a fictitious brand t-shirt; one of three different types of environmental claims for 2 ̆ 2 organic cotton 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 recycled hang tags, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 donation of profits 2 ̆ 2 or a control statement was included in the ad.

Empirical research into the production and implementation of Oxfordshire's Biodiversity Action Plan and Farm Biodiversity Action Plans in England and Scotland is used as a vehicle to explore the legitimisation of the biodiversity claim at the local scale. The two strands of research highlight the current importance of biodiversity as a focus for environmental planning partnerships (although the extent of public 'buy-in' to the claim is unclear) {{and the way in which}} biodiversity as a 'buzzword' has been adopted by farmers with some reluctance and mainly for financial reasons. There is strong evidence that the scientific basis of the claim is crucial in terms of engendering support, and that the rhetoric employed at the local level is positive rather than a 'rhetoric of loss'. However, the need for further popularisation of the biodiversity issue is identified.

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore how {{different}} types of environmental claims may affect the communication effectiveness of environmental advertising. Two two moderating variables include the perceived eco‐friendly image of the originating country and consumer involvement. Design/methodology/approach– The examination involves the analysis of the responses of 1, 200 subjects in Shanghai, China, to mock advertisements containing environmental claims using a 2 x 3 factorial design. Findings– Environmental claims enhance the communication effectiveness of advertisements for both high‐ and low‐involvement services. For high‐involvement services, substantive environmental claims generate more favorable attitudinal responses than do associative environmental claims. Research limitations/implications– This research focused on a single Chinese city and on two service categories with contrasting degrees of involvement. While such a confinement can enhance the internal validity of the findings, their external validity has yet to be established. Practical implications– These findings suggest that marketers should adopt a situational perspective by taking into account <b>environmental</b> <b>claim</b> type, country disposition, the degree of environmental consciousness of their target consumers, and service type when designing their environmental advertising campaigns. Originality/value– Although a number of previous studies have focused on the application of environmental claims to advertise products, similar investigation into how these claims may help advertise services is virtually non‐existent. In this respect, the present study can be viewed as the first empirical work devoted to closing this research gap. Department of Management and Marketin...|$|E
