40|$|A {{test stand}} to observe {{movement}} and deformation of thermoplastic polymers in {{a cross-section of}} the plastification zone of a co-rotating twin screw extruder is presented. Multiple experiments to examine the initial melting processes {{as a function of}} different process parameters such as rotational speed, temperature, <b>kneading</b> <b>disk</b> configuration, thermoplastic materials, granule size and filling degree were conducted. The analysis was accomplished by means of high-speed imaging. Hereby it was possible to gain insights into the significant influence parameters of the initial melting behaviour of thermoplastics during processing in a corotating twin screw extruder for the first time...|$|E
40|$|Melt-mixing in twin-screw {{extruders}} is a {{key process}} {{in the development of}} polymer composites. Quantifying the mixing performance of kneading elements based on their internal physical processes is a challenging problem. We discuss melt-mixing by novel kneading elements called "pitched-tip <b>kneading</b> <b>disk</b> (ptKD) ". The disk-stagger angle and tip angle are the main geometric parameters of the ptKDs. We investigated four typical arrangements of the ptKDs, which are forward and backward disk-staggers combined with forward and backward tips. Numerical simulations under a certain feed rate and screw revolution speed were performed, and the mixing process was investigated using Lagrangian statistics. It was found that the four types had different mixing characteristics, and their mixing processes were explained by the coupling effect of drag flow with the disk staggering and pitched-tip and pressure flows, which are controlled by operational conditions. The use of a pitched-tip effectively to controls the balance of the pressurization and mixing ability...|$|E
40|$|In mixing highly viscous materials, like polymers, foods, and rubbers, the {{geometric}} {{structure of the}} mixing device is a determining factor {{for the quality of}} the mixing process. In pitched-tip <b>kneading</b> <b>disks</b> (ptKD), a novel type of mixing element, based on conventional <b>kneading</b> <b>disks</b> (KD), the tip angle is modified to change the channel geometry as well as the drag ability of KD. We discuss the effects of the tip angle in ptKD on mixing characteristics based on numerical simulation of the flow in the melt-mixing zone under different feed rates and a screw rotation speed. It turns out that the passage of fluid through the high-stress regions increases in ptKD compared to conventional KD regardless of the directions and sizes of the tip angle, while the fluctuation in residence time stays at the same level as the conventional KD. Furthermore, pitched tips of backward direction increase the mean applied stress on the fluid elements during its residence in the melt-mixing zone, suggesting the enhancement of dispersive mixing quality in ptKD. These understandings {{of the role of the}} tip angle on KD can give a basic guide in selecting and designing suitable angle parameters of ptKD for different mixing purposes...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the mixing}} {{capability}} of mixing devices {{based on their}} geometric shape {{is an important issue}} both for predicting mixing processes and for designing new mixers. The flow patterns in mixers are directly connected with the modes of the local strain rate, which is generally a combination of elongational flow and planar shear flow. We develop a measure to characterize the modes of the strain rate for general flow occurring in mixers. The spatial distribution of the volumetric strain rate (or non-planar strain rate) in connection with the flow pattern plays an essential role in understanding distributive mixing. With our measure, flows with different types of screw elements in a twin-screw extruder are numerically analyzed. The difference in flow pattern structure between conveying screws and <b>kneading</b> <b>disks</b> is successfully characterized by the distribution of the volumetric strain rate. The results suggest that the distribution of the strain rate mode offers an essential and convenient way for characterization of the relation between flow pattern structure and the mixer geometry...|$|R
