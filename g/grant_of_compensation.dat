40|$|The {{purpose and}} {{parameters}} of director liability lack a clear articulation, particularly {{with respect to}} indemnification. Corporate statutes and actual practice retain both liability and constraints on indemnification, but there is substantial scope for directors to contract for protection. Thus, neither a regulatory nor a contract model provides a particularly robust explanation for the form of the statutes. Alternative theories to account for the form of director liability and exoneration might include rent-seeking by lawyers for corporations, the team production model, or post modern readings that accept the text as an expression of discontinuities in the official legal narrative about corporations. Practically, policy alternatives include deregulation that subjects indemnification decisions to the normal default rules of corporate law, classifying indemnification decisions as conflict of interest transactions, or treating them as <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation.</b> The textual artifacts in which are embedded contradictory impulses about director liability {{could be used as a}} means of conditioning contracts for indemnification on the production of corporate narratives by those seeking indemnification.

40|$|The {{development}} of dairy {{farms in the}} mountainous regions of France was seriously impaired {{by the introduction of}} EC milk quotas in 1984. This effect was particulary noticeable in the Haute-Loire area, where the traditional route into dairying was from veal production. This study examined 30 dairy farms in the region, with a view to establishing the effects of the introduction of milk quotas. For the first 3 yr, these effects were masked by decreases in milk yield attributable to climate and the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> payments. In the fourth yr after quota introduction, however, all farms had to take action, since the climate favoured higher milk yields. Factorial analysis was used to analyse the profiles of the dairy farms. Farms which had aimed to specialize in dairying, using French Friesian cattle and intensive farming methods, had more difficulty in adapting to the quota system, whereas farms that had conc. on Red Pied cattle and continued to produce veal calves coped better. Future prospects for farms in the region are discussed; the best strategy is perceived to be mixed farming, with moderate intensification, and investment in modernization programmes spread over a long period. / Dans les montagnes de Haute-Loire, la production laitière est relativement récente; elle s'est développée à partir d'un système basé sur le veau de boucherie sous la mère et beaucoup d'exploitations conservent les marques de cette évolution.
