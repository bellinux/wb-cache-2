By application of isoelectric focusing (IEF) disease-specific AFP isoforms can be identified. Three major bands are apparent: + l (associated with ‘benign’ liver disease), + II (associated with HCC) and +III (associated with NSGCT). Recently, we have characterized the predominant glycans of human serum AFP and now report the application of these findings and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to {{the determination of the}} glycan composition of the isoforms present in the sera of 12 patients with HCC and of one patient with NSGCT. ESI-MS allowed simultaneous identification of various AFP <b>glycoforms</b> in purified serum AFP. Seven <b>glycoforms</b> were identified, but with different abundance in the sera of the HCC patients, whereas six <b>glycoforms</b> were identified in the serum from the NSGCT patient. The glycan structures of these <b>glycoforms</b> were deduced from their observed masses. AFP <b>glycoforms</b> carrying a single biantennary complex-type N-glycan appeared as the predominant <b>glycoforms,</b> whereas those carrying both N-glycan and O-glycan appeared as minor <b>glycoforms.</b> Correlation between the abundance of the AFP <b>glycoforms</b> and the IEF band intensity suggested that different degrees in sialylation cause the formation of isoforms.

It allows post-acquisition extraction of glycopeptide-specific fragment-ion chromatograms to be aligned with that of precursor MS 1 ion by nanoLC elution time.

P. multocida strains simultaneously express two lipopolysaccharide (LPS) glycoforms (glycoforms A and B) that differ only in their inner core structure. <b>Glycoform</b> A contains a single 3 -deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residue that is phosphorylated by the Kdo kinase, KdkA, whereas <b>glycoform</b> B contains two unphosphorylated Kdo residues. We have previously shown that P. multocida mutants lacking the heptosyltransferase, HptA, produce full-length <b>glycoform</b> B LPS and a large amount of truncated <b>glycoform</b> A LPS, as they cannot add heptose to the <b>glycoform</b> A inner core. These hptA mutants were attenuated in chickens because the truncated LPS made them vulnerable to host defense mechanisms, including antimicrobial peptides. However, here we show that birds inoculated with high doses of the hptA mutant developed fowl cholera and the P. multocida isolates recovered from diseased birds no longer expressed truncated LPS. Sequencing analysis revealed that the in vivo-derived isolates had mutations in kdkA, thereby suppressing the production of <b>glycoform</b> A LPS. Interestingly, a number of the spontaneous KdkA mutant strains produced KdkA with a single amino acid substitution (A 112 V, R 123 P, H 168 Y, or D 193 N).

40|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a {{critical}} virulence determinant in Pasteurella multocida and a major antigen responsible for host protective immunity. In other mucosal pathogens, variation in LPS or lipooligosaccharide structure typically occurs in the outer core oligosaccharide regions due to phase variation. P. multocida elaborates a conserved oligosaccharide extension attached to two different, simultaneously expressed inner core structures, one containing a single phosphorylated 3 -deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residue and the other containing two Kdo residues. We demonstrate that two heptosyltransferases, HptA and HptB, add the first heptose molecule to the Kdo 1 residue and that each exclusively recognizes different acceptor molecules. HptA is specific for the <b>glycoform</b> containing a single, phosphorylated Kdo residue (<b>glycoform</b> A), while HptB is specific for the <b>glycoform</b> containing two Kdo residues (<b>glycoform</b> B).

We conclude that the ability of P. multocida to elaborate alternative inner core LPS structures is due to the simultaneous expression of two different heptosyltransferases that add the first heptose residue to the nascent LPS molecule and to the expression of both a bifunctional Kdo transferase and a Kdo kinase, which results in the initial assembly of two inner core structures...|$|E

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells {{produce more}} {{biopharmaceuticals}} {{than any other}} cell line due to the CHO cells’ many advantageous characteristics, including their ability to glycosylate biopharmaceuticals with human-compatible glycans. The biopharmaceutical <b>glycoform</b> affects the product efficacy, half-life, and immunogenicity; therefore, biopharmaceuticals must have a consistent <b>glycoform</b> to ensure therapeutic efficacy and patient safety. One challenge associated with ensuring consistent glycosylation is that the CHO-specific glycosylation reaction network is a non-template driven cellular process with many variables, making predictive <b>glycoform</b> modeling difficult. This research addresses this challenge through {{the design of a}} computational glycosylation tool using a novel modeling technique that predicts biopharmaceutical glycoforms and thereby generates experimentally-relevant CHO cell line-specific information to improve biopharmaceutical manufacturing. ☐ Achieving this goal requires a fundamental understanding of CHO cellular biology, processes, and reaction networks. The recently sequenced and annotated CHO genome facilitates a detailed, mechanistic understanding of CHO cell-specific biology. Recent and emerging genome sequencing technologies were characterized, the differences between the technologies were highlighted, and the reported CHO biopharmaceutical applications of these sequencing technologies were examined with a focus on the sequencing and annotation of the CHO-K 1 cell and Chinese hamster (CH) genomes. We improved CHOgenome. org, the centralized CHO community’s public database repository through the addition of the CHO and CH genomes to the website databases and through the creation of additional genomic and proteomic bioinformatics tools.

The modifications Glyco-Mapper has successfully predicted include the altered expression of glycosylation, nucleotide sugar transport, and metabolism genes, as well as modified nutrient feeding strategies. Glyco-Mapper’s ability to replicate cell line-specific reference glycoforms and accurately predict the reference-specific engineered glycoforms provides a streamlined tool to design cell lines to control specific product quality attributes. ☐ In this work, CHO-produced biopharmaceutical glycoforms from literature were used to validate the Glyco-Mapper’s predictive <b>glycoform</b> output. Glyco-Mapper predicted the engineered glycoforms with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of the glycans changing experimental measurements {{as a result of the}} engineering strategy of 96 %, 85 %, 97 %, and 85 %, respectively.

Using immunochemical methods for in situ localization, we show that the lectin dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) and two monoclonal antibodies, 9 OE and 3 A 6, detect three unique N-CAM forms present on primary sensory olfactory axons. In addition, DBA and monoclonal antibody 9 OE recognize glycoconjugates and/or N-CAM <b>glycoforms</b> expressed specifically in discrete central olfactory pathways and regions in frog brain. This is a novel example of unique adhesion molecule forms present in a chain of two neurons within a vertebrate neural pathway. Together these glycoconjugates and N-CAM <b>glycoforms</b> may participate in cellular interactions associated with olfactory system pathway formation and renewal...|$|R
40|$|Presentation no. 27. 16 Reports of chondroitin sulfate (CS) <b>glycoforms</b> in {{boundary}} {{regions of}} mouse embryonic hindbrain {{led us to}} hypothesize that these <b>glycoforms</b> are involved in patterning hindbrain segmentation. Immunohistochemical study using monoclonal antibody CS- 56 on E 8. 5 to E 11. 5, the time when hindbrain segmentation occurs, revealed immunopositivity in the neuroepithelial boundaries in both tissue sections and whole-mount embryos. The signals in E 8. 5 and E 9. 5 embryos were found stronger than those in later stages. Competitive neutralization of CS- 56 immunoreactivity with different CSs found 6 -sulfated <b>glycoforms</b> superior to other CS <b>glycoforms,</b> suggesting the abundance of 6 -sulfated CSs. The result was confirmed by analyzing the chondroitinase digestion products of the different CS <b>glycoforms</b> using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE). As C 6 S {{is a product of}} chondroitin 6 -sulfotransferase (C 6 ST) -catalyzed reaction, upregulation of C 6 ST gene expression in the boundary regions was anticipated. Riboprobes specific for the C 6 ST mRNA were synthesized and used for in situ hybridization. The anti-sense probe indicated distribution of positive cell bodies in the hindbrain neuroepithelium of E 8. 5 and E 9. 5 embryos but not in the later stages. We have therefore found temporal correlation between the expression of C 6 ST mRNA and the product of C 6 ST activity. The basis for the spatial difference in expression patterns of gene activity and enzyme activity remains to be investigated. (SPON: The Hong Kong Society of Neurosciences).

40|$|AbstractCyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) catalyzes the rate-limiting {{step in the}} prostanoid {{biosynthesis}} pathway, converting {{arachidonic acid}} into prostaglandin H 2. COX- 2 exists as 72 and 74 kDa glycoforms, the latter resulting from an additional oligosaccharide chain at residue Asn 580. In this study, Asn 580 was mutated to determine the biological significance of this variable glycosylation. COS- 1 cells transfected with the mutant gene were unable to express the 74 kDa <b>glycoform</b> and were found to accumulate more COX- 2 protein and have five times greater COX- 2 activity than cells expressing both glycoforms. Thus, COX- 2 turnover appears to depend upon glycosylation of the 72 kDa <b>glycoform...</b>|$|E
40|$|The RV 144 {{clinical}} trial showed {{for the first}} time that vaccination could provide modest but significant protection from HIV- 1 infection. To understand the protective response, and to improve upon the vaccine's efficacy, it is important to define the structure of the immunogens used in the prime/boost regimen. Here we examined the heterogeneity in net charge, attributable to <b>glycoform</b> variation, of the gp 120 immunogens contained in the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine. Isoelectric focusing and glycosidase digestion were used to assess variation in net charge of the gp 120 s contained in the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine used in the RV 144 trial. We observed 16 variants of MN-rgp 120 and 24 variants of A 244 -rgp 120. <b>Glycoform</b> variation in gp 120 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells was compared to <b>glycoform</b> variation in gp 120 produced in the 293 F human embryonic kidney cell line, often used for neutralization assays. We found that gp 120 variants produced in CHO cells were distinctly more acidic than gp 120 variants produced in 293 cells. The effect of <b>glycoform</b> heterogeneity on antigenicity was assessed using monoclonal antibodies. The broadly neutralizing PG 9 MAb bound to A 244 -rgp 120, but not to MN-rgp 120, whether produced in CHO or in 293. However, PG 9 was able to bind with high affinity to MN-rgp 120 and A 244 -rgp 120 produced in 293 cells deficient in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I. MN- and A 244 -rgp 120 used in the RV 144 trial exhibited extensive heterogeneity in net charge due to variation in sialic acid-containing glycoforms. These differences were cell line-dependent, affected the antigenicity of recombinant envelope proteins, and may affect assays used to measure neutralization. These studies, together with recent reports documenting broadly neutralizing antibodies directed against carbohydrate epitopes of gp 120, suggest that <b>glycoform</b> variation is a key variable to be considered in the production and evaluation of subunit vaccines designed to prevent HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether the <b>glycoform</b> distribution patterns of {{human chorionic gonadotropin}} (hCG) obtained by chromatofocusing in pre-evacuation serum are different for patients who will eventually develop into persistent trophoblastic disease in case of complete hydatidiform mole pregnancy as compared to those patients for whom trophoblastic tissue will regress uneventfully. METHODS: Pre-evacuation blood samples were collected from women with complete hydatidiform mole with uneventful spontaneous regression after molar evacuation (n= 32), from women with complete hydatidiform mole who developed persistent trophoblastic disease after evacuation of their mole (n= 28) and, as a control group, from women during the first trimester of normal pregnancy (n= 22). The serum specimens were subjected to chromatofocusing, and hCG was determined in the fractions collected in the pH range 7. 0 - 3. 0. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed that 36 % of complete hydatidiform mole patients with post-molar persistent trophoblastic disease development had different hCG <b>glycoform</b> profiles at 97 % specificity (pH interval 6. 3 - 5. 1, hCG cutoff 9. 9 %). There {{was a significant difference}} between complete hydatidiform mole with and without persistent trophoblastic disease for the cumulative percent amounts of hCG in the pH interval 6. 3 - 5. 1 (p< 0. 0003). CONCLUSION: In 36 % of the patients with complete hydatidiform mole with subsequent development of persistent trophoblastic disease, typical <b>glycoform</b> profiles for hCG are observed in pre-evacuation serum samples. This result suggests that hCG <b>glycoform</b> profiles are of potential use in the prediction of persistent trophoblastic disease...|$|E
40|$|Optimization of post-translational {{modifications}} {{was shown}} to affect the ability of recombinant human acetylcholinesterase (rHuAChE) produced in HEK- 293 cells to be retained in the circulation for prolonged periods of time [Kronman, Velan, Marcus, Ordentlich, Reuveny and Shafferman (1995) Biochem. J. 311, 959 - 967; Chitlaru, Kronman, Zeevi, Kam, Harel, Ordentlich, Velan and Shafferman (1998) Biochem. J. 336, 647 - 658; Chitlaru, Kronman, Velan and Shafferman (2001) Biochem. J. 354, 613 - 625]. To evaluate the possible contribution {{of the number of}} appended N-glycans in determining the pharmacokinetic behaviour of AChE, a series of sixteen recombinant human AChE <b>glycoforms,</b> differing in their number of appended N-glycans (2, 3, 4 or 5 glycans), state of assembly (dimeric or tetrameric) and terminal glycan sialylation (partially or fully sialylated) were generated. Extensive structural analysis of N-glycans demonstrated that the various glycan types associated with all the different rHuAChE <b>glycoforms</b> are essentially similar both in structure and abundance, and that production of the various <b>glycoforms</b> in the sialyltransferase-overexpressing 293 ST- 2 D 6 cell line resulted in the generation of enzyme species that carry glycans sialylated to the same extent. Pharmacokinetic profiling of the rHuAChE <b>glycoforms</b> in their fully tetramerized and sialylated state clearly demonstrated that circulatory longevity correlated directly with the number of attached N-glycans (mean residence times for rHuAChE <b>glycoforms</b> harbouring 2, 3, and 4 glycans= 200, 740, and 1055 min respectively). This study provides evidence that glycan loading, together with N-glycan terminal processing and enzyme subunit oligomerization, operate in a hierarchical and concerted manner in determining the pharmacokinetic characteristics of AChE...|$|R

However to such released <b>glycoforms</b> it is difficult to introduce a label to amplify a signal for oligosaccharide detection. In our study we used a combination of the β-elimination and hydrazinolysis methods.

Serum transferrin (Tf) and alpha 1 -antitrypsin (AAT) that are markers for CDG, were purified sequentially to obtain high-quality MALDI mass spectra to differentiate single <b>glycoforms</b> {{of the native}} intact glycoproteins. The procedure was found feasible for the investigation of protein macroheterogeneity due to glycosylation site underoccupancy then ensuing the characterization of patients with CDG group I (N-glycan assembly disorders). Following PNGase F digestion of the purified glycoprotein, the characterization of protein microheterogeneity by N-glycan MS analysis was performed in a patient with CDG group II (processing disorders). CDG-Ia patients showed a typical profile of underglycosylation where the fully glycosylated <b>glycoforms</b> are always the most abundant present in plasma with lesser amounts of partially and unglycosylated <b>glycoforms</b> in this order. Galactosemia and HFI are potentially fatal diseases, which benefit from early diagnosis and prompt therapeutic intervention. In symptomatic patients with galactosemia and in those with HFI, MALDI MS of Tf and AAT depicts a hypoglycosylation profile with a significant increase of underglycosylated <b>glycoforms</b> that reverses by dietary treatment, representing a clue for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. status: publishe...|$|R
