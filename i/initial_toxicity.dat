50|$|Organohalogen compounds, such as dioxins, are {{commonly}} found in pesticides or created as by-products of pesticide manufacture or degradation. These compounds can {{have a significant impact}} on the neurobiology of exposed organisms. Some observed effects of exposure to dioxins are altered astroglial intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+), decreased glutathione levels, modified neurotransmitter function in the CNS, and loss of pH maintenance. A study of 350 chemical plant employees exposed to a dioxin precursor for herbicide synthesis between 1965 and 1968 showed that 80 of the employees displayed signs of dioxin poisoning. Of these 350 employees, 15 were contacted again in 2004 to submit to neurological tests to assess whether the dioxin poisoning had any long-term effects on neurological capabilities. The amount of time that had passed made it difficult to assemble a larger cohort, but the results of the tests indicated that eight of the 15 subjects exhibited some central nervous system impairment, nine showed signs of polyneuropathy, and electroencephalography (EEG) showed various degrees of structural abnormalities. This study suggested that the effects of dioxins were not limited to <b>initial</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Dioxins, through neuroplastic effects, can cause long-term damage that may not manifest itself for years or even decades.|$|E

40|$|The enzyme-catalyzed {{polymerization}} of {{phenolic compounds}} {{has been proposed}} as an alternative method {{for the treatment of}} industrial wastewaters which contain these contaminants. In addition to the efficient removal of these phenolic compounds, one should also be concerned with residual soluble by-products of the enzymatic reaction which may potentially exhibit higher toxicities than the parent phenols. In this investigation, a number of phenolic compounds were completely removed from solution using excess concentrations of soybean peroxidase and horseradish peroxidase. Partial treatment of phenol was also carried out using limited enzyme doses. Supernatants were characterized in terms of their acute toxicities using the 5 -minute Microtox assay. The fully treated mixtures obtained from the enzymatic polymerization of 4 -chlorophenol and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol were significantly more toxic than expected, while those obtained from the oxidation of 2 -methylphenol, 2 -chlorophenol, and phenol had residual toxicities which were higher than the <b>initial</b> <b>toxicities</b> of the corresponding untreated mixtures. GC and 14 C radio-tracer analyses of the peroxidase-treated phenol solutions revealed that the total quantity of residual by-products was lowest when full treatment of the substrate was achieved. However, residual non-phenol toxicities were found to be lower in samples which had undergone only partial treatment. The residual effluent toxicities for the fully treated samples were observed to be independent of the initial phenol concentration...|$|R
40|$|Mushroom {{tyrosinase}} (polyphenol oxidase, EC 1. 14. 18. 1) {{was investigated}} {{as an alternative}} to peroxidase, enzymes for the catalytic removal of phenolic compounds from wastewaters. The maximum catalytic activity was observed at pH 7; however, significant activity was observed at pHs ranging from 5 to 8. Tyrosinase was unstable under acidic conditions and at elevated temperatures. The activation energy for thermal inactivation of tyrosinase was determined to be 1. 85 kJ mol- 1 at pH 7. The transformation of phenols catalysed, by tyrosinase was investigated as a function of pH, initial phenol concentration, and additives. Phenol was transformed successfully with tyrosinase, over a wide range of pH (pH 5 [...] 8) and a wide range of initial concentrations (0. 5 mM [...] 10 mM). Some chlorinated phenols were also successfully transformed with tyrosinase. Polyethylene glycol and chitosan did not improve the transformation efficiency of phenol. However, chitosan was successfully used to remove coloured, products resulting from treatment Since coagulation with aluminium sulfate failed, the colour removal induced by chitosan addition appeared {{to be the result of}} simultaneous coagulation and adsorption mechanisms. Minimum doses of chitosan required to achieve 90 % of colour removal were logarithmically related to the quantity of phenol treated. All solutions of phenol and chlorophenols treated with tyrosinase, had substantially lower toxicities, than their corresponding <b>initial</b> <b>toxicities.</b> Chitosan addition enhanced the reduction in toxicity very effectively. The toxicities of the phenol solutions treated with tyrosinase were markedly lower than previously reported toxicities of solutions treated with peroxidase enzymes...|$|R

Larvicidal activities of 3 highly mosquitocidal strains, strains C 3 - 41, Mal, and LB 24, previously selected in the laboratory, were {{compared with that of}} strain 2362 in tropical and European countries. The following steps were performed : production and titration of acetonic powders from these 4 strains on local #Culex$ species, survey of initial and residual activity under standardized indoor and outdoor conditions, and evaluation of the efficacity of liquid formulations of the 4 strains in natural breeding sites of #Culex$. In indoor conditions, strain C 3 - 41 showed the highest activity on both #Culex pipiens$ and #Culex quinquefasciatus$; strain Mal was the least active.

In tropical countries, larval recolonization in cesspits or ponds occured after 10 - 35 days. In Europe, higher doses were needed in polluted water than in clear water (from 3 to 10 liter/ha) for the same control, and the time before 80 % residual activity was reached was less than 9 - 12 days. However, in cesspits, residual activity could be observed for 12 days to 5 mo.

40|$|AbstractThe Microtox® {{test was}} used to {{quantify}} the impact of holding time on toxicity of compounds formed in the electrochemical treatment of phenol. Phenol was treated {{in the presence of a}} sodium chloride (NaCl) or sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4) electrolyte using either a boron-doped diamond anode/stainless steel cathode, or graphite anode/SS cathode. The intermediates from both oxidative and chlorine-substitution pathways were measured concurrently using HPLC immediately after the application of constant current was stopped and at time intervals up to 18 days. The toxicity of the samples were measured using the Microtox® basic test protocol at each of these time points as well. Chlorine-substitution pathway effluents, consisting mainly of chlorinated phenols, exhibited little toxicity change over the 18 day storage period considered in the study. Oxidative pathway effluents, however, consisting of quinone products, most notably the highly toxic benzoquinone, exhibited significant toxicity loss over the time period of the study. Over a period of 18 days, a 0. 092 mM solution of benzoquinone alone lost over 92 % of its <b>initial</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Over a 13 day period, an electrochemical effluent from conditions conducive to the oxidative pathway and benzoquinone formation also lost over 96 % of its <b>initial</b> <b>toxicity...</b>|$|E

We evaluated QL and Q-TWiST among patients randomised to adjuvant dose-intensive epirubicin and cyclophosphamide administered with filgrastim and progenitor cell support (DI-EC) or standard-dose anthracycline-based chemotherapy (SD-CT). We estimated the duration of chemotherapy toxicity (TOX), time without disease symptoms and toxicity (TWiST), and time following relapse (REL). Patients scored QL indicators. Mean durations for the three transition times were weighted with patient reported utilities to obtain mean Q-TWiST. Patients receiving DI-EC reported worse QL during TOX, especially treatment burden (month 3 : P< 0. 01), but a faster recovery 3 months following chemotherapy than patients receiving SD-CT, for example, less coping effort (P< 0. 01).

Our <b>initial</b> metal <b>toxicity</b> experiments indicate that hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) is variably cytotoxic to Steller sea lions depending on the organ involved.

Thus, skin is more resistant to Cr(VI) than lung cells, and liver cells are the most sensitive of the three.

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the application of}} a solar driven advanced oxidation process (solar photo-Fenton), for the degradation of antibiotics at low concentration level (mg L 1) in secondary treated domestic effluents at a pilot-scale. The examined antibiotics were ofloxacin (OFX) and trimethoprim (TMP). A compound parabolic collector (CPC) pilot plant was used for the photocatalytic experiments. The process was mainly evaluated by a fast and reliable analytical method based on a UPLC-MS/MS system. Solar photo-Fenton process using low iron and hydrogen peroxide doses ([Fe 2 þ] 0 ¼ 5 mg L 1; [H 2 O 2] 0 ¼ 75 mg L 1) was proved to be an efficient method for the elimination of these compounds with relatively high degradation rates. The photocatalytic degradation of OFX and TMP with the solar photo-Fenton process followed apparent first-order kinetics. A modification of the first-order kinetic expression was proposed and has been successfully used to explain the degradation kinetics of the compounds during the solar photo- Fenton treatment.

Despite the presence of aggregates in affected patients, the precise relationship between aggregates and disease pathogenesis is unresolved. Results from in vivo and in vitro studies of mutant huntingtin {{have led to the}} hypothesis that nuclear localization of aggregates is critical for the pathology of Huntington's disease (HD). We tested this hypothesis using a 293 T cell culture model system by comparing the frequency and toxicity of cytoplasmic and nuclear huntingtin aggregates. Insertion of nuclear import or export sequences into huntingtin fragments containing 548 or 151 amino acids was used to reverse the normal localization of these proteins. Changing the subcellular localization of the fragments did not influence their total aggregate frequency. There were also no significant differences in toxicity associated with the presence of nuclear compared with cytoplasmic aggregates. These studies, together with findings in transgenic mice, suggest two phases for the pathogenesis of HD, with the <b>initial</b> <b>toxicity</b> in the cytoplasm followed by proteolytic processing of huntingtin, nuclear translocation with increased nuclear concentration of N-terminal fragments, seeding of aggregates and resultant apoptotic death. These findings support the nucleus and cytosol as subcellular sites for pathogenesis in HD...|$|E
40|$|Malaria is {{endemic to}} Lombok Island, Indonesia. One {{approach}} to suppress malaria spread {{is to eliminate}} anopheline larvae in their habitat and the environmentally safe agent is bacteria, that is, Bacillus sphaericus. However, there is no information regarding local isolate of B. sphaericus that is toxic to mosquito larvae from Lombok. The aims {{of the study were}} to isolate B. sphaericus from soil in areas close to beach surrounding Lombok Island and to test their toxicity against 3 rd instar Anopheles aconitus larvae. Soil samples were collected from 20 different sampling locations from Lombok Island and homogenized with sterile physiological salt solution. Suspension was heat-shocked at 80 °C for 30 minutes and then spread onto antibiotic-supplemented NYSM solid medium. Colonies grown were characterized and subjected to <b>initial</b> <b>toxicity</b> test against anopheline larvae. Isolates with more than 50 % killing percentage were subjected to bioassay testing against anopheline larvae. From 20 locations, 1 isolate showed mild toxicity (namely, isolate MNT) and 2 isolates showed high toxicity (namely, isolates SLG and TJL 2) against An. aconitus. Those 3 isolates were potentially useful isolates, as they killed almost all larvae in 24 hours. The discovery of toxic indigenous isolates of B. sphaericus from Lombok Island opens opportunity to develop a biopesticide from local resources...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Rituximab {{has been}} {{reported}} to have little activity in small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) /chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and to be associated with significant infusion-related toxicity. This study sought to decrease the <b>initial</b> <b>toxicity</b> and optimize the pharma-cokinetics with an alternative treatment schedule. Patients and Methods: Thirty three patients with SLL/ CLL received dose 1 of rituximab (100 mg) over 4 hours. In cohort I (n 5 3; 250 mg/m 2) and cohort II (n 5 7; 375 mg/m 2) rituximab was administered on day 3 and there-after three times weekly for 4 weeks using a standard administration schedule. Cohort III (n 5 23; 375 mg/m 2) administered rituximab similar to cohort II for the first two treatments and then over 1 hour thereafter. Results: A total of 33 CLL/SLL patients were enrolled; only one patient discontinued therapy because of infusion-related toxicity. Thirteen patients developed transient hy-poxemia, hypotension, or dyspnea that were associated with significant changes in baseline interleukin- 6, interleu-kin- 8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma compared with those not experiencing such reactions. Infu-sion-related toxicity occurred more commonly in older (me-dian age 73 v 62 years; P 5. 02) patients with no other pretreatment clinical or laboratory features predicting oc-currence of these events.

40|$|This study reports surface {{complexation}} models (SCMs) for quantifying {{metal ion}} adsorption by thermophilic microorganisms. In <b>initial</b> cadmium ion <b>toxicity</b> tests, {{members of the}} genus Geobacillus displayed the highest tolerance to CdCl 2 (as high as 400 to 3, 200 μM). The thermophilic, gram-positive bacteria Geobacillus stearothermophilus and G. thermocatenulatus were selected for further electrophoretic mobility, potentiometric titration, and Cd 2 + adsorption experiments to characterize Cd 2 + complexation by functional groups within and on the cell wall. Distinct one-site SCMs described the extent of cadmium ion adsorption by both studied Geobacillus sp. strains over a range of pH values and metal/bacteria concentration ratios. The results indicate that a functional group with a deprotonation constant pK value of approximately 3. 8 accounts for 66 % and 80 % of all titratable sites for G. thermocatenulatus and G. stearothermophilus, respectively, and is dominant in Cd 2 + adsorption reactions. The results suggest {{a different type of}} functional group may be involved in cadmium biosorption for both thermophilic strains investigated here, compared to previous reports for mesophilic bacteria...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. -Individual {{tolerance}} to single or widely spaced doses of methotrexate was explored in 49 patients with advanced cancer with normal serum creatinine and/or blood urea nitrogen. Methotrexate was given as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour at initial doses of 80 - 120 mg. /m 2 body surface area. The doses were increased by 50 % increments every 2 weeks until moderate toxicity occurred, arbitrarily defined as leukopenia < 5000 /mm. 3, and/or thrombocytopenia < 100, 000 /mm. 3, and/or {{the appearance of}} oral mucous or intestinal toxicity. The individual dose required to produce <b>initial</b> evidence of <b>toxicity</b> varied {{by a factor of}} 18 between 50 and 900 mg. /m 2. Starting doses above 80 mg. /m 2 were potentially hazardous. Dose limiting toxicity consisted of leukopenia with or without stomatitis in 81 % of the patients, and stomatitis without leukopenia, in 19 %. Thrombocytopenia was seen in 19 % of the patients, but was never a dose limiting factor alone. Leukopenia always preceded thrombocytopenia. The nadir for haematologic toxicity varied considerably between day 5 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Hundreds of {{groundwater}} {{samples were collected}} at E 95 (95 % ethanol, 5 % gasoline) train derailment spills in Balaton and Cambria, Minnesota and South Hutchinson, Kansas. Most samples were analyzed for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), ethanol, methane, acetate, terminal electron acceptors, and field parameters. At each site, maximum groundwater ethanol concentrations at percent levels were restricted to the release area and downgradient ethanol transport was not detected. A shallow, anaerobic groundwater zone characterized {{by the absence of}} dissolved oxygen, low nitrate (less than 1 mg N/L), high Fe+ 2, and high dissolved methane (more than 10, 000 μg/L) and BTEX formed and spread downgradient from each release area. BTEX appeared to be persistent. Methane appeared to be generated within the capillary fringe and very shallow groundwater and migrate laterally. Methane’s high oxygen demand promotes anaerobic conditions within the shallow groundwater. Estimated and measured methane soil gas concentrations exceeded the lower explosive limit. Long-term monitoring at South Hutchinson and Cambria using 1 to 5 -foot (0. 3 to 1. 5 m) well screens straddling the capillary fringe and the shallow water table effectively demonstrated the presence of high ethanol (~ 1 %) and benzene (more than 250 μg/L) concentrations 5 years after the release. The wells appear impacted by long-term ethanol inputs from the vadose zone where ethanol has persisted for years after the <b>initial</b> release. <b>Toxicity,</b> volatile fatty acids, excess hydrogen production, and/or exudate coatings could be responsible for ethanol’s preservation. High acetate and hydrogen concentrations at South Hutchinson indicated that fermentation was actively occurring in the very shallow groundwater and/or in the lower capillary fringe. Shortscreened (1 to 5 feet; 0. 3 to 1. 5 m) nested wells were pivotal to improving our understanding of ethanol’s behavior...|$|R
