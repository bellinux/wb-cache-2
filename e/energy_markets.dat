5|$|In 2013, {{the energy}} {{consumption}} was 240 billion kilowatt hours. As Turkey imported 72 {{percent of its}} energy in 2013, the government decided to invest in nuclear power to reduce imports. Three nuclear power stations are to be built by 2023. Turkey's first nuclear power plants are planned {{to be built in}} Mersin's Akkuyu district on the Mediterranean coast; in Sinop's İnceburun district on the Black Sea coast; and in Kırklareli's İğneada district on the Black Sea coast. Turkey has the fifth highest direct utilisation and capacity of geothermal power in the world. Turkey is a partner country of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing energy security, convergence of member state <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> on the basis of EU internal energy market principles, supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{wind power}} {{industry}} set new records in 2014 – more than 50 GW of new capacity was installed. Another record breaking year occurred in 2015, with 22% annual market growth {{resulting in the}} 60 GW mark being passed. In 2015, close to half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America. This was largely from new construction in China and India. Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) figures show that 2015 recorded an increase of installed capacity of more than 63 GW, taking the total installed wind energy capacity to 432.9 GW, up from 74 GW in 2006. In terms of economic value, the wind energy sector {{has become one of}} the important players in the <b>energy</b> <b>markets,</b> with the total investments reaching bn (bn), an increase of 4% over 2014.|$|E

40|$|The energy {{intensive}} industry can be {{a major contributor to}} CO 2 emissions reduction, provided that appropriate investments are made. Predictions about future <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> conditions are needed to assess profitability and net CO 2 emissions reduction potential of such measures. <b>Energy</b> <b>market</b> scenarios can be used to reflect different possible future <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> conditions. This paper presents a tool for creating consistent <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> scenarios adapted for evaluation of energy related investments in {{energy intensive}} industrial processes. Required user inputs include fossil fuel prices and costs associated with policy instruments, and the outputs are <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> prices and CO 2 consequences of import/export of different energy streams (e. g. electric power and biofuel) from an industrial process site. The paper also presents four <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> scenarios for 2020 created with the tool...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the expansion}} of the EU into <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> regulation. It shows that the limits to EU influence and, thereby, EU <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> regulation for the internal <b>energy</b> <b>market,</b> begin where EU influence affects national interests with regard to ensuring energy security. This scientifically established insight bears an important practical implication. The further development of EU <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> regulation as a cornerstone of the internal <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> faces a particular policy challenge: It is necessary to establish a regulatory framework for the internal electricity and gas market, which acknowledges the primacy of national energy security interests. This finding is important {{in the light of the}} new and increasing energy policy challenges that some Member States face today, not least as a result of a liberalized <b>energy</b> <b>market.</b> Moreover, in the context of new systemic risks arising from ongoing <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> integration, a politically unstable (in the worst case - collapsing) EU regulatory framework can cause significant social and economic costs for individual Member States. With regard to that, the study points to the increasingly complex policy areas that are made subject to EU integration and calls for more attention to the related regulatory and political risks - also with a view to the current euro crisis...|$|R

25|$|In energy policy, the Thaksin {{government}} {{continued the}} Chuan Leekpai government's privatisation agenda, but with important changes. Whereas the Chuan government's post-Asian financial crisis policies sought economic efficiency through industry fragmentation and wholesale power pool competition, Thaksin's policies aimed to create national champions that could reliably support stronger {{economic growth and}} become important players in regional <b>energy</b> <b>markets.</b> Thaksin also initiated a policy to encourage renewable energy and energy conservation. Many Thaksin-era energy policies were reversed following the 2006 coup.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of Barack Obama—a supporter of renewable energy, {{greenhouse gas emissions}} trading {{and the development of}} electric cars—as president of the United States in 2008 was seen as a positive development for the company's outlook.

30|$|Second, it is {{critical}} to establish and perfect the related policies and measures. This is the most important measure, chiefly because the China’s <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> has experienced a lack of more aggressive energy efficiency policies and more vigorous policy actions for decades. For example, the resource tax in China’s <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> has been comprehensively introduced. However, the stringency level of the resource tax has generally lagged behind that of developed countries. Furthermore, it is difficult to implement some <b>energy</b> <b>market</b> policies and measures in China.|$|R

Estonian energy liberalization is lagging far behind the Nordic energy market. During the accession negotiations with the EU, Estonia agreed that at least 35% of the market are opened before 2009 and all of non-household market, which totals around 77% of consumption, before 2013. Estonia is concerned that Russia could use <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> to bully it.

Some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables. Outside Europe, a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10% to 50%.|$|E

25|$|The Reform Party saw the Canadian federal {{government}} as {{led by the}} Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties as being consistently indifferent to Western Canada while focusing too much attention on Eastern Canada (especially Quebec). It noted that the National Energy Program of the 1980s, introduced by a federal Liberal government, involved major government intervention into Canada's <b>energy</b> <b>markets</b> to regulate prices, resulting in economic losses to Alberta and benefits to Eastern Canada. It also cited the 1986 decision by a federal Progressive Conservative government to contract the construction of CF-18 military aircraft to an unprepared contractor in Quebec rather than a ready contractor in Winnipeg, Manitoba. To Reformers, these events served as evidence that Liberals and Progressive Conservatives consistently favoured Eastern Canada {{at the expense of}} Western Canada.|$|E
25|$|How might {{climate change}} have other effects that {{indirectly}} shape energy {{production and consumption}} in the United States? The research evidence about indirect effects ranges from abundant information about possible {{effects of climate change}} policies on energy technology choices to extremely limited information about such issues as effects on energy security. Based on this mixed evidence, it appears that climate change is likely to affect risk management in the investment behavior of some energy institutions, and it is very likely to have some effects on energy technology R investments and energy resource and technology choices. In addition, climate change can be expected to affect other countries in ways that in turn affect U.S. energy conditions through their participation in global and hemispheric <b>energy</b> <b>markets,</b> and climate change concerns could interact with some driving forces behind policies focused on U.S. energy security.|$|E
