2500|$|Macropsia is {{generally}} diagnosed once a patient complains of the characteristic symptoms, such as disproportionally large objects in their visual field. The Amsler <b>Grid</b> <b>test</b> {{can be used}} to diagnose macropsia, along with other visual maladies depending on the subjective disturbance reported by the patient after looking at the Amsler Grid. Outward bulging of the lines on an Amsler Grid is consistent with patients experiencing macropsisa. [...] The New Aniseikonia Test (NAT) can quantify the degree of macropsia or micropsia independently in the vertical and horizontal meridians. The test consists of red and green semicircles on a black background with a white round fixation target. [...] The size of the red semicircle is held constant while the green semicircle is varied in size in 1% increments. The patient wears a pair of red/green goggles so that one eye is tested at a time, and the patient attempts to determine when the semicircles are the same size. [...] This is termed the reversal threshold and the size difference between the semicircles is reported as the degree of aniseikonia. [...] A positive value indicates that the object was perceived bigger and thus corresponds to macropsia, and conversely a negative value indicates micropsia. [...] The Aniseikonia Inspector contains an aniseikonia test based on the same principles as the NAT, but the test is run on a computer screen, it is based on a forced choice method, and it can measure the size difference {{as a function of the}} size of the objects. The functionality of being able to measure the size difference as function of the size (i.e. field dependent testing) is especially important when the macropsia (or micropsia) has a retinal origin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{notion of}} grid {{computing}} has gained an increasing popularity {{recently as a}} realistic solution to many of our large-scale data storage and processing needs. It enables the sharing, selection and aggregation of resources geographically distributed across collaborative organisations. Now {{more and more people}} are beginning to embrace grid computing and thus are seeing the need to set up their own grids and grid testbeds. With this comes the need to have some means to enable them to view and monitor the status of the resources in these testbeds. Generally developers invest a substantial amount of time and effort developing custom <b>grid</b> <b>testbed</b> monitoring software. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes Gridscape – a tool that enables the rapid creation of interactive and dynamic testbed portals (without any programming effort). Gridscape primarily aims to provide a solution for those users who need to create a <b>grid</b> <b>testbed</b> portal but don't necessarily have the time or resources to build a system of their own from scratch. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar a influência de alguns tipos de opacidade {{lenticular}} no teste da tela de Amsler entre portadores de catarata senil. MÉTODOS:Foram avaliados 200 pacientes portadores de catarata senil através da aplicação da tela de Amsler, antes e após a cirurgia. O estudo foi feito em um único centro, simples cego, randomizado e prospectivo. Os pacientes foram submetidos a exame de acuidade visual (AV) corrigida, para longe e perto, biomicroscopia do segmento anterior e da região macular. RESULTADOS:A acuidade visual média pré-operatória para longe dos 200 pacientes foi de 0, 5 logMAR (20 / 60 Tabela de Snellen). Após a cirurgia, dos 11 pacientes que haviam apresentado alteração na tela de Amsler pré-operatória, dez não tiveram alteração no exame de reavaliação da tela. Os 10 indivíduos apresentaram acuidade visual pós-operatória, com a melhor correção óptica, para distância de 20 / 20 e para perto de J 1. No presente estudo foi constatado 5, 5 % com alteração na tela de Amsler antes da cirurgia, em 5 % dos pacientes estas alterações estavam diretamente relacionados a opacidade do cristalino e 0, 5 % relacionados a opacidade vítrea.
