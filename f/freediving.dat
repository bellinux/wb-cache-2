5|$|The {{ability to}} dive and swim {{underwater}} while holding one's breath {{is considered a}} useful emergency skill, {{an important part of}} water sport and Navy safety training, and an enjoyable leisure activity. Underwater diving without breathing apparatus can be categorised as underwater swimming, snorkelling and <b>freediving.</b> These categories overlap considerably. Several competitive underwater sports are practised without breathing apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Blackouts in <b>freediving</b> {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for {{metabolic}} activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E

25|$|Skilled, {{highly trained}} and very fit freedivers can often go {{as deep as}} {{recreational}} scuba divers, and sometimes deeper, but for a very much shorter time. Recreational scuba diving is generally limited by diver certification {{to a maximum of}} 40 meters, for reasons of safety. Recreational divers who dive to deeper depths are generally expected by the certification agencies to have technical diver training, while <b>freediving</b> is only limited by the divers ability and willingness to accept the risks. The risks of <b>freediving</b> to these depths are significant, and a major difference is that recreational scuba certification agencies specify depth restrictions to avoid liablity issues, while freedivers are left to make their own choices regarding risk acceptance. Recreational <b>freediving</b> is practiced by many people ranging from the average snorkeler to the professional freediver. Recreational <b>freediving</b> is also frequently practiced in freshwater springs due to excellent visibility.|$|E
25|$|Training for <b>freediving</b> {{can take}} many forms, some {{of which can be}} {{performed}} on land.|$|E
25|$|Some cave {{passages}} are {{so small}} that shorter fins are better to use than long <b>freediving</b> fins.|$|E

25|$|<b>Freediving,</b> free-diving, free diving, breath-hold diving, or {{skin diving}} {{is a form}} of {{underwater}} diving that relies on divers' ability to hold their breath until resurfacing rather than on the use of a breathing apparatus such as scuba gear.|$|E
25|$|Free-diving was {{the primary}} source of income for many Gulf {{nationals}} such as Qataris, Emiratis, and Bahrainis and Kuwaitis. As a result, Qatari, Emirati and Bahraini heritage promoters have popularized recreational and serious events associated with <b>freediving,</b> underwater equipment and related activities such as snorkeling.|$|E

25|$|Competitive <b>freediving</b> is {{currently}} governed by two world associations: AIDA International (International Association for Development of Apnea) and CMAS (Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques – World Underwater Federation). Each organization {{has its own}} rules on recognizing a record attempt. These {{can be found on}} the website from the respective organizations.|$|E
25|$|Divers and {{swimmers}} who blackout or {{grey out}} underwater during a dive will usually drown unless rescued and resuscitated {{within a short}} time. <b>Freediving</b> blackout has a high fatality rate, and mostly involves males younger than 40 years, but is generally avoidable. Risk cannot be quantified, but is clearly increased by any level of hyperventilation.|$|E
25|$|Most {{types of}} {{competitive}} <b>freediving</b> {{have in common}} {{that it is an}} individual sport based on the best individual achievement. An exception to this rule is the bi-annual World Championship for Teams, held by AIDA, where the combined score of the team members makes up the team's total points. Another exception is the Skandalopetra diving by CMAS.|$|E

25|$|For {{thousands}} of years, most seawater pearls were retrieved by divers {{working in the}} Indian Ocean, {{in areas such as}} the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and in the Gulf of Mannar (between Sri Lanka and India). A fragment of Isidore of Charax's Parthian itinerary was preserved in Athenaeus's 3rd-century Sophists at Dinner, recording <b>freediving</b> for pearls around an island in the Persian Gulf.|$|E
25|$|The film {{took over}} four years to complete, and follows the story of Max Avery (Justin Flint Williford), as he pursues {{competitive}} <b>freediving</b> as an emotional and physical respite from chronic lung disease. His love for the potentially deadly sport, however, causes a rift between Avery and his father, a cautious physician. Christopherson had first met Justin Williford when they were roommates at the Olympic Training Center, where Wiliford was a shotgun shooter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Freediving</b> {{blackout}} {{can occur}} on any dive profile: at constant depth, on an ascent from depth, {{or at the}} surface following ascent from depth and may be described {{by a number of}} terms depending on the dive profile and depth at which consciousness is lost. Blackout during a shallow dive differs from blackout during ascent from a deep dive in that deep water blackout is precipitated by depressurisation on ascent from depth while shallow water blackout is a consequence of hypocapnia following hyperventilation.|$|E
