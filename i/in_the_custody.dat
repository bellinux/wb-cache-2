5|$|Anne {{soon learned}} {{that she would have}} no say in her son's care. James {{appointed}} as head of the nursery his former nurse Helen Little, who installed Henry in James' own oak cradle.

5|$|English Heritage {{took over}} control of the castle in 1983 and {{continued}} to operate it as a tourist attraction. In the 21st century the castle is protected by UK law as an ancient monument and a grade I listed building.

5|$|The repute of the {{sanctuary}} was far reaching. Cypriot pilgrims from Paphos left marks of their devotion for Astarte on a marble stele inscribed both in Greek and Cypriot syllabary at Astarte's shrine; this stele is now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the seventh}} and eighth centuries, the two abbeys {{followed}} their mission of evangelism, along with forest clearance. With {{the decline of the}} Carolingian Empire, however, the abbeys suffered the same decay as elsewhere, leaving the principality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of lay abbots—temporal guardians—from 844 to 938, including Ebbo, archbishop of Rheims, Adalard the Seneschal, and Reginar and Giselbert, dukes of Lorraine.|$|E

5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court. The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent was outside the bounds of {{the authority of the}} Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court was right to reverse. Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E
5|$|Although the originators {{intended}} {{to devise a}} system that was equally accessible to all, it proved necessary to use prototype units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of national or local authorities as standards. Control of the prototype units of measure was maintained by the later French governments until 1875, when it was passed to an international intergovernmental organisation, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM).|$|E
5|$|Between 1087 and 1089, Rufus asked Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, {{to build}} a new stone castle at Rochester. He {{established}} the current extent of the castle. Though much altered through the centuries, some parts of Gundulf's work survive. In 1127 King HenryI granted the castle to the Archbishop of Canterbury in perpetuity. William de Corbeil built the massive keep that still dominates the castle today. Throughout the 12thcentury the castle remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of the archbishops.|$|E

5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer {{found that it was}} {{relevant}} to the custody analysis. Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement can be difficult to determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E
5|$|The body {{of one of}} U-853s crewmembers was {{recovered}} in 1960 and was interred in the Island Cemetery Annex on Van Zandt Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island.

50|$|Falling into disrepair, <b>in</b> 1763, <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of <b>the</b> villa {{went to the}} Camera Apostolica of <b>the</b> Catholic church. <b>In</b> 1777 it was ceded by Pope Pius VI to Prince Orazio Albani, {{brother of}} the former pope Pope Clement XI, and father of {{cardinal}} Alessandro Albani. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 19th-century, many of the frescoes were restored by Giuseppe Gennari.

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages, pilgrims to the Holy Land {{would bring}} back palms for deposit {{at their home}} churches.

50|$|In 1860 or 1863, during {{restoration}} works, it was uncovered {{that the}} whole strained tower had to be deconstructed. <b>In</b> 1864, under <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of architect Albrecht, a new 60 metre tower was built, on the exemplar of <b>the</b> Palazzo Vecchio <b>in</b> Florence, Italy.|$|R
5|$|Upon his release, Morris {{returned}} to Peekskill where {{he discovered that}} he had been promoted to the rank of captain while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of the British. Morris commanded a company back to White Plains until he received orders to head south to Virginia. Upon arrival, Morris's company, under the overall command of General George Washington, aided in Siege of Yorktown, the last major battle of the American Revolution. Specifically, Morris's company of light infantry provided support to the forlorn hope commanded by Colonel Alexander Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|After the Republic was proclaimed, the {{national}} flag was provisionally adopted as distinguishing {{flag of the}} head of state in place of the royal standard. On the initiative of the Ministry of Defence, a project was prepared in 1965 to adopt a distinct flag. Opportunity suggested the most natural solution was the Italian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms; however, under conditions of poor visibility, this could easily be mistaken for the standard of the President of the United States of Mexico, which is also that country's national flag. The standard is kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of the Commander of the Reggimento Corazzieri of the Arma dei Carabinieri, along with the war flag (assigned to Regiment in 1878).|$|E
5|$|Braose {{was the son}} of William de Braose, 1st Baron Braose and {{his first}} wife, Aline, {{daughter}} of Thomas de Multon. He was likely born around 1260, as his age was given as about 46 in 1307. Other events prove that he was born prior to 1264, as he was captured in that year. This came about during the Second Barons' War (1264–1267) during the reign of King Henry III of England, as the elder Braose had sided with the king during Simon de Montfort's rebellion. The younger Braose was a hostage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of Montfort's wife, Eleanor. Her household accounts include expenses related to the younger William's care.|$|E

Once that is done, Abigail is told to tell the events {{that led up to}} her arrest.|$|R
5|$|Brock's {{successor}} at Detroit, however, fared much worse. Colonel Henry Procter {{faced an}} attack from a resurrected American Army of the Northwest under future President William Henry Harrison. Harrison {{set out to}} retake Detroit, but a detachment of his army was defeated at Frenchtown on 22 January 1813. Procter, displaying poor judgement, left the prisoners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of his First Nations allies, who proceeded to execute an indeterminate number of them. Subsequent American victories allowed Harrison to attempt another invasion of Canada, {{which led to the}} Battle of the Thames on 5 October 1813. After a successful American charge, Procter's forces turned and fled, leaving Tecumseh and his American Indian troops to fight alone. They fought on, eventually being defeated. Perhaps of more importance to the British, at this battle Tecumseh died, and their alliance with the American Indians effectively ended.|$|E
5|$|Charles's only {{recourse}} was {{to return}} to negotiations, which were held at Newport on the Isle of Wight. On 5 December 1648, Parliament voted by 129 to 83 to continue negotiating with the king, but Oliver Cromwell and the army opposed any further talks with someone they viewed as a bloody tyrant and were already taking action to consolidate their power. Hammond was replaced as Governor of the Isle of Wight on 27 November, and placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of the army the following day. In Pride's Purge on 6 and 7 December, the members of Parliament out of sympathy with the military were arrested or excluded by Colonel Thomas Pride, while others stayed away voluntarily. The remaining members formed the Rump Parliament. It was effectively a military coup.|$|E
5|$|The International Prototype Kilogram was {{commissioned}} by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) {{under the authority of}} the Metre Convention (1875), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E
25|$|June 3, 2009, ICE removed Finnish Nationalist Henrik Holappa to Finland.

Holappa associated closely with David Duke and John de Nugent. Holappa spent 87 days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ICE <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ICE Detention Center in Batavia, New York.|$|R
50|$|The case {{involved}} Craven Berkeley, Augusta's stepfather. He had married Augusta Talbot (née Jones), widow of George Henry Talbot and Augusta's mother, in 1839; {{she died in}} 1841. Doyle made a petition for access to Augusta (Doyle v Wright) <b>in</b> 1840. <b>The</b> <b>custody</b> petition of March 1851 continued that case. Popular interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> issue linked anti-Catholic feeling with Augusta Talbot's status as an heiress to £80,000, around the allegation that the Catholic Church would profit if she died a nun.|$|R
