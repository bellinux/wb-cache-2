McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group.|$|E

5|$|In the Matsya Purana, Ila was disinherited after {{becoming}} a female or kimpurusha. Ila's father passed his inheritance directly to Pururavas, ignoring the three sons Ila-Sudyumma bore as a male. Pururavas ruled from Pratishtanapura (present-day Allahabad), where Ila stayed with him. The Ramayana says that having returned to manhood, Ila ruled Pratishtana while his son Shashabindu ruled over Bahlika. The Devi-Bhagavata Purana tells {{that as a}} man Sudyumma governed the kingdom and as a woman remained indoors. His subjects were disturbed by <b>his</b> <b>sex</b> changes and did not respect him as they once had. When Pururavas attained adulthood, Sudyumma left his kingdom to Pururavas {{and went to the}} forest for penance. The sage Narada told Sudyumma a nine-syllable mantra, Navakshara, which would please the Supreme Goddess. Pleased with his austerities, the Goddess emerged before Sudyumma, who was in his female form Ilā. Sudyumma praised the Goddess, who merged the king's soul with herself and thus, Ilā gained salvation.|$|E

Meanwhile, Crosetti (Jon Polito) spends a lot of time with his friend Officer Chris Thormann (Lee Tergesen), who is recovering from a recent shooting that has left him blind. At one point, Thormann defecates on himself and is humiliated, but Crosetti helps him clean up.

60|$|What {{does all}} this mean? It means that the {{activity}} of the lower psyche and lower body is polarized by the upper body. Eyes and ears want to gather sexual activity and knowledge. The mind becomes full of sex: and always, in an introvert, of <b>his</b> own <b>sex.</b> If we examine the apparent extroverts, like the flaunting Italian, we shall see the same thing. It is <b>his</b> own <b>sex</b> which obsesses him.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} {{ceased to}} be a tea-table talk, and became suddenly tragically real for Ann Veronica. There he sat, cheerfully friendly in <b>his</b> <b>sex's</b> freedom--the man she loved, the one man she cared should unlock the way to the wide world for her imprisoned feminine possibilities, and he seemed regardless that she stifled under his eyes; he made a jest of all this passionate insurgence of the souls of women against the fate of their conditions.|$|R

25|$|In Inuit shamanism, {{the first}} two humans were Aakulujjuusi and Uumarnituq, both male. This {{same-sex}} couple desired company and decided to mate. This sexual encounter resulted in pregnancy for Uumarnituq. As he was physically not equipped to give birth, a spell was cast that changed <b>his</b> <b>sex,</b> giving him a vagina capable of passing the child. The now-female Uumarnituq was also responsible for introducing war into the world via magic, in order to curb overpopulation. The goddess Sedna is an Inuit creator deity, with dominion of marine animals. She is depicted as gynandrous or hermaphroditic in some myths, and is served by two-spirit shamans. Other myths show Sedna as a bisexual or lesbian, living with her female partner {{at the bottom of}} the ocean.|$|E

At the backup transmitter, Mal incapacitates the Operative and forces him to watch the broadcast recording. Mal returns to the crew, and the blast doors open to reveal that River has killed all the Reavers. Alliance troops arrive, but the Operative orders them to stand down.|$|E

In return for her silence on <b>his</b> various <b>sex</b> scandals, Rob Lowe submitted to corporal punishment {{at the end of}} the interview. However, Rob Lowe began to enjoy being spanked by the Church Lady, who took this as a sign that Satan had possessed Lowe's butt and began screaming for Satan to leave the actor's body.|$|R
25|$|Early {{reports of}} sex {{reassignment}} surgery {{had been published}} in Germany in the 1920s, {{but it was not}} until approximately three decades later that the practice became more generally known; early surgeries were performed mostly in Europe and Casablanca. Burou operated <b>his</b> <b>sex</b> reassignment clinic, called “Clinique du Parc”, out of Casablanca and in 1973 reported his experience with over 3000 individual cases. Between 1956 and 1958 Burou independently developed the anteriorly pedicled penile skin flap inversion vaginoplasty in his clinic. The technique became the “gold standard” of skin-lined vaginoplasty in transsexuals. Burou performed well over 800 confirmed vaginoplasties by 1974. That year, he published his technique for the first time, and presented it at the Second Interdisciplinary Symposium on Gender Dysphoria syndrome. He is said to have worked at the clinic seven days a week, and more often than not, up to fifteen hours each day.|$|E
25|$|After {{having his}} way with Aoi, Yuuko and Manaka are taken into the room via a secret door. With all 3 captured, Kimura reveals his plans to make them <b>his</b> <b>sex</b> slaves. Yuuko tries to cover for her daughters and pleads with him to take her instead. He {{considers}} this and tells Yuuko he might spare her daughters if she can prove her worth. Yuuko gives him a very long blowjob while her two daughters watch. When Kimura seems pleased at her performance, Yuuko thinks she has won her daughters' freedom. Instead, Kimura reveals that he will never change his mind {{and that they are}} all there to stay. Yuuko breaks down in the end, Manaka breaks next and finally Aoi as well. The game ends with the ominous title card that as a new day starts the Kiryu family horror has 'only just begun'.|$|E
25|$|In May1938 {{with the}} Religions Law, Puyi was {{declared}} a god, and a cult of emperor-worship {{very similar to}} Japan's began with schoolchildren starting their classes by praying to {{a portrait of the}} god-emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor. Puyi's elevation to a god was due to the Sino-Japanese war, which caused the Japanese state to begin a program of totalitarian mobilization of society for total war in Japan and the places ruled by Japan. His Japanese handlers felt that ordinary people in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were more willing to bear the sacrifices for total war because of their devotion to their god-emperor, and it was decided that making Puyi into a god-emperor would have the same effect in Manchukuo. After 1938, Puyi was hardly ever allowed to leave the Salt Tax Palace, while the creation of the puppet regime of President Wang Jingwei in November1938 crushed Puyi's spirits, as it ended his hope of one day being restored as the Great Qing Emperor. Puyi became a hypochondriac, taking all sorts of pills for various imagined aliments and hormones to improve <b>his</b> <b>sex</b> drive and allow him to father a boy, as Puyi was convinced that the Japanese were poisoning his food to make him sterile. Puyi believed that Japanese wanted one of the children that Pujie had fathered with his Japanese wife Lady Saga to be the next emperor, {{and it was a great}} relief to him that their children were both girls (Manchukuo law forbade female succession to the throne).|$|E
