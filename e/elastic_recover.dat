40|$|Fracture {{toughness}} of {{bulk materials}} {{is a topic}} of classical measurements, but that of thin films, especially hard and superhard thin films, is a different matter owing to specimen dimensions (thickness) and lack of convincing test procedure. Fracture toughness {{is the ability of}} a material to resist the growth of a pre-existing crack. For thin films, however, the testing usually includes crack initiation together with crack propagation thus the result {{is not the same as}} the classical “fracture toughness”. For thin films, it is better to use term “toughness” to avoid confusion. For engineering applications, it is of vital importance that the toughness of thin films be evaluated with a convincing method and procedure. This paper presents a new and relatively easy method in which two-step uniaxial tensile test is performed to characterise toughness of ceramic thin films. In the test, the film/substrate system is subjected to uniaxial tensile stress until the film fractures. After the load is removed to allow complete <b>elastic</b> <b>recovering,</b> this system is subjected to a second loading to the earlier extension. The toughness of the thin film is derived from the energy difference between the two subsequent loading extension curves. The crack initiation and propagation patterns are examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM). As an example, toughness of a nc-TiN/a-SiNx nanocomposite thin film has been tested with satisfactory results...|$|R

40|$|Most {{determinations}} of elastic constants of anisotropic solids {{are based}} on acoustic wave phase velocity measurements [1, 2]. The methods for <b>recovering</b> <b>elastic</b> constants from phase velocity data are fairly straightforward and well-established. For high symmetry directions certain elastic constants, or combinations thereóf, can be obtained directly from individual velocity measurements [3]. When data pertaining to off-symmetry directions is used, usually an optimized fitting procedure is invoked to obtain the full set of elastic constants [4]. There is growing use of techniques that measure the group velocities of acoustic waves or phonons in solids. In an anisotropic solid the phase and group velocities do not in general coincide, {{even in the absence}} of dispersion and attenuation.

Recent advancements in ultrasonic velocity measurements have demonstrated the ability to <b>recover</b> <b>elastic</b> properties in anisotropic laminates. A simplified experimental setup was investigated to <b>recover</b> the <b>elastic</b> properties based on the flexural wave propagation in anisotropic laminates. The initial objective of this thesis was to verify flexural wave propagation in composite laminates through the comparison of experimental and theoretical phase velocities.

The initial method used to <b>recover</b> <b>elastic</b> constants was successful in the recovery of a partial set of the bending and extensional stiffnesses. The inability to recover all bending stiffnesses dictated the investigation of a second method. This method used an iterative method based on a nonlinear Newton's method to recover the bending stiffnesses. This method did not converge due to ill conditioning of the solution matrix.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to character skinning where divergence-free vector fields induced by skeletal motion, describe the velocity of skin deformation. The joint transformations for a pose relative to a rest pose create a bend deformation field, resulting in pose-dependent or kinematic skin deformations, varying smoothly across joints. The bend deformation parameters are interactively controlled to capture the varying deformability of bone and other anatomic tissue within an overall fold-over free and volume-preserving skin deformation. Subsequently, we represent the dynamics of skeletal motion, tissue elasticity, muscular tension and the environment as forces that are mapped to vortices at tissue interfaces. A simplified Biot-Savart law in the context of <b>elastic</b> deformation <b>recovers</b> a divergence-free velocity field from the vorticity. Finally, we apply a new stable technique to efficiently integrate points along their deformation trajectories. Adding these dynamic forces over a window of time prior to a given pose provides a continuum of user controllable kinodynamic skinning.

40|$|International audienceThe inverse {{problem of}} the {{recovery}} of the poroelastic parameters of open-cell soft plastic foam panels is solved by employing transmitted ultrasonic waves (USW) and the Biot-Johnson-Koplik-Champoux-Allard (BJKCA) model. It is shown by constructing the objective functional given by the total square of the difference between predictions from the BJKCA interaction model and experimental data obtained with transmitted USW, that the inverse problem is ill-posed, since the functional exhibits several local minima and maxima. In order to solve this problem, which is beyond the capability of most off-the-shelf iterative nonlinear least squares optimization algorithms (such as the Levenberg Marquadt or Nelder-Mead simplex methods), simple strategies are developed. The recovered acoustic parameters are compared with those obtained using simpler interaction models and a method employing asymptotic phase velocity of the transmitted USW. The retrieved elastic moduli are validated by solving an inverse vibration spectroscopy problem with data obtained from beam-like specimens cut from the panels using an equivalent solid elastodynamic model as estimator. The phase velocities are reconstructed using computed, measured resonance frequencies and a time-frequency decomposition of transient waves induced in the beam specimen.

Their function is to promote the separation between the teeth that will receive orthodontic bands, however, when subgingivally lost, they may cause periodontal problems and, ultimately, cause tooth extraction. OBJECTIVE: Concerned not only about their function but also about their properties, this experimental work was performed in order to evaluate, with a clinical perspective, the plasticity and radiopacity of the elastic separators, usually used in orthodontic clinic, through physical traction tests and radiographs. METHODS: Six different brands were analyzed and divided in two groups: extruded separators (American Orthodontics, GH, Morelli Blue and Morelli Green) and modular separators (Abzil, Dentaurum, GAC, Blue Modular Morelli and Green Modular Morelli). The plasticity was evaluated after physical traction tests, stretching the separators to 3 times their initial diameter. While the radiopacity was assessed using x-rays. RESULTS: When stretched to three times their inner diameter (ID), the extruded separators American Orthodontics, GH, Morelli Blue and Morelli Green and the modular ones Dentaurum, Morelli Blue Modular and Morelli Green Modular, presented <b>elastic</b> deformation, <b>recovering</b> their original inner diameter.

40|$|In {{most cases}} of seismic {{processing}} and interpretation, elastic isotropy is assumed. However, velocity anisotropy {{is found to}} exist in most subsurface media. Hence, there exists a fundamental inconsistency between theory on the one hand, and practice on the other. If not recognised, this can invalidate interpretation of seismic data. In this thesis, inversion methods for elastic parameters are developed to quantify the degree of velocity anisotropy of multi-layered transversely isotropic media. This primarily involves examining the velocity fields of layered media using anisotropic elastic wave propagation theory, and developing inversion programs to <b>recover</b> <b>elastic</b> parameters from those velocity fields. The resolved elastic parameter information is used in carrying out further studies {{on the effects of}} seismic anisotropy on normal moveout (NMO). Mathematical analyses, numerical simulations, and physical modelling experiments are used in this research for verification purposes before application to field survey data. Numerical studies show the transmission velocity field through layered media appears to be equivalent to that through a single-layered medium, within the practical offset limits in field surveys. The elastic parameters, which describe the property of such equivalent single-layered media, can be used as apparent elastic parameters to describe the collective mechanical property of the layered media. During this research, Snell's law was used in ray tracing to determine ray paths through the interface between any two component layers. By analyzing the signals recorded by any receiver in a walkaway VSP survey, the apparent transmission velocity field for the layered media above this receiver depth was inverted. Software was developed to <b>recover</b> the apparent <b>elastic</b> parameters for the layered media above this receiver depth using the transmission velocity field as input. Based on a two-layered model, another method was developed to <b>recover</b> the interval <b>elastic</b> parameters for an individual layer of interest, using the signals recorded by receivers on the upper and lower surfaces of this layer. The <b>recovered</b> <b>elastic</b> parameters may be considerably different from the real values if a transversely isotropic medium with a tilted symmetry axis (TTI) is treated as a transversely isotropic medium with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI). A large angle of tilt of the symmetry axis significantly influences the recorded velocity field through the medium. An inversion program was written to recover the value of the tilt angle of a TTI medium, and the elastic parameters of the medium. Programs were also developed to combine information from P, SV, and SH-waves in an inversion procedure. This capability in inversion programs enables us to use the additional information provided by a multi-component VSP survey to obtain accurate estimates of the elastic parameters of geological formations. Software testing and development was carried out on numerically generated input data. Up to 10 milliseconds of random noise in travel time was added to the input to confirm the stability of the inversion software. Further testing was carried out on physical model data where the parameters of the model were known from direct measurements. Finally the inversion software was applied to actual field data and found to give plausible results. In software testing in the physical modelling laboratory, other practical problems were encountered. System errors caused by the disproportionately large size of the transducers used affected the accuracy of the inversion results obtained. Transducer performance was studied, and it was found that reducing the size of transducers or making offset corrections would decrease the errors caused by the disproportionately large transducer dimensions. In using the <b>elastic</b> parameters <b>recovered,</b> {{it was found that the}} elastic parameter δ significantly influences the seismic records from a horizontal reflector. The normal moveout velocity was found to show variations from the zero-offset normal moveout velocity depending on the value and sign of elastic parameter δ. New approximate expressions for anisotropic normal moveout, phase and ray velocity functions at short offsets were developed. The value of anisotropic parameter δ was found to be the major factor controlling these relations. If the recovered parameter δ has a large negative value, analytical and numerical studies demonstrated that the new expression for moveout velocity developed herein should be used instead of Thomsen's normal moveout equation...|$|R

The differences of bamboo creep property which was loaded by two ways mainly due to the loading orientation and fiber distribution.

Specifically, we conduct experiments with two different polymers films and compare the role of plastic deformation, elastic deformation and adhesion in crumpling. We use an empirical model to capture the behaviour quantitatively, and use the model to show that adhesion leads to an order of magnitude increase in "effective" modulus. Going beyond statics, we additionally conduct force recovery experiments. We show that once adhesion is accounted for, plastic and <b>elastic</b> crumpled films <b>recover</b> logarithmically.

30|$|Unlike {{classical}} travel-time based tomographic approaches, {{the elastic}} FWI is capable {{to map the}} extension of the thin gas plume of downward gradual desaturation using only reflection seismic data, if a very accurate background model for the seismic velocities and density can be estimated before the gas injection. Additionally the <b>elastic</b> FWI <b>recovers</b> the changes of isotropic elastic material parameters and density due to the gas injection and subsequent partial drainage of the aquifer. By using an appropriate rock model, changes of the gas saturation can be deduced from the elastic FWI results with an accuracy of 5 – 30 % within the aquifer, depending on the amount of noise (S/N-ratio[*]>[*] 100) present in the data. Due to the finite frequency content of the source signal larger saturation errors up to 60 % can occur at the boundaries of the gas plume. Density inversion artefacts outside the aquifer due to noise can lead to fictitious estimates of saturation variations with local maxima of 20 %. For a S/N-ratio of 50 the shape of the gas plume is still visible, but estimations of the gas saturation become highly erroneous and a S/N-ratio of 25 seem to be the detection limit for the gas plume. Errors in the elastic baseline model has a very substantial impact {{on the quality of the}} elastic time-lapse FWI results. Picking errors in layer interfaces and inaccurate material parameters within the layers lead to results with an approximately correct shape and position of the gas plume, but overestimated wrong elastic material parameters within the gas plume. Therefore, the estimation of accurate elastic baseline models for a successful elastic multiparameter FWI, and a subsequent calculation of the gas saturation distribution, is the greatest challenge for real field applications. Smooth macro-velocity models based on Common-Reflection Surface (CRS) stacking (Mann 2002) and Normal-Incidence Points (NIP)-wave tomography (Duveneck 2004) for P- and SH-wave data combined with the intensive use of prior information from borehole logs seem to be the most promising approach.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{focuses on}} the {{identification}} of heterogeneous linear elastic moduli {{in the context of}} frequency-domain, coupled acoustic-structure interaction (ASI), using either solid displacement or fluid pressure measurement data. The approach postulates the inverse problem as an optimization problem where the solution is obtained by minimizing a modified error in constitutive equation (MECE) functional. The latter measures the discrepancy in the constitutive equations that connect kinematically admissible strains and dynamically admissible stresses, while incorporating the measurement data as additional quadratic error terms. We demonstrate two strategies for selecting the MECE weighting coefficient to produce regularized solutions to the ill-posed identification problem: 1) the discrepancy principle of Morozov, and 2) an error-balance approach that selects the weight parameter as the minimizer of another functional involving the ECE and the data misfit. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can successfully <b>recover</b> <b>elastic</b> parameters in 2 D and 3 D ASI systems from response measurements taken in either the solid or fluid subdomains. Furthermore, both regularization strategies are shown to produce accurate reconstructions when the measurement data is polluted with noise.

40|$|A full {{factorial}} {{design of experiments}} was used to study the effect of blend shear strain on the compaction process, relative density and strength of pharmaceutical tablets. The powder blends were subjected to different shear strain levels (integral of shear rate with respect to time) using an ad hoc Couette shear cell. Tablets were compressed at different compaction forces using an instrumented compactor simulator, and compaction curves showing the force-displacement profiles during compaction were obtained. Although the die-fill blend porosity (initial porosity) and the minimum in-die tablet porosity (at maximum compaction) decreased significantly with shear strain, the final tablet porosity was surprisingly independent of shear strain. The increase in the in-die maximum compaction with shear strain was, in fact, compensated during post-compaction relaxation of the tables, which also increased significantly with shear strain. Therefore, tablet porosity alone was not sufficient to predict tablet tensile strength. A decrease in the 'work of compaction' {{as a function of}} shear strain, and an increase in the <b>recovered</b> <b>elastic</b> work was observed, which suggested weaker particle-particle bonding as the shear strain increased. For each shear strain level, the Ryskewitch Duckworth equation was a good fit to the tensile strength as a function of tablet porosity, and the obtained asymptotic tensile strength at zero porosity exhibited a 60 % reduction as a function of shear strain. This was consistent with a reduced bonding efficiency as the shear strain increased...|$|R

We incorporate the traction free boundary condition into the minimisation problem for the finite deformation case (i. e. large rotations and small elastic strains). Numerical experiments show that this finite deformation kinematic analysis continues to work well, while the infinitesimal analysis fails, when the misorientation between test and reference pattern is made increasingly high. However, measurements on patterns simulated using dynamical diffraction theory indicated that this formulation is not sufficient to <b>recover</b> <b>elastic</b> strains accurately because the pattern shifts are not determined accurately when large rotations are present. To overcome this issue we remap the test pattern to an orientation that is close to that of reference pattern.

A second cross-correlation analysis between the reference pattern and the remapped test pattern allows the elastic strains to be recovered using the much simpler infinitesimal deformation theory.

40|$|The in vivo {{estimation}} of tissue elasticity parameters {{is important for}} realistic tissue deformation modelling and diagnosis tasks such as cancer mass detection and characterization. Elastography (strain imaging) provides non-quantitative information about tissue stiffness and is becoming well established clinically. Acoustic radiation force imaging, supersonic shear wave imaging and (Young's) modulus imaging are all evolving as quantitative methods. This paper concerns the latter. The established approach to Young's modulus reconstruction involves solving the so-called inverse elasticity problem of <b>recovering</b> <b>elastic</b> parameters by comparing the displacement field from the measurements and the theoretical tissue deformation modelling. In this paper, a new modulus imaging pathway is proposed in which the inverse problem of elasticity reconstruction has {{been converted into a}} global optimization problem involving an image similarity measure. This approach is applied to ultrasound images and the tissue elasticity distribution is recovered by adaptively adding new regions based on the local mismatch of the images using a multiscaled split-and-merge approach. For this experimental evaluation of the performance of the proposed method, first synthetic images are used with different Gaussian noise levels. The reconstructed elasticity shows good agreement with the ground-truth. A comparison of the proposed method with a conventional displacement-based method is made using a gelatine phantom. The results using both methods agree remarkably well with the theoretical prediction. A further in vivo study on 19 breast cancer masses was performed. The present method estimated an elasticity contrast of 6. 41 ±? 0. 98 between cancerous tissue and normal tissue, which is consistent with values reported elsewhere in the literature. © 2009 IMechE...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{stresses}} (force/cross-sectional area) {{acting in}} muscles, tendons and {{bones of the}} hindlimbs of kangaroo rats {Dipodomys spectabilis) were calculated during steady-speed hops and vertical jumps. Stresses were determined from both high-speed cine films (light and X-ray) and force plate recordings, {{as well as from}} in vivo tendon force recordings. Stresses in each hindlimb support element during hopping (1 - 6 - 3 - 1 m s" 1) were generally only 33 % of those acting during jumping (3 = 40 cm height) : ankle extensor muscles, 80 ± 12 (S. D.) versus 297 ± 42 kPa; ankle extensor tendons, 7 - 9 ± 1 - 5 versus 32 - 7 ± 4 - 8 MPa; tibia, — 29 ± 5 versus — 110 ± 25 MPa (all values are for hopping versus jumping). The magnitude of stress in each structure during these locomotor activities was similarly matched to the strength of each element, so that a consistent safety factor to failure is achieved for the hindlimb as a whole (1 - 5 - 2 - 0). The large stresses during jumping were correlated with a three-fold increase in ground reaction forces exerted on the ground compared with the fastest steady hopping speeds. We conclude that, for its size, the kangaroo rat has disproportionately large hindlimb muscles, tendons and bones to withstand the large forces associated with rapid acceleration to avoid predation, which limits their ability to store and <b>recover</b> <b>elastic</b> strain energy.

" Submitted to Physical Review Letters * Work supported by the Department of Energy, contract DE-AC 03 - 76 SF 00515. - 2 -It'has been shown by one of us (JVL) l that the three particle zero range scattering theory, first developed in a nonrelativistic context, 2 using relativistic kinematics and an appropriate simple unitary and covariant two particle scattering amplitude as the driving term allows the calculation of unitary three particle amplitudes for elastic scatter-ing, rearrangement, breakup, coalescence and 3 - 3 scattering. For three equal mass particles it has been shown 1 that these equations predict an infinite logarithmic accumulation of three particle bound states in the nonrelativistic kinematic region in quantitative agreement with the Efimov effect 3 calculated using a separable nonrelativistic Hamiltonian. The theory therefore is proved to have the correct limit in nonrelativis-tic scattering-theory in this case. In this communication we prove that by appropriately defining one of the three particles as a "quantum " we have a covariant model which predicts unitary scattering amplitudes for two particles due to single quantum exchange and single quantum produc-tion in a two particle system, with physical flux conservation. In the nonrelativistic two particle <b>elastic</b> channel we <b>recover</b> Yukawa or Coulomb "potential " scattering. The two quantum-one particle sector is also correctly described.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{theory of}} poroelasticity {{focuses on the}} coupled response of fluid flow and elastic deformation of porous media saturated with either an incompressible or a compressible pore fluid. The Theory of poroelasticity has been successfully applied to examine time-dependent transient phenomena {{in a variety of}} natural and synthetic materials, including geomaterials and biomaterials. The assumption of elastic behaviour of the porous skeleton in these developments is a significant limitation in the application of this theory to brittle geomaterials; which could exhibit non-elastic phenomena either in the form of initiation and extension of discrete fractures, or in the form of initiation and evolution of continuum damage in the porous skeleton. The computational methodology developed in this study examines the effect of development of such defects (fracture or damage) on the fluid transport characteristics and the poroelastic behaviour of saturated geomaterials. The finite element based computational models for fracture and damage phenomena examine two-dimensional plane strain and axisymmetric problems. The classical theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics is extended to examine the timedependent behaviour of local effects at the crack tip in poroelastic media. The numerical procedure accounts for the stress singularity of the effective stress field at the crack tip. The damage model based on the concept of continuum damage mechanics, takes into account the alteration of the stiffness and permeability characteristics of porous material due to development of micromechanical damage in the porous skeleton. The isotropic damage criteria governing the evolution of stiffness and permeability parameters are characterized by the dependency of damage parameters on the distortional strain invariant. As the applications of the theory of poroelasticity diversify, attention needs to be focused on other aspects of importance. The class of transient and steady crack extension in poroelastic media is recognized as an area of interest in geomechanics applications and in energy resources recovery from geological formations. A computational algorithm is developed to examine the transient quasi-static crack extension in poroelastic media where the temporal and spatial variations of boundary conditions governing the displacement, traction and pore pressure fields are taken into account in the incremental analysis. The path of crack extension is established by a mixed-mode crack extension criterion applicable to the porous fabric. The computational modelling of steady state crack extension in poroelastic media at constant velocity is also examined for the plane strain problems. The finite element formulations of the governing equations, which are velocity-dependent, are developed by employing the Galerkin technique. The poroelastic behaviour of material depends on the propagation velocity at the crack tip. The computational schemes developed in this study followed an extensive procedure of verification via known analytical solutions to poroelasticity problems and for limiting cases of initial undrained (t → 0 +) and final drained (t → +infinity) <b>elastic</b> responses <b>recovered</b> through analogous problems in classical elasticity...|$|R
40|$|Diagonal stride is {{the classic}} style of cross-­‐country skiing {{involving}} alternating arm and leg movements that appear similar to both walking and running, but is it truly biomechanically and energetically similar to walking and running? To better understand the fundamental biomechanics of diagonal stride skiing, we compared its ground reaction forces, mechanical energy fluctuations {{of the center of}} mass and metabolic energy consumption to walking and running. We hypothesized that diagonal stride skiing would be biomechanically more similar to running, but with a lesser energetic cost. I recorded ground reaction forces of nine subjects roller skiing on a force-­‐measuring treadmill, a method that catalyzed the study of walking and running but had never been utilized in cross-­‐country skiing studies. I analyzed the changes in the perpendicular and parallel forces with increasing speed (1. 25 and 3 m/s) and incline (Level, 3 °, and 6 °). Force recordings were similar to those previously recorded with other devices, thus validating our method. From the forces, we calculated the mechanical energy fluctuations of the center of mass of level walking, running, and diagonal stride skiing (with and without poles). Diagonal stride skiing had almost in-­‐phase fluctuations of kinetic and gravitational potential energies, similar to running. In-­‐phase fluctuations of the center of mass allow runners to store and <b>recover</b> <b>elastic</b> energy, so that less mechanical energy input is required with each step. However, in diagonal stride skiing, almost all of the kinetic energy losses were due to the rolling resistance of the skis and could not be stored elastically. I also compared the energy expenditure of each locomotion form using open-­‐circuit expired gas analysis. Diagonal skiing had a metabolic rate greater than walking and lower than running at the same speeds. Also, I found no significant metabolic advantage of using poles during level roller skiing. Overall, by successfully using a force-­‐measuring treadmill, I found that diagonal skiing is a unique form of locomotion that does not utilize elastic energy storage like running, but has a lower energeti...|$|R
40|$|Neoplastic {{tissue is}} {{typically}} highly vascularized, contains abnormal concentrations of extracellular proteins (e. g. collagen, proteoglycans) {{and has a}} high interstitial fluid pres- sure compared to most normal tissues. These changes result in an overall stiffening typical of most solid tumors. Elasticity Imaging (EI) is a technique which uses imaging systems to measure relative tissue deformation and thus noninvasively infer its mechanical stiffness. Stiffness is recovered from measured deformation by using an appropriate mathematical model and solving an inverse problem. The integration of EI with existing imaging modal- ities can improve their diagnostic and research capabilities. The aim of this work is to develop and evaluate techniques to image and quantify the mechanical properties of soft tissues in three dimensions (3 D). To that end, this thesis presents and validates a method by which three dimensional ultrasound images {{can be used to}} image and quantify the shear modulus distribution of tissue mimicking phantoms. This work is presented to motivate and justify the use of this elasticity imaging technique in a clinical breast cancer screening study. The imaging methodologies discussed are intended to improve the specificity of mammography practices in general. During the development of these techniques, several issues concerning the accuracy and uniqueness of the result were elucidated. Two new algorithms for 3 D EI are designed and characterized in this thesis. The first provides three dimensional motion estimates from ultrasound images of the deforming ma- terial. The novel features include finite element interpolation of the displacement field, inclusion of prior information and the ability to enforce physical constraints. The roles of regularization, mesh resolution and an incompressibility constraint on the accuracy of the measured deformation is quantified. The estimated signal to noise ratio of the measured displacement fields are approximately 1800, 21 and 41 for the axial, lateral and eleva- tional components, respectively. The second algorithm <b>recovers</b> the shear <b>elastic</b> modulus distribution of the deforming material by efficiently solving the three dimensional inverse problem as an optimization problem. This method utilizes finite element interpolations, the adjoint method to evaluate the gradient and a quasi-Newton BFGS method for optimiza- tion. Its novel features include the use of the adjoint method and TVD regularization with piece-wise constant interpolation. A source of non-uniqueness in this inverse problem is identified theoretically, demonstrated computationally, explained physically and overcome practically. Both algorithms were test on ultrasound data of independently characterized tissue mimicking phantoms. The <b>recovered</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus was in all cases within 35 % of the reference elastic contrast. Finally, the preliminary application of these techniques to tomosynthesis images showed the feasiblity of imaging an elastic inclusion.

40|$|Springback is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs when nonhomogeneous elastic and plastic deformation occurs throughout a component during forming processes. Since the <b>elastic</b> deformation is <b>recovered</b> when the forming load is removed, geometrical changes occur. Springback is particularly important in sheet forming; therefore, {{in order to provide}} formed parts of close tolerances it is essential to first have a good understanding of the factors which affect springback {{and to be able to}} determine the extent those factors have. It is also important to be able to predict springback under different conditions so that it can either be minimized or properly accounted for in the process design. This research presents work done thus far on understanding and predicting springback in sheet metal forming of stainless steel 410 and inconel 718, which have a wide range of usage in the aerospace industry as well as dual-phase steels 6001300 and 600 / 400 which are used in the automotive sector. The role that the anisotropy plays in the springback is assessed in this work. The effect of normal anisotropy on springback for the aerospace materials is considered while the automotive materials were considered perfectly isotropic and only the effect of forming conditions was studied. In order to characterize the materials and their anisotropic behaviour, a series of mechanical tests is conducted. These tests include standard uniaxial tension and uniaxial tension-compression tests. Moreover, a series of simple multiplebending experiments were conducted on the aerospace materials (steel and Ni based alloys) to examine the effect of specimen orientation on the springback in simple bending. Furthermore, since process conditions have an obvious effect on springback and one of the most important of these is the blank holding force, 2 D draw bending experiments are conducted with varying blank holding force to assess its role in springback of the formed part. The combined effect of anisotropy and blank holding force was also studied for the aerospace materials. Finite element simulations that include only either classical isotropic hardening or kinematic hardening did not show close agreement with the experimental findings especially for springback prediction. Therefore, to properly simulate springback a material model that combines both hardening effects, along with the material anisotropy, has been developed in this work. The developed finite element model implements isotropic hardening as well as kinematic hardening based on the Mroz multiple-yield surface formulation. Hill's 1948 yield function with normal anisotropy is considered. The developed material model has been tested by simulating the tension-compression experiments and a good agreement was reached. Furthermore, to demonstrate the model capability, bending experiments were simulated. Springback angles predicted by the model reflected those obtained experimentally for the simple multiple-bending experiments. Moreover, draw-bending experiments were simulated with the developed material model, which showed good agreement with the experiments. Finally, the capability of the model can be readily extended to cover real forming operations, which will reduce cost and enhance the quality of the formed parts...|$|R
