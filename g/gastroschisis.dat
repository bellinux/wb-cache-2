2500|$|Landfill {{sites have}} been shown to have adverse effects on fetal development. [...] Extensive {{research}} has been shown that landfills have several negative effects on babies born to mothers living near landfill sites: low birth weight, birth defects, spontaneous abortion, and fetal and infant mortality. [...] Studies done around the Love Canal site near Niagara Falls and the Lipari Landfill in New Jersey have shown a higher proportion of low birth babies than communities farther away from landfills. [...] A study done in California showed a positive correlation between time and quantity of dumping and low birth weights and neonatal deaths. [...] A study in the United Kingdom showed a correspondence between pregnant women living near landfill sites and an increased risk of congenital disorders, such as neural tube defects, hypospadias, epispadia, and abdominal wall defects, such as <b>gastroschisis</b> and exomphalos. [...] A study conducted on a Welsh community also showed an increase incidence of <b>gastroschisis.</b> [...] Another study was done on twenty-one European hazardous waste sites and showed that those living within three kilometers had an increased risk of giving birth to infants with birth defects and that as distance from the land increased, the risk decreased. [...] These birth defects included neural tube defects, malformations of the cardiac septa, anomalies of arteries and veins, and chromosomal anomalies. Looking at communities that live near landfill sites brings up environmental justice. [...] A vast majority of sites are located near poor, mostly black, communities. [...] For example, between the early 1920s and 1978, about 25% of Houston’s population was black. [...] However, over 80% of landfills and incinerators during this time were located in these black communities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gastroschisis</b> is {{a similar}} birth defect, but in <b>gastroschisis</b> the {{umbilical}} cord is not involved and the lesion is usually {{to the right of}} midline. Parts of organs may be free in the amniotic fluid, and not enclosed in a membranous (peritoneal) sac. <b>Gastroschisis</b> is less frequently associated with other defects than omphalocele.|$|E
50|$|Most {{risks of}} <b>gastroschisis</b> {{are related to}} {{decreased}} bowel function. Sometimes {{blood flow to the}} exposed organs is impaired or there may be less than the normal amount of intestine. This may put infants at risk for other dangerous conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis. Also, because their intestines are exposed, infants with <b>gastroschisis</b> are at increased risk for infection, and must be closely monitored.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{abdominal}} wall defects that result due to the changes during development. They are omphalocele and <b>gastroschisis.</b> <b>Gastroschisis</b> develops when the abdominal wall does not completely close, and the organs are present outside of the infant’s body. Omphalocele occurs {{when some of the}} organs protrude through the muscles of the abdomen in the area surrounding the umbilical cord. Omphalocele can be either minor, with only some of the organs exposed, or severe, with most, if not all of the abdominal organs being exposed.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>gastroschisis</b> is not known. There may be genetic causes in some cases, {{and there may}} be {{environmental}} factors to which the mother is exposed during pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|Abdominal wall defects can {{be treated}} surgically {{if there is no}} {{accompanying}} anomalies. The surgical procedure also called omphalocele repair/closure or <b>gastroschisis</b> repair/closure is not overcomplicated. The organs are normal but are misplaced.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gastroschisis</b> is a {{birth defect}} {{in which the}} baby's {{intestines}} extend outside of the body through a hole next to the belly button. The size of the hole is variable and other organs such as stomach and liver may also occur outside the babies body. Complications may include feeding problems, prematurity, intestinal atresia, and intrauterine growth retardation.|$|E
50|$|The correct {{function}} of the gastric tract and the internal health {{is related to the}} nutrition that the child or its mother receives. From the prenatal period, correct nutrition can affect the developing of the system, short bowel syndrome (the most common one), necrotizing enterocolitis, <b>gastroschisis</b> or omphalocele to the postnatal period with diseases such as diarrhea.|$|E
50|$|During {{the fourth}} week of human {{embryonic}} development, the lateral body wall {{folds of the}} embryo meet at the midline and fuse together to form the anterior body wall. However, in <b>gastroschisis</b> and other anterior body wall defects, this fails to occur by either {{one or both of}} the lateral body wall folds not moving properly to meet with the other and fusing together. This incomplete fusion results in a defect that allows abdominal organs to protrude through the abdominal wall, and the intestines typically herniate through the rectus abdominis muscle, lying to the right of the umbilicus. The forces responsible for the movement of the lateral body wall folds are poorly understood, and a better understanding of these forces would help to explain why <b>gastroschisis</b> occurs mostly to the right of the umbilicus, while other ventral body wall defects occur in the midline.|$|E
50|$|Given {{the urgent}} need for surgery after birth, it is {{recommended}} that delivery occur at a facility equipped for caring for these high-risk neonates, as transfers to other facilities may increase risk of adverse outcomes. There is no evidence that cesarean deliveries lead to better outcomes for babies with <b>gastroschisis,</b> so cesarean delivery is only considered if there are other indications.|$|E
50|$|TPN may be {{the only}} {{feasible}} option for providing nutrition to patients who do not have a functioning gastrointestinal tract or who have disorders requiring complete bowel rest, including bowel obstruction, short bowel syndrome, <b>Gastroschisis,</b> prolonged diarrhea regardless of its cause, high-output fistula, very severe Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, and certain pediatric GI disorders including congenital GI anomalies and necrotizing enterocolitis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gastroschisis</b> {{requires}} {{surgical treatment}} {{to return the}} exposed intestines to the abdominal cavity and close {{the hole in the}} abdomen. Sometimes this is done immediately but more often the exposed organs are covered with sterile drapings, and only later is the surgery done. Affected newborns frequently require more than one surgery, as only about 10% of cases can be closed in a single surgery.|$|E
50|$|Three {{days after}} the death of his newborn son in 2011, Sharp famously chose to play and scored the opener in that game, and 5 days later he was applauded by {{opposing}} fans following his goal against their team. He and his wife set up The Luey Jacob Sharp Foundation in aid of <b>gastroschisis</b> research and to support other people affected by this condition.|$|E
5000|$|Some teratomas contain {{yolk sac}} elements, which secrete {{alpha-fetoprotein}} (AFP). Detection of AFP {{may help to}} confirm the diagnosis and is often used as a marker for recurrence or treatment efficacy, but is rarely the method of initial diagnosis. (Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, or MSAFP, is a useful screening test for other fetal conditions, including Down syndrome, spina bifida and abdominal wall defects such as <b>gastroschisis.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Abdominal wall defects, {{specifically}} the main two types, <b>gastroschisis</b> and omphalocele, are rare, occurring in about {{one out of}} every 5000 births. There is no difference in prevalence between boys and girls. Mothers who are below the age of twenty are almost four times as likely to have an offspring that has developed an abdominal wall defect compared to mothers who is in her late twenties and older.|$|E
5000|$|STEP {{was first}} {{performed}} {{on a human}} patient, a two-year-old who had been born with <b>gastroschisis,</b> in 2003. [...] By 2010, it had been utilized by more than 20 hospitals, mostly in the United States. In addition to its use in treating SBS, STEP has been utilized to treat bacterial overgrowth in a dilated bowel loop and to prevent SBS upon the initial repair of certain types of intestinal atresia.|$|E
50|$|There are {{no signs}} during pregnancy. About {{sixty percent of}} infants with <b>gastroschisis</b> are born prematurely. At birth, the baby will have a {{relatively}} small (<4 cm) hole in the abdominal wall, usually just {{to the right of}} the belly button. Some of the intestines are usually are outside the body, passing through this opening. In rare circumstances, the liver and stomach may also come through the abdominal wall. After birth these organs are directly exposed to air.|$|E
50|$|Short bowel {{syndrome}} (SBS) is {{the condition}} in which a patient cannot absorb adequate nutrients because {{a portion of the}} small intestine is damaged or absent. SBS commonly affects pediatric patients who have undergone surgery, such as premature infants with necrotizing enterocolitis and infants with gastrointestinal defects such as <b>gastroschisis.</b> In adults, Crohn's disease is a possible cause of SBS. If they are unable to absorb nutrients in the gut, patients must be given parenteral nutrition (PN) intravenously, but long-term PN can be associated with liver failure.|$|E
50|$|Walters {{was brought}} up in Moreton, Merseyside and the house in which he lived in was {{opposite}} a number of community football pitches. He grew up supporting Everton. He is married and has two daughters and a son.
