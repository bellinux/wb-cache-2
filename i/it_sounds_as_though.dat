500|$|... "Army of Me" [...] {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Andrew Hampp for Billboard and Chris Younie for 4Music both though that [...] "Army of Me" [...] {{could have been}} a potential single, the latter of whom writing [...] "This track must be a future single." [...] Younie continued to write that the song [...] "captivates and excites right from the very start", has a [...] "euphoric" [...] energy and is the type of [...] "angry" [...] pop song that Kelly Clarkson [...] "would give her right arm for". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe described it as a [...] "Gloria Gaynor-meets-Depeche Mode dance of anger." [...] Mike Wass for Idolator wrote that although [...] "Army of Me" [...] is a [...] "quality" [...] song, it is an album filler. Writing that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{it would have been a}} good song to include on her previous studio album, Bionic, Wass thought that Aguilera was [...] "not exaggerating" [...] when she refers to it as [...] "Fighter 2.0". He concluded his review by saying that although her vocals are sparse, it is a [...] "quirky" [...] addition to Lotus. The A.V. Clubs Annie Zaleski described Aguilera as a [...] "playful" [...] and [...] "sassy techno diva" [...] on [...] "Army of Me".|$|E
2500|$|Delson's {{style is}} {{sometimes}} criticized {{as being too}} simplistic, lacking complexity, and largely limited to non-solo, non-instrumental sections, particularly during the Hybrid Theory and Meteora eras. He has stated that he [...] "doesn't like to show off", and that he attempts to play his guitar so that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were the keyboard or strings so as to seamlessly {{fit in with the}} band's hip-hop- and electronica-style compositions. [...] Delson has also stated that he likes to produce a gritty, [...] "sampled" [...] feel with his sound. [...] Although a self-described [...] "fervent opponent of guitar leads," [...] he started performing solos in the Minutes to Midnight era after his bandmates encouraged him to do so. Delson performs guitar solos on the tracks [...] "What I've Done," [...] "In Pieces" [...] and [...] "The Little Things Give You Away." [...] Delson also played many solos on Linkin Park's 6th studio album The Hunting Party.|$|E
60|$|Don't say that; <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> you regretted having married her.|$|E
60|$|The Brook {{had changed}} her note again. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she were mumbling {{something}} soft.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{man with}} {{concussion}} {{of the brain}} doesn't cry out like that. Besides, {{did you hear the}} end of <b>it?</b> <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> some one were choking him. Hush!" ...|$|R
50|$|This makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the {{punishment}} {{was more of}} a prolonged ducking than anything intended to inflict serious injury or trauma. Indeed, a footnote in one source suggests that it may have evolved from the medieval punishment of ducking.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I {{wanted to}} say, {{but it sounds}} {{different}} on your lips. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> you meant it yourself, and that you meant it because of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a nasty, hackneyed, false {{phrase that}} is--that of a marrying man! <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> some {{men were in}} the habit of getting married {{three or four times a}} month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lily," [...] he said, [...] "I've {{come for}} the last time. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I meant to {{threaten}} you; but you won't take it in that way. I think you will know what I mean. I have {{come for the}} last time--to ask you to be my wife." [...] She had got up to greet him when he entered, and they were both still standing. She did not answer him at once, but turning away from him walked towards the window. [...] "You knew why I was coming to-day, Lily?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm terribly interested," [...] said Ruth. (But {{she made}} <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she really was.) [...] "I think it's so wonderful.... I {{want to go}} off {{tramping}} through the Berkshires. I'm so tired {{of going to the}} same old places." ...|$|R
60|$|We watched {{each other}} for a few minutes; and I noticed that his mouth kept opening and shutting, though he said nothing. Suddenly, edging closer to me, he spoke in a thick whisper. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> his mouth were full of wool.|$|R
500|$|Some reviewers {{commented on}} the part in which Gaga says she's [...] "had a couple of drinks". Lipshutz wrote that Gaga sounded [...] "loose and light-hearted, letting her {{audience}} twirl around on the dance floor". Cragg said <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> her vocals had been [...] "covertly recorded during a drunken game of truth or dare".|$|R
60|$|In {{the last}} chapter Peregrine Orme called at Orley Farm with the view of {{discussing}} with Lucius Mason the conduct of their respective progenitors; and, as will be remembered, the young men agreed {{in a general way}} that their progenitors were about to make fools of themselves. Poor Peregrine, however, had other troubles on his mind. Not only had his grandfather been successful in love, but he had been unsuccessful. As he had journeyed home from Noningsby to The Cleeve in a high-wheeled vehicle which he called his trap, he had determined, being then in a frame of mind somewhat softer than was usual with him, to tell all his troubles to his mother. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were lack-a-daisical--such a resolve as this {{on the part of a}} dashing young man, who had been given to the pursuit of rats, and was now a leader among the sons of Nimrod in the pursuit of foxes. Young men of the present day, when got up for the eyes of the world, look and talk as though they could never tell their mothers anything,--as though they were harder than flint, and as little in want of a woman's counsel and a woman's help as a colonel of horse on the morning of a battle. But the rigid virility of his outward accoutrements does in no way alter the man of flesh and blood who wears them; the young hero, so stern to the eye, is, I believe, as often tempted by stress of sentiment to lay bare the sorrow of his heart as is his sister. On this occasion Peregrine said to himself that he would lay bare the sorrow of his heart. He would find out what others thought of that marriage which he had proposed to himself; and then, if his mother encouraged him, and his grandfather approved, he would make another attack, beginning on the side of the judge, or perhaps on that of Lady Staveley.|$|E
50|$|The {{speech that}} Hirohito gives {{on the radio}} {{at the end of}} the film is a part of the actual {{recording}} of the speech that was played to announce plans of surrender. Terry's translation for Gwen, however, is actually only bits and pieces of the much longer speech, even though <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he is translating it word for word.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the songs}} that Perrey and Kingsley collaborated on in this album have a fun, whimsical, futuristic feel. Often <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the {{synthesizer}} is emulating different instruments in each piece. In the case of Baroque Hoedown, the synthesizer creates sounds that seem to emulate instruments like a piano, a brass section, chimes, a harpsichord, a percussion section, and something {{that can only be}} described as a kazoo.|$|E
60|$|This epistle Lizzie did send, {{believing that}} she could add nothing to its insolence, let her study it as she might. And, she thought, as she read it for the fifth time, that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> had been written before her receipt of the final note from himself, and that it would, therefore, irritate him the more.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{describes}} a woman nostalgically remembering {{a love affair}} from her youth, mostly through impressionistic and surreal imagery, with the refrain: [...] "oh, how many years / is it now Maurice?". The chorus repeats the words [...] "Young heart". The song is recorded with echo effects that make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> is being performed in a large hall.|$|R
60|$|When they kneeled {{this time}} they heard the most curious muffled grunts and knockings, {{apparently}} under their feet. Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a blind puppy were squeaking above the lamp; then as if a stone were being ground on hard ice; and again, like muffled blows on a drum; but all dragged out and made small, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they travelled through a little horn a weary distance away.|$|R
5000|$|According to legend, the peace-loving tribe walked {{single file}} into the Singing River (now {{known as the}} Pascagoula River) because the local Biloxi tribe were {{planning}} to attack. [...] The famous Singing River is known throughout the world for its mysterious music. The singing sounds like a swarm of bees in flight and is best heard in late evenings during late summer and autumn. Barely heard at first, the music seems to grow nearer and louder until <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it comes directly under foot.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{speculation}} {{has arisen}} {{as to the}} character's proper name. For years, fandom has established the name as 'Alexander'. An examination of first series scripts show no documentation of a surname in the character lists. In [...] "Breakaway", <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she could have introduced herself to Koenig as 'Tanya Alexandreva'. Assuming a Russian background, Martin Willey has chosen to spell the name as 'Aleksandr' in The Catacombs website. In later years, Series One story editor Johnny Byrne has revealed that he was rather smitten with actress Suzanne Roquette ...|$|E
5000|$|By mid-December Absent Friends issued {{their debut}} single, [...] "Hallelujah", which Canberra Times Penelope Layland {{dismissed}} as [...] "could quite easily have remained {{a figment of}} someone's imagination. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they all had fun making it, but that's about it. The flip is a different mix of the same song". Absent Friends' debut album, Here's Looking Up Your Address, followed in April {{the next year and}} peaked at No. 7 on the ARIA Albums Chart. By late 1990 the group toured Europe supporting INXS but Duffield had been replaced by Geoffrey Stapleton (GANGgajang on hiatus) on keyboards.|$|E
5000|$|Strunk and White's The Elements of Style {{provides}} {{another kind}} of example, a misplaced modifier (another participle):I saw the trailer peeking through the window.Presumably, this means the speaker was peeking through the window, but {{the placement of the}} clause [...] "peeking through the window" [...] makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the trailer were doing so. The sentence can be recast as, [...] "Peeking through the window, I saw the trailer." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{they were}} about half-way across the lake the wind {{suddenly}} lulled, and once more they heard the awful scream, and this time <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the crier was quite close to them. The occupants of the boat were terribly frightened, and one of them, after suddenly shrieking 'he's here,' fainted, and lay still {{at the bottom of}} the boat, while the monk and the other man stared straight before them, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> petrified.|$|R
5000|$|... "They're always {{threatening}} us, always, always. Whether it's Brent Tyler, Stephen Scott, William Johnson, William Shaw or whoever. And they're {{very subtle}} about it. They {{say that if}} we want to divide Canada, then they'll divide Quebec. And they make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> people will accept it. Their real objective is to scare people, but they say, 'We don't want violence. We just won't pay our taxes. We'll use civil disobedience.' [...] " ...|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "chirp" [...] {{is a type}} of scratch used by turntablists. It is {{made with}} a mix of moving the record and {{incorporating}} movement with the crossfade mixer. It was invented by DJ Jazzy Jeff. The scratch is somewhat difficult to perform because it takes a good amount of coordination. The scratch starts out with the cross-fader open. The DJ then moves the record forward while simultaneously closing the previously opened channel ending the first sound. Then, in a reverse fashion, the DJ opens the channel while moving the record backwards creating a more controlled sounding [...] "baby scratch". Done in quick succession <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a chirp sound is being produced.|$|E
5000|$|Against the {{background}} of different musical influences, Patrik Lindström of Brutal Resonance found the album to be [...] "a very varied experience." [...] About the band members he said: [...] "I sometimes {{get the feeling that}} they are not exactly working together like a team." [...] At the expense of the album's coherence, as Lindström pointed out: [...] "If you are looking for singularity and musical unity, this album is not for you." [...] In contrast, Mike Schiller of PopMatters considered Improvised Electronic Device to be [...] "Front Line Assembly's 'band' album, on which <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Leeb, programmers Chris Peterson and Jeremy Inkel, and guitarist Jared Slingerland all have significant input into the final sound," [...] and the [...] "layers complement each other but never {{get in the way of}} the songs".|$|E
5000|$|John Dingwall, {{writing for}} the Daily Record, said [...] "A superb soul effort backed by the sort of synth work that wouldnt be out of place on an early Depeche Mode pop effort rekindled by Stock, Aitken & Waterman." [...] A {{reporter}} for the Sunday Mail quipped that the track is [...] "a powerful little number". While Nick Levine from the BBC called the song [...] "Annie Lennox-style synth-pop." [...] During her review of Fall to Grace, Contactmusic.coms Hayley Avron proclaimed [...] "30 Minute Love Affair is possibly the worst offender. The concept of the song goes nowhere beyond the obvious connotations of the title and musically, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the love affair lasted longer than it took to write the song." [...] The Scotsmans Fiona Shepherd branded the song [...] "dreary".|$|E
30|$|Novelty {{is usually}} called an alien {{intruder}} that organizations and societies will react to aliens and intruders {{in a negative}} way. How do you protect alien intruders from elimination? I emphasize that because the romantic stories of novelty and creativity and foolishness make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it’s</b> a glorious thing and the victors won and everyone gathered around and cheered them. That’s {{the final stage of}} a long process of being kicked and scorned and everything else.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes,' {{the other}} answered, 'the poor man {{certainly}} was sick in his head, {{and it was}} quite time that they checked his folly while they still had a patch of skin left upon their feet. Moreover, he for his part certainly did not like this country of Wambe's, which really was full of ghosts. Only the last night he had heard the spooks at work--they were out shooting, at least <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were. <b>It</b> was very queer, but perhaps their lunatic of a master----' ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{with other}} This Heat recordings, {{much of the}} album was {{recorded}} at Cold Storage, a disused refrigerated storeroom at a former meat pie factory in Acre Lane, Brixton, England. The music included new improvisations along with songs the band had been playing during live performances (portions of these songs were culled from actual concert recordings). As Hayward describes, [...] "some of the album was really plush sounding, some dim and pokey. Sometimes <b>it</b> would <b>sound</b> like the machinery was breaking up. We deliberately would make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the record player was exploding." ...|$|R

5000|$|Reviewing the 2014 {{premiere of}} Thunderstuck, music critic Lewis M. Smoley lauded the work, saying, [...] "Permeated with syncopated and {{chugging}} rhythms, brash outbursts and colorful orchestration, the music splashed across the sonic spectrum, energized by youthful vigor, {{and at times}} evocative of the music of Aaron Copland or Roy Harris." [...] Despite criticizing the premiere performance, David Allen of The New York Times also praised the piece, saying, [...] "It’s {{designed to be a}} fun concert opener, and it is." [...] Eric C. Simpson of the New York Classical Review was slightly more critical, saying, [...] "Rouse says the work is meant to be 'engaging and fun.' It is both those things to some degree, though it is also completely out of left field, both in general and for Rouse specifically. Suave, punchy, and almost oppressively consonant, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it could accompany a training montage in a boxing movie." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Army of Me" [...] {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics.

60|$|By--and--by Granville heard a {{loud voice}} outside. He listened in surprise. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Barolong had another prisoner. There was a pause and a scuffle. Then, all of a sudden, {{somebody}} else came bundling unceremoniously through the hole that served for a door, in the same undignified fashion as he himself had done. Granville's eyes, now accustomed to the gloom, recognised the stranger at once with a thrill of astonishment. He could hardly trust his senses at the sight. It was--no, it couldn't be--yes, it was--Guy Waring.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very sorry, Baas," [...] {{said the}} man in a whine, [...] "but {{half an hour ago}} I heard you coming. I don't know what is the matter with the air to-night, but <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> twenty people were {{galloping}} after you. I could hear them all quite clearly; first the big black horse, and then all those that followed, just <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were hunting you. So I came out and lay down to listen, and it was not till you were quite close that one by one the others stopped. Perhaps it was the devils who galloped." ...|$|R
2500|$|RZA's {{production}} technique, {{specifically the}} manner of chopping up and/or speeding or slowing soul samples to fit his beats, has been picked up by currently popular producers– most notably Kanye West and Just Blaze, the two main producers behind Roc-A-Fella Records. West's own take on RZA's style briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed [...] "chipmunk soul," [...] the speeding of a vocal sample to where <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the singer had inhaled helium. Several producers at the time copied the style, creating other offshoots. West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by the RZA's production, ...|$|R
