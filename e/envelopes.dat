Irish telegram forms were only produced in 1/- and 1/6 values. Registered <b>envelopes</b> have appeared in many values and sizes. The printed (but non-stamped) registered <b>envelopes</b> were produced by private firms and stored by the Irish post office until needed, so <b>envelopes</b> from former periods, showing out-dated fees in the text, often received an impressed stamp for the current postal rate, creating many subtypes for collectors. Other products have carried post-paid imprint, such as commemorative and special issue postcards, including a series of St. Patrick's Day cards issued annually since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Before December 1981, {{the show}} did not feature a bonus round. Under the bonus round's {{original}} rules, no letters were provided automatically. The contestant asked for five consonants and a vowel, {{and then had}} fifteen seconds to attempt solving the puzzle. Also, bonus prizes were selected by the contestant {{at the start of}} the round. The current time limit and rules for letter selection were introduced on October 3, 1988. Starting on September 4, 1989, the first episode of the seventh syndicated season, bonus prizes were selected by the contestant choosing from one of five <b>envelopes</b> labeled W, H, E, E, and L. One prize was always $25,000 in cash, and the rest were changed weekly. Any prize that was won was taken out of rotation for the rest of the week. During seasons 16 through 18 (1998–2001), the $25,000 remained in-place the entire week of shows regardless if it was won. At the start of season 19 in 2001, there were three car <b>envelopes</b> and two $25,000 <b>envelopes,</b> which were available the entire week of shows. These <b>envelopes</b> were replaced with the bonus wheel on October 22, 2001.|$|E

5|$|Known as the {{stamping}} privilege, companies, {{associations and}} individuals {{were permitted to}} submit their own designed and pre-printed <b>envelopes,</b> cards, letter sheets, etc., to the Irish Post Office for impressing with an official post-paid indicia.

Stamped-to-order postal stationery users included Blackrock College, Córas Iompair Éireann, Esso, Great Northern Railway, and John Player & Sons, Dublin. No stamped-to-order registered <b>envelopes</b> are known.

Except for limited early usage of previously issued British postal stationery, which were not overprinted like the postage stamps, all post-paid impressed stamps before 1984 were based on variations of a design showing the country's name in Irish, Éire, with appropriate values in text and numeral tablets centred around an Irish harp motif. This was initially superseded by a shamrock design that later became loosely based on the logo of wavy lines and the word POST used by An Post from 1984. An Post has also used some designs based on postage stamps as post-paid impressed stamps on Irish postal stationery.|$|E
50|$|The donor's core {{does not}} {{participate}} in the expansion of the stellar <b>envelope</b> and the formation of the common <b>envelope,</b> and the common <b>envelope</b> will contain two objects: the core of the original donor and the companion star. These two objects (initially) continue their orbital motion inside the common <b>envelope.</b> However, it is thought that because of drag forces inside the gaseous <b>envelope,</b> the two objects lose energy, which brings them in a closer orbit and actually increases their orbital velocities. The loss of orbital energy is assumed to heat up and expand the <b>envelope,</b> and the whole common-envelope phase ends when either the <b>envelope</b> is expelled into space, or the two objects inside the <b>envelope</b> merge and no more energy is available to expand or even expel the <b>envelope.</b> This phase of the shrinking of the orbit inside the common <b>envelope</b> is known as a spiral-in.|$|R

Cells {{infected with the}} recombinant adenovirus which contained the large <b>envelope</b> gene (HS 1.

No HBV <b>envelope</b> proteins were detected in the culture medium from HS 1. HP-infected cells. Cells infected with recombinant adenovirus which contained the middle <b>envelope</b> gene (HS 2. HP) expressed and secreted the middle and major <b>envelope</b> proteins in a molar ratio of 3 : 1. Cells infected with the recombinant adenovirus which contained the major <b>envelope</b> gene (HS.

HP were assembled in 22 -nm particles, as shown by velocity sedimentation rate determination, buoyant densities, and electron microscopy. Cells coinfected with a recombinant adenovirus which contained the large <b>envelope</b> gene and with either HS 2. HP or HS. HP expressed similar quantities of the large, middle, and major <b>envelope</b> proteins in the cell lysates. Secretion of the major and middle <b>envelope</b> proteins was inhibited more than 95 % {{by the presence of}} the large <b>envelope</b> proteins. These results suggest that differential biosynthesis, transport, and processing of the <b>envelope</b> proteins occur during HBV infection, allowing efficient assembly and secretion of virions and hepatitis B surface antigen particles...|$|R

5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, <b>envelopes</b> the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E

That coin was donated to the newly established Columbian Museum (today the Field Museum). The Company immediately put the pieces on sale for $1 each, and the first shipment was soon all sold to those who lined up to buy them, had ordered them by mail, or had purchased them at local banks that were given allocations. No official packaging was provided; the pieces exist in holders supplied by various banks.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} deliver high data rates, modern {{wireless}} communication systems transmit complex modulated signals with high peak-to-average ratio, which demands wide bandwidth and stringent linearity performance for power amplifiers. To satisfy spectral mask regulations and achieve adequate error vector magnitude, power amplifiers typically operate at 6 to 10 dB back-off from the maximum output power, leading to low efficiency. To overcome the low efficiency problem, the <b>envelope</b> tracking power amplifier architecture {{has been proposed}} {{for this type of}} application due to its feature of high efficiency over a wide power range. The overall efficiency of an <b>envelope</b> tracking system relies not only on performance of the RF power amplifier but also on that of an <b>envelope</b> amplifier that provides a dynamically varying power supply voltage. This dissertation focuses on <b>envelope</b> amplifier design for efficiency enhancement of <b>envelope</b> tracking power amplifiers. First, the <b>envelope</b> tracking power amplifier architecture is analyzed, and the efficiency of a RF transistor in the <b>envelope</b> tracking technique is described. Then <b>envelope</b> amplifier behavior is investigated and a general purpose simulator is developed for analyzing and designing an <b>envelope</b> amplifier. Power loss and efficiency of the <b>envelope</b> amplifier is analyzed and compared with experimental results. The design of <b>envelope</b> amplifiers for high voltage (> 30 V) <b>envelope</b> tracking applications is described. A high voltage <b>envelope</b> amplifier is designed, implemented and verified. The overall <b>envelope</b> tracking system employing a GaN-HEMT RF transistor is demonstrated. Finally, a new architecture is developed for the efficiency enhancement of <b>envelope</b> amplifiers, using a digitally assisted controller design. Digital control is utilized to mitigate delay in the control loop inside the <b>envelope</b> amplifier, leading to lower overall power dissipation. A novel <b>envelope</b> amplifier architecture with dual-switcher stages based on the digitally-assisted control strategy is proposed, designed and implemented. The strategy is demonstrated to improve the efficiency of <b>envelope</b> amplifier as well as the system overall efficiency. The resulting performance of <b>envelope</b> tracking system employing a GaAs high voltage HBT with a single carrier W-CDMA input demonstrated state- of-the-art efficiency with good linearity performanc...|$|R
