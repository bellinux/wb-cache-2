5|$|Monte Burney is {{a volcano}} in {{southern}} Chile, {{part of its}} Austral Volcanic Zone which consists of six volcanoes with activity during the Quaternary.

5|$|A {{paternity}} {{analysis of}} yellow-faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by the male of the nesting pair, with clear evidence for extra-pair paternity {{in the case}} of the remaining 44%. This conflicts with the usual pattern, where genetic monogamy <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> characteristics of strong social pairing, essential paternal contributions to brood rearing, and to sexual monomorphism; characteristics exhibited by the yellow honeyeater.|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> six Khmer bronze statues (three lions–with heads {{substituted}} {{later in}} Burmese style, a three-headed elephant known as Airavata, and two warriors {{in the form}} of Shiva), which are installed in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard. These statues were originally at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia.

5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the female}} {{claim to the}} {{principal}} rooms of the corps de logis, the library and dining room were relocated to a secondary wing not built until much later. This secondary wing <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of corps de logis by a large arcaded loggia; originally open, it is now glazed and known as the Winter Garden. A later secondary wing, known as the Shuvalov wing (named after Vorontsov's son-in-law, Count Shuvalov) {{was not part of}} Blore's original plan and designed by his assistant, William Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Scully becomes {{worried about}} Piller's {{influence}} over Mulder. The agents return to Washington, D.C., where Mulder keeps searching for {{evidence in the}} case. Meanwhile, Piller gets another vision of Samantha, leading Mulder to April Air Force Base. Scully finds evidence that Samantha's disappearance <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Smoking Man (William B. Davis); when she returns to her apartment, she finds him waiting for her. He tells {{her that he had}} called off the search for Mulder's sister when she vanished because he knew she was dead.|$|E

5|$|The only {{motorway}} in {{the county}} is the M4 motorway from London and South Wales, which extends as far west as the Pont Abraham services before continuing northwest as the A48 to Carmarthen. Llanelli <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> motorway by the A4138. The A40 links Carmarthen to Llandeilo, Llandovery and Brecon to the east, and with St Clears, Whitland and Haverfordwest to the west.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the endomembrane system <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> origin of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain the {{origin of the}} endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for {{the origin of the}} endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount of novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} Holkham {{were of a}} large central block of two floors only, {{containing}} on the piano nobile level a series of symmetrically balanced state rooms situated around two courtyards. No hint of these courtyards is given externally; they are intended for lighting rather than recreation or architectural value. This great central block is flanked by four smaller, rectangular blocks, or wings, and at each corners <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main house not by long colonnadesas {{would have been the}} norm in Palladian architecturebut by short two-storey wings of only one bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of the minuet (in F-sharp major) and the trio (in F-sharp minor) continues the overall tension between major and minor. The minuet features a startling harmonic shift: its second half is suddenly interrupted by a fortissimo D-major chord, far remote from the home key, before a chromatic passage leads back to the dominant of C-sharp major. The trio <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> minuet by the rhythmic similarities of their opening motifs.|$|E

5|$|The second area is {{controversial}} and considered pseudoscientific. It {{is found in}} clinical practice, on websites and in books and publications, but {{has little or no}} evidence base. It makes controversial claims relating to a basis in attachment theory.

5|$|The second part, Debt and Sin, {{explores the}} {{theological}} side, including moral or ethical characteristics attributed to debtors and creditors by society and religion. Debt, like certain vices, such as cigarette-smoking, have experienced {{times when it}} was considered sinful, and other times fashionable. Biblical references, like the Book of Deuteronomy, the Lord's Prayer, and sin-eating, are examined. The growth of debt <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> growth of the written media with the relationship symbolized by the Faustian contract with the devil.|$|E
