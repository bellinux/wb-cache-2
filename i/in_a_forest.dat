5|$|A {{saprophytic}} fungus, H. aurantiaca obtains {{nutrients from}} forest litter and decomposing wood, causing a brown rot {{on the wood}} upon which it grows.

5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father deep <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>forest,</b> young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her {{to prepare the}} oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E
50|$|Example: Suppose that <b>a</b> two-way {{transitive}} <b>forest</b> trust {{exists between}} the forest root domains <b>in</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>A</b> and <b>Forest</b> B, and another two-way transitive forest trust {{exists between the}} forest root domains in Forest B and <b>Forest</b> C. Such <b>a</b> configuration lets users in Forest B access resources in any domain <b>in</b> either <b>Forest</b> <b>A</b> or <b>Forest</b> C, and users <b>in</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>A</b> or C can access resources in any domain in Forest B. However, it does not let users <b>in</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>A</b> access resources <b>in</b> <b>Forest</b> C, or vice versa. To let users <b>in</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>A</b> and <b>Forest</b> C share resources, a two-way transitive trust must exist between both forests.|$|R

The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays confetti.|$|E
5|$|Comparing folk tales, {{there are}} {{similarities}} between the ala and the Russian Baba Yaga. The aforementioned motif of a stepdaughter coming to an ala’s house <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> is recorded among Russians too– there a stepdaughter comes to Baba Yaga’s house and feeds her “livestock”. Similar are also the motifs of an ala (by Serbs) and Baba Yaga (by Russians) becoming godmothers to children whom they later eat because the children discover their secret. In the Serbian example, the mother of an ala’s godchild speaks with the ala, and in the Russian, the godchild speaks with Baba Yaga.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{introduces}} Scully to Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), an FBI {{specialist in}} ritualistic crime, shortly before Mulder's deceased body suddenly appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> at night. Following Mulder's funeral, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{is threatened by}} Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) that he must kill Scully's baby before it is born. Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley), a multiple abductee who disappeared {{on the same night}} as Mulder, is returned deceased but his dead body is resurrected and restored to full health. Mulder also returns from death, with Scully supervising his recovery. Fully rejuvenated, Mulder investigates several X-Files, against orders to do so, but soon gets fired, leaving Doggett in charge of the cases.

After crash-landing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> and getting separated, Roget and Yurchael fight their way back {{to the rest of the}} group through the Ferolian army before running into the Peddan military.

Unable to support the invasion, the group rebels against Pedda and joins forces with the Ferolians.|$|E

The Ramayana records that Gautama's ashram is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> (Mithila-upavana) near Mithila, where the couple practices asceticism together for several years. In other scriptures, the ashram is usually near the river bank. The Brahma Purana {{says that it is}} near the river Godavari and the Skanda Purana (701–1200 CE) places it near the river Narmada. The Padma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) describe the ashram as near the holy city of Pushkar.|$|E

5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>forest.</b> The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E
5|$|Post-production work on {{the episode}} was {{finished}} by May 1993, with {{the final version of}} the episode being assembled only three hours before its preview screening for the network's executives. Stock footage of the exterior of the J. Edgar Hoover Building was added to the episode, although later episodes would film new exterior shots using Simon Fraser University as a stand-in location. The climactic abduction scene featuring Billy Miles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> clearing featured a swirling vortex of leaves created using computer imagery by the series' visual designer Mat Beck; which Carter has described as being more complicated to achieve than the Normandy landings.|$|E
5|$|Solitary {{places are}} the best venues for yoga. A matha (hut) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> is ideal, but any private place that is free from distractions, high winds or intense {{sunshine}} is a good location for yoga. Either a pad made of kusha grass or a solid ground with deer skin mat on it, is desirable. Yoga can be learned, {{with the help of}} a teacher, within three to four months if practiced six times a day. If frequent practice is not possible, yoga can be mastered over a period of three to four years.|$|E

Conan's encounter with the witch and Subotai was shot among the Ciudad Encantada rock formations in the province of Cuenca. Most outdoor scenes were shot in the province of Almería, which offered a semiarid climate, diverse terrain (deserts, beaches, mountains), and Roman and Moorish structures that could be adapted for many settings.|$|E
