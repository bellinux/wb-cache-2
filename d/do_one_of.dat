5|$|In September, Oliver Hazard Perry {{destroyed}} {{most of the}} British fleet at the Battle of Lake Erie, {{taking control}} of the lake. This put the British army, then at Fort Malden (now Amherstburg, Ontario) out of supply, and threatened to cut it {{off from the rest of}} Canada by a landing to the east. The British, under General Henry Procter, withdrew to the northeast, followed by Harrison, who had advanced through Michigan while Johnson kept the Indians engaged. The Indian chiefTecumseh and his tribe, hired as mercenaries, covered the British retreat, but were countered by Johnson, who had been called back from a raid on Kaskaskia that had taken the post where the British had distributed arms and money to their hired Indians.. Johnson's cavalry defeated Tecumseh's main force on September 29, took British supply trains on October 3, and was one of the factors inducing Procter to stand and fight at the Battle of the Thames on October 5, as Tecumseh had been demanding he <b>do.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> Johnson's slaves, Daniel Chinn, accompanied Johnson to the battle.|$|E

500|$|Como {{competed with}} Jackie Gleason {{in what was}} billed as the [...] "Battle of the Giants" [...] and won. This is now rarely mentioned, in part because Como {{commonly}} downplayed his own achievements, and also because {{the two men were}} friends. The weekly ratings winner would phone the loser for some mock gloating. At the height of this television competition, Como asked Gleason a favor: to visit his home when his mother-in-law, a big Gleason fan, was there. Though Mrs. Belline spoke no English and Gleason no Italian, Roselle's mother was thrilled. Como's words to Gleason after the visit, [...] "Anything you want, you got it.

500|$|The {{music video}} for Fall Out Boy's [...] "Beat It" [...] was {{directed}} by Shane Drake and was made in homage to Jackson. [...] "I think when you're doing a Michael Jackson cover, there's this expectation that you're going to <b>do</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his videos verbatim," [...] Stump said. [...] "What {{we decided to do}} was kind of inspired by Michael Jackson and the mythology of him. There are specific images that are reference points for us, but at any given point, it's not any of his videos. It's kind of all of his videos, all at once, but on a Fall Out Boy budget, so it's not quite as fancy." [...] The costumes for the video were similar to the originals. [...] "My costume is this take on one of the guys from Michael Jackson's original 'Beat It' video, like, the guy who plays the rival dancer," [...] Wentz said during the filming of the video. The music video featured numerous cameos, including a karate class/dance session being taught by Tony Hale, Donald Faison and Joel David Moore dressed up like Michael Jackson. The short film later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Rock Video.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} much less {{politically}} focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor. Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for [...] "a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics". The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged {{by some of the}} show's cast. Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, [...] "You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and leave it in the closet before you got on the plane to <b>do</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these pieces." [...] One reviewer from The New York Times criticized the show for being too cruel and for lacking a central editorial vision or ideology, describing it as [...] "bereft of an ideological or artistic center... precocious but empty." ...|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship between The Undertaker and Edge. The match went {{in and out of}} the ring early on, with both {{competitors}} throwing each other out of the ring. The Undertaker instinctively tried to apply the triangle choke hold on Edge, but the referee made him break the hold. Edge then tried to <b>do</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Undertaker's moves, Old school, but Undertaker countered. Mid-way in the match, Edge's associates, Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder, distracted Undertaker after performing an Old school on Edge. This distraction led Edge to remove the top turnbuckle padding. Back and forth action was seen between the two individuals. As the top turnbuckle was exposed, the Undertaker executed Snake Eyes on Edge. As the Undertaker ran off the ropes, Edge performed a Spear for a near-fall. Afterwards, the Undertaker clotheslined Edge to the outside of the ring, then rolled to the floor after. Undertaker threw Edge over the barricade to the front row with a clothesline while the referee began the 10-count. Both men struggled back to the floor and the Undertaker tackled Edge into the barricade at the eight count. He then rolled into the ring to win the match by countout and the belt. After the match, Vickie Guerrero announced that Undertaker hadn't won the title as it can only be won by pinfall or submission, leaving the title vacant. Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Edge.|$|E

Only two minutes elapsed between the departure of the ferry and {{the collision}}. Since there was doubt as to the intention of the George Prince, and there was no response to attempts to determine the ferry's intentions, the duty of the pilot of the Frosta was to immediately reverse engine and sound the danger signal.|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Cosmatos frequented a {{video store}} named Video Addict. During these trips he would browse the horror film section {{looking at the}} boxes {{although}} he {{was not allowed to}} watch such films. During such times he would instead imagine what the film was. He would later reflect upon this experience when making Black Rainbow where one of his goals was [...] "to create a film that is a sort of imagining of an old film that doesn’t exist." [...] The year 1983 was chosen for the story as it's the first year he went to Video Addict. Additionally he thought the idea of setting such a film one year before 1984 was funny. The film's genesis was an overlap between two projects Cosmatos wanted to <b>do.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> these was a film about a girl trapped in an asylum while the other was an installation promoting a research facility that didn't exist. Eventually Cosmatos realized that he could use both ideas in the same project.|$|E
2500|$|On March 18, EA {{announced}} a new multiplayer option, which would be available as a free patch immediately upon {{the release of the}} game. Called [...] "Don Control", it would be a new option available for all pre-existing multiplayer modes.

As the Don, this player can drop waypoints anywhere, directing their teammates to strategic areas. Additionally, specific areas of the map, called [...] "capture nods," [...] can be controlled by either team. Once controlled by a team, the Don can activate the nod to <b>do</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> three things; give a health boost, give an armored vest, or explode when members of the enemy team approach. The mode also lets Dons wager in-game cash prior to the commencement of the battle. Dons sets the amount they wish to wager, and how much they will give to their team should they win. However, if a player loses, all cash wagered will be removed from their single-player campaign.|$|E
