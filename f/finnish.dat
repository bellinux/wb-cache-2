5|$|A 800–1,000-strong Swedish Brigade, led by Hjalmar Frisell, {{took part}} in the battles of Tampere and those fought in the area south of the town. In February 1918, the Swedish Navy escorted the German naval squadron, {{transporting}} <b>Finnish</b> Jägers and German weapons, and allowed it to pass through Swedish territorial waters. The Swedish socialists did not aid the <b>Finnish</b> Reds but tried to open peace negotiations between the Whites and Reds. The weakness of Finland gave Sweden a chance to take-over geopolitically vital <b>Finnish</b> Åland islands, east of Stockholm, but the German army's Finland-operation stalled the plan.|$|E
5|$|As <b>Finnish</b> {{nationalism}} arose {{and increased}} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, crossbreeding of the <b>Finnish</b> horse essentially ended and a new direction was taken by <b>Finnish</b> horse breeders. The breed was considered {{a symbol of the}} nation, and thus it was desired that it be as purebred as possible. On 20 November 1894, Finland's first horse breeding association Hevoskasvatusyhdistys Hippos (now Suomen Hippos) was founded to breed and improve the <b>Finnish</b> horse by the means of purebreeding, and in 1905, a governmental decree was issued for horse breeding associations to be founded throughout the country, leading to the establishment of the Finnhorse stud book in 1907.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western <b>Finnish</b> horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western <b>Finnish</b> type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and <b>Finnish</b> horses were larger than their <b>Finnish</b> parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E
5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in <b>Finnish</b> society. The power struggle between the <b>Finnish</b> estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the <b>Finnish</b> elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E
5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1939, the Soviets further reduced their demands and sent Boris Stein to negotiate. Stein and Erkko met five times. Erkko {{rejected}} the Soviet proposals, saying that the Soviet demands would {{mean the end of}} the <b>Finnish</b> neutrality policy and displease the Germans. When the chairman of the <b>Finnish</b> Defense Council C.G.E. Mannerheim was informed of the negotiations, he opined that Finland should give up the Suursaari islands because their defence would anyway be impossible during a war, but his arguments did not persuade the majority of the <b>Finnish</b> government. Stein departed Helsinki empty-handed on 6 April.|$|E
5|$|During German-Finnish {{negotiations}} Finland {{had demanded}} to remain neutral unless the Soviet Union attacked them first. Germany therefore sought to provoke the Soviet Union into {{an attack on}} Finland. After Germany launched Barbarossa on 22 June, German aircraft used <b>Finnish</b> air bases to attack Soviet positions. The same day the Germans launched Operation Rentier and occupied the Petsamo Province at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to remilitarize the neutral Åland Islands. Despite these actions the <b>Finnish</b> government insisted via diplomatic channels that they remained a neutral party, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland as an ally of Germany. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 June against all major <b>Finnish</b> cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti. During a night session {{on the same day}} the <b>Finnish</b> parliament decided to go to war against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|During {{the closing}} stages of World War I, German-trained <b>Finnish</b> Jäger troops {{played a key}} role in the <b>Finnish</b> Civil War, while the German Baltic Sea Division also intervened late in the civil war. Jäger troops were volunteers from German-influenced circles, such as {{university}} students. This participation in the <b>Finnish</b> struggle for independence created close ties with Germany, but after the German defeat in the World War, Scandinavian relations became more important and the main goal of the <b>Finnish</b> foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|Earliest horse {{equipment}} (bits) {{found in}} <b>Finnish</b> graves {{date from the}} <b>Finnish</b> Middle Iron Age, beginning from circa 400 CE. Breeds considered to descend from the same early types as the Finnhorse include the Estonian Native horse, the Norwegian Nordlandshest/Lyngshest, the Swedish Gotland Russ, the Mezen horse from the region of Archangelsk, Russia, and the Lithuanian Žemaitukas.|$|E

5|$|Finland {{was divided}} into two {{operational}} zones. Northern Finland was the staging area for Army Norway. Its goal was to execute a two-pronged pincer movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. Southern Finland was still under {{the responsibility of the}} <b>Finnish</b> Army. The goal of the <b>Finnish</b> forces was, at first, to recapture <b>Finnish</b> Karelia at Lake Ladoga as well as the Karelian Isthmus, which included Finland's second largest city Vyborg.|$|E

5|$|<b>Finnish</b> {{society had}} {{experienced}} rapid population growth, industrialization, pre-urbanization {{and the rise}} of a comprehensive labor movement. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratization and modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle, militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning <b>Finnish</b> labor movement and the <b>Finnish</b> conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Finnish-German {{relations}} cooled {{after the}} National Socialists rose {{to power in}} 1933—Finns admired Imperial Germany, not the radical and anti-democratic Nazi regime. <b>Finnish</b> conservatives did not accept the state violence and anti-church policies of the Nazis. Still, there was sympathy for German aims to revise the Treaty of Versailles, although the official <b>Finnish</b> policy was reserved, especially after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Finland even recalled its ambassador for a short period. <b>Finnish</b> Nazis and ultranationalist parties such as the IKL achieved only minor support in several elections, especially {{in the aftermath of}} the failed Mäntsälä rebellion in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Growing up in Turku, Finland, Salo had {{aspirations}} {{of playing with}} the <b>Finnish</b> national team, rather than the NHL. He idolized Jari Kurri and was more familiar with other <b>Finnish</b> players, such as Esa Peltonen and Heikki Riihiranta, than he was with any NHL stars.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the Soviet Union began {{collectivization}} in Ingria. During the collectivization {{and ethnic}} cleansing, the Soviets captured, killed and deported Ingrian peasants, provoking widespread criticism by the <b>Finnish</b> media in 1930. Two years later, the nationalist Lapua Movement unsuccessfully attempted {{to overthrow the}} <b>Finnish</b> government in the Mäntsälä rebellion.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, {{a working}} group {{set up by the}} <b>Finnish</b> MoD {{proposed}} starting a program to replace the <b>Finnish</b> Air Force's current fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. The group recognises five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35, and Saab JAS Gripen.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-19thcentury, manor {{owners in}} Estonia found the native Estonian Horse {{too small for}} their {{agricultural}} needs, {{and came to the}} conclusion that the population would benefit from crossbreeding. <b>Finnish</b> horses were among the good quality breeds considered for the job. The state stud farm of Tori was founded as the central base for the new Estonian breed in 1856, and ten <b>Finnish</b> mares and three stallions were bought for its needs. Though some purebred <b>Finnish</b> horses were produced, they were used mainly for crossbreeding; the later offspring of part-Finnish crossbreds, however, did not prove as good as expected, and the Tori stud gradually stopped using <b>Finnish</b> horses. One Finnish-Arabian stallion, Orro, has had noteworthy influence on the modern-day Tori horse, through his widely used great-grandson Harun 42 T.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{does not}} sell to {{automobile}} manufacturers, but instead {{concentrates on the}} more profitable consumer tyre replacement and premium snow tyre markets. Nokian Tyres has the highest market share of the <b>Finnish</b> passenger car tyre market. The <b>Finnish,</b> Swedish, and Norwegian markets contributed over 40% of Nokian Tyres' corporate net sales in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Salo {{made his}} {{international}} debut with the <b>Finnish</b> national {{team at the}} 2001 World Championships in Germany. He recorded an international career-high nine points in nine games, second among tournament defencemen to <b>Finnish</b> teammate Petteri Nummelin. Finland advanced to the gold medal game, where they lost 3–2 to the Czech Republic, earning silver.|$|E
5|$|Suomen Gummitehdas Oy {{was founded}} in 1898 and began {{manufacturing}} car tyres in 1932. The Hakkapeliitta tyre name was introduced in 1936, and some tyres sold under the Nokian tyre name still use the Hakkapeliitta brand name. Hakkapeliitta is a (<b>Finnish)</b> historical term used for a <b>Finnish</b> light cavalryman {{in the service of}} King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48). In 1967, Suomen Kumitehdas Oy (originally called Suomen Gummitehdas Oy) merged with Suomen Kaapelitehdas (<b>Finnish</b> Cable Works) and the forest and power industry company Nokia Aktiebolag to create Nokia Corporation.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Finnish</b> and Swedish militaries {{engaged in}} wide-ranging co-operation, {{but it was}} more focused on the {{exchange}} of information and defence planning for the Åland islands than on military exercises or materiel. The <b>Finnish</b> objective was to commit the Swedes by establishing a military-political joint venture in the Åland: if the Swedes would undertake to assist Finland in fortifying the islands, then an important and useful precedent might be set. The Government of Sweden was aware of the military co-operation, but carefully avoided committing itself to <b>Finnish</b> foreign policy.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Finnish</b> labor movement, {{which emerged}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century from temperance, {{religious}} movements and Fennomania, had a <b>Finnish</b> nationalist, working-class character. From 1899–1906 the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the patronizing thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the <b>Finnish</b> Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism directed both toward opposing Russification and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for democracy. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the <b>Finnish</b> nobility-burghers and the labor movement concerning voting rights for the common people.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Finnish</b> plan in {{the south}} in Karelia was to advance as swiftly as {{possible}} to Lake Ladoga, cutting the Soviet forces in half. Then the <b>Finnish</b> territories east of Lake Ladoga were to be recaptured before the advance along the Karelian Isthmus, including the recapture of Vyborg, commenced. The <b>Finnish</b> attack was launched on 10 July. The Army of Karelia held a numerical advantage versus the Soviet defenders of the 7th Army and 23rd Army, so it could advance swiftly. The important road junction at Loimola was captured on 14 July. By 16 July, the first <b>Finnish</b> units reached Lake Ladoga at Koirinoja, achieving the goal of splitting the Soviet forces. During the rest of July, the Army of Karelia advanced further southeast into Karelia, coming to a halt at the former Finnish-Soviet border at Mansila.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{invasion}} and occupation caused additional hardships. By {{the end of}} Russian occupation in 1721, {{a third of the}} <b>Finnish</b> human populace as well as large numbers of horses were lost to war and epidemic diseases. Furthermore, a great number of horses were exported to Russia during the invasion at the command of PeterI. Horses removed from Finland ended up mainly in the area of Vyatka government, and some Russian researchers such as Simanov and Moerder have suggested that the Vyatka horse was developed mainly from Estonian and <b>Finnish</b> bloodlines. In addition to the hardships of war and occupation, the treaties of Nystad in 1721 and Åbo in 1743 ceded <b>Finnish</b> territory to Russia, which resulted in much of the <b>Finnish</b> horse population being left behind the new borders. The <b>Finnish</b> horses in these now-Russian areas were crossbred with the Russian horses in significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet offer {{divided the}} <b>Finnish</b> government. The foreign {{minister}} Eljas Erkko and the defence minister Juho Niukkanen rejected the offer, {{backed by the}} president Kyösti Kallio. J.K. Paasikivi and C.G.E. Mannerheim, together with Väinö Tanner—who was later appointed one of the <b>Finnish</b> negotiators—wanted to accept the Soviet offer.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{alphabet}} {{is completely}} {{identical to the}} <b>Finnish</b> alphabet.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien based Quenya {{pronunciation}} more on Latin than on <b>Finnish.</b> Thus, Quenya {{lacks the}} vowel harmony and consonant gradation present in <b>Finnish,</b> and accent {{is not always}} on the first syllable of a word. Typical <b>Finnish</b> elements like the front vowels ö, ä and y are lacking in Quenya, but phonological similarities include the absence of aspirated unvoiced stops or {{the development of the}} syllables ti > si in both languages. The combination of a Latin basis with <b>Finnish</b> phonological rules resulted in a product that resembles Italian in many respects, which was Tolkien's favourite modern Romance language.|$|E
5|$|With the Germans mostly {{unable to}} operate and advance {{without the support}} of the {{experienced}} <b>Finnish</b> units, their hope now lay on a continuation of the attack led by the Finns themselves. These hopes were soon squashed. Field Marshal Carl Mannerheim, supreme commander of the <b>Finnish</b> forces, insisted on delaying further offensive operations, citing military and logistical reasons. On 17 November, Siilasvuo ordered an immediate stop to the <b>Finnish</b> III Corps' offensive, despite positive feedback from his field commanders that further ground could be taken. This sudden change in <b>Finnish</b> behaviour was, in some part, the result of diplomatic pressure by the United States and Britain. Finland was no longer interested in spearheading such an offensive. With the <b>Finnish</b> refusal to be involved in further offensive operations, Arctic Fox came to an end in November and both sides dug in.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increasing}} Soviet resistance, a plan {{was made to}} concentrate on only one target. It was decided to halt the Ukhta-offensive and instead support the advance east of Kestenga in mid-August. This new drive {{was able to make}} some ground in the arctic no-man's land, but no decisive breakthrough could be achieved. The increasing Soviet activity also worried Siilasvuo, especially as Group F was now standing still in exposed terrain, open to a possible Soviet encirclement. To counter this, AOK Norwegen decided to bolster the <b>Finnish</b> forces for a final push to the east {{and the rest of the}} SS Nord division was moved south and put under <b>Finnish</b> command. Also parts of 6th <b>Finnish</b> Division were now moved south and returned to the <b>Finnish</b> III Corps for more reinforcements. Once the reorganisation had been completed, a new, final attack had to be launched by both <b>Finnish</b> battlegroups in October.|$|E
5|$|Finally, on 30 October, the new long-planned {{offensive}} began, {{and after}} two days a Soviet regiment was encircled. <b>Finnish</b> General Hjalmar Siilasvuo proceeded to clear the perimeter with his troops. After the disappointing performance of the SS units under his command and the realization that he neither the <b>Finnish</b> nor the German high command is going to provide him with additional forces or substantial reinforcements, he slowed down the advance towards the east and instead concentrated on clearing and securing the area. Those mop-up operations were completed by 13 November. By that point the <b>Finnish</b> 3rd Division had killed 3,000 Soviet soldiers and captured 2,600.|$|E
5|$|In foreign policy, the Vaasa Senate {{leaned on}} the German Empire for {{military}} and political aid, in order to defeat the <b>Finnish</b> Red Guards, end the influence of Bolshevist Russia in Finland, and expand <b>Finnish</b> territory to Russian/East Karelia, which held geopolitical significance, and was home to people speaking Finno-Ugric languages (Irredentist campaigns/Heimosodat). The weakness of Russia induced an idea of Greater Finland among the expansive factions of both the right and left; the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed {{on the need to}} take over eastern Karelia and for German weapons, but opposed German intervention in Finland. Mannerheim recognized the lack of combat skills of the <b>Finnish</b> Red Guards, and he {{leaned on the}} high military skills of the <b>Finnish</b> Jägers. As a former Russian army officer, Mannerheim was well aware of the demoralization of the Russian army. He co-operated with White Russian officers in Finland and Russia.|$|E
5|$|Later, the <b>Finnish</b> statesman J.K. Paasikivi {{commented that}} the Soviet attack, without a {{declaration}} of war, violated three different non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu of 1920, the Non-aggression Pact between Finland and the Soviet Union signed 1932 and again in 1934, and further the Charter of the League of Nations. The invasion was judged as illegal by the League of Nations, which expelled the Soviet Union on December 14. Following the Soviet attack, C.G.E. Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the <b>Finnish</b> Defense Forces. Furthermore, the <b>Finnish</b> government changed as Risto Ryti was appointed {{the new prime minister}} and Väinö Tanner as foreign minister.|$|E
