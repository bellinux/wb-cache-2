40|$|Open {{defecation}} {{increases the}} risk of helminthiasis and other infectious diseases. In rural Indonesia, we tested a <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> (the ‘BALatrine’) as a method for controlling soil transmitted helminth (STH) infection. We studied two villages, one of which had household latrines and the other did not. The dependent variable was {{the presence or absence of}} worm eggs in stool samples, as confirmed by laboratory analysis. The independent variables were the village of residence, demographic characteristics, and various behaviours associated in the literature with the risk of helminthiasis. The total number of participants was 475, of whom 392 were worm-free. In a multivariate logistic-regression model, the people who were more likely to be worm-free were younger, female, did not spend time in the paddy fields, and lived in the village that had BALatrines. Compared with the people living in the village without BALatrines, those in the village with BALatrines were twice as likely to be worm-free. A longitudinal controlled study of the BALatrine would allow us to confirm the significance of this <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> in controlling helminthiasis. 1 This work was supported by the UBS Optimus Foundation.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The issue of standards for <b>household</b> <b>latrines</b> is complex because discussions related to standards for latrines in literature from the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector {{tend to focus on}} the negative aspects of standards and highlights cases where the miss-application of standards in the past has caused problems. However, despite concerns about the constraints that standards can seemingly impose, there is an acknowledgement that standards can play a more positive role in supporting efforts to increase access to <b>household</b> <b>latrines.</b> The World Health Organisation has long established and widely recognised standards for water supply quality and quantity but there are no equivalent standards for sanitation services and there is currently no guidance that deals with the topic of standards for <b>household</b> <b>latrines.</b> <b>Household</b> <b>latrines</b> are a small component of the wider sanitation system in a country and by considering how standards for <b>household</b> <b>latrines</b> operate within this wider sanitation system the aim of this research is to understand what influences standards can have on <b>household</b> <b>latrines</b> and explore how the negative perceptions about standards and latrine building can be overcome. The development of guidance on how to develop well written standards is the core focus of this research. This research explores the factors that can influence the development and use of a standard for <b>household</b> <b>latrines</b> in Rwanda using three data collection methods. Document analysis using 66 documents, including policies and strategies, design manuals and training guides from 17 countries throughout Sub-Saharan Africa was used in conjunction with the Delphi Method involving an expert panel of 27 from Rwanda and 38 semi-structured interviews. The research concludes that perceptions about standards for <b>household</b> <b>latrines</b> are fragmented and confused with little consensus in Rwanda on what need a standard should meet and what role it should play. The study has found that the need for a standard must be considered {{in the context of the}} wider sanitation system otherwise it can lead to duplication of efforts and increased confusion for all stakeholders. The study also found that there is an assumed link between standards and enforcement of standards through regulation and punishments which creates the negative perceptions about standards in Rwanda. However, despite this aversion to standards, there are still intentions to promote the standardisation of latrine technologies and designs, led by national government in Rwanda and in other Sub-Saharan African countries. The contribution to knowledge of this research includes a decision process presented at the end of the study which can be used by decision makers who are interested in developing a standard for <b>household</b> <b>latrines.</b> The decision process acts as a tool for outlining how a standard can operate within the national sanitation system.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAn {{estimated}} 2. 4 {{billion people}} still lack access to improved sanitation and 946 million still practice open defecation. The World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned this review {{to assess the}} impact of sanitation on coverage and use, as part of its effort to develop a set of guidelines on sanitation and health. Methods and findingsWe systematically reviewed the literature and used meta-analysis to quantitatively characterize how different sanitation interventions impact latrine coverage and use. We also assessed both qualitative and quantitative studies to understand how different structural and design characteristics of sanitation are associated with individual latrine use. A total of 64 studies met our eligibility criteria. Of 27 intervention studies that reported on <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> coverage and provided a point estimate with confidence interval, the average increase in coverage was 14 % (95 % CI: 10 %, 19 %). The intervention types with the largest absolute increases in coverage included the Indian government's “Total Sanitation Campaign” (27 %; 95 % CI: 14 %, 39 %), latrine subsidy/provision interventions (16 %; 95 % CI: 8 %, 24 %), latrine subsidy/provision interventions that also incorporated education components (17 %; 95 % CI: − 5 %, 38 %), sewerage interventions (14 %; 95 % CI: 1 %, 28 %), sanitation education interventions (14 %; 95 % CI: 3 %, 26 %), and community-led total sanitation interventions (12 %; 95 % CI: − 2 %, 27 %). Of 10 intervention studies that reported on <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> use, the average increase was 13 % (95 % CI: 4 %, 21 %). The sanitation interventions and contexts in which they were implemented varied, leading to high heterogeneity across studies. We found 24 studies that examined the association between structural and design characteristics of sanitation facilities and facility use. These studies reported that better maintenance, accessibility, privacy, facility type, cleanliness, newer latrines, and better hygiene access were all frequently associated with higher use, whereas poorer sanitation conditions were associated with lower use. ConclusionsOur results indicate that most sanitation interventions only had a modest impact on increasing latrine coverage and use. A further understanding of how different sanitation characteristics and sanitation interventions impact coverage and use is essential in order to more effectively attain sanitation access for all, eliminate open defecation, and ultimately improve health...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} done in four rural {{communities}} in Ghana to assess uptake of household latrines. A total of 156 household interviews, 16 focus group discussions and 8 in-depth interviews with key informants were conducted. Study findings show that only 8. 5 % of households were using improved sanitation facilities with more than 75 % of the households relying on open defecation and communal trench latrines. Knowledge of technological options was very limited and the cost for preferred latrines was unaffordable. Though health-related benefits motivated <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> uptake, those related to personal security, privacy, social status and convenience were ranked higher. Sanitation uptake was constrained mainly by finances, poor sanitation promotion and general biophysical factors. High costs of latrine construction could be reduced by introducing cheaper technological options, using low-cost construction materials and labor contributions from households. Financing models like microcredit financing can also be explored and adapted for use in Ghana. We recommend the use of approaches aimed at behavior change while giving households a range of technological options such as community led total sanitation (CLTS). Hence, despite the low coverage of improved sanitation in rural Ghana, there exist real opportunities to accelerate sanitation uptake...|$|E

Households as Sanitation Consumers In Sanitation Marketing (SanMark), we learn to think about households as consumers, not beneficiaries, of sanitation goods and services. When low-income rural households build an improved latrine – whether it is their first latrine or an upgrade from an unhygienic or temporary facility – they {{make a decision to}} invest money and effort in something they have never owned. This typically involves a new technology or product, and construction methods they may not have seen, touched, or used before. To motivate household to spend hard earned money and effort for an improved latrine, the very first step is to understand them better. SanMark programs start by gaining a deep understanding of consumer needs, motivations, preferences, and barriers for acquiring improved sanitation.

30|$|In {{terms of}} menstrual waste disposal, the toolkit {{was not found}} to greatly {{influence}} practice {{for a range of}} reasons, including the shortage of timing and funds to cover a relatively large intervention. However, learning was gained in the challenges with disposal. The formative evaluation found relatively little attention among actors directed towards addressing disposal, which could have been partly related to a predominance of reusables being distributed. However, waste disposal was mentioned as a priority by WASH actors given the implications of menstrual materials for desludging latrines. Both Burundian and Congolese girls and women indicated strong preferences for putting used menstrual materials directly into <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> pits. In addition, there were strong taboos surrounding menstrual blood and its linkages to witchcraft which posed a challenge to identifying other disposal approaches, and in particular, women’s fears that cleaners would be able to identify their used materials. At schools and protection centers where pit latrine and flush toilet were present, disposal issues were of greater concern given the frequency of blockages from menstrual waste. Overall, there remained a lack of consensus across organizations and agencies on improving disposal approaches, disposal and waste management design options, and appropriate strategies for engaging with girls and women given cultural sensitivities. These conceptual blockages appeared to delay movement in this area prior to and during the pilot.|$|E

40|$|Why do governments {{sometimes}} fail {{to provide}} essential {{services that are}} fundamental to development and the well-being of their citizens? I investigate the role of gender, of both policy makers and of beneficiaries, in the variation of access to sanitation in rural India. I argue that politicians' gender can help explain why some elected officials are more responsive in providing sanitation services than others {{in terms of the}} quality and quantity of latrines. Given the close association between latrine quality and water-borne diseases, there is a need to examine the variation in the quality of latrines rather than access to latrines as previous studies do. Using an instrumental variable approach with sub-state level data that exploits the quasi-randomness of the gender of the winner in close elections, I study the influence of female state legislators of fifteen major states in India. When faced with increased electoral competition female politicians act in the same way as their male counterparts do, which is by widening latrine coverage, in order to signal good performance to the voters. However, female state legislators are more likely to improve sanitation services than their male counterparts by increasing higher quality latrines (flush toilets), after controlling for correlates of electoral incentives. Given that women benefit disproportionately from latrines, the role of gender in the decision making process among household members is likely to be relevant. Thus, the second part of my argument examines what influences women, the main beneficiaries of improved sanitation, to make financial investments towards having a <b>household</b> <b>latrine.</b> Drawing from nationwide household level survey data, I find that households are more likely to have latrines not only when women are more informed through mass media, but also when their intra-household status is higher, especially with respect to taking part in the financial decision making process in households...|$|E
40|$|Background: More than 761 {{million people}} rely on shared {{sanitation}} facilities. These {{have historically been}} excluded from international sanitation targets, regardless of the service level, due to concerns about acceptability, hygiene and access. In connection with a proposed change in such policy, we undertook this review to identify and summarize existing evidence that compares health outcomes associated with shared sanitation versus individual <b>household</b> <b>latrines.</b> Methods and Findings: Shared sanitation included any type of facilities intended for the containment of human faeces and used {{by more than one}} household, but excluded public facilities. Health outcomes included diarrhoea, helminth infections, enteric fevers, other faecal-oral diseases, trachoma and adverse maternal or birth outcomes. Studies were included regardless of design, location, language or publication status. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the STROBE guidelines. Twenty-two studies conducted in 21 countries met the inclusion criteria. Studies show a pattern of increased risk of adverse health outcomes associated with shared sanitation compared to individual <b>household</b> <b>latrines.</b> A meta-analysis of 12 studies reporting on diarrhoea found increased odds of disease associated with reliance on shared sanitation (odds ratio (OR) 1. 44, 95 % CI: 1. 18 – 1. 76).

40|$|In Zanzibar, the {{prevalence}} {{and intensity of}} helminth infections have markedly declined over the past 25 years, which is generally attributed to morbidity control programmes emphasising 'preventive chemotherapy'. Here we provide an update of the current situation of soil-transmitted helminthiasis and urinary schistosomiasis on Unguja Island, and highlight socioeconomic development, improvement in sanitation and health education as additional drivers against helminthiases. Our data were obtained from cross-sectional surveys carried out between 2006 and 2009 with stool and urine samples from 2858 and 879 individuals, respectively, examined for helminth eggs and larvae. Additionally, several hundred people were interviewed on sanitation and hygienic behaviour. Data on Unguja's economic growth and improvements in access to clean water and <b>household</b> <b>latrines</b> {{in the recent past}} were derived from the extant literature. Pooled prevalences of Trichuris trichiura, Schistosoma haematobium, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis were 35 %, 29 %, 12 %, 10 % and 6 %, respectively. However, there were considerable differences in prevalences between different age-groups and at village and district level. Moreover, some hotspots for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and S. haematobium were identified with prevalences above 60 % among school-aged children. Availability of a latrine and washing hands before eating did not significantly lower the risk of helminth infections in our study population. Nevertheless, a considerable increase in access to <b>household</b> <b>latrines</b> (from 49 % to 72 %) and piped water (from 45 % to 71 %) between 1991 and 2005 is likely to have contributed to reducing the force of transmission of helminthiases in Zanzibar. The next logical step in Unguja is to change the tactics from morbidity control to interruption of helminth transmission and ultimately local elimination. Hence, 'preventive chemotherapy' needs to be further consolidated, placing particular emphasis on health education and improved access to clean water and sanitation...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{assessed}} a <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> revision intervention {{implemented in}} Kabul, Afghanistan {{for evidence of}} a reduction in diarrhoeal disease. METHODS: A case-control design involving 1238 cases and 625 controls was used. Logistic regression modelling was performed both for children < 5 years and < 11 years, and the parameter estimates were later used with results from a stratified cluster sample survey. This survey used a verbal autopsy methodology to enable an estimation {{of the number of}} deaths averted over a 1 -year period. A cost-effectiveness analysis using direct and indirect costs for the intervention was then conducted and the results compared with primary health care interventions identified from a Medline search. FINDINGS: Conditional logistic regression showed that patients were less likely than controls to live in households with revised latrines (odds ratio (OR) 0. 57, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 42 - 0. 77 for children < 5 years, and OR 0. 53, 95 % = CI 0. 41 - 0. 67 for children < 11 years). The results from the survey of cause-specific mortality by verbal autopsy enabled estimation of the number of deaths averted over a 1 -year period due to the intervention; these estimations were 235 (95 % CI = 109 - 360) for children < 5 years and 285 (95 % CI = 180 - 397) for children < 11 years. Estimates of cost effectiveness ranged from approximately US$ 1800 to US$ 4100 per death averted depending on age and payer perspective. CONCLUSION: These estimates are conservative because only 1 year of effectiveness is considered, yet they compare favourably with a review of other paediatric interventions. These results are important because funding for sanitation interventions is often limited by the belief that the interventions are not cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{water and}} {{sanitation}} facilities and unhygienic practices contribute to millions of child deaths every year. India is perhaps the worst affected country. Annually, over half a million children die of diarrhea in India. I examine the sustained effects on sanitation and child health of a randomized sanitation campaign conducted in rural Orissa, India, in 2005 - 06 by a team from RTI International, the World Bank {{and the government of}} Orissa. The campaign was based on the community-led total sanitation (CLTS) methodology and combined subsides to poor households with strategies to increase <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> adoption by inducing emotional responses to open defecation. My analysis reveals that latrine ownership rose significantly in treatment villages even after the campaign ended, especially among poor households. In these households, latrine ownership surged from 35 % in 2006 to 49 % in 2010, while in other households, it increased from 30 % to 32 %. In contrast, only around 19 % of both poor and non-poor families in control villages owned latrines in 2010. Over 15 % of all households in villages that received the sanitation campaign constructed individual latrines after the campaign ended, indicating considerable diffusion of latrine adoption in addition to continued latrine ownership. The diffusion is pronounced in BPL households, which comprise around 74 % of the ‘late’ adopters. The intervention also seems to have decreased diarrhea incidence, but these results are not as clear-cut. These figures indicate that the benefits of the campaign did not diminish over time, and the impact of the evaluation was underestimated in the short run. They also suggest that the subsidies given to poor families were responsible {{for more than half of}} the continued effect of the campaign, which calls into question the strict no-subsidies approach followed by many international organizations. Further research into the mechanisms of behavior change is vital if the Millennium Development Goals of improved sanitation are to be met...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Rates of population growth in developing country cities are straining the capacity of sanitation service providers. In spite of widespread sector recognition {{of the need to}} adopt low-cost, people centred approaches, 80 per cent of investments in the water and sanitation sector continue to be allocated to high cost technologies for urban elites. Household level, on-plot sanitation systems potentially offer a solution to the sanitary needs of the urban poor. Nevertheless, commonly held assumptions amongst sector professionals that lower cost, on-plot systems are inappropriate and unacceptable in urban communities impede-their wider application. There is little empirical evidence to justify this position. The scope of this work examines the technical appropriateness and user acceptability of on-plot sanitation options. The thesis contributes to an improved understanding of the context in which on-plot systems operate, what factors constrain their application, and what issues need consideration when deciding on sanitary options in low-income communities. The research adopted a mix of methodological techniques to improve {{the reliability and validity of}} findings, with both quantitative and qualitative methods applied during fieldwork. Findings from Ghana, Mozambique and India are included in the thesis in order to permit sampling of key latrine types used internationally. The thesis concludes that user based perceptions of the performance and acceptability of on-plot systems varies markedly to those of sector professionals, particularly in relation to plot size, satisfaction levels and reasons for absence of <b>household</b> <b>latrine.</b> Furthermore, user based criteria of performance are developed for consideration practitioners when narrowing decision making on sanitary options. The implications of the study highlight the need for integration of user concerns into strategic planning for sanitation, more effective stimulation and negotiation of demand for sanitation systems and challenges for agencies in adopting a user oriented approach. The recommendations from the thesis include practitioner focused policy changes that affect project planning and support systems for user education. Potential areas of further research interest include ranking user perceptions, an holistic understanding of excreta management processes and institutional constraints affecting user-service provider consultations...|$|E

40|$|Background: Faced with {{a massive}} {{shortfall}} in meeting sanitation targets, some governments have implemented campaigns that use subsidies focused on latrine construction to overcome income constraints and rapidly expand coverage. In settings like rural India where open defecation is common, this may result in sub-optimal compliance (use), thereby continuing to leave the population exposed to human excreta. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate latrine coverage and use among 20 villages (447 households, 1933 individuals) in Orissa, India where the Government of India’s Total Sanitation Campaign had been implemented {{at least three years}} previously.

40|$|Background Neglected {{tropical}} diseases (NTDs) predominantly {{occur in}} resource poor settings where they often present a serious public health burden. Sustained global advocacy has been important in raising awareness of NTDs {{and the relatively}} low cost for control of helminthic NTDs using preventive chemotherapy. This enthusiasm was boosted at the London declaration on NTDs in 2012 through commitments by different partners to avail resources required for control of NTDs particularly those that employ preventive chemotherapy as the major intervention strategy. Subsequently, national NTD programmes are responding to these new opportunities by implementing preventive chemotherapy including school-based deworming (SBD). Further, with the availability of increased resources, both financial and pharma, the optimal strategies for implementing preventive chemotherapy in highly endemic settings are under debate and this paper goes some way to addressing this issue in a specific setting in coastal Kenya. Methods We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study in Matuga District, Kwale County, Kenya to evaluate the effect of school-based co-administration of praziquantel and albendazole against urogenital schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections. A total of 1022 school children in 5 study schools were tested for the infections in urine and stool samples during a baseline survey in September 2009. The presence of Schistosoma haematobium infection {{was determined by the}} urine filtration method while STH infections were determined by Kato-Katz technique. Results Urogenital schistosomiasis and hookworm infection were the major parasitic infections among the children in the study area. There was significant decrease in both prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection after treatment but varying levels of rebound were observed during the period between the treatments. The school-based treatment, however, did not have any significant effect on both the prevalence and intensity of hookworm infection. Conclusions Once per year SBD programmes may not be adequate for controlling hookworm infection and urogenital schistosomiasis in rural areas of Kwale County. There is a need to consider expanded preventive chemotherapy strategies that will allow inclusion of the adult populations. Community-based health education campaigns focusing on increasing <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> ownership and use, as a complementary measure to control STH and urogenital schistosomiasis in similar settings, may also be useful...|$|E

The zonal-level prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura was 9. 9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 7. 2 - 12. 7 %), 9. 7 % (5. 9 - 13. 4 %), and 2. 6 % (1. 6 - 3. 7 %), respectively. The prevalence of S. mansoni was 2. 9 % (95 % CI 0. 2 - 5. 5 %) but infection was highly focal (range by community from 0 - 52. 4 %). The prevalence {{of any of these}} helminth infections was 24. 2 % (95 % CI 17. 6 - 30. 9 %) compared to 48. 5 % as found in a previous study in 1995 using the Kato-Katz technique. The pathogenic intestinal protozoa Giardia intestinalis and Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar were found in 23. 0 % (95 % CI 20. 3 - 25. 6 %) and 11. 1 % (95 % CI 8. 9 - 13. 2 %) of the surveyed children, respectively. We found statistically significant increases in <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> ownership, use of an improved water source, access to water, and face washing behavior over the past 7 years.; Improvements in hygiene and sanitation promoted both by the SAFE strategy for trachoma and health extension program combined with preventive chemotherapy during enhanced outreach services are plausible explanations fo the changing patterns of intestinal parasite prevalence.

40|$|Trachoma control {{programs}} utilize mass azithromycin distributions {{to treat}} ocular Chlamydia trachomatis {{as part of}} an effort to eliminate this disease world-wide. But it remains unclear what the community-level risk factors are for infection. This cluster-randomized, controlled trial entered 48 randomly selected communities in a 2 × 2 factorial design evaluating the effect of different treatment frequencies and treatment coverage levels. A pretreatment census and examination established the prevalence of risk factors for clinical trachoma and ocular chlamydia infection including years of education of household head, distance to primary water source, presence of <b>household</b> <b>latrine,</b> and facial cleanliness (ocular discharge, nasal discharge, and presence of facial flies). Univariate and multivariate associations were tested using linear regression and Bayes model averaging. There were a total of 24, 536 participants (4, 484 children aged 0 - 5 years) in 6, 235 households in the study. Before treatment in May to July 2010, the community-level prevalence of active trachoma (TF or TI utilizing the World Health Organization [WHO] grading system) was 26. 0 % (95 % CI: 21. 9 % to 30. 0 %) and the mean community-level prevalence of chlamydia infection by Amplicor PCR was 20. 7 % (95 % CI: 16. 5 % to 24. 9 %) in children aged 0 - 5 years. Univariate analysis showed that nasal discharge (0. 29, 95 % CI: 0. 04 to 0. 54; P =  0. 03), presence of flies on the face (0. 40, 95 % CI: 0. 17 to 0. 64; P =  0. 001), and years of formal education completed by the head of household (0. 07, 95 % CI: 0. 07 to 0. 13; P =  0. 03) were independent risk factors for chlamydia infection. In multivariate analysis, facial flies (0. 26, 95 % CI: 0. 02 to 0. 49; P =  0. 03) and years of formal education completed by the head of household (0. 06, 95 % CI: 0. 008 to 0. 11; P =  0. 02) were associated risk factors for ocular chlamydial infection. We have found that the presence of facial flies and years of education of the head of the household are risk factors for chlamydia infection when the analysis is done at the community level.

The water distribution network will be extended to serve 400,000 more people (40,000 connections) in Addis Ababa and 500,000 more people (50,000 connections) in the five secondary cities. The project will also promote awareness of water conservation among customers. The project will also reduce water losses: In Addis Ababa out of the 50 liters per capita per day produced, only 35 reached consumers due to water losses. In the remaining cities only 20 of the 30 liters produced reached consumers.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 We {{sought to}} better {{understand}} the relationship between household-to-road travel time with improved <b>household</b> <b>latrines</b> in villages in the Kalimpong Subdivision of the Darjeeling District. BACKGROUND The absence of improved sanitation facilities is the sixth leading risk factor for death in {{children under the age of}} 5 worldwide (Insitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 2013). There is little published about the health-supporting infrastructure in the Darjeeling District while its mountainous, isolating terrain makes its 1. 6 million people (Census of India 2011) vulnerable to health risks (Huddleston, Ataman and d'Ostiani 2003). METHODS This was a secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional household survey of Kalimpong Blocks I and II of the Darjeeling District of West Bengal, India. At both the household and the village level we measured the association of perceived travel time from households to a road with the presence of a <b>household</b> improved <b>latrine.</b> RESULTS After adjusting for a socioeconomic proxy, the person/room index, we found that an increase of one hour in the travel time to road results in a 21 % (95 % CI: 36 %, 7 %) increase in the odds of a household having an unimproved sanitation system. CONCLUSION In this study we found that the nearer a household is to the road, the more likely it is to have an improved toilet. This relationship remains significant when we account for crowding, a socio-economic proxy. DISCUSSION Although perceived nearness to road is associated with the increased presence of household sanitation systems, the development of roads as an isolated response to sanitation may be problematic. Due to the introduction of new risk exposures that are coupled with the development of roads it may be necessary to develop roads in conjunction with other infrastructures that support healthy behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{impressive}} progress {{over the last}} two decades in which millions of people worldwide have gained first time access to improved water and sanitation infrastructure, the reality for many is that shortly after infrastructure construction the actual service received by users slips back to unacceptably low levels. However, due to inadequate research and inconsistencies with how data and cost data has been collected and reported, very little is known of the necessary levels of expenditure required to sustain an acceptable (so called “basic”) water and sanitation service and this inhibits effective financial planning for households, communities, governments and donors alike. This thesis sought to provide a better understanding of what has historically been spent to provide different levels of water and sanitation services as a means to better understand the necessary expenditure required. Empirical findings are based on a large data sample of nearly 2, 000 water points, over 4, 000 latrines, and over 12, 000 household surveys, which have been collected as part of three research projects (WASHCost, Triple-S, and WASHCost Sierra Leone), across five country research areas (Andhra Pradesh (India), Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone). Findings for water supply systems show that the combination of high capital investments of: $ 19 and $ 69 per person for community point sources and $ 33 – $ 216 per person for piped systems; and low recurrent expenditures of: $ 0. 06 - $ 0. 37 per person per year for point sources and $ 0. 58 - $ 7. 87 per person per year for piped systems; results in less than half of users receiving a “basic” level of service. Evidence based estimates of the required expenditure for acceptable services are found to be far greater than the “effective demand” expressed in terms of the willingness to pay of service users and national government for these services. Findings for sanitation show that constructing a <b>household</b> <b>latrine</b> that achieves “basic” service standards requires a financial investment of at least $ 40 that is likely to be an unaffordable barrier for many households in lower income countries. In addition the costs and affordability of periodic pit emptying remains a concern. Ultimately this research suggests that if international standard of improved water and sanitation services are to be sustained in rural areas, the international sector will likely have to provide additional investments to meet a significant proportion of the recurrent costs of delivering these services...|$|E
50|$|In {{communities}} {{with fewer than}} 5,000 inhabitants, water supply systems are owned and managed by the respective community on a demand-driven basis. According to the NCWSP, these systems do not receive any cross-subsidies and 5% of investment costs are paid by District Assemblies. Communities and in rural areas and small towns elect gender-balanced water and sanitation boards consisting of volunteers, including one or two village-based caretakers who received special training in repair and maintenance. Communities can contract private companies or NGOs to provide technical assistance, goods, or services. Local companies drill boreholes and build hand-dug wells, and local artisans are used to provide <b>household</b> <b>latrines.</b> Maintenance units of CWSA have been privatized and the regional companies created through this process now perform major repairs on behalf of District Assemblies. Minor repairs are carried out by area mechanics. The communities' water and sanitation boards receive technical assistance by District Water and Sanitation Teams (DWST), ideally consisting of an engineer, a hygiene expert, and a community mobilizer. However, in some districts these teams are so weak that the regional teams of CWSA resort to providing direct assistance to local water and sanitation boards.|$|R
40|$|Background: Poor {{sanitation}} {{is thought}} to be a major cause of enteric infections among young children. However, there are no previously published randomized trials to measure the health impacts of large-scale sanitation programs. India’s Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) is one such program that seeks to end the practice of open defecation by changing social norms and behaviors, and providing technical support and financial subsidies. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the effect of the TSC implemented with capacity building support from the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program in Madhya Pradesh on availability of individual <b>household</b> <b>latrines</b> (IHLs), defecation behaviors, and child health (diarrhea, highly credible gastrointestinal illness [HCGI], parasitic infections, anemia, growth). Methods and Findings:We conducted a cluster-randomized, controlled trial in 80 rural villages. Field staff collected baseline measures of sanitation conditions, behaviors, and child health (May–July 2009), and revisited households 21 months later (February–April 2011) after the program was delivered. The study enrolled a random sample of 5, 209 children, 5 years old from 3, 039 households that had at least one child, 24 months at the beginning of the study. A random subsample of 1, 150 children, 24 months at enrollment were tested for soil transmitted helminth and protozoan infections in stool.

This case study describes the roles and responsibilities of women in TSC implemented in Yavatmal. The study was conducted in four Nirmal Gram Villages in December 2006. Quantitative (house to house survey), qualitative (Focus group discussions) and participatory rapid appraisal technique (transect walks) were used to conduct the study. Women had played important roles as beneficiaries, targets and resources for the campaign. The women described benefits at individual, family and community level. Only 18 out of the 55 Women Latrine Complexes were functional, a majority of which were noted to be of poor quality and lacking in maintenance and cleanliness. The community and administration acknowledged the vital role of women in achieving the goals of TSC. Women were considered to be important target groups in IEC and training activities Women performed varied roles as fund raisers, motivators, initiators, surveillance workers and implementers. In the post TSC phase women were mainly responsible for the cleanliness and maintenance of the <b>household</b> <b>latrines.</b> After achieving the goal of open defaecation free villages, women in only one village were involved in some development activities.

40|$|In Indonesia diarrheal {{diseases}} {{continue to}} be a public health problem. The diarrhea control program has been instituted, including the provision of drinking water and <b>household</b> <b>latrines</b> to reduce the prevalence and incidence of diarrhea diseases, and the introduction of oral rehydration to prevent severe dehydration which might be fatal. Results of the Demographic and Health Surveys (1991, 1994 and 1997), reported that the prevalence (10 %) and incidence (7 %) of diarrheal diseases among children under 5 years of age slightly varied in the three survey periods. The average duration of diarrhea was 3. 1 days, which was slightly longer among infants than children aged 12 - 59 months. Mothers with children suffering from diarrhea had less demand for medical treatment than those with children suffering from cough with fast-breathing or fever. More than 90 % women in the survey had ever heard or seen of the oral rehydration salt packets (ORS packets), but only 68 % had ever used the ORSpackets to treat diarrhea. In practice, among mothers having children with diarrhea 48 % were giving ORS solution, and only 15 % were not giving any additional fluids, except young infants under 6 months among whom 54 % were not given any additional fluids, as they still received the same amount of breast milk and some were more frequently breastfed. </p...|$|R
