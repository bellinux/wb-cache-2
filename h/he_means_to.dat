5|$|Khan {{is placed}} under guard in quarters. McGivers {{is sent to}} brief him on current events. Taking {{advantage}} of McGivers' attraction towards him, Khan tells her <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> rule mankind again and needs her help to take over Enterprise. Reluctantly, she agrees, beaming Khan to Botany Bay, where he revives {{the rest of his}} people. They return to Enterprise and assume control of the ship. Khan throws Kirk into a decompression tank, and threatens to slowly suffocate him unless Kirk's command crew agree to follow Khan. Having a change of heart, McGivers frees Kirk from the chamber. Kirk and Spock vent anesthetic gas throughout the entire ship to disable Khan and his cohorts. Khan escapes the gas and heads to Engineering, where he attempts to destroy Enterprise, but Kirk confronts him and a brawl ensues. Though outmatched by Khan's superior strength, Kirk pulls an odd rod-like tool (never seen before or since, in this episode or the entire series) from a wall and uses it as a club to knock the superman unconscious.|$|E

25|$|Robertson told ministers (30 May) that “Haig {{had no idea}} of {{any attempt}} to break through the German lines. It would only be a move to (rescue) the French”, {{although}} he was probably not aware of Haig’s insistence, overruling Rawlinson’s earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and “fighting the enemy in the open”. Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig “does not mean to knock his head against a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> stop and consolidate and try somewhere else”.|$|E

25|$|Inspector Davies and Poirot meet back at Fernley. The call to Dr. Sheppard {{has been}} traced. It {{was made from}} the local railway station, {{a few minutes before}} the late-night express train for Liverpool left. He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that they will find only the dead man's prints on the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers seen in the past week – the only one he can recall was a young representative from a firm of Dictaphone manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found a scrap of starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that it came from the dress of Bourne who is {{the only person in the}} house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> find the truth.|$|E
500|$|As a {{free agent}} after the 2005 season, Hoffman re-signed with the Padres after {{negotiating}} with the Cleveland Indians. Hoffman signed a $13.5 million, two-year contract that included a club option for 2008. [...] "It came down to me making a decision for my family and not disrupting what we have going on", said Hoffman. [...] "This is probably the most significant signing that I've had", said then-Padres general manager Kevin Towers. [...] "This guy is the face of our organization.

500|$|The Times {{refused to}} print the {{advertisement}} from the Pig-faced Lady's would-be suitor, and donated his £1 fee to The Marine Society. An anonymous letter-writer to the Times continued the comparison with Joanna Southcott, who had claimed {{that she would}} give birth to the Messiah in October 1814, speculating that [...] "the present miss piggy" [...] was perhaps Southcott's child, [...] "brought into {{the world in a}} state of complete puberty". The letter-writer also ridiculed the [...] "swinish Lothario" [...] who hoped to marry the Pig-faced Lady, suggesting that [...] "if <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> have her, he must woo her in grunts".|$|E

500|$|Klaatu {{meets with}} another alien, Mr. Wu, {{who has lived}} on Earth for 70 years. Wu tells Klaatu that he has found the human race to be destructive, {{stubborn}} and unwilling to change, which matches Klaatu's experiences. Klaatu orders the smaller spheres to collect specimens of animal species, to preserve them for later reintroduction to the Earth. He clarifies for Helen that <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> save the Earth from destruction by humankind. [...] When a policeman attempts to take them into custody, Klaatu kills him then promptly revives the officer, telling Helen and Jacob that he did this to simply disarm an obstacle to his mission.|$|E
500|$|Toscanini, Beecham {{and many}} others {{regarded}} Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world. Even orchestral musicians gave him credit: the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him, [...] "He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of. You have only to see {{the eyes of a}} choral society screwing into him like hundreds of gimlets to understand what <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> them." [...] However, another of Sargent's colleagues, Sir Adrian Boult, said of him, [...] "e was a great all-rounder but never developed his potentialities, which were enormous, simply because he didn't think hard enough about music – he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation. He was too interested in other things, and not single-minded enough about music." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its numerous memorials and monuments which pay homage to famous Americans, Washington, D.C. is home to many artworks honoring foreign heroes. Examples in Dupont Circle include memorials honoring Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi of India, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, and Lajos Kossuth of Hungary. [...] The idea of a U.S. monument honoring Shevchenko began with the American Shevchenko Society, founded in 1898. [...] Although the group's efforts never came to fruition, Ukrainian Americans continued to pursue the goal. [...] A turning point was when Professor Ivan Dubrovsky wrote an article in Svoboda titled [...] "In Favor of a Shevchenko Monument in Washington, D.C.", asking for support from the Shevchenko Scientific Society and Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA). [...] Thousands of Ukrainian Americans sent letters to members of Congress while Lev Dobriansky, a Ukrainian American economist and anti-communism activist, became a prominent advocate and lobbyist for erecting a monument honoring Shevchenko. [...] The activists eventually gained the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Representative Alvin Morell Bentley of Michigan. [...] Javits said [...] "Taras Shevchenko was a bard of freedom...It is fitting that the statue of such a national hero, who taught the American ideals of patriotism and service to man, should stand {{in the capital of}} the U.S." [...] and Bentley stated, [...] "In erecting a statue of Taras Shevchenko in Washington the United States will give full expression to its understanding and appreciation of Taras Shevchenko and all that <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> the brave and noble Ukrainian people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robertson's rival Wilson {{appears to}} have held him in similar social disdain. Early in Robertson's tenure as Commandant at Staff College (20 December 1910), he did not speak to Wilson when he visited Staff College with the CIGS Nicholson, causing his {{predecessor}} to complain to Nicholson about his [...] "most rude & unpardonable behaviour". After Robertson had again not spoken to him at a Staff College point-to-point (25 March 1911), Wilson wrote that he was [...] "an ill-mannered swine, though I don't think <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be rude". Wilson wrote (in 1915) [...] "He is secretive &, like all underbreds, suspicious; also his manners are somewhat repugnant" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "a slippery old boy" [...] and [...] "It is d(amnable?) to work with a man who is not a gentleman. The moment the strain comes so does the hairy heel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arthur fusses {{with his}} costume and Cope objects to having ladies' {{garments}} about their room, though [...] "not speaking his essential thought."(290) In performance, Arthur's successful acting en travesti fails to please: [...] "he was feminine, even overfeminine, throughout."(291) When Randolph recounts his reactions to Joe, who refers to Randolph's [...] "caring" [...] for Cope, Randolph counters {{that it was}} just [...] "a passing amitié,"(292) using a French word because he is unsure what <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> say. It transpires that immediately following the performance Arthur, remaining in character, made unspecified advances to a fellow actor in a male role, for which he received a bruise on his forehead, lost his role, and was expelled from the University. The narrator comments: [...] "He had carried things too far. Well, such are the risks run by the sincere, self-revealing artist."(294) Cope finds the social atmosphere has turned chilly, Randolph declines Cope's request for help in finding Arthur new employment, and Arthur returns to Winnebago before the term ends.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opening}} scene, Abraham prays to God, thanking Him for His various blessings, {{most of all}} his {{favourite}} son, Isaac. Next, God reveals to an angel that he will test Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice Isaac. The angel conveys this instruction to Abraham who, though he is distraught, agrees to comply with it. Abraham takes Isaac {{to the place of}} sacrifice, his grief made all the greater by Isaac (not yet knowing he is the [...] "qweke best" [...] intended for sacrifice) being eager to aid his father. When Abraham reveals that <b>he</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> kill him, Isaac at first pleads for his life. However, when he learns that it is God's will that he should die, Isaac acquiesces in his death, even urging his father not to tarry over the deed. Abraham binds Isaac so that he will not deflect his father's sword but when he draws that sword and prepares to strike, the angel appears and takes it out of his hand. The angel reveals that God is pleased with Abraham's obedience and that Isaac need not be sacrificed after all. Leaving them with a ram, the angel departs. As they make the offering, God appears above (the medieval custom was to have God act at a higher level than other characters) and promises them that “for thys dede | I schall mvltyplye yowres botheres [...] sede | As thyke as sterres be in the skye”. In an epilogue a doctor, a stock figure in medieval drama, appears and points the moral that we should obey God's commandments and not rail against the designs God has for us.|$|E
