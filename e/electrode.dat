5|$|Liquid {{mercury is}} a part of popular {{secondary}} reference <b>electrode</b> (called the calomel <b>electrode)</b> in electrochemistry {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen <b>electrode.</b> The calomel <b>electrode</b> is used to work out the <b>electrode</b> potential of half cells. Last, but not least, the triple point of mercury, −38.8344°C, is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the International Temperature Scale (ITS-90).|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} polarity of the SMAW system depends primarily {{upon the}} <b>electrode</b> being {{used and the}} desired properties of the weld. Direct current with a negatively charged <b>electrode</b> (DCEN) causes heat to build up on the <b>electrode,</b> increasing the <b>electrode</b> melting rate and decreasing {{the depth of the}} weld. Reversing the polarity so that the <b>electrode</b> is positively charged (DCEP) and the workpiece is negatively charged increases the weld penetration. With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an even heat distribution and providing a balance between <b>electrode</b> melting rate and penetration.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the <b>electrode</b> and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the <b>electrode</b> melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the <b>electrode</b> disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
40|$|The {{model of}} thin film based {{biosensor}} {{is built based on}} COMSOL {{in order to}} simulate and optimize the electronic characteristic of dipolar <b>electrodes</b> system and tetrapolar <b>electrodes</b> system. Zones of negative sensitivity exist between current carrying <b>electrodes</b> and voltage measuring <b>electrodes</b> while the polarization occurs at the edges of <b>electrodes.</b> By changing the parameters embracing distance between <b>electrodes,</b> thickness of <b>electrodes,</b> and the width of inner <b>electrodes</b> (for tetrapolar <b>electrodes</b> system only), the polarization and zones of negative sensitivity can be receded to some extent, which improves the system’s performance. Tetrapolar <b>electrodes</b> system has less polarization but more negative-sensitivity zones compared to dipolar <b>electrodes</b> system and different setups response differently to these changing parameters...|$|R
50|$|If the <b>electrodes</b> are not {{completely}} baked, {{there is a risk}} of breakage, especially with long <b>electrodes.</b> Söderberg <b>electrodes</b> have a higher proportion of organic impurities when compared to the pre-baked <b>electrodes.</b> Thus, Söderberg electrode-equipped furnaces produce yellow phosphorus and pre-baked <b>electrodes</b> produce white phosphorus.|$|R

5|$|Capacitive discharge: {{this is a}} nonthermal plasma {{generated}} by the application of RF power (e.g., 13.56MHz) to one powered <b>electrode,</b> with a grounded <b>electrode</b> held at a small separation distance {{on the order of}} 1cm. Such discharges are commonly stabilized using a noble gas such as helium or argon.|$|E
5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the <b>electrode,</b> tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of <b>electrode</b> or increasing the <b>electrode</b> diameter. In addition, if the <b>electrode</b> is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the <b>electrode</b> be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E
5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} {{equipment}} typically consists of a constant current welding power supply and an <b>electrode,</b> with an <b>electrode</b> holder, a 'ground' clamp, and welding cables (also known as welding leads) connecting the two.|$|E
50|$|Silver-containing single-junction pH <b>electrodes</b> (e.g., silver {{chloride}} <b>electrodes)</b> are incompatible with tris since an Ag-tris precipitate forms which clogs the junction.

5|$|Sloped, {{vertical}} or upside-down welding {{requires more}} operator skill, and often necessitates {{the use of}} an <b>electrode</b> that solidifies quickly to prevent the molten metal from flowing out of the weld pool. However, this generally means that the <b>electrode</b> melts less quickly, thus increasing the time required to lay the weld.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten <b>electrode</b> must be held firmly {{in the center of}} the torch with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the <b>electrode</b> provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten <b>electrode</b> they hold. The body of the torch is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} <b>electrode</b> holder is a semiautomatic {{air-cooled}} holder. Compressed air circulates {{through it to}} maintain moderate temperatures.

40|$|We {{describe}} a sensitive plant monitoring system by {{the detection of}} the bioelectric potentials in plants with boron-doped diamond (BDD) <b>electrodes.</b> For sensor <b>electrodes,</b> we used commercially available BDD, Ag, and Pt plate <b>electrodes.</b> We tested this approach on a hybrid species in the genus Opuntia (potted) and three different trees (ground-planted) at different places in Japan. For the Opuntia, we artificially induced bioelectric potential changes by the surface potential using the fingers. We detected substantial changes in bioelectric potentials through all <b>electrodes</b> during finger touches {{on the surface of}} potted Opuntia hybrid plants, although the BDD <b>electrodes</b> were several times more sensitive to bioelectric potential change compared to the other <b>electrodes.</b> Similarly for ground-planted trees, we found that both BDD and Pt <b>electrodes</b> detected bioelectric potential change induced by changing environmental factors (temperature and humidity) for months without replacing/removing/changing <b>electrodes,</b> BDD <b>electrodes</b> were 5 – 10 times more sensitive in this detection than Pt <b>electrodes.</b> Given these results, we conclude that BDD <b>electrodes</b> on live plant tissue were able to consistently detect bioelectrical potential changes in plants...|$|R

5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable <b>electrode</b> processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the <b>electrode</b> can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the <b>electrode</b> affects weld properties. If the <b>electrode</b> is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged <b>electrode</b> results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable <b>electrode</b> processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the <b>electrode</b> only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged <b>electrode</b> causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged <b>electrode</b> makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} <b>electrode</b> and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten <b>electrode</b> from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative <b>electrode)</b> to reverse polarity (positive <b>electrode).</b> To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E

The electrochemical performance of the np-Au <b>electrodes</b> was measured by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We have fabricated np-Au <b>electrodes</b> with pore sizes between 10 nm and 60 nm, {{directly related to the}} Ag:Au ratio. The electrochemical results reveal that np-Au <b>electrodes</b> have much lower impedance than the conventional Au <b>electrodes,</b> due to the significantly higher surface area to volume ratio of np-Au. The np-Au <b>electrodes</b> made from Ag 66 Au 34 and Ag 60 Au 40 show more than 10 -fold magnitude reduction in impedance compared to conventional Au <b>electrodes.</b> These results show that np-Au <b>electrodes</b> have a great potential for electrochemical applications...|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the <b>electrode,</b> the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten <b>electrode</b> to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E

In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies.

5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the <b>electrode</b> tends to build up {{on the end of the}} <b>electrode,</b> often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the <b>electrode</b> itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E
