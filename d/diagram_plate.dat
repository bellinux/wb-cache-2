6000|$|The ridges, as {{was shown}} in the <b>diagram</b> (<b>Plate</b> 3) of the palm of the hand, run athwart the fingers in rudely {{parallel}} lines {{up to the last}} joint, and {{if it were not for}} the finger-nail, would apparently continue parallel up to the extreme finger-tip. But the presence of the nail disturbs their parallelism and squeezes them downwards on both sides of the finger. (See Fig. 8, ~2~.) Consequently, the ridges that run close to the tip are greatly arched, those that successively follow are gradually less arched until, in some cases, all signs of the arch disappear at about the level of the first joint (Fig. 8, ~1~). Usually, however, this gradual transition from an arch to a straight line fails to be carried out, causing a break in the orderly sequence, and a consequent interspace (Fig. 8, ~2~). The topmost boundary of the interspace is formed by the lowermost arch, and its lowermost boundary by the topmost straight ridge. But an equally large number of ducts exist within the interspace, as are to be found in adjacent areas of equal size, whose mouths require to be supported and connected. This is effected by the interpolation of an independent system of ridges arranged in loops (Fig. 8, ~3~; also Plate 5, Fig. 9, a, f), or in scrolls (Fig. 8, ~4~; also Fig. 9, g, h), and this interpolated system forms the [...] "pattern." [...] Now the existence of an interspace implies the divergence of two previously adjacent ridges (Fig. 8, ~2~), in order to embrace it. Just in front of the place where the divergence begins, and before the sweep of the pattern is reached, there are usually one or more very short cross-ridges. Their effect is to complete the enclosure of the minute triangular plot in question. Where there is a plot on both sides of the finger, the line that connects them (Fig. 8, ~4~) serves as a base line whereby the pattern may be oriented, and the position of any point roughly charted. Where there is a plot on only one side of the finger (Fig. 8, ~3~), the pattern has almost necessarily an axis, which serves for orientation, and the pattern can still be charted, though on a different principle, by dropping a perpendicular from the plot on to the axis, in the way there shown.|$|E
60|$|The {{prints in}} the two plates cover the {{intervals}} from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to early manhood, from manhood to {{about the age of}} 60, and another set--that of Sir W. G.--covers the interval from 67 to 80. This is clearly expressed by the <b>diagram</b> (<b>Plate</b> 15, Fig. 23). As there is no sign, except in one case, of change during any one of these four intervals, which together almost wholly cover the ordinary life of man, we are justified in inferring that between birth and death there is absolutely no change in, say, 699 out of 700 of the numerous characteristics in the markings of the fingers of the same person, such as can be impressed by them whenever it is desirable to do so. Neither can there be any change after death, up to the time when the skin perishes through decomposition; for example, the marks on the fingers of many Egyptian mummies, and on the paws of stuffed monkeys, still remain legible. Very good evidence and careful inquiry is thus seen to justify the popular idea of the persistence of finger markings, that has hitherto been too rashly jumped at, and which wrongly ascribed the persistence to the general appearance of the pattern, rather than to the minutiæ it contains. There appear to be no external bodily characteristics, other than deep scars and tattoo marks, comparable in their persistence to these markings, whether they be on the finger, on other parts of the palmar surface of the hand, or on the sole of the foot. At the same time they are out of all proportion more numerous than any other measurable features; about thirty-five of them are situated on the bulb of each of the ten digits, in addition to more than 100 on the ball of the thumb, which has not one-fifth of the superficies {{of the rest of the}} palmar surface. The total number of points suitable for comparison on the two hands must therefore be not less than one thousand and nearer to two; an estimate which I verified by a rough count on my own hand; similarly in respect to the feet. The dimensions of the limbs and body alter in the course of growth and decay; the colour, quantity, and quality of the hair, the tint and quality of the skin, the number and set of the teeth, the expression of the features, the gestures, the handwriting, even the eye-colour, change after many years. There seems no persistence in the visible parts of the body, except in these minute and hitherto too much disregarded ridges.|$|E

By phase contrast observations of' the living object it was found, that 6 to 7 hours after irradiation with 2400 R, the number of functionally active mitochondria decreased; subsequently there appeared in the cytoplasm numerous small spherical pre-mitochondria which soon increased in number and develop into mitochondria of normal size and structure. The results with the electron microscope are illustrated in the <b>diagram</b> (<b>Plate</b> 4). The endoplasmic reticulum produces buds which must be considered as young pre-mitochondria (a). While they are still attached to the reticular system (b$_{ 1 }$) or after detaching from the endoplasmicreticulum (b$_{ 2 }$) they begin to establish an interior membrane. Later on, in limited areas, the spherical pre-mitochondria show the typical arrangement of cristae mitochondriales (c) and simultanously they increase in length (d). Therewith the pre-mitochondria assume a club-shaped form (e) the spherical portion of which is filled with a dense ground-substance. This ground-substance obviously produces the material for the further formation of cristae mitochondriales which accompanies the outgrowth of the mitochondrial tube. Thus the pre-mitochondria transform into the definitive mitochondria (f) ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an analytical {{approach to the}} optical design of four-mirror anastigmatic optical systems. In all cases investigated here the object is at infinity. In the introduction the field of reflecting, or "catoptric", optical system design is discussed and given some historical context. The concept of the "simplest possible reflecting anastigmat" is raised in connection with <b>Plate</b> <b>Diagram</b> analysis. It is shown that four-plate systems are in general the simplest possible anastigmats, and that four-plate systems comprised of four spherical mirrors are the last family of "simplest possible reflecting anastigmats" for which the complete solution set remains unknown. In chapter 2 third-order aberration coefficients in wavefront measure are derived {{in a form that}} is particularly suitable for <b>Plate</b> <b>Diagram</b> analysis. These coefficients are subsequently used to describe the <b>Plate</b> <b>Diagram,</b> and to detail the application of the <b>Plate</b> <b>Diagram</b> to the survey of all possible solutions for four-spherical-mirror anastigmats. The <b>Plate</b> <b>Diagram</b> technique is also generalized to investigate its use as an optical design tool. In the example given a generalized <b>Plate</b> <b>Diagram</b> approach is used to determine solutions for four-mirror anastigmats with a prescribed first-order layout and a minimum number of conicoids. In chapter 3 results are presented for the survey of four-spherical-mirror anastigmats in which all elements are required to be smaller than the primary mirror. Two novel families of four-spherical-mirror anastigmats are presented and these are shown to be the only examples of four-spherical-mirror systems that exist under the given constraints. Chapter 4 gives an example of the application of <b>Plate</b> <b>Diagram</b> analysis to the design of an anastigmatic system with a useful first-order layout and a minimum number of conicoid mirrors. It is shown that systems with useful first-order layouts and only one conicoid mirror can be obtained using this method. In chapter 5 results are presented of the survey of all remaining four-spherical-mirror anastigmatic systems: that is systems in which elements are allowed to exceed the diameter of the entrance pupil, which includes systems with concave and convex primary mirrors. A wide variety of solutions are presented and classified according to both the underlying geometry of the solutions and the first-order layouts. Of these systems only one has been reported in previously published literature. The results presented in this thesis complete the set of "four-plate" reflecting anastigmats, and it can now be said that all possible solutions for four-spherical-mirror anastigmatic systems have been determined...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves 121 - 126 Adjacent to {{and south of the}} village of Puerto Calamajue, southeastern Baja California, Mexico, is approximately 40 square km of complexly deformed low-grade metamorphosed limestone, volcanic rocks, mudstone, siltstone, quartz arenite, marble, greenstone, slate, phyllite, quartzite and chert. The stratigraphic section cannot be accurately measured because of the local attenuation and repetition. The exposed thickness {{in the northern part of}} the area averages 500 m. Premetamorphic lithologies of the northern part are thinly bedded lime mudstone, thin and thickly bedded coarse-grained bioclastic packstone, black chert, shale, quartz arenite, and hornblende andesite. Separated by a small tonalite pluton from the northern area, the southern area has an exposed thickness of nearly 1 km. Within this is predominately thinly layered metamorphosed lime mudstone, coarse-grained bioclastic packstone, and thick boulder and cobble conglomerates. Also present is minor chert and phyllite. Interpretation of the depositional environments indicates an anoxic slope-to-basin outboard of a distally steepened carbonate ramp. The coexistence of a hornblende andesite sill and abundant well-rounded quartz grains (especially in the quartz arenite) indicates arc-type volcanics proximal to the continental edge. Conodont fragments from both areas as well as favositid corals from the southern area indicate a medial Paleozoic age for the metasediments. Tentative age and lithologic correlations indicate relationships to the Sierra las Pintas in the Baja California, and areas in south-central Sonora, northeastern Sinaloa, and the western United States. At least two periods of penetrative deformation have affected the area. The earliest event was a compression which created pervasive small-scale tight isoclinal folding and shearing, as well as large-scale recumbant folds. The axes of these folds dip gently to the north-northeast, and in the current position verge to the east and southeast. The second event resulted in a large synform of which only the western limb is preserved. The axis of this fold dips steeply to the east and caused attenuation of as much as 75...|$|R

Bibliography on leaves [69]- 72 Reconnaissance geologic mapping has generated new information on the stratigraphy, paleontology, and structure of the rocks near Asunci??n Bay and adjacent regions, Baja California, Mexico. Emphasis is placed on the Cenozoic rock formations and fossils. Rocks of the Asunci??n Bay region range from Early (?) Jurassic ultramafic rocks to well-preserved Late Pliocene to Pleistocene marine terraces. Middle Jurassic basement rock comprises {{a large portion of the}} outcrop within the study area; the headlands of Punta San Pablo, San Roque, and Asunci??n and the Sierra de Vizca??no consist of tonalite, mafic-ultramafic rocks, and effusive volcanic rocks of basaltic and andesitic composition. Potassium/argon age determinations indicate the tonalite is Middle to Late Jurassic in age (154. 1 ?? 1 m. y.). The volcanic rocks of the basement terrane may be genetically related to the plutonic rocks and possibly were generated during subduction of the oceanic crust beneath the continental margin. The Valle Formation of Late Cretaceous age, consists of sandstones, siltstones, and conglomerates resting unconformably on an irregular basement terrane. The basal beds are generally conglomeratic dolomitic biosparrudites containing abundant fragments of shallow-water organisms. The conglomerate is dominated by rhyolite porphyry clasts possibly derived from the Alisitos island-arc of Aptian-Albian age. The Cretaceous rocks are unconformably overlain by the Tortugas Formation of Middle to Late Miocene age. The Tortugas Formation consists of volcaniclastic sandstones, bentonites and siliceous shales. The Miocene strata are richly fossiliferous and contain a diverse assemblage of mega-invertebrates, marine mammalian remains, sharks teeth, and foraminifera. The Tortugas Formation is overlain unconformably by the Almejas Formation of Middle to Late Pliocene age. Fossil bivalves are abundant in some horizons of the Almejas Formation. Based on faunal similarities, the Almejas Formation is correlated with the San Diego Formation of Alta California. A major portion of the study area is covered by thin, slightly west sloping, Late Pliocene to Pleistocene marine terraces. These ancient strand lines occur up to 4 or 5 kilometers inland and form an unbroken sequence stepping down to the present shoreline. Tertiary volcanic rocks of the study area include flood basalts, pyroclastic rock, dikes and sills. Potassium/argon determinations give an age for the flow of Mesa de Auras as 13. 12 ?? 3. 2 m. y.

The objective was to capture the spirit and essence of this subject in a series of six intaglio prints. The theme became more profound with the consideration not only of the superb engineering of the forms but also the influence of birds on human interest and imagination since early times. The project for thesis performance began with several days of quick sketching of the birds at the Los Angeles Children's Zoo. The final designs for the bird series were expressions of the gesture and acti 6 n of these first quick sketches. The purpose was to simplify the basic forms and elements and dramatize the conception. After the layouts for the series had been made, the principal forms were cut from the drawings and rearranged as collages for more vigorous composition. All of the plates were in process {{at the same time and}} all were completed at the same time. A different procedure was used for the first etching of the collage designs on each of four plates and the same procedure on the other two. The basic methods for the first etch were: sugar lift technique, soft ground transfer, Wilhold glue lift, printing ink transfer, and wax crayon etch. After the initial etch on each plate, the steps were identical on all plates. The integration of color was achieved by the use of woodcuts and stencils. A complete analysis of the methods and technical steps is described in the thesis. Photographs of the final prints and procedure <b>diagrams</b> for <b>Plate</b> Number One are included...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares and evaluates various plate finite {{elements}} to analyse the static response of {{thick and thin}} plates subjected to different loading and boundary conditions. Plate elements are based on different assumptions for the displacement distribution along the thickness direction. Classical (Kirchhoff and Reissner-Mindlin), refined (Reddy and Kant), and other higher-order displacement fields are implemented up to fourth-order expansion. The Unified Formulation UF by the first author is used to derive finite element matrices in terms of fundamental nuclei which consist of 3 × 3 arrays. The MITC 4 shear-locking free type formulation {{is used for the}} FE approximation. Accuracy of a given plate element is established in terms of the error vs. thickness-to-length parameter. A significant number of {{finite elements}} for plates are implemented and compared using displacement and stress variables for various plate problems. Reduced models that are able to detect the 3 D solution are built and a Best <b>Plate</b> <b>Diagram</b> (BPD) is introduced to give guidelines for the construction of plate theories based on a given accuracy and number of terms. It is concluded that the UF is a valuable tool to establish, for a given plate problem, the most accurate FE able to furnish results within a certain accuracy range. This allows us to obtain guidelines and recommendations in building refined elements in the bending analysis of plates for various geometries, loadings, and boundary conditions...|$|R

Lanai lies 59 miles {{southeast}} of Honolulu, Oahu, has an area of 141 square miles, and is 3, 370 feet high. (See fig. 1 and pl. 1.) The island produces pineapples and cattle. The surface above about 1, 200 feet is generally covered with lateritic soil, which reaches 50 feet. Below this level the island is partly devoid of vegetation and is strewn with boulders, the result of having been once submerged by the ocean to this depth. Traces of various emerged and submerged shore lines are described, the highest fossiliferous marine deposits being 1, 070 feet above sea level. Lanai is an eroded extinct basaltic volcano built during one period of activity. No secondary eruptions occurred as {{on most of the}} other islands. It has three rift zones and a summit caldera. The summit plateau has resulted from collapse along the northwest rift zone. Elsewhere, there is much evidence of faulting. About 100 faults and 275 dikes were recorded, but they are so close together in places that {{it was not possible to}} show them all on the map. The climate is semitropical, the mean annual temperature of Lanai City, altitude 1, 620 feet, being 68 ° F. Because Lanai lies to the lee of Maui Island, it is dry. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 38 inches on the summit to less than 10 inches on the coast. The windward (northeast) side is carved by streams into deep canyons. Maunalei Gulch has the only perennial stream, and it does not reach the sea. Ground water, the lifeblood of Lanai, is scarce. Lanai City obtains some of its water supply by a tunnel from gravel in Maunalei Gulch. This water apparently rises from the dike complex in this gulch. The rest of the supply comes from a recently constructed shaft tapping the dike complex not far downstream. The total quantity of high-level ground water discharged by springs and tunnels ranges from about 600, 000 gallons a day in wet weather to about 250, 000 gallons a day in dry weather. The basal water, although potable, is fairly high in salt. Several sites are recommended for developing and conserving ground water...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves 108 - 119 El Capitan, located 50 km southeast of Yuma, Arizona, consists of complexly deformed and moderately metamorphosed carbonate, clastic, and volcanic strata, granitic and granodioritic plutonic rocks, and mylonitic plutonic gneiss. The metamorphosed carbonate and clastic rocks can be subdivided into formations correlative with the upper Paleozoic-lower Mesozoic cratona 1 section of the Colorado Plateau, northwestern Arizona. Metamorphosed lithologic equivalents of the Pennsylvanian-Permian Supai Group, Permian Coconino Sandstone, Permian Toroweap and Kaibab Limestones, Triassic Moenkopi Formation, and Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic Aztec Sandstone are present. A sequence of metasedimentary rocks overlying the metamorphosed Aztec Sandstone may be correlative with Jurassic strata on the Colorado Plateau; however, the exact correlation is not understood. The metavolcanic rocks at El Capitan {{are believed to be}} Jurassic in age based on stratigraphic relationships observed within the study area. A Late Jurassic emplacement age for the granodioritic plutonic rocks is suggested from radiometric studies. All of the rocks at El Capitan were deformed and metamorphosed at upper greenschist-lower amphibolite facies subsequent to the emplacement of the plutonic rocks. Deformation was due to top-to-the northeast simple shear, although a component of pure shear may have been present. Deformation resulted in the formation of thrust faults, mylonitic shear zones, large- and smale-scale folds, and a pervasive axial-planar foliation. The age of this deformational event can be bracketed between Middle Jurassic and earliest Late Cretaceous time. Because the cratonic strata at El Capitan appear to be in place relative to Paleozoic-lower Mesozoic depositional trends, it seems probable that the Mojave-Sonora megashear cannot extend across the eastern Mojave Desert, California, but if it exists, must instead be located west of this area. However, this reconstruction creates distinct problems with the definition of the megashear as separating Precambrian terranes whose boundary is well-documented to be 50 km east of El Capitan. Alternately, the Paleozoic hingeline and miogeoclinal belt may swing around the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico unbroken by major left-lateral faults. The Mesozoic deformational history recorded in the rocks at El Capitan appears to be remarkably similar to the deformational history of Mesozoic compressional terranes exposed to the north of this area. The similarities in the style and timing of deformation in these areas could be merely coincidental, but more likely, are related by some large-scale tectonic process...|$|R
