However, these joints have a limited lifespan resulting in failure of the prosthesis {{and the need for}} revision surgery. A number of materials have been introduced recently in an attempt to overcome these problems. Polycarbonate urethane (PU) is a compliant material that can be used as an artificial <b>joint</b> <b>bearing</b> surface which has been developed to mimic the natural synovial joint more accurately by promoting fluid film lubrication. Tribological tests were performed on CoCrMo-on-PU unicondylar knee prostheses to assess their performance in vitro. The wear produced by these components was considerably lower than that found for conventional joints. They also exhibited low friction and operated close to full-fluid film lubrication with viscosities of lubricant similar to those found in patients with arthritis. These tests gave encouraging results for the tribological performance of this material couple for use as an alternative bearing combination...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. Results from a {{research}} program {{to investigate the}} long term effects of through-the-thickness fastener clamp-up force (preload) relaxation {{on the strength of}} mechanically fastened joints for two graphite/thermoplastic composite materials (Dupont's IM 6 /KIII and ICI-Fiberite's IM 8 /APC(HTA)) are summarized and compared with analytical methods. An experimental program was conducted in which 56 mechanically fastened single-shear joints were tested. Phase I static tests established <b>joint</b> <b>bearing</b> strength as a function of clamp-up force for two types of fasteners (protruding head and countersink) with no relaxation of preload. Phase II testing monitored short-term fastener preload relaxation (up to 1, 000 hours), with special bolt force sensor washers. Inservice parameters included were temperature, in-plane loads, and torque. The jOints were tested to failure {{at the end of the}} relaxation time period to determine any subsequent effect on joint strength. Phase I test results indicated that <b>joint</b> <b>bearing</b> strength increased by as much as twenty-eight percent over the clamp-up force range of a Ibs (fingertight) to 3, 500 Ibs for both materials. Fastener head type, material, and temperature also affected the resultant bearing strength. For Phase II, fastener clamp-up force at room temperature (78 °F) relaxed an average of six percent from the initial value during the short-term test period. The relaxation was projected to be as high as fourteen and sixteen percent at 100, 000 hours for HTA and Kill, respectively. The elevated temperature condition (250 °F) significantly increased the relaxation rate with the projected 100, 000 hour relaxation amount being as high as thirty-seven percent for HTA and sixty percent for Kill. Comparison of the Phase II bearing strengths to the Phase I results indicated that portions of the data correlated well, while others did not. It was concluded that relaxation of the clamp-up force over the short-term time period did not significantly lower the bearing strength of either material, however an extended exposure to 250 °F could affect the bearing strength...|$|E

40|$|Which {{intrinsic}} biomaterial parameter governs and, if quantitatively monitored, could {{reveal to}} us the actual lifetime potential of advanced hip <b>joint</b> <b>bearing</b> materials? An answer to this crucial question is searched for in this paper, which identifies ceramic bearings as the most innovative biomaterials in hip arthroplasty.

Besides searching for improvements in the phenomenological response of biomaterials to engineering protocols, hip joint components should also be designed to satisfy precise stability requirements in the stoichiometric behavior of their surfaces when exposed to extreme chemical and micromechanical conditions.

40|$|This {{research}} {{represents a}} fundamental {{study of the}} failure mechanisms observed to occur in fiber reinforced elastomeric bearing surfaces. The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a better fundamental understanding of the complex interactions which lead to the failure of bearing surfaces. This new understanding of the principal failure mechanisms can then be used to design new materials with sufficient longevity for use in total joint replacements or other bearing applications. It is proposed to use elastomeric composites as artificial <b>joint</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces to increase their fluid film lubrication and therefore reduce the number of failures which have been attributed to wear mechanisms related to frictional forces. The fluid generated between the surfaces supports part of the load and prevents direct contact of the bearing surfaces. In order to obtain optimum elastohydrodynamic lubrication, elastomeric materials have been selected based on their static mechanical properties such as modulus of elasticity. However, permanent deformation and failure of both elastomers alone and model elastomeric composites has been observed.

The material properties are required for further development and design studies and have not previously been quantified. Creep indentation experiments were therefore performed on samples of the hydrogel. The biphasic model developed by Mow and co-workers (Mak et al., 1987; Mow et al., 1989 a) was used to curve-fit the experimental data to theoretical solutions in order to extract the three intrinsic biphasic material properties of the hydrogel (aggregate modulus, HA, Poisson's ratio, Vs, and permeability, k). Ranges of material properties were determined: aggregate modulus was calculated to be between 18. 4 and 27. 5 MPa, Poisson's ratio 0. 0 - 0. 307, and permeability 0. 012 - 7. 27 x 10 (- 17) m 4 /Ns. The hydrogel thus had a higher aggregate modulus than values published for natural normal articular cartilage, the Poisson's ratios were similar to articular cartilage, and finally the hydrogel was found to be less permeable than articular cartilage.
