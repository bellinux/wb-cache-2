40|$|A {{sequential}} optimization {{method is}} applied to manage air traffic flow under uncertainty in airspace capacity and demand. To support its testing, a decision support system is developed by integrating a deterministic integer programming model for assigning delays to aircraft under en route capacity constraints to reactively account for system uncertainties. To reduce computational complexity, the model assigns only <b>departure</b> <b>controls,</b> while a tactical control loop consisting of a shortest path routing algorithm and an airborne holding algorithm refines the strategic plan to keep flights from deviating into capacity constrained airspace. This integrated approach is used to conduct thirty-two, 6 -hour fast-time simulation experiments to explore variations in the number and severity of <b>departure</b> <b>controls,</b> tactical reroutes, and airborne holding controls. Three feasible types of traffic flow controls emerged. The first type relied primarily on <b>departure</b> <b>controls</b> and strategic reroutes on the 300 to 400 nmi look-ahead horizon and worked best when rerouting occurred at a frequency of 10 to 15 minutes. The second type generated more tactical reroutes on the 200 – 300 nmi look-ahead horizon and required little airborne holding or pre-departure control when rerouting occurred at a frequency of 5 minutes. The last type relied heavily on airborne holding controls and infrequent updates to the weather avoidance reroutes. This last type was the least desirable solution due {{to the impact of}} its airborne holding on airspace complexity and airspace users. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} robust {{schedule}} coordination scheme which combines timetable planning with a semi-flexible <b>departure</b> delayed <b>control</b> strategy {{in case of}} disruptions. The flexibility is provided by allowing holding for the late incoming bus within a safety control margin (SCM). In this way, the stochastic travel time is addressed by the integration of real-time control and slacks at the planning phase. The schedule coordination problem then jointly optimises the planning headways and slack times in the timetable subject to SCM. Analytical formulations of cost functions are derived for three types of operating modes: uncoordinated operation, <b>departure</b> punctual <b>control</b> and <b>departure</b> delayed <b>control.</b> The problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed integer programming model and solved by a branch-and-bound algorithm. Numerical results provide an insight into the interaction between SCM and slack times, and demonstrate that the proposed model leads to cost saving and higher efficiency when SCM is considered. Compared to the conventional operating modes, the proposed method also presents advantages in transfer reliability and robustness to delay and demand variation...|$|R
40|$|A piloted {{simulator}} {{evaluation of}} the stability and control characteristics of a relaxed static stability fighter aircraft was conducted using a differential maneuvering simulator.

The command limiters were effective in preventing <b>departure</b> from <b>controlled</b> flight while permitting competent levels of sustained maneuvering. Parametric variations during the study included the effects of pitch control power and wing-body static margin.

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) have {{recently}} established new light aircraft certification rules that introduce significant {{changes to the}} current regulations. The changes include moving from prescriptive design requirements to performance-based standards, transferring many of the acceptable means of compliance out of the rules and into consensus standards. In addition, the FAA/EASA rules change the performance requirements associated {{with some of the}} more salient safety issues regarding light aircraft. One significant change is the elimination of spin recovery demonstration. The new rules now call for enhanced stall warning and aircraft handling characteristics that demonstrate resistance to inadvertent <b>departure</b> from <b>controlled</b> flight. The means of compliance with these changes in a safe, cost-effective manner is a challenging problem. This paper discusses existing approaches to reducing the likelihood of <b>departure</b> from <b>controlled</b> flight and introduces a new approach, dubbed Departure Aversion, which allows applicants to tailor the amount of departure resistance, stall warning, and enhanced safety equipment to meet the new proposed rules. The Departure Aversion approach gives applicants the freedom to select the most cost-effective portfolio for their design, while meeting the safety intent of the new rules, by ensuring that any combination of the selected approaches will be at a higher equivalent level of safety than today's status quo...|$|R

Among the most significant aerodynamic changes are the enlarged leading edge extensions (LEX) which provide improved vortex lifting characteristics in high angle of attack maneuvers, and reduce the static stability margin to enhance pitching characteristics. This results in pitch rates in excess of 40 degrees per second, and high resistance to <b>departure</b> from <b>controlled</b> flight.|$|R
