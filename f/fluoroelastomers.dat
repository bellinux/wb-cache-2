PFOA {{is used in}} the production of Gore-Tex as it is PTFE-based. In PTFE processing, PFOA is in aqueous solution and forms micelles that contain tetrafluoroethylene and the growing polymer. PFOA can be used to stabilize fluoropolymer and fluoroelastomer suspensions before further industrial processing and in ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography it can act as an extraction agent. PFOA also finds uses in electronic products and as an industrial fluorosurfactant.|$|E

40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of <b>fluoroelastomer</b> high-density polyethylene (HDPE) blends {{was investigated in}} detail. A capillary rheometer {{was used to determine}} the apparent viscosity of the blends as a function of time at various shear rates. The time to attain the steady state and the normalized steady-state apparent viscosity of the blends depend on shear rate and the <b>fluoroelastomer</b> concentration. The reduction in the apparent viscosity is caused by adhesive failure at the interface between the HDPE melt and the <b>fluoroelastomer</b> layer which was formed on the die wall surface during the extrusion of the blends. The presence of the <b>fluoroelastomer</b> layer on the die wall surface was confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and rheological measurements.

Viton is now manufactured by Chemours. <b>Fluoroelastomers</b> are more expensive than neoprene or nitrile rubber elastomers. They provide additional heat and chemical resistance.

To ensure that a <b>fluoroelastomer</b> with the required properties for a particular application is used, characterization techniques that allow the positive identification of the elastomer are required. In this paper the characterization of four <b>fluoroelastomer</b> formulations – a vinylidene fluoride/hexafluoropropene (VDF/HFP) dipolymer, a vinylidene fluoride/hexafluoropropene/tetrafluoroethylene terpolymer, and two vinylidene fluoride/perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether) /tetrafluoroethylene (VDF/PMVE/TFE) tetrarpolymers – is described. The characterization techniques included pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

50|$|Ozone-resistant {{elastomers}} include EPDM, <b>fluoroelastomers</b> like Viton and polychloroprene rubbers like Neoprene. Attack is {{less likely}} because double bonds form a very small proportion of the chains, and with the latter, the chlorination reduces the electron density in the double bonds, therefore lowering their propensity to react with ozone.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the time-dependent chemical degradation of a <b>fluoroelastomer,</b> FKM (Viton® A), in an alkaline environment (10 % NaOH, 80 °C). Optical microscopy and SEM analysis reveal that degradation starts with surface roughness right from the earliest stage of exposure (e. g., 1 week) and finally results in cracks on the surface after prolonged exposure. Initially the extent of degradation is mainly confined to the surface regions (a few nanometers) but with longer exposure (e. g., 12 weeks) it extends to below the subsurface region of the <b>fluoroelastomer.</b> The extent of this surface degradation {{is found to be}} strong enough to affect the bulk mechanical properties. The molecular mechanisms of the surface chemical degradation were determined using surface analysis (XPS and ATR-FTIR) where the initial degradation was found to proceed via dehydrofluorination. This leads to double bond formation on the rubber backbone which accelerates the degradation even further with longer exposure. Furthermore, the cross-link sites of the exposed rubber samples are also found to be vulnerable to hydrolytic attack under the studied chemical environment as evidenced by the decrease in cross-link density and gel fraction (%) ...|$|R
