During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who <b>decides</b> <b>whether</b> or not to take off.|$|E
5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge <b>decides</b> <b>whether</b> to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{have three}} main jersey colors: black, white, and blue. Their blue jerseys, {{designated}} their alternate uniforms, are the newest and {{were introduced in}} 2002. NFL regulations allow the team to use the blue jersey up to two times in any given season. In all other games, the team must wear either their white or black jerseys; in NFL games, the home team <b>decides</b> <b>whether</b> to wear a dark or white jersey, while the away team wears the opposite. The Panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants, while the black and blue jerseys are paired with silver pants; there have only been a few exceptions to these combinations.|$|E

5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: {{requests}} from strangers, checklist challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their objectives are replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts for family members instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston is called to liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, new places to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player <b>decides</b> <b>whether</b> to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as a currency in the game since the shops have closed. The player has fewer correctives for immorality, such as helping or killing other survivors, given the dire circumstances. The game puts a greater emphasis on hyperbolic fun.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee <b>decides</b> <b>whether</b> it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{problems}} of <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> an arbitrary graph has a k-regular subgraph, for some given k 3; of <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a planar graph has a quartic subgraph; and of <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a planar graph has a quintic subgraph, are complete for NP via logspace reductions. There are no regular planar graphs of degree greater than 5. 1 Introduction Regular graphs have been extensively studied from a structural point of view (e. g., [1]) but negligible {{research has been done}} on <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a given graph contains, as a subgraph (not necessarily induced), a regular subgraph of some degree different from 3 : the only case studied in the past is that where the regular subgraph should have degree 3 (i. e., it should be cubic). The result that <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a graph contains a cubic subgraph is NP-complete was attributed to Chv`atal in [5], and was expanded upon in [6], where it was shown that the problem of <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a planar graph of degree at most 7 has a cubic subgraph is [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a 3 -regular graph has a {{hamiltonian}} cycle (or path) was proved NP-complete. In this paper, we prove that for any fixed k⩾ 3, <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a k-regular graph has a hamiltonian cycle (or path) is a NP-complete problem. When the k-regular graph is planar, <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> the graph has a hamiltonian cycle (or path) was proved NP-complete for k = 3 and polynomial for k⩾ 6.

40|$|We {{prove that}} there exist some infinitary {{rational}} relations which are analytic but non Borel sets, giving {{an answer to}} a question of Simonnet [Sim 92].
