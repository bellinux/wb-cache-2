The problem appears to be especially prevalent {{on some of the}} more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using <b>damage</b> <b>control</b> voids for ballast, but a solution using solid ballast which does not affect the ship's survivability has been proposed.|$|E

5|$|Ostfriesland was ceded to the US Navy, and {{was later}} used as a {{stationary}} target during a demonstration of air power, conducted by General Billy Mitchell on 21 July 1921 off Cape Henry in Virginia. The ship sank at 12:40 after sustaining several bomb hits and near misses.

Posthumous awards of the Medal of Honor {{also went to}} two high-ranking officers who were on board the battleship when it was destroyed, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first flag officer killed in the Pacific war, and Captain Franklin Van Valkenburgh, who reached the bridge and was attempting to defend his ship when the bomb that hit the onboard ammunition magazines destroyed it. Arizona was awarded one battle star for her service in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Amalfi {{immediately}} began listing to port and, after initial <b>damage</b> <b>control</b> efforts proved fruitless, her commander ordered the ship evacuated. The cruiser sank less than 30 minutes {{after she was}} torpedoed. Distress calls were answered by other ships of the division which rescued {{a large number of}} the ship's complement. The loss of men was reported as about 200 at the time, but later reports list only 67 fatalities. Amalfi was among the largest ships sunk by U-boats during the war. As a result of Amalfis sinking, sister ship Pisa and the other pair of armored cruisers at Venice rarely ventured out of port for most of the next year, and were eventually transferred to Valona in April 1916.|$|E

5|$|Following the sinking, a Board of Inquiry was {{established}} to investigate the loss. Based on its findings, Captain Loben Maund was court-martialled in February 1942 for negligence. He was found guilty on two counts of negligence: one of failing to ensure that properly constituted <b>damage</b> <b>control</b> parties had remained on board after the general evacuation, and one of failing to ensure the ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage. The board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a high standard was being expected of Maund, {{and that he was}} primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew.|$|E

Besides the boldness of the action, the EPB strategists were also unsatisfied when Ramírez failed to account for food expenses in his report.|$|E
5|$|The Bucknill Committee, {{which had}} been set up to {{investigate}} the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made <b>damage</b> <b>control</b> difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious- and Implacable-class carriers, under construction at the time.|$|E

5|$|The class {{incorporates}} {{some major}} features including {{but not limited}} to the 'X'-shaped hull form to improve stealth, a raft-mounted propulsion system to reduce vibration, and an infrared signature suppression system. It also includes networks such as the Total Atmospheric Control System (TACS), Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), Integrated Bridge System (IBS), Battle <b>Damage</b> <b>Control</b> System (BDCS) and Personnel Locator System (PLS). The ships also include technology that enables them to fight in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare scenarios. The Indian Navy claims that the indigenization achieved in these ships is about 90%.|$|E
5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 <b>damage</b> <b>control</b> teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Fuel was pumped {{from the}} port storage tanks to the {{starboard}} side to correct the list and Lexington began recovering damaged aircraft and those that were low on fuel at 11:39. The Japanese had shot down three of Lexingtons Wildcats and five Dauntlesses, plus another Dauntless crashed on landing. At 12:43, the ship launched five Wildcats to replace the CAP and prepared to launch another nine Dauntlesses. A massive explosion at 12:47 was triggered by sparks that ignited gasoline vapors from the cracked port avgas tanks. The explosion killed 25 crewmen and knocked out the main <b>damage</b> <b>control</b> station. The damage did not interfere with flight deck operations, although the refueling system was shut down. The fueled Dauntlesses were launched and six Wildcats that were low on fuel landed aboard. Aircraft from the morning's air strike began landing at 13:22 and all surviving aircraft had landed by 14:14. The final tally was three Wildcats shot down, plus one Wildcat, three Dauntlesses and one Devastator that were forced to ditch.|$|E

5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} <b>damage</b> <b>control,</b> pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The {{administrative}} {{actions and}} subsequent suspension of Nagpal received widespread attention in India. She was widely praised for making efforts {{to clean up}} the corruption in the Indian political system. References were made with the Hindu goddess Durga for taking action against the politically well-connected sand-mining mafia and real estate barons. According to Surinder S. Jodhka, professor and chair at the Centre for the Study of Social Systems in Jawaharlal Nehru University, the protest after Nagpal's suspension are due to the growing discontent within India's growing middle-class with criminalisation in politics. Due to the public protests, the UP government had to engage in <b>damage</b> <b>control,</b> highlighting its welfare schemes and announcing that it is considering to set up a task force to check illegal mining.|$|E
5|$|The film is set {{several months}} after the events of Captain America: Civil War, which is eight years after the events of The Avengers.

Favreau, Paltrow, and Evans also reprise their roles as Happy Hogan, Pepper Potts, and Steve Rogers / Captain America, respectively. The clean-up crew <b>Damage</b> <b>Control</b> appear in the film (after previously being referenced in Iron Man and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) ahead of an intended television series about them. Various weaponry and artifacts from previous films are referenced throughout the film that Toomes and his crew repurpose for their weapons. In Parker's high school, one of his classes has a lesson about the Sokovia Accords, and portraits of Bruce Banner, Howard Stark and Abraham Erskine are seen within the school.
