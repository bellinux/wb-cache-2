The chamber incorporated several novel techniques in that it used parallel-plate pad readout and a Cesium-iodide (CsI) solid photocathode. The pad system used <b>gas</b> <b>multiplication</b> where the gas was kept at low pressure to minimize photon losses due to absorption and back-scattering and to minimize ion collection times. Low pressure also lowers the chamber response to charged particles. The chamber gas was ethane at 20 torr and the chamber was operated at room temperature. The chamber was built at the University of Pennsylvania by a University of Puerto Rico graduate student, Jorge Millan. Initial tests at Pennsylvania using a hydrogen-discharge lamp indicated a quantum efficiency of 13 % at 190 nm.

Dose verifications prior the treatment of the patient are mandatory in order to guarantee high accuracy to the treatment. We have developed a 2 D dose imaging system for dose delivery verification in hadron therapy. The system consists of two cascaded Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) in an Ar/CF 4 scintillating gas mixture. A GEM is a copper clad thin kapton foil with a regular pattern of sub-mm holes. The primary electrons, created in the detector's sensitive volume by the incoming beam, drift in an electric field towards the GEMs and undergo <b>gas</b> <b>multiplication</b> in the GEM holes. During this process light is emitted by the excited Ar/CF 4 molecules and detected by a mirror-lens-CCD camera system. The measured 2 D light intensity distribution is proportional to the 2 D distribution of the energy deposited in the sensitive volume by the hadron beam. When the thickness of a water bellows phantom, mounted upstream the detector, is varied from zero up to beyond the hadron range, a 3 D dose distribution can be reconstructed easily. The response of the detector was studied in a proton, alpha and clinical carbon beam. The main result of this work is that the energy dependence of the detector response in high LET (Linear Energy Transfer) beams is quite small compared to state-of-the-art 2 D dosimeters with a millimetre resolution. The scintillating GEM detector is a promising device for dose verification, especially in case of high LET beams for checking treatment plans composed of several beam energies.
