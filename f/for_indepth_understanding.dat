40|$|Abstract. Actin bundles have {{profound}} effects on cellular shape, division, adhesion, motility, and signaling. Fimbrin {{belongs to a}} large family of actin-bundling proteins and {{is involved in the}} formation of tightly ordered cross-linked bundles in the brush border microvilli and in the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells. Polymorphism in these three-dimensional (3 D) bundles has prevented the detailed structural characterization required <b>for</b> <b>indepth</b> <b>understanding</b> of their morphogenesis and function. Here, we describe the structural characterization of two-dimensional arrays of actin cross-linked with human T-fimbrin. Structural information obtained by electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, and homology modeling allowed us to build the first molecular model for the complete actin–fimbrin cross-link. The restrictio...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: We {{present in}} this paper {{a model of the}} {{coronary}} circulation. This model is integrated with a model of the systemic circulation, and contains models for oxygen supply and demand. Methods: Three compartments are created: one for the right ventricle, one for the epicardial segment of the left ventricle and one for the endo-cardial segment of the left ventricle. The model was implemented in the Java programming language and contains a visual representation of the left and right ventricles which beat in real time. Color shading is used to represent the partial pressure of oxygen in the segments. A multitude of model parameters can be changed to simulate different scenarios. Results: The output of the model was characterized under different conditions and the results verified by clinicians. Conclusions: Educational models of human physiology can be very useful <b>for</b> a more <b>indepth</b> <b>understanding</b> of complete physiologic systems. The models must however have enough complexity, interaction with other systems, and realism to show the concepts being taught...|$|R
40|$|Phenomics is an {{emerging}} branch of modern biology, which uses high throughput phenotyping tools to capture multiple environment and phenotypic trait measurements, at a massive scale. The resulting high dimensional data sets represent {{a treasure trove}} of information <b>for</b> providing an <b>indepth</b> <b>understanding</b> of how multiple factors interact and contribute to control the growth and behavior of different plant crop genotypes. However, computational tools that can parse through such high dimensional data sets and aid in extracting plausible hypothesis are currently lacking. In this paper, we present a new algorithmic approach to effectively decode and characterize the role of environment on phenotypic traits, from complex phenomic data. To the best of our knowledge, this effort represents the first application of topological data analysis on phenomics data. We applied this novel algorithmic approach on a real-world maize data set. Our results demonstrate the ability of our approach to delineate emergent behavior among subpopulations, as dictated by one or more environmental factors; notably, our approach shows how the environment {{plays a key role in}} determining the phenotypic behavior of one of the two genotypes.

In this work, we explore the possibility of boron monolayers (BMs) as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by first-principle method.

We review three existing belief update methods with uncertain evidences: virtual evidence method, Jeffrey’s rule, and IPFP (iterative proportional fitting procedure), and analyze the relations between these methods. This <b>indepth</b> <b>understanding</b> leads us to propose two algorithms for belief update with multiple soft evidences. Both of these algorithms can be seen as integrating the techniques of virtual evidence method, IPFP and traditional BN evidential inference, and they have clear computational and practical advantages over the methods proposed by others in the past. 1...|$|R

This association and dependency upon plants and other natural resources, however, is deteriorating due to the depletion of these resources. Fieldwork was conducted in Tasek Bera, Pahang, Malaysia, {{with the objective of}} interrogating the ethnobotany of the Semelai, an Indigenous community locally known as Orang Asli Semelai who have lived within these wetlands territories for more than 600 years. The Tasek Bera is being one of RAMSAR's internationally protected and monitored habitats and contributes to the significance of this Indigenous community being studied. Participant observation, in order to have <b>indepth</b> <b>understanding,</b> was carried out where a selection of respondents was questioned about their knowledge and expertise. This ethnographic research was directed at investigating and evaluating Indigenous knowledge {{and environment}}al heritage which started within the ambit of ethnobotany. This thesis offers insights to the reader from a multi-disciplinary perspective that engages in a wide body of interdisciplinary works including sociology, landscape planning, architecture, anthropology, ethnobotany and ethnology. Taking ethnology to its most general definition, the sub-discipline refers to investigation of the socio-cultural distinctiveness of a community. This thesis investigates the associations and inter-relationships of this particular Indigenous society with their environment to determine their decision-making processes and rationale that characterises their culture. This thesis explores how Indigenous knowledge, perceptions, values and activities that are embedded in the ethnology of the Semelai can and should be incorporated into present Indigenous settlement design and planning in order to sustain this Indigenous group’s intrinsic values. Spatial mobility among the Semelai is of interest in ethnological study, as this process is related to transformations of the landscape and the environment. The novel approaches used in this study could be used in future landscape methodological studies and analysis about human culture. They however require an <b>indepth</b> <b>understanding</b> {{of the people who are}} using the space rather than what designers and planners think that they should have.
