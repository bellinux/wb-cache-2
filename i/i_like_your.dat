[...] A 3:15 edited {{version of the}} song without the added audience noises was released as a single, {{but it did not}} appear on the record charts. [...] The song continues to be a highlight of the group's shows and the album version has become a staple of album-oriented rock and classic rock radio. [...] It has become so identified with Aerosmith, that when Jeff Beck (whose 1965 and 1966 recordings with the Yardbirds inspired Tyler and Perry) occasionally performs it, he often hears comments like [...] "Hey, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> angle on the Aerosmith tune".|$|E

Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E

I think I was probably with him a total of four times. And I don't consider that dating somebody." [...] Carey recorded a song called [...] "Clown" [...] for Charmbracelet which [...] "ambiguously addressed the relationship" [...] with the lyrics [...] "Should've left it at <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> music too" [...] and [...] "You should've never intimated we were lovers/ When you know very well we never even touched each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|Three members (Garred, Pritchard and Harris) of The Kooks all met as {{students}} at the BRIT School in Croydon, all three moving further south to join BIMM (where they met Rafferty who was from Brighton) in 2002. The inspiration to form a band came to Pritchard as he and Garred were out shopping for clothes one day in Primark as a joke. Speaking to MTV Garred said, [...] "we had a vision on how we wanted the band to look and stuff—so we bought some clothes and these hats, it was fun." [...] Sharing a love of The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Police, and David Bowie, Pritchard got Harris and Rafferty involved {{under the guise of}} a school music project. Pritchard himself said [...] "We got together just on a whim, really." [...] With a strong demo of their material Garred and Pritchard went in search of a gig, and according to Garred, they were able to book their first show simply because the landlord liked their hats. [...] "So we went in to get a gig, we don't have a demo blid burnt, and this guy told us, 'Well, you can't get a gig if you don't have a demo, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>your</b> hats, so I'm {{going to give you a}} gig'", said Garred. However, the band was unable to make the performance as they were finishing off their demo at the time.|$|E
