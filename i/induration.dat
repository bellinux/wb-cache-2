5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual <b>induration,</b> however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
25|$|TST (tuberculin skin test) {{positive}} {{is measured}} by size of <b>induration.</b> The size of the <b>induration</b> {{considered to be a}} positive result depends on risk factors. For example, a low-risk patient must have a larger <b>induration</b> for a positive result than a high-risk patient.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the course and {{outcomes}} of lipodermatosclerosis (LDS) as a variant of lobular panniculitis. Patients and methods. Examinations were made in 38 patients (37 women and one man) aged 54 ± 13 years who {{had been diagnosed with}} LDS lasting 2 weeks to 20 years and followed up at the V. A. Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology in 2009 – 2016. In addition to general clinical examination, the patients underwent immunological studies and lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography (DUSG). Outcomes were assessed as a significant improvement (complete regression of <b>indurations),</b> an improvement (regression of <b>indurations</b> was achieved, but there was one recurrence of LDS in the follow-up period), a slight improvement (regression of <b>indurations</b> was achieved, but there was more than one recurrence of LDS, which needed to change treatment policy), no effect of the therapy (no regression of <b>indurations</b> was achieved), and deterioration of health. Results. The 38 patients with LDS were noted to have subcutaneous fat inflammation in the leg (100 %) and asymmetric inflammation (55 %) on its medial surface (92 %). If the body mass index (BMI) was normal, LDS regressed more rapidly (p= 0. 04). During the entire follow-up period, 16 (42 %) patients were observed to have recurrent LDS; the median time to recurrence was 3 [1; 6] months. The development of a recurrence was associated with node merging into conglomerates [odds ratio (OR), 4. 33; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 05 – 17. 8; p= 0. 037] and with the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) agents at a dose < 400 mg/day (OR, 5. 25; 95 % CI, 1. 26 – 21. 96; p= 0. 019). Regression of <b>indurations</b> was achieved in 39. 5 % of cases, the likelihood of its development was higher when the duration of LDS was ≤ 3 months before therapy initiation (OR, 14. 67; 95 % CI, 1. 5 – 139. 8; p= 0. 006) {{and in the absence of}} perforating vein valve incompetence, as evidenced by DUSG (OR, 4. 1; 95 % CI, 1. 0 – 17. 0; p= 0. 045). Conclusion. In the study group, LDS was more common in middle-aged women with increased BMI and chronic venous insufficiency. The elevated clinical and laboratory parameters of inflammatory activity were not typical of LDS. Higher BMI values contributed to a longer regression of <b>indurations.</b> Recurrences were more frequently observed after stress and due to non-compliance with prescribed therapy. Node merging into conglomerates and use of HCQ< 400 mg/day for ≥ 6 months after therapy initiation are risk factors of recurrent LDS. The likelihood of regression of <b>indurations</b> was higher in patients, in whom the duration of the underlying disease was ≤ 3 months before therapy initiation and perforator vein valve incompetence was absent, as evidenced by DUSC.  </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} (TST) {{is used to}} detect latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. WHO guidelines recommend 10 mm as tuberculosis (TB) infection threshold for high risk individuals and 15 mm for persons with no risk factors for TB. Nigeria {{is one of the}} 22 high burden countries for TB and her population is at risk of exposure to the TB germ. In an attempt to investigate indigenous TST <b>indurations</b> in a local population, 200 apparently healthy new students of tertiary institutions and other residents of Calabar- Nigeria metropolis that required the test for routine medical examination were examined. Each subject was injected intradermally with 0. 1 mL of 5 TU of purified protein derivative (PPD) into the dorsal surface of the forearm. Indurated areas were measured after 48 - 72 hours of administration and results expressed in millimeters. 200 smear positive TB patients receiving treatment at the treatment center of the National TB Control program were used as the reference group. Results were statistically analysed using Chi square and T-test. Data obtained from the apparently healthy group show that approximately 31 % of the individuals had <b>indurations</b> measuring 5 - 7 mm while 29 % were non-reactive. At least 25 % of these individuals had <b>indurations</b> of> 10 mm compared to 95 % of TB patients. Nine (4. 5 %) of TB patients have <b>indurations</b> < 10 mm. The results of this study imply that at least 25 % of the healthy subjects are at risk of progressing to active disease when exposed to conditions that lower the individual’s immune status...|$|R

40|$|SETTING: Human {{observers}} {{generally have}} a strong tendency to round analog measurements or estimates to 'nice' ending digits, such as 0, 5, or even numbers. This is known as digit preference; it is a well-known phenomenon in frequency distributions of <b>indurations</b> collected in tuberculin surveys. Digit preference can distort estimates of prevalence and other statistical parameters. METHODS: We have developed a statistical model that combines smoothing by penalized likelihood and the transfer of counts from non-preferred to preferred digits, to obtain estimates of: 1) the smooth underlying distribution and 2) the amount of digit preference. RESULTS: To illustrate {{the validity of the}} model, it was applied to data from several countries.

2500|$|The {{results of}} this test must be {{interpreted}} carefully. [...] The person's medical risk factors determine at which increment (5mm, 10mm, or 15mm) of <b>induration</b> the result is considered positive. A positive result indicates TB exposure.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to evaluate for co-existent abscess, as this finding usually requires surgical drainage as opposed to antibiotic therapy alone. [...] Physicians' clinical assessment for abscess may be limited, especially in cases with extensive overlying <b>induration,</b> but use of bedside ultrasonography performed by an experienced practitioner readily discriminates between abscess and cellulitis and may change management in up to 56% of cases. Use of ultrasound for abscess identification may also be indicated in cases of antibiotic failure. [...] Cellulitis has a characteristic [...] "cobblestoned" [...] appearance indicative of subcutaneous edema without a defined hypoechoic, heterogeneous fluid collection that would indicate abscess.|$|E
2500|$|An ulcer {{that keeps}} forming {{on the same}} site and then healing {{may be caused by}} a nearby sharp surface, and ulcers that heal and then recur at {{different}} sites are likely to be RAS. Malignant ulcers are likely to be single in number, and conversely, multiple ulcers are very unlikely to be oral cancer. The size of the ulcers may be helpful in distinguishing the types of RAS, as can the location (minor RAS mainly occurs on non-keratinizing mucosa, major RAS occurs anywhere in the mouth or oropharynx). <b>Induration,</b> contact bleeding and rolled margins are features of a malignant ulcer. There may be nearby causative factor, e.g. a broken tooth with a sharp edge that is traumatizing the tissues. Otherwise, the person may be asked about problems elsewhere, e.g. ulceration of the genital mucous membranes, eye lesions or digestive problems, swollen glands in neck (lymphadenopathy) or a [...] general unwell feeling.|$|E

Detailed {{accounts}} of the Rossberg Fall {{may be found in}} any ordinary Swiss Guide; the only points we have to notice respecting it are, that the mountain was composed of an indurated gravel, disposed in oblique beds sloping towards the valley. A portion of one of these beds gave way, and half filled the valley beneath, burying five villages, together with the principal one of Goldau, and partially choking up a little lake, the streamlets which supplied it now forming irregular pools among the fallen fragments.

40|$|Background There {{is little}} {{information}} concerning community-based prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) using T-cell based interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs), particularly in TB endemic settings. In this study, {{the prevalence of}} LTBI in the Afar pastoral community was assessed using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFTGIT) and tuberculin skin tests (TST). Methods A community-based cross-sectional survey of LTBI involving 652 apparently healthy adult pastoralists was undertaken in the pastoral community of Amibara District of the Afar Region between April and June 2010. Results The prevalence of LTBI was estimated as 63. 7 % (363 / 570) using QFTGIT at the cut-off point recommended by the manufacturer (≥ 0. 35 IU/ml IFN-γ), while it was 74. 9 % (427 / 570) using a cut-off point ≥ 0. 1 IU/ml IFN-γ. The QFTGIT-based prevalence of LTBI was not significantly associated with the gender or age of the study participants. However, the prevalence of LTBI was 31. 2 % (183 / 587) using TST at a cut-off point ≥ 10 mm of skin <b>indurations,</b> and it was higher in males than females (36. 8 % vs. 23. 5 %, X 2 = 11. 76; p < 0. 001). There was poor agreement between {{the results of the}} tests (k = 0. 098, 95 % CI, 0. 08 - 0. 13). However, there was a positive trend between QFTGIT and TST positivity (X 2 = 96. 76, P < 0. 001). Furthermore, individuals with skin <b>indurations</b> ≥ 10 mm were 13. 6 {{times more likely to have}} positive results using QFTGIT than individuals with skin <b>indurations</b> of 0 mm (adjusted OR = 13. 6; 95 %CI, 7. 5 to 24. 7, p < 0. 001). Conclusions There is currently no agreed gold standard for diagnosis of LTBI. However, the higher prevalence of LTBI detected using QFTGIT rather than TST suggests that QFTGIT could be used for epidemiological studies concerning LTBI at the community level, even in a population unreactive to TST. Further studies of adults and children will be required to assess the effects of factors such as malnutrition, non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections, HIV and parasitic infections on the performance of QFTGIT...|$|R
6000|$|... 272. In {{addition}} to the fact mentioned by Mr. Hunter[30] relative to the <b>induration</b> of soft sandstone, I would adduce {{an excellent example of}} the same effect in the cathedral of Basle, in Switzerland. The cathedral is wholly built of a soft coarse-grained sandstone, of so deep a red as to resemble long-burned brick. The numerous and delicate ornaments and fine tracery on the exterior {{are in a state of}} excellent preservation, and present none of the moldering appearance so common in old cathedrals that are built of stone which, when quarried, was much harder than this sandstone. The pavement in the interior is composed of the same material; and, as almost every slab is a tomb, it is charged with the arms, names, and often statues in low relief, of those who lie below, delicately sculptured in the soft material. Yet, though these sculptures have been worn for ages by the feet of multitudes, they are very little injured; they still stand out in bold and distinct relief: not an illegible letter, not an untraceable ornament is to be found; and it is said, and I believe with truth, that they have now grown so hard as not to be in the least degree farther worn by the continual tread of thousands; and that the longer the stone is exposed to the air, the harder it becomes. The cathedral was built in 1019.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Signal {{adherence}} to the great law of nature, that all opposites tend to attract and temper each other. Passion in Shakspeare generally displays libertinism, but involves morality; {{and if there are}} exceptions to this, they are, independently of their intrinsic value, all of them indicative of individual character, and, like the farewell admonitions of a parent, have an end beyond the parental relation. Thus the Countess's beautiful precepts to Bertram, by elevating her character, raise that of Helena her favorite, and soften down the point in her which Shakspeare does not mean us not to see, but to see and to forgive, and at length to justify. And so it is in Polonius, who is the personified memory of wisdom no longer actually possessed. This admirable character is always misrepresented on the stage. Shakspeare never intended to exhibit him as a buffoon; for although it was natural that Hamlet,--a young man of fire and genius, detesting formality, and disliking Polonius on political grounds, as imagining that he had assisted his uncle in his usurpation,--should express himself satirically,--yet this must not be taken as exactly the poet's conception of him. In Polonius a certain <b>induration</b> of character had arisen from long habits of business; but take his advice to Laertes, and Ophelia's reverence for his memory, and we shall see that he was meant to be represented as a statesman somewhat past his faculties,--his recollections of life all full of wisdom, and showing a knowledge of human nature, whilst what immediately takes place before him, and escapes from him, is indicative of weakness.|$|E
6000|$|No {{improvement}} in {{the fortunes of the}} original anarchists through immigration to what was then called the New World would have made them good citizens. From centuries of secret war against particular forms of authority in their own countries they had inherited a bitter antagonism to all authority, even the most beneficent. In their new home they were worse than in their old. In the sunshine of opportunity the rank and sickly growth of their perverted natures became hardy, vigorous, bore fruit. They surrounded themselves with proselytes from the ranks of the idle, the vicious, the unsuccessful. They stimulated and organized discontent. Every one of them became a center of moral and political contagion. To those as yet unprepared to accept anarchy was offered the milder dogma of Socialism, and to those even weaker in the faith something vaguely called Reform. Each was initiated into that degree to which the <b>induration</b> of his conscience and the character of his discontent made him eligible, and in which he could be most serviceable, the body of the people still cheating themselves with the false sense of security begotten of the belief that they were somehow exempt from the operation of all agencies inimical to their national welfare and integrity. Human nature, they thought, was different in the West from what it was in the East: in the New World the old causes would not have the old effects: a republic had some inherent vitality of its own, entirely independent of any action intended to keep it alive. They felt that words and phrases had some talismanic power, and charmed themselves asleep by repeating [...] "liberty," [...] "all men equal before the law," [...] "dictates of conscience," [...] "free speech" [...] and all manner of such incantation to exorcise the spirits of the night. And when they could no longer close their eyes to the dangers environing them; when they saw at last that what they had mistaken for the magic power of their form of government and its assured security was really its radical weakness and subjective peril--they found their laws inadequate to repression of the enemy, the enemy too strong to permit the enactment of adequate laws. The belief that a malcontent armed with freedom of speech, a newspaper, a vote and a rifle is less dangerous than a malcontent with a still tongue in his head, empty hands and under police surveillance was abandoned, but all too late. From its fatuous dream the nation was awakened by the noise of arms, the shrieks of women and the red glare of burning cities.|$|E
