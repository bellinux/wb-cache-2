5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots were coming from unless <b>he</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> where the gunman would be.|$|E
5|$|In the afterlife, {{in which}} Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island, Faraday has a {{different}} background. Daniel was allowed to pursue his passion for music, and never trained in physics. After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope (Sonya Walger), Faraday approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered. He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red-haired woman he strongly felt <b>he</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> and loved. Daniel states after the encounter, he {{made a series of}} notes in his journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes, and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path. Faraday then tells him Penelope is his half-sister and where Desmond can find her. Later, Faraday meets Charlotte at his benefit concert, but they do not yet realize they are in the afterlife. Daniel then takes the stage with DriveShaft to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd. It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they are living in the afterlife. Eloise convinces Desmond to let Faraday live out the rest of his afterlife, since Faraday was never allowed to live the life he wanted in his past, and Eloise was never allowed to spend time with her son.|$|E

25|$|English voice actor Bryce Papenbrook got {{excited when}} he got the role of Eren as he was a fan of the show before it was {{announced}} that it would be dubbed into English. As a result, he viewed this as an advantage as he managed to understand the character beforehand.

Additionally, he saw himself prepared for the role's pressure due to his previous works in popular anime.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} guitarist amongst modern Cuban trovadors is Eliades Ochoa (b. Songo La Maya, Santiago de Cuba, 22 June 1946), {{the leader of}} Cuerteto Patría.

Ochoa plays now with an eight-stringed guitar (a self-designed hybrid of an acoustic six-string and the Cuban trés). Cuerteto Patría includes his brother Humberto Ochoa on guitar, son Eglis Ochoa on maracas, William Calderón on bass, Anibal Avila on claves and trumpet, and Roberto Torres on congas.|$|E

Although Ellis and Rogers had no wells and were dependent upon purchasing crude oil to refine and sell to Pratt, {{the two young men}} agreed to sell the entire output of their small Wamsutta refinery to Pratt's company at a fixed price. This worked well at first. Then, a few months later, crude oil prices suddenly increased due to manipulation by speculators. The young entrepreneurs struggled to try to live up to their contract with Pratt, but soon their surplus was wiped out. Before long, they were heavily in debt to Pratt.|$|E

25|$|After their {{missions}} for the Navy, Knorr {{arrived on}} site on August 22, 1985, and deployed Argo. When they {{searched for the}} two submarines, Ballard and his team discovered that they had imploded from the immense pressure at depth. It littered thousands of pieces of debris all over the ocean floor. Following the large trail of debris led them directly to both and made it significantly {{easier for them to}} locate them than if they were to search for the hulls directly. <b>He</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> that the Titanic imploded from pressure as well, much the same way the two submarines did, and concluded that it too must have also left a scattered debris trail. Using that lesson, they had Argo sweep {{back and forth across the}} ocean floor looking for the Titanic's debris trail. They took shifts monitoring the video feed from Argo as it searched the ocean floor two miles below.|$|E

25|$|The 1924–25 {{school year}} was a hard period of work for Bourguiba. However, {{he used to be}} {{interested}} in politics and French culture that he was eager to discover in every aspect. He frequently went to Palais Bourbon where he attended debates and sensitized to the intellectual and sentimental spirit of Leon Blum, that <b>he</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> from Le Populaire. He also closely followed the evolution of French politics during the Third Republic. It was while discovering this new knowledge that he developed an interest for politics. Between classes, students went to Jardin du Luxembourg to talk about news and political issues, during the France between two wars. Bourguiba went to read his newspaper and participate in the debates. In that context of post-war, the main topics were Woodrow Wilson's self-determination doctrine and the Russian Revolution of 1917, but also the Congress of Tours that divided the SFIO. Furthermore, 1924 discussions were about Vladimir Lenin's death but also socialism and the rivalry between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Bourguiba was following the international news in detail, was opposed to Bolsheviks and got interested in Gandhi's idea of transforming the National Indian Congress into a powerful mass organization. He also thought that Hô Chi Minh's participation in Tours Congress and his joining of the Communist International, aiming to get his country independence {{with the help of the}} enemies of Imperialism and Capitalism, made him dependent of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR). Bourguiba also admired his Tunisian fellow Mahmoud El Materi, who was active in Paris.|$|E

Months later, he and Babe are closer again, and are more about raising their son together while not being romantically intertwined with each other. But during a snowday with Babe and Little Adam, JR suggests to Babe that she keep the idea of them as lovers open for consideration. Having enjoyed her recent time with JR, Babe accepts his request. Still perplexed by Richie, she talks with him at times, her concern more directed at {{the fact that he has}} leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. His sister, Annie, is thought to be the best candidate to be his donor, and Babe is determined to convince her to save him. But her efforts are revealed hopeless when test results show that Annie is not a good donor match for Richie after all. The revelation comes that someone else in Pine Valley is the perfect bone marrow match for Richie. With the help of her mother, Babe discovers that JR is the match. Feeling that he will not donate the bone marrow on his own due to his hate for Richie, she decides to entice JR during a runway where she wears a sexy red dress. Once she gets his attention, she propositions him with a game of strip poker. If she wins, he will have to save Richie's life. If JR wins, he can have anything he wants in regards to her. The deal is made, and JR and Babe play for the prize at Babe's home. Both half naked by the time the game nears an end, it is JR who wins. But he surprises Babe with the news that <b>he</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> he was a match for Richie, and that he was already going to help him. Babe is intrigued by this new, softer side of JR, and JR mentions to Babe how they both want each other. They embrace, and the two make love.|$|E
25|$|Kazembek {{started his}} career as a {{linguist}} by translating Christian books into Oriental languages. In addition to the languages <b>he</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew,</b> he learned French, German and Tatar. In 1825, he received an invitation to complete his bachelor's degree in London. However the Russian government refused to let him out of the country, fearing that Kazembek would choose to stay and work in England upon graduation. Instead by Imperial decree he was appointed as a teacher of the Tatar language in Omsk, thus being held away from his academic instructors. He never made it to Omsk as, while staying in Kazan due to an illness, Kazembek met historian Karl Fuchs and was invited by him to pass an academic test to determine Kazembek's eligibility to teach Arabic and Persian at Kazan University. The test was passed and Kazembek was hired as a senior teacher. In 1828, he was chosen {{to be a member of}} the Royal Asiatic Society and became head of the newly established Faculty of Turkic languages at Kazan University. In 1831, he attained a master's degree after writing an academic essay called Views on the History and Vocabulary of the Arabic Language (in Persian). In 1835 he was admitted to the Russian Academy of Sciences as a Corresponding Member. In 1837, he earned a Ph.D. degree at Kazan University. In 1839, he wrote a detailed work called Grammar of the Turco-Tatar language (at that time, most Turkic languages were regarded as dialects of one single language unit often referred to as 'Tatar' or 'Turco-Tatar'), where he compared Ottoman Turkish, Azeri and various dialects of Tatar in terms of their phonology, morphology, and syntax and for which he received the Demidov Prize. The second edition of this book was published in 1846 and incorporated the author's latest research in the field. It became popular in Western Europe, being the richest academic source on the Turkic languages at that time, and was used in universities as a primary reference book until 1921, when Jean Deny published his Grammar of the Turkish language (Ottoman dialect).|$|E
