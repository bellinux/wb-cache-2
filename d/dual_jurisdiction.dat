The announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics, not least the members of Bruce's own cabinet, most of whom had not been informed of the dramatic change in policy until the day it was announced to the states.

40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s, California 2 ̆ 7 s {{juvenile}} justice system has been struggling to address two phenomena: crossover youth and the policy of <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Crossover youth are children who are simultaneously involved in the child welfare and {{juvenile justice}} systems; in conjunction, the policy of <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is a policy that permits juvenile courts to assume collaborative jurisdiction over crossover youth 2 ̆ 7 s child welfare and juvenile justice cases. Between 1989 and 2004, the system 2 ̆ 7 s actors adhered to California Welfare 2 ̆ 6 Institutions Code (WIC) § 241. 1, which prohibited the policy of <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> As a result, the system 2 ̆ 7 s actors assigned crossover youth to either the child welfare or {{juvenile justice system}}, and these children did not receive proper treatment. However, in January 2005, the California state legislature amended WIC § 241. 1 to incorporate Section (e), which {{is also known as}} the policy of <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Subsequently, the system 2 ̆ 7 s actors now have the option to assign crossover youth to both the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, and these children can receive holistic services from both systems. Currently, approximately two southern Californian counties implement the policy of <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> This thesis argues that the implementation of <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is necessary as it serves {{in the best interests of}} crossover youth by addressing the issue of disproportionate minority contact, decreasing the rates of juvenile recidivism, and increasing the availability of rehabilitative services. This thesis also uses preliminary field research to demonstrate the policy of <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> 2 ̆ 7 s benefits and to encourage more counties to adopt this policy...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} federalization {{of crime}} {{gives rise to}} concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over most crimes. This <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> enables prosecutors to choose whether to prosecute in state or federal courts. It is generally easier to obtain conviction in federal courts, and there is usually a large differential in the possible punishment under the different systems, with the federal system often having the harsher sentencing structure. As a result, prosecu- tors have enormous power to coerce guilty pleas or to choose the easiest path to conviction at trial. This concentration of power is worrisome, especially because there is at present no coherent policy about which crimes and which criminals should be prosecuted in state courts and which in federal courts. The {{result is that the}} prosecutorial advantages are employed randomly, with predictable results: wide disparities in sentences for similar offenses committed by like offenders, and marked differences in enforcement patterns across jurisdictions...|$|E

40|$|When Democrats and Republicans crafted the 2002 No Child Left Behind (NCLB), the {{bipartisan}} reauthorization of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), {{they did so}} {{with the best of}} intentions: Close our nation’s staggering achievement gap with federal leadership, accountability, flexibility, and choice. But a over a decade later, many argue the law’s flaws have outweighed its successes to detriment of our public education system, schools, teachers, and most importantly, our students. In accordance with ESEA’s traditional reauthorization cycle, NCLB was signed into law in 2002 and expired in 2007. It is now 2013, and our nation’s education policy still has yet to be reauthorized. In examining how this can be accomplished, this paper first demonstrates how our tradition of local school control developed into one of <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> It then examines the executive and legislative battle that produced NCLB in the 107 th Congress. Next, this paper analyzes the intended and unintended consequences of NCLB, which include conflicting conservative and liberal mechanisms, perverse incentives, narrowing and homogenizing education, inadequate resources, ignoring community issues, and seeking annual educational profit over qualitative learning. The paper concludes with an outlook on reauthorization–how NCLB should be substantively improved, as well as, the political context in which this reauthorization will occur...|$|E
40|$|February 27, 2001 {{marked the}} 200 th {{anniversary of the}} Federal Courts of the District of Columbia, the courts we know today as the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The history of these courts is interesting, albeit {{somewhat}} confusing; their names changed no fewer than six times since their creation. Indeed, from 1863 until 1893, the two courts were joined and called the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Because of their location in the nation 2 ̆ 7 s capital and their unusual <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> as both federal and local courts, the District of Columbia courts were destined to make unique and important contributions to American jurisprudence. This article describes the evolution of these courts from a three-judge circuit court with both trial and appellate jurisdiction to the two courts whose anniversary we celebrate this year. It then examines two prominent themes central to appreciating the core and character of these unique institutions. First, the courts of the District have served as principal reviewers of government action, protecting {{the rule of law}} against non-observance, neglect, or abuse by federal officials. Second, these courts have responded to the pleas and plight of vulnerable populations within the city, including African Americans, women, the poor, the disabled, political protestors, and criminal defendants. While these courts were frequently constrained by the often restrictive laws and customs of the time, their opinions, especially their dissents, revealed a sensitivity that was then notable and ultimately influential...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I review New Zealand's present {{inheritance}} laws which are characterised by: 20 disparate statutes stretching back 100 years; {{a lack of}} clear and consistent policies; a failure to adapt to fundamental changes in life expectancy, re-partnering and family groupings {{that have taken place}} over the last 40 years; inconsistent judicial decision-making; <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Family Court and High Court; mechanisms to avoid the consequences of the current legislation. Calls for urgent and fundamental reform have been met by piecemeal ad hoc changes. In contrast, reform in Australia has been systematic and carefully analysed. After considering the two common inheritance regimes around the world (the fixed rule scheme and the court-based discretionary system), I reach two fundamental conclusions: adoption of an inheritance code; recognition of the principle of testamentary freedom. In addition I recommend a number of changes to New Zealand's inheritance laws, and in particular: acceptance of the primacy of the position of a surviving spouse or partner; replacement of the current family protection and testamentary promises claims with support and contribution claims; restriction of estate claims to spouses, partners and minor children; recognition of the rights of "accepted children" (stepchildren and whangai); clarification of the ability to compromise and contract out of claims; empowering one court to administer all inheritance laws; anti-avoidance measures; equating the rights of spouses, civil union partners and long term de facto partners on separation. I conclude this thesis with a skeleton of the proposed inheritance code including drafts of some of the key provisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{functions}} of family courts in England and Wales {{in making decisions}} about children are identified as processing disputes and protecting vulnerable individuals, with latent {{functions of}} applying and influencing social policy. The thesis explores why family courts have been singled out for particular criticism in undertaking these functions. Two issues are examined: complaints that family court proceedings are held in secret and that a court is not the appropriate place for resolving disputes about children. The methods used are historical analysis, a comparison with courts in Australia, and applying the theories of Habermas. According to Habermas, when systems are maintained {{for their own sake}} without being anchored in people's values and needs, or operate without rational discourse, institutions can lose their legitimacy. The historical analysis shows that as social policy developed over the past 60 years, court structures were trapped in a <b>dual</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> which made it difficult to adapt to changing expectations. Since the 1970 s, there have been calls for a unified family court to better meet families‘ requirements. However, a comparison with such a court, the Family Court of Australia, reveals another set of dualities which undermine its legitimacy. The claim that family courts do not function effectively because they are closed and secret is examined. The law is set out in the context of concepts of secrecy, privacy, openness and transparency. It is argued that children have a particular right to privacy which is marginalised in the current debate, and that a recent consultation process undertaken to reform the law on media access to court proceedings was not undertaken in a transparent manner. Attempts to introduce alternative dispute resolution and remove disputes about child care and upbringing to mediation and other non-legal alternatives are also shown as likely to fail unless formulated through rational discourse...|$|E

Abstract: Most of {{juridical}} systems are historically {{developed from the}} interaction of two main legal principles: the principle of personality and the principle of territoriality. Roman Law {{is one of the}} best examples of it; its legacy channeled the growth and coexistence of religious and secular jurisdictions in the Germanic kingdoms of Western Europe. Under the principle of personality of laws, bonding individuals to their cultural or religious communities, legal pluralism was the common grounds from the Antiquity to the pre-Modern era. However, as a result of the religious wars in the Holy Roman Empire between Catholics and Protestants in the 16 th and the 17 th centuries, the Westphalian state model reinforced a territorial religious jurisdiction under the principle cuius regio eius religio, allowing the ruler to impose his religion on his subjects. The Muslim legal tradition developed, as well, plural juridical systems from the Dhimma System. One of them was the Ottoman Millet system that was adapted from the colonial era to the most of Middle East nation-states as a bonding personal religious law applied to non-Muslim communities. The secular paradigm of the Rule of Law, centralizing and reinforcing state and federal legislative powers, is implemented in Europe and her former colonies in the 19 th century under the nation-state constitutional model, expanding worldwide the principles of territoriality and citizenship. As a result, religious legal systems are progressively confined to the private sphere. However, the secular paradigm is confronted gradually by a new development of legal pluralism, mainly as an effect of an extensive increment of global migrations; Halakha or Jewish Law, Canon Law or Catholic Law, Sharia or Islamic Law, are gaining strength as formal or informal religious ADR under the principle of Religious Freedom. Religious legal systems are becoming an innovative tool of mediation, conciliation, and arbitration accepted by some secular jurisdictions around the world, although there is a polarized debate about it. In today´s global world, which are the lessons to be learned from legal traditions and contemporary models of legal pluralism? Can religious legal systems become a tool of mediation for restorative justice preventing and exiting from violence? This article addresses this juridical and social challenge from an interdisciplinary comparative analysis...|$|E
