40|$|Abstract: HIV- 1 pseudoviruses {{constitute}} {{an important tool}} in HIV- 1 vaccine and entry inhibitor research. Single-cycle pseudoviruses carrying functional envelopes are generated by co-transfecting HEK 293 T cells with pNL 4 - 3. LucR−E− and Env expression plasmids. However, cloning of Env genes is time consuming and single Env clones are not representative {{of the diversity of}} HIV- 1 in a patient's blood sample. A new method to construct Env <b>expression</b> <b>cassettes</b> is proposed which can be used for the rapid generation of heterogeneous HIV- 1 pseudoviruses without a cloning step. The linear Env <b>expression</b> <b>cassettes</b> are constructed by ligating PCR amplified Env genes between a 5 CMV promoter and 3 SV 40 polyadenylation element. The resulting cassettes generate pseudoviruses carrying heterogeneous Env variants of a primary HIV- 1 isolate derived from viral RNA or proviral DNA. The influence of cis-acting sequences upstream of the Env gene on infectivity was compared between pseudoviruses generated from plasmids and linear <b>expression</b> <b>cassettes.</b> The results suggest that the presence of these upstream sequences tends to result in higher infectivity of pseudoviruses when present in heterogeneous Env <b>expression</b> <b>cassettes,</b> but they do not enhance infectivity of pseudoviruses generated with homogeneous Env expression constructs.

Hairpin (hp) RNA <b>expression</b> <b>cassettes</b> are typically constructed on binary plasmids and delivered into plant cells by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Realizing the importance of RNAi for basic plant research, various vectors have been developed for RNAi-mediated gene silencing, allowing the silencing of single target genes in plant cells. To further expand the collection of available tools for functional genomics in plant species, we constructed a set of modular vectors suitable for hpRNA expression under various constitutive promoters. Our system allows simple cloning of the target gene sequences into two distinct multicloning sites and its modular design provides a straightforward route for replacement of the <b>expression</b> <b>cassette's</b> regulatory elements. More importantly, our system was designed to facilitate the assembly of several hpRNA <b>expression</b> <b>cassettes</b> on a single plasmid, thereby enabling the simultaneous suppression of several target genes from a single vector. We tested the functionality of our new vector system by silencing overexpressed marker genes (green fluorescent protein, DsRed 2, and nptII) in transgenic plants.

Progress in such cases have been recently reported in Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays. In Arabidopsis thaliana, using ZFN-assisted gene targeting, two herbicide-resistant genes (tobacco acetolactate synthase SuRA and SuRB) were introduced to SuR loci with as high as 2% transformed cells with mutations.

40|$|The Escherichia coli {{bacteriophage}} P 1 encodes a site-specific recombinase called Cre and two 34 -bp target {{sites of}} Cre recombinase called loxP. The Cre/loxP {{system has been}} used to achieve targeted insertion and precise deletion in many animal and plant genomes. The Cre/loxP system has particularly been used for the removal of selectable marker genes to create marker-free transgenic organisms. For the first time, we applied the Cre/loxP-mediated site-specific recombination system to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to construct marker-free transgenic strains. Specifically, C. reinhardtii strains cc 4350 and cc 124 carrying an aphVIII <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> flanked by two direct repeats of loxP were constructed. Separately, a synthetic Cre recombinase gene (CrCRE), the codons of which were optimized for expression in C. reinhardtii, was synthesized, and a CrCRE <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> was introduced into strain cc 4350 carrying a single copy of the loxP-flanked aphVIII <b>expression</b> <b>cassette.</b> Among 46 transformants carrying the CrCRE <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> stably, the excision of aphVIII by CrCre recombinase was observed only in one transformant. We then constructed an <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> of an in-frame fusion of ble to CrCRE via a short linker peptide. The product of ble (Ble) is a bleomycin-binding protein that confers resistance to bleomycin-related antibiotics such as Zeocin and localizes in the nucleus. Therefore, the ble-(linker) -CrCRE fusion protein is expected to localize in the nucleus. When the ble-(linker) -CrCRE <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> was integrated into the genome of strain cc 4350 carrying a single copy of the loxP-flanked aphVIII <b>expression</b> <b>cassette,</b> CrCre recombinase-mediated excision of the aphVIII <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> was observed at a frequency higher than that in stable transformants of the CrCRE <b>expression</b> <b>cassette.</b> Similarly, from strain cc 124 carrying a single loxP-flanked aphVIII <b>expression</b> <b>cassette,</b> the aphVIII <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> was successfully excised after introduction of the ble-(linker) -CrCRE <b>expression</b> <b>cassette.</b> The ble-(linker) -CrCRE <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> remained in the genome after excision of the aphVIII <b>expression</b> <b>cassette,</b> and it was subsequently removed by crossing with the wild-type strain.

In previous studies, the lipase (LipA) and its chaperone (LipB) from Ralstonia sp. M 1 were overexpressed in E. coli and the lipase was successfully refolded in vitro. The {{purpose of this study}} was to enhance the production of the active lipase LipA from Ralstonia sp. M 1 in the heterologous host E. coli without in vitro refolding process, using two-plasmid co-expression systems and dual <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> plasmid systems. Results To produce more active lipase from Ralstonia sp. M 1 in E. coli without in vitro refolding process but with the help of overexpression of the chaperone (LipB 1 and LipB 3 corresponding to 56 -aa truncated and 26 -aa truncated chaperone LipB), six different expression systems including 2 two-plasmid co-expression systems (E. coli BL 21 /pELipAB a + pELipB 1 k and BL 21 /pELipAB a + pELipB 3 k) and 4 dual <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> plasmid systems (BL 21 /pELipAB-LipB 1 a, BL 21 /pELipAB-LipB 3 a, BL 21 /pELipA-LipB 1 a, and BL 21 /pELipA-LipB 3 a) were constructed. The two-plasmid co-expression systems (E. coli BL 21 /pELipAB a + pELipB 1 k and BL 21 /pELipAB a + pELipB 3 k) produced the active lipase at a level of 4 times as high as the single <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> plasmid system E. coli BL 21 /pELipAB a did. For the first time, the dual <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> plasmid systems BL 21 /pELipAB-LipB 1 a and BL 21 /pELipAB-LipB 3 a yielded 29 - and 19 -fold production of the active lipase in comparison with the single <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> plasmid system E. coli BL 21 /pELipAB a, respectively. Although the lipase amount was equally expressed in all these expression systems (40 % of total cellular protein) and only a small fraction of the overexpressed lipase was folded in vivo into the functional lipase in soluble form whereas the main fraction was still inactive in the form of inclusion bodies. Another controversial finding was that the dual <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> plasmid systems E. coli BL 21 /pELipAB-LipB 1 a and E. coli /pELipAB-LipB 3 a secreted the active lipase into the culture medium of 51 and 29 times as high as the single <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> plasmid system E. coli pELipAB a did, respectively, which has never been reported before. Another interesting finding was that the lipase form LipA 6 xHis (mature lipase fused with 6 × histidine tag) expressed in the dual <b>expression</b> <b>cassette</b> plasmid systems (BL 21 /pELipA-LipB 1 a and BL 21 /pELipA-LipB 3 a) showed no lipase activity although the expression level of the lipase and two chaperone forms LipB 1 and LipB 3 in these systems remained as high as that in E. coli BL 21 /pELipAB a + pELipB 1 k, BL 21 /pELipAB a + pELipB 3 k, BL 21 /pELipAB-LipB 1 a, and BL 21 /pELipAB-LipB 3 a.
