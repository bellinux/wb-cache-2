5|$|A year later, {{during the}} 1944 Warsaw Uprising, Batalion Zośka, {{one of the}} most notable Polish {{resistance}} units, liberated hundreds of Jews from the Gęsiówka section of the Warsaw Concentration Camp. Many individual members of the Home Army were awarded by Yad Vashem as non-Jews who saved Jews from extermination <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> Recipients of Righteous Among the Nations medals are for example members of AK: Jan Karski, Aleksander Kamiński, Stefan Korboński, Henryk Woliński, Jan Żabiński, Władysław Bartoszewski, Mieczysław Fogg, Henryk Iwański, Witold Bieńkowski, Jan Dobraczyński and many others.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 600 Jews {{were killed}} in Greater Albania during the war. Albania-proper emerged from the war with a {{population}} of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning, numbering around 1,800 individuals. Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel, but several hundred remained until the fall of Communism in the early 1990s before they did the same. As of 2011, 69 Albanians have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations for the role they played in saving Jews <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b>|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{estimated}} to be between 2 and 3 million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> and never recovered. The population of Belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971. It was also after this conflict that the final borders of Belarus were set by Stalin when parts of Belarusian territory {{were given to the}} recently annexed Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Every few weeks, the Nazis {{staged a}} roundup in the Lvov ghetto of people unable to work. These roundups {{typically}} took place while the able-bodied were absent doing forced labour. In one such deportation, Wiesenthal's mother and other elderly Jewish women were transported by freight train to Belzec extermination camp {{and killed in}} August 1942. Around the same time, a Ukrainian policeman shot Cyla's mother to death {{on the front porch}} of her home in Buczacz while she was being evicted.

Firms in several countries continue to produce Zyklon B under alternative brand names, including Detia-Degesch, the successor to Degesch, who renamed the product Cyanosil in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Joel Brand (25 April 1906 – 13 July 1964) was {{a leading}} member, in the 1940s, of Budapest's Aid and Rescue Committee, which smuggled Jews out of German-occupied Europe to the {{relative}} safety of Hungary <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> After Germany invaded Hungary in March 1944, Brand became known for his efforts to save the country's Jews from deportation to the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland.|$|E
5|$|Raoul Gustaf Wallenberg (born 4 August 1912, death date unknown) was a Swedish architect, businessman, diplomat and humanitarian.

5|$|With the {{repatriation}} of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union and the 1947 Operation Vistula dispersing the remaining Ukrainian minority, and {{with most of}} the former Jewish minority exterminated by Nazi Germany <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> and many of the survivors emigrating to the West and to newly created Israel, Poland for the first time became an ethnically homogeneous nation state. The government-imposed and spontaneous movements of people amounted to one of the greatest demographic upheavals in European history.|$|E
5|$|Kafka's parents {{probably}} spoke a German {{influenced by}} Yiddish that was sometimes pejoratively called Mauscheldeutsch, but, as the German language {{was considered the}} vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak High German. Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest. Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele ("Ellie") (1889–1944), Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1942) and Ottilie ("Ottla") (1892–1943). They all died <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> of World War II. Valli was deported to the Łódź Ghetto in Poland in 1942, {{but that is the}} last documentation of her. Ottilie was his favorite sister.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{establishment}} in 1871, Germany was about two-thirds Protestant and one-third Roman Catholic, with a notable Jewish minority. Other faiths {{existed in the}} state, but never achieved a demographic significance and cultural impact of these three confessions. Germany lost nearly all of its Jewish minority <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> Religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through immigration and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through state policies. It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990, with an accompanying substantial decline in religiosity throughout all of Germany and a contrasting increase of Evangelical Protestants and Muslims.|$|E

5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, Bratislava remained a multi-ethnic city, but with a different demographic trend. Due to Slovakization, the proportion of Slovaks and Czechs increased in the city, while the proportion of Germans and Hungarians fell. In 1938, 59% of population were Slovaks or Czechs, while Germans represented 22% and Hungarians 13% of the city's population. The creation of the first Slovak Republic in 1939 brought other changes, most notably the expulsion of many Czechs and the deportation or flight of the Jews <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> In 1945, most of the Germans were evacuated. After the restoration of Czechoslovakia, the Beneš decrees (partly revoked in 1948) collectively punished ethnic German and Hungarian minorities by expropriation and deportation to Germany, Austria, and Hungary for their alleged collaborationism with Nazi Germany and Hungary against Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{direction}} of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler and the supervision of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, the Einsatzgruppen operated in territories occupied by the German armed forces following the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union) launched from occupied Poland in June 1941. The Einsatzgruppen worked hand-in-hand with the Orpo Police Battalions on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from {{the murder of a}} few people to operations which lasted over two or more days, such as the massacre at Babi Yar with 33,771 Jews killed in two days, and the Rumbula massacre (with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the Wehrmacht cooperated with the Einsatzgruppen and provided logistical support for their operations. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related auxiliary troops killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews. The total number of Jews murdered <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> The chemical was used to kill roughly one million people in gas chambers installed in extermination camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and elsewhere. Most {{of the victims were}} Jews, and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz. Zyklon B was supplied to concentration camps at Mauthausen, Dachau, and Buchenwald by the distributor Heli, and to Auschwitz and Majdanek by Testa. Camps also occasionally bought Zyklon B directly from the manufacturers. Of the 729 metric tons of Zyklon B sold in Germany in 1942–44, 56 metric tons (about 8 per cent of domestic sales) were sold to concentration camps. Auschwitz received 23.8 tons, of which 6 tons were used for fumigation. The remainder was used in the gas chambers or lost to spoilage (the product had a stated shelf life of only three months). Testa conducted fumigations for the Wehrmacht and supplied them with Zyklon B. They also offered courses to the SS in the safe handling and use of the material for fumigation purposes. In April 1941, the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized applier of the chemical, and thus they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{commitments}} {{that formed the}} basis for this endeavor to seek restitution was a resolution passed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2009 <b>Holocaust</b> Era Assets Conference in Prague.

However, this resolution is morally rather than legally binding.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Schindler {{had spent}} his entire fortune on bribes and black-market {{purchases}} of supplies for his workers. Virtually destitute, he moved briefly to Regensburg and later Munich, but did not prosper in postwar Germany. In fact, he was reduced to receiving assistance from Jewish organisations. In 1948 he presented a claim for reimbursement of his wartime expenses to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and received $15,000. He estimated his expenditures at over $1,056,000, including the costs of camp construction, bribes, and expenditures for black market goods, including food. Schindler emigrated to Argentina in 1949, where he tried raising chickens and then nutria, a small animal raised for its fur. When the business went bankrupt in 1958, he left his wife and returned to Germany, where he had a series of unsuccessful business ventures, including a cement factory. He declared bankruptcy in 1963 and suffered a heart attack the next year, which led to a month-long stay in hospital. Remaining in contact with many of the Jews he had met during the war, including Stern and Pfefferberg, Schindler survived on donations sent by Schindlerjuden from all over the world. He died on 9 October 1974 and is buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, {{the only member of the}} Nazi Party to be honoured in this way. For his work during the war, in 1963 Schindler was named Righteous Among the Nations, an award bestowed by the State of Israel on non-Jews who took an active role to rescue Jews <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> Other awards include the German Order of Merit (1966).|$|E
