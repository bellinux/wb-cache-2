The presence of unwanted trace species, such as CO, H 2 S, and NH 3, can adversely affect {{the function of}} a fuel cell.

The mechanisms of NH 3 contamination were diagnosed based on degradation tests using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The contamination factors investigated included ammonia concentration, operating current, temperature, and relative humidity. The results show that the severity of the adverse effect caused by ammonia contamination was enhanced by increased ammonia concentration, decreased operating temperature, and decreased relative humidity. The performance decay induced by ammonia is attributable to reduced membrane/ionomer conductivity and ammonia adsorption on the catalyst surface, which blocks the active sites and hinders mass transfer.

40|$|The {{effect of}} two compatibilizers, {{polypropylene}} graft maleic anhydride (PPgMA) and {{ethylene vinyl alcohol}} (EvOH), on the physical properties of wood polymer composites were studied. The composites were prepared with pine wood and two different impact polypropylene polymers, where the polymers varied according to ethylene content. These compatibilizers, when used together and pre-reacted to create a joint compatiblizer of PPgMA and EvOH, significantly improved control over the repeatability of the physical properties tested, compared to when the compatibilizers were used individually. The impact values were slightly reduced, however the standard deviation of these values showed that the variation in the impact properties were significantly minimized when EvOH was also introduced. It appears that the joint compatiblizer provides better control over the hardness to impact balance of these composite materials {{and some of these}} physical properties were improved depending on the ratio between PPgMA and EvOH used, in the joint compatibilizer. Due to the difference in chemistry between PPgMA and EvOH, we expected PPgMA to interact more with the crystalline polypropylene matrix of the <b>impact</b> <b>polymer</b> and the EvOH with the amorphous, rubbery part and yield interesting results.

40|$|Statement of the Problem: Despite its {{popularity}} as a denture-base material, poly-methyl methacrylate exhibits inherently low resistance to impact and fatigue failure. This {{is reflected in}} the analyses of the prevalence of denture fracture which suggests that prosthesis failure remains an unsolved problem. Consequently, various approaches to improve the physical and mechanical properties of denture-base polymers have been proposed. These include incorporation of solid metal forms and various types of fibers to provide reinforcement to fracture prone areas. In recent years there has been considerable interest in glass fiber reinforcement of polymeric denture resins. Partial fiber reinforcement using glass fiber has been shown to improve the mechanical properties of removable prostheses. However, adequate impregnation of fibers often requires the use of excessive methyl methacrylate monomer which has a deleterious effect on the mechanical properties of the fiber composite material. Purpose: The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effect of glass fiber polysulphone composite reinforcement on the flexural characteristics of two commonly used denture-base polymers. Materials and methods: Prefabricated E-glass fiber polysulphone composite rods, ± 3 mm in diameter, with a continuous, unidirectional, non-silanized fiber concentration of ± 55 vol %, were employed as strengtheners. The reinforcement was incorporated axial to the neutral axis in standardized cylindrical heat polymerizing conventional and high impact resin test specimens 6 mm in diameter and 28 mm in length. The two reinforced pattern groups (n = 10) were compared with unreinforced resin control groups. A three point loading test was performed in air after storage of the specimens in water at 37 °C for a period of 8 weeks. The following values were measured : flexural modulus and flexural strength. The obtained data were subjected to relevant statistical analysis. Results: The flexural modulus of the glass fiber polysulphone reinforcement was 14, 106 MPa and the flexural strength 546. 6 MPa. The flexural modulus of conventional denture-base resin was 1746 MPa, reinforcement increased it to 2328 MPa, and the flexural strength increased from 164 MPa to 209 MPa. The flexural modulus of high <b>impact</b> <b>polymer</b> was 1684 MPa and reinforcement increased it to 2067 MPa. The flexural strength was increased from 171 MPa to 242 MPa with reinforcement. Statistical analysis using t test showed that reinforcement affected the flexural modulus and flexural strength of polymer brands (p < : 05). Conclusion: Novel glass fiber polysulphone composite reinforcement may considerably enhance the flexural properties of multi phase denture-base polymers.

The bioavailability of these compounds can be enhanced {{with the use of}} supersaturating dosage forms, due to their high flux rates across the gastrointestinal tract membrane. However, the success of this strategy hinges on the ability to inhibit crystallization of the supersaturated drug solutions. Polymers can be used to inhibit crystallization and prolong supersaturation, however the mechanisms of polymer inhibition are not yet fully understood. Therefore it is desirable to understand the attributes that render a polymer effective. In this work, the crystal growth rate of a poorly soluble pharmaceutical compound, felodipine, was measured in the presence of various polymers. The growth rate studies were performed using a rotating disk apparatus so that the growth kinetics could be controlled and mathematically modeled. It was found that both polymer ionization state and <b>polymer</b> hydrophobicity greatly <b>impacted</b> <b>polymer</b> effectiveness. Investigation of these systems with atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that these properties significantly <b>impacted</b> adsorbed <b>polymer</b> conformation. The polymers that adsorbed in an extended chain conformation were able to achieve a higher degree of surface coverage than those that adsorbed in a coiled globule formation. The surface coverage was found to directly correlate to polymer effectiveness. By modeling this correlation using the Kubota-Mullin model, polymer effectiveness could be predicted when surface coverage was known. This research also assessed the ability of a <b>polymer</b> to <b>impact</b> crystal morphology. It was found that when polymers were present during crystal evolution from an amorphous melt, they were able to impact {{the size and shape of}} the resulting crystals.

Particles {{with a wide}} and controllable range of size and polymer content were prepared by varying monomer amount, reaction temperature and initiator concentration. A kinetic study {{of the evolution of}} the terpolymer colloid composition and morphology reveals a mechanism of fast homogeneous nucleation. Copolymerizalion of the three monomers yields particles whose composition changes continuously during the reaction, which <b>impacts</b> <b>polymer</b> properties. Temperature and monomer amount are key parameters, particularly in the nucleation and growth stages of the reaction. A linear relationship between the particle size and reaction temperature is observed. This is attributed {{to the fact that the}} concentration of small, nucleated primary particles with high surface area, initiated at higher temperatures, is too large for efficient stabilization and hence they are more prone to aggregation. The linear relationship between the volume of the colloids and the ratio of main monomer to water in the reaction batch is due to the growth of the particles that continues while there is MMA available. The initiator concentration is not significant in terms of size and concentration of methacrylate-based colloids since primary particles are formed very early during polymerization and they are not dependent on the number of growing chains.

In this thesis, the preparation, chemical modification and characterization of different types of thermoplastic polymers and their blends - such as poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), Mater-Bi (MB) and polyolefins (PE, PP, PS) composites – containing various natural fibres (hemp, micro- and nano-fibrillated cellulose) have been reported. Owing to the incompatibility of polymer matrices (hydrophobic) with cellulosic fibres (hydrophilic), either polymer or fibres have been functionalized, or a compatibilizer has been added during processing of composites. The functionalization was carried out by esterification or by grafting with bi-functional monomers - such as glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and maleic anhydride (MA) - able to react with both polymer and fibres during melt mixing. The composites were prepared by melt mixing in Brabeder Plasti-Corder and characterized by microscopic analyses (OM, SEM, TEM, AFM), diffractometry (WAXS), spectroscopy (FT-IR, NMR), calorimetry (DSC, TGA), tensile mechanical and rheological tests. Results demonstrated that morphology, phase behaviour, interfacial interactions, rheological and mechanical properties of composites were strictly affected by the component structure, composition and mixing processes. For binary PCL/CF and EVA/CF composites the effect of functional modification of matrix (with GMA and MA) and fibres (with butanoic acid) on the final properties of materials was examined. Results obtained for composites with polymer blend matrix (PLA/EVA-GMA/CF) demonstrated that phase morphology and mechanical properties were influenced by the polymer-polymer miscibility, and properties varied with blend composition. In the case of ternary composites of biodegradable MB, polyolefins and hemp fibres (H), the crystallization behaviour, morphology and mechanical strenght of the composites were found to be markedly affected by the phase dispersion and compatibilizer type. A significant improvement of tensile modulus and strength was recorded for ternary MB/PE/H and MB/PS/H composites as compared to binary composites (MB/H). The results indicated that incorporation of polyolefins in the biodegradable matrix may have significant advantages in terms of properties, processability and cost. Moreover, a novel approach to the preparation and functionalization of PLA bio-composites with nano-fibrillated cellulose (NC) has been reported. The effect of different processing strategies on the phase dispersion of NC, {{as well as on the}} thermal and mechanical properties of these systems has been analysed. To improve the dispersion of NC in PLA either functionalization of NC or PLA by GMA grafting, or inclusion of NC in poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) – which is miscible with PLA - were applied. Better dispersion of NC was observed for PLA nanocomposites containing functionalized components and/or NC included in PVAc.

This thesis focuses on investigating {{the impact of}} material chemical structure upon the blend microstructure, and thereby on device efficiency and stability for polymer:fullerene solar cells. It will be shown in the first results chapter that polymer fluorination can promote phase segregation in polymer:fullerene blend, limiting its charge generation as demonstrated using transient absorption spectroscopy. The promotion in phase segregation is shown to vary from polymer to polymer. With a careful modification of the polymer backbone, the negative <b>impact</b> of <b>polymer</b> fluorination can be avoided, resulting in an improvement in device performance. The following chapter focuses on the <b>impact</b> of <b>polymer</b> side chain on device performance. Linear side chain for PTTV polymers is found to offer a better polymer:fullerene mixing in comparison to branched side chains, potentially due to its better ability to accommodate fullerene molecules. This subsequently addresses limitations of poor of fullerene exciton dissociation efficiency. The next chapter provides {{new insights into the}} effects of polymer molecular weight on device performance. A high molecular weight of two DPP-containing polymers is shown to be beneficial to device performance, by offering a higher degree of material mixing in the polymer:fullerene blend.

It is shown that devices employing a crystalline DPP based polymer exhibits a sharp collapse in efficiency for annealing at temperatures beyond 140 °C, which is assigned to the polymers poorer miscibility with fullerene, making it incapable to suppress fullerene clusters formation. In contrast, an amorphous IDT based polymer shows a smaller decrease in efficiency under the same condition, consistent with its greater miscibility with fullenere. Open Acces...|$|R

While the range of polymer design parameters that impact BHJ solar cell performance remains a matter of some debate, our recent developments indicate that the combination of side-chain substituents appended to the main chain critically <b>impacts</b> <b>polymer</b> performance. For example, in poly(benzo[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b’]dithiophene–thieno[3, 4 -c]pyrrole- 4, 6 -dione) (PBDTTPD), side-chain substituents of various size and branching impart distinct molecular packing distances (i. e., π–π stacking and lamellar spacing), varying degrees of nanostructural order in thin films, and preferential backbone orientation relative to the device substrate. [2 - 5] While these structural variations seem to correlate with BHJ solar cell performance, with power conversion efficiencies ranging from 4 % to 8. 5 %,[2, 3] we believe that other contributing parameters – such as the local conformations between the polymer and the fullerene, and the domain distribution/composition across the BHJ (i. e., pure/mixed phases) – should also be taken into account.

This study includes the viscosity measurements over a wide range of shear rate and also friction and film thickness analyses performed in a soft elastohydrodynamic lubrication contact in order to avoid piezoviscous effects. A very recent technique based on laser induced fluorescence technology is used to evaluate the film thickness. These experimental results are compared with theoretical calculations, which allows based on the rheological data of each <b>polymer</b> solution, the <b>impact</b> of <b>polymer</b> shear thinning on hydrodynamic friction to be quantified. The studied polymer solutions show a decrease in film thickness and in hydrodynamic friction compared to Newtonian fluids of similar viscosity. This reduction is ascribed to the temporary shear thinning of polymer blends. The proposed theoretical models show good agreement with the experimental values. They appear to be useful tools to quantify the <b>impact</b> of <b>polymer</b> shear thinning on film thickness and friction. In addition to this main work, the polymer solutions are analysed under high contact pressure and the shear stability of some commercials viscosity modifiers are studied. A new method is developed to quantify the permanent viscosity loss of each polymer solution and this is compared to the industrial Kurt-Orbahn test.

40|$|Polymer flocculants, {{traditionally}} {{used with}} primary coagulant to enhance flocculation and sedimentation, {{are used in}} the coagulation-/microfiltration process as well assuming they can improve membrane performance similarly. However, there are several uncertainties concerning the use of polymer flocculants in the coagulation-microfiltration process. First, polymer flocculants may not have measurable effect on turbidity removal, because microfiltration membranes can remove significantly smaller particles than those removed by the conventional treatment process. Second, the effect of using polymer flocculants on NOM removal has been controversial. Although a number of studies reported improved NOM removal when polymers were used, others reported no or negative <b>impact</b> of <b>polymers</b> on NOM removal. Third, polymer flocculants are high molecular weight organic compounds. When carried over to membrane residual polymers can potentially foul the membranes. Finally, the use of polymer flocculants will change floc properties (i. e. size, fractal dimension, and stickiness) and subsequently bring uncertain effect on cake layer resistance. Therefore, the role of polymer flocculants in coagulation-microfiltration system needs to be carefully assessed for system optimization. In the reported research, three types of polymer flocculants with different charge and molecular weights were tested for comprehensively evaluating the <b>impact</b> of <b>polymer</b> flocculants on the performance of coagulation-microfiltration of surface water. Operation conditions such as inline filtration, direct filtration, and filtration with sedimentation were included. Two membrane reactors were designed to study the mechanism through which polymer flocculants affect the performance of coagulation-microfiltration systems. The result demonstrated that the use of polymer flocculants provides little to no benefit to turbidity and NOM removal in most cases, but pDADMACs can enhance NOM removal if applied properly; All polymer flocculants significantly increased membrane fouling except for pDADMACs when sedimentation proceeds MF; Polymer flocculants increase deposition/attachment of floc particles on the membrane surface through both adsorption of residual polymer on the membrane surface and polymer molecules on the floc particle surface; Even though polymers form larger and more fractal floc particles, they did not have notable impact on cake layer structure...|$|R
