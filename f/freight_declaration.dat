40|$|A freight {{checking}} system (200) comprises a first material statistics estimator (210) for estimating nominal material statistics (219) for {{a freight}} unit (1). The first material statistics estimator comprises a computation unit (212) that is configured to convert material details and corresponding quantity details from a <b>freight</b> <b>declaration</b> (10) for the freight unit (1) into the nominal material statistics (219). A second material statistics estimator (224) is {{provided for the}} purpose of estimating actual material statistics (229) for the freight unit (1). The second material statistics estimator comprises an image processing unit (220) for analysing radiogram data (22) for the freight unit (1), which are provided by a radiographic examination (20), and for converting the radiogram data into the actual material statistics (129; 229). A material statistics comparator (260) is used to compare the nominal material statistics (219) and the actual material statistics (229). A corresponding method for checking the plausibility of a <b>freight</b> <b>declaration</b> (10) in respect of correspondence to goods that a freight unit (1) described by the <b>freight</b> <b>declaration</b> (10) contains is likewise disclosed...|$|E
