[...] In it, Fry interviews a lesbian couple who discuss their fears that simply being out to their 16-year-old daughter and her friends could be taken as breaking this law, due to the law's prohibition [...] "on anyone disseminating information about homosexuality to under 18s". [...] The LGBT news magazine The Advocate described the law as criminalising [...] "any positive discussion of LGBT people, identities, or issues in forums that might be accessible to minors. In practice, the law has given police broad license to interpret almost any mention of being LGBT [...] whether uttered, printed, or signified by waving a rainbow flag [...] as just cause to arrest LGBT people." [...] The US State Department in its 2013 report on human rights in Russia noted the clarification from Roskomnadzor (the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications) that the [...] "gay propaganda" [...] prohibited under the law includes materials which [...] "directly or indirectly approve {{of people who are}} in nontraditional sexual relationships."
