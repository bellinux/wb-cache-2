The authority I have sought is not in any sense political. It is the authority that results from collecting and classifying information on a scientific level and interpreting facts as I have found them. Since I do not speak with political authority I have no means of communicating my conclusions except by putting them in print myself and distributing them in the most advantageous way that is available to a private citizen.|$|E

500|$|Britten, like Elgar and Walton before him, {{was signed}} up {{by a major}} British {{recording}} company, and performed a considerable proportion of his output on disc. For the Decca Record Company he made some monaural records in the 1940s and 1950s, followed, with the enthusiastic support of the Decca producer John Culshaw, by numerous stereophonic versions of his works. Culshaw wrote, [...] "The happiest hours <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason {{that it did not}} seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we were just trying to make music." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} in Nelson, Constantine made a deep {{impression}} and remained a [...] celebrity there even after leaving the town; [...] his general community involvement was such [...] that a regional historian described him as a [...] "local champion". He appreciated the greater freedom he enjoyed in Nelson as compared with Trinidad, where racial issues predominated. Although Nelson suffered {{from the effects of}} the Depression, Constantine's high earnings were never a source of resentment; of {{his time in}} Nelson he wrote: [...] "If I had not come... I could not have been the person I am today... I am a better citizen for the time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> in Nelson." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics also {{identified}} problems with Bellesiles's methods of citation. [...] Cramer noted that Bellesiles had misrepresented a passage by George Washington {{about the quality}} of three poorly prepared militia units as if his criticism applied to the militia in general. (Washington had noted that the three units were exceptions to the rule.) Cramer wrote, [...] "It took me twelve hours of hunting before I found a citation that was completely correct.

He is a constant inspiration, and my eternal friend"; and Mandel said, [...] "I love Norman Lloyd.

2500|$|Voelker's {{business}} slowed {{after the}} Peterson trial, and by 1953 {{he closed his}} office and worked from home. In 1954, {{he ran for the}} United States Congress. In 1956, he was interviewed as a possible candidate to fill a vacancy on the Michigan Supreme Court. At the time, Governor G. Mennen Williams thought it was appropriate to revive a tradition of having a justice from the Upper Peninsula on the court. When asked why he wanted to serve, Voelker replied, [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> my life on fiction and fishing, and I need the money." [...] He was appointed the 74th justice of the Michigan Supreme Court by [...] Williams to fill Emerson R. Boyles's vacant seat on the court in December 1956, and Voelker was confirmed in an election in 1957 to fill out the remainder of Boyles' term. He was then reelected to a full term in 1958.|$|E
2500|$|Elric's {{albinism}} appears {{influenced by}} Monsieur Zenith, an albino Sexton Blake villain whom Moorcock appreciated enough to write into later multiverse stories. [...] Moorcock read Zenith stories {{in his youth}} and has contributed to their later reprinting, remarking that it [...] "took me forty years to find another copy of Zenith the Albino! In fact it was a friend who found it {{under lock and key}} and got a copy of it to Savoy who are, at last, about to reprint it! Why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> so much energy making public the evidence of my vast theft from Anthony Skene, I'm not entirely sure... [...] Moorcock later said, [...] "As I've said in my introduction to Monsieur Zenith: The Albino, the Anthony Skenes character was a huge influence. For the rest of the character, his ambiguities in particular, I based him on myself at the age I was when I created Elric, which was 20". The influence of Zenith on Elric is often cited in discussions of Zenith.|$|E
2500|$|Culshaw {{produced}} {{a series of}} Decca recordings of Britten's music with the composer as conductor or pianist. The Times described them as [...] "a priceless heritage for posterity." [...] Culshaw persuaded Decca {{to make the first}} complete recording of Peter Grimes, arguing that unless they did so they should abandon their exclusive agreement with the composer and so [...] "give him a chance to try his luck with other companies". Decca, unwilling to lose out to competition, gave the go-ahead. Culshaw, who was then responsible for recordings in Vienna, was unavailable to produce that pioneering recording, which was also the first modern opera to be recorded in stereo: instead, he [...] "planned it down to the last detail", and passed his detailed instructions to Erik Smith, who produced the recording. Among the works Culshaw himself recorded with Britten were the operas Albert Herring (1964), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1967), and Billy Budd (1968). Culshaw wrote, [...] "The happiest hours <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason that it did not seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we were just trying to make music." ...|$|E

He was terribly changed; gaunt, wolfish, and spoke like a madman. I told him that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> the money. He gnashed his teeth at me, and swore it was his money. I told him that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> it on him. He asked me how. I said in trying to make him an honest man, and in {{repairing}} the results of his villainy. He shrieked out a curse, and pulling something out of the breast of his coat--a loaded stick, I think--he struck me with it, and I remembered nothing more." ...|$|R

It was those final years that were the crucial period for me. Illusions there met up with reality. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> since come to appreciate the rightness of a quotation I recently read, one made by a statesman, now dead, who said: [...] "The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie - deliberate, contrived and dishonest - but the myth - persistent, persuasive and unrealistic."

2500|$|Armageddon was {{originally}} slated for release mid-2012, {{but it was}} delayed because Sebastian wanted to be completely happy with it before it was released. He said, [...] "It's the longest <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> with an album but I'm not rushing it for a TV performance or anything. It will happen when it's ready". He explained he had approached Armageddon {{in a different way}} than his previous albums, [...] "I haven't sat down to write an album, I've just been writing whatever I feel. I'm still learning what defines me as an artist. There's stuff in there that radio won't touch but it needs to be there and I think it lifts the album. [...] I've done most of it myself and I've really taken my time." [...] While the album has the upbeat happy music and love songs he is known for, Sebastian said becoming a father earlier in the year brought new awareness, and he started analysing the world his son would grow up in. He explained it gave him a broader perspective, and while he had always taken notice of the state of world affairs, he had never written about it in song before. Because of this he said the album has more light and shade, [...] "there's definitely moments where it has a bit more depth to it -- it's not just 'I love you, do you love me too?' Obviously there's some love songs in there, but there's also a bit more commentary on the world that my little boy (Hudson) is going to inherit." [...] When asked to give five words that could describe the album Sebastian used the words [...] "dark", [...] "reflective", [...] "happy", [...] "appreciative" [...] and [...] "anxious".|$|E
2500|$|Hammond {{was made}} captain of England in 1938 when he {{achieved}} amateur status through {{being given a}} top job in a tyre company. This was {{the age of the}} [...] "Shamateur", when cricketers were given lucrative posts so that they would qualify for amateur status and captaincy of their county and country. He was with the RAF in South Africa during the war, but returned to play in 1945 and in the first full county season in 1946 made 1,783 runs (84.90) including six centuries in seven innings, making him easily the best batsman in England. Though the [...] at the MCC disliked having an ex-professional as England captain Hammond had no rivals to the post. On his arrival in Australia the news broke that he was divorcing his wife of 17 years to marry a South African beauty queen and the press had a field day. Hammond made centuries in his first two innings on the tour, 131 off Northam (with 19 fours and 4 sixes) and 208 against Western Australia, but suffered from fibrositis and let Yardley captain most of the early tour games. Hammond proved to be aloof and distant and at 43 was a generation older than the rest of his team, who held in him awe. Amateur captains used to readily consult their senior professional, but Hammond the ex-pro rarely sought anybody's advice, and [...] "sphinx-like marched from slip at one end to slip at the other, apparently, as Plum Warner wrote of him 'just letting the game go on'". He ordered his batsmen to stay in their crease and not attack the bowling and had his best bowlers running around the outfield between overs. In the Tests his highest Test score was only 37 and simply failed to concentrate as he used to; [...] "When I consider the hours <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> against men like Grimmett and O'Reilly, never taking the slightest chance and patiently waiting for the loose ball to come along, I cannot understand why in 1946 I tried to hit spin bowlers off their length before I had been at the wicket ten minutes". Although averse to public speaking Hammond was very popular with the Australian public and was cheered whenever he appeared. One newspaper told its readers [...] "See him while you can. Your grandsons will feel you have let them down if you haven't seen him on their behalf". However, Hammond came [...] "as a cricket god, only to leave a failure both as a batsman and a captain". He retired on his return to England and moved to South Africa, where he remained detached from cricket until he took to the habit of visiting M.J.K. Smith's touring team just before he died in a car accident in 1965.|$|E
