40|$|In {{applications}} such as processor-memory interconnect, I/O networks, and router switch fabrics, an interconnection network must be scalable to thousands of high-bandwidth terminals {{while at the same}} time being economical in small configurations and robust in the presence of single-point faults. Emerging optical technology enables new topologies by allowing links to cover large distances but at a significant premium in cost compared to high-speed <b>electrical</b> <b>links.</b> Existing topologies do not cost-effectively exploit these optical links. In this paper we introduce SOENet, a family of topologies that exploits emerging high-speed optical and <b>electrical</b> <b>links</b> to provide cost effective scalability and graceful degradation in the presence of faults. We show that SOENet scales more economically than alternative topologies. For networks scalable to 32, 000 nodes, a 32 -node SOENet costs 4 x less than a 3 -D torus.

5000|$|The {{design of}} the Abeille was {{directed}} by René Dorand at the helicopter division of SNCAC. An intermeshing rotor layout was chosen instead of a tail rotor design, following the examples of the 1939 Flettner Fl 265 and the Kellet XR-8 of 1944. Its twin, two blade rotors were driven by shafts which leaned out of the fuselage side-by-side. The rotor blades, which began some way from the hub, tapered strongly. Pitch and roll were adjusted from the control column by altering cyclic pitch via a pair of swashplates and yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors with the pedals. Forward tilt of the rotor shafts was automatically linked to forward speed.

Busbar topology including the ground potential brings some EMC filtering capability. A multilayer topology is proposed to both increase the capacitances of interest and decrease the stray inductance. This has been validated using simulations and experimental results.

50|$|The main {{benefits}} of fiber are its exceptionally low loss (allowing long distances between amplifiers/repeaters), its {{absence of ground}} currents and other parasite signal and power issues common to long parallel electric conductor runs (due to its reliance on light rather than electricity for transmission, and the dielectric nature of fiber optic), and its inherently high data-carrying capacity. Thousands of <b>electrical</b> <b>links</b> {{would be required to}} replace a single high bandwidth fiber cable. Another benefit of fibers is that even when run alongside each other for long distances, fiber cables experience effectively no crosstalk, in contrast to some types of electrical transmission lines. Fiber can be installed in areas with high electromagnetic interference (EMI), such as alongside utility lines, power lines, and railroad tracks. Nonmetallic all-dielectric cables are also ideal for areas of high lightning-strike incidence.|$|R

They are based on diffusion conditions influenced by parameters such as relative humidity, temperature, rains etc. This work presents the influence of sacrificial cathodic protection on the chloride profile in concrete. Cathodic protection to the embedded steel in concrete was established by plugging-in a sacrificial magnesium alloy anode {{at the center of the}} slab and providing an <b>electrical</b> <b>link</b> between them.

On one hand, the use of UHVAC {{transmission lines}} not only strengthens the <b>electrical</b> <b>link</b> among different regions, but also enriches the existing operation modes and improves the ability to operate economically in the whole grid. On the other hand, it makes the operation modes of power grids more complicated and diversified. Once the power grid is subjected to large disturbances, the fault can spread easily, which challenges the security and stability of the power grid [2]. The islanding of power system works as the last defense so as to maintain {{the stability of the}} separated islands. In the islanding stage, it should search for an appropriate group of lines which form a cut set in order to separate the system into two or more subsystems. These islands operate independently to prevent the accident from spreading and blackout from happening when disturbances occur among the generator groups. Therefore, how to quickly identify the system swing modes and how to pinpoint the out-of-step generator groups in order to search for the optimal separation boundaries are the critical issues. It has great significance in guaranteeing the security and stability of the power system.|$|E
40|$|The {{microprocessor}} architecture {{transition from}} multi-core to many-core will drive increased chip-to-chip I/O bandwidth demands at processor/memory interfaces and in multi-processor systems.

40|$|As {{microprocessors}} {{become increasingly}} interconnected, {{the power consumed}} by the interconnection network {{can no longer be}} ignored. Moreover, with demand for link bandwidth increasing, optical <b>links</b> are replacing <b>electrical</b> <b>links</b> in inter-chassis and inter-board environments. As a result, the power dissipation of optical links is becoming as critical as their speed. In this paper, we first explore options for building high speed opto-electronic links and discuss the power characteristics of different link components. Then, we propose circuit and network mechanisms that can realize power-aware optical links – links whose power consumption can be tuned dynamically in response to changes in network traffic. Finally, we incorporate power-control policies along with the power characterization of link circuitry into a detailed network simulator to evaluate the performance cost and power savings of building power-aware opto-electronic networked systems. Simulation results show that more than 75 % savings in power consumption can be achieved with the proposed power-aware opto-electronic network. ...|$|R
30|$|Besides the {{parameters}} of PLL, other {{factors such as the}} output power, the grid voltage and the impedance of transmission line also play an important role on the small- signal stability. When the output power of CC-VSC is large, it means that the steady-state angle θ 0 between the terminal voltage of CC-VSC and the grid voltage is large. It is also the steady-state power angle δ 0 in traditional power system. As demonstrated in (15), {{it is obvious that the}} large θ 0 makes the stability deteriorate, by degrading the damping performance and the synchronizing ability. Likewise, the amplitude of grid voltage can also influence the small-signal stability, by altering the value of equivalent synchronizing coefficient and damping coefficient. When the grid voltage dips, both the damping performance and the synchronizing ability will be weakened according to (15). It also helps explain why the CC-VSC system tends to lose its stability when suffering voltage sag. An important parameter of the system configuration is the impedance of the transmission line which is represented by an inductor L in Fig.  1. A large inductance indicates a large virtual mechanical torque, as shown in (13). Under the condition of the steady state, the virtual mechanical torque is equal to the virtual electromagnetic torque which is also represented in (13). Thus, it is inferred that the steady-state angle θ 0 is large with the large inductance. As mentioned above, the large θ 0 degrades the damping performance and the synchronizing ability of the CC-VSC system. Therefore, it is evident that larger inductance of transmission line is unfavorable, because it will lead to weaker small-signal stability. The traditional power system theory also presents that the compactness of <b>electrical</b> <b>link</b> between two interconnected power sources depends on the inductance of the transmission line: if the linking inductance is larger, the electrical connection will be weaker, and the stability will get worse.|$|E
40|$|After {{four years}} of activity, EuCARD has most of its {{objectives}} fulfilled, with some new objectives added {{and a few others}} on excellent tracks while requiring additional time. The management has been active in reinforcing the collaborative links between partners and projects, contributing to the preparation of FP 7 -EuCARD 2, initiating FP 7 -HiLumi-LHC Design Study, to favour sustained collaborations beyond EuCARD. An out-of-contract network has been successfully launched on laser plasma acceleration, to combine forces between accelerator, laser and plasma communities. Communication and dissemination activities have led to two highlights: Accelerating News, an accelerator R&D newsletter initiated by EuCARD and now common to all FP 7 accelerator projects (over 1000 subscribers) and a series of monographs on accelerator sciences that is progressively finding its public. The scientific networks have more than fulfilled their initial objectives: roadmaps are defined for neutrino facilities, submitted to the European HEP Strategy Session. The accelerator networks have so successfully become the international forum on accelerator sciences that their share and scope in EuCARD 2 have been significantly expanded. With over 40 topical workshops organized on diverse scientific and technological topics, from innovative crab cavities to roadmaps towards novel frontier accelerators, their impact is largely acknowledged in the community. The two open facilities (MICE@STFC, HiRadMat@SPS) delivered more access units than foreseen, with significant results. The JRAs have the lion’s share in EuCARD. They have had naturally tight links with networks and TA facilities, resulting in a coherent and coordinated approach. The development of an innovative Nb 3 Sn magnet with a YBCO insert, has made significant progress, confirmed by its international advisory committee, even though an extension of the study by 1. 5 years turns out to be necessary: the mechanical structure of the magnet is completed and tested at cold, and a test coil with Cu conductor was manufactured. The Nb 3 Sn cable shows excellent performance. The YBCO HTS insert solenoids were built and the dipole components are procured with completion of the insert by end 2013. The HTS <b>electrical</b> <b>link</b> demonstrator is fully operational. It will allow remote powering of magnets, avoiding risks of single event upset and easing maintenance. The new collimation collaboration organized for EuCARD fully fulfilled its plans, including an optional crystal collimation experience. Novel more robust materials were characterized for collimator jaws. The smart collimator and cryo-catcher were designed, built and successfully tested. The EuCARD contribution to linear colliders is deeply integrated in the CLIC/ILC studies. Significant progress was obtained in ultra-precise assembly and integration of RF modules, thermal stabilization, ultra-precise phase control to 20 fs and beam control. The active mechanical stabilization of magnets to a fraction of nanometer is especially impressive, as well as highly sophisticated simulations of RF break-downs, showing new microscopic mechanisms and giving directions for mitigation. The collaboration concurred to the record accelerating gradient obtained, exceeding 100 MV/m. The study of an innovative compact crab cavity gave momentum to this R&D line and went well beyond plans, with the fabrication of a bulk Nb sc unit. The progress in thin film deposition is slower, given the complexity of this highly promising technology. Better sputtering seems at hand. Progress is noted in chemical processing and cleaning strategies for sc cavities and their couplers. Two reference monographs were published. A new original RF control was built for FLASH and already showed improvement to operations. Finally, the assessment of novel accelerator technologies out of the main stream (crab waist crossing, non-scaling FFAG and diagnostics for divergent beams from laser-plasma acceleration) all met the planned goals. In summary, EuCARD contributed to significant scientific progress beyond the state-of-the-art and to a marked expansion of the collaborative dimension...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Both power {{efficiency}} and per-channel data rates of high-speed input/output (I/O) links must be improved {{in order to}} support future inter-chip bandwidth demand. In order to scale data rates over band-limited channels, various types of equaliza-tion circuitry are used to compensate for frequency-dependent loss. However, this additional complexity introduces power and area costs, requiring selection of an appropriate I/O equalization architecture in order to comply with system power budgets. This paper presents a design flow for power optimization of high-speed <b>electrical</b> <b>links</b> at a given data rate, channel type, and process technology node, which couples statistical link analysis techniques with circuit power estimates based on normalized transistor parameters extracted with a constant current density methodology.
