5|$|In 1955 the US Army began {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) as an anti-ballistic missile to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the missile could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead {{while it was still}} far enough away to give the missile time to launch. All of this appeared to be within the state of the art, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. These barriers were swept aside in late 1957 after the launch of the R-7 Semyorka, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest <b>development</b> <b>priority.</b>|$|E

25|$|In January 2011, the {{government}} created the Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation. Up until then, management of science, technology and innovation had fallen under the Department of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research. Within this ministry, the Directorate General for Research and Sector Statistics {{is responsible for}} planning. A separate body, the Directorate General of Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation, co-ordinates research.

500|$|Transport {{into and}} out of the ACT was an early <b>development</b> <b>priority.</b> In 1931 the Federal Highway linking the ACT to Goulburn was completed, and in 1936 an {{airfield}} was constructed at Duntroon.

500|$|As the Comet {{represented}} {{a new category}} of passenger aircraft, more rigorous testing was a <b>development</b> <b>priority.</b> From 1947 to 1948, de Havilland conducted an extensive research and development phase, {{including the use of}} several stress test rigs at Hatfield for small components and large assemblies alike. Sections of pressurised fuselage were subjected to high-altitude flight conditions via a large decompression chamber on-site, and tested to failure. However, tracing fuselage failure points proved difficult with this method, and de Havilland ultimately switched to conducting structural tests with a water tank that could be safely configured to increase pressures gradually. The entire forward fuselage section was tested for metal fatigue by repeatedly pressurising to [...] overpressure and depressurising through more than 16,000 cycles, equivalent to about 40,000hours of airline service. [...] The windows were also tested under a pressure of , [...] above expected pressures at the normal service ceiling of [...] One window frame survived , about 1,250 percent over the maximum pressure it was expected to encounter in service.|$|E
