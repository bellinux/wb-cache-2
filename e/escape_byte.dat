50|$|In {{addition}} to the ISO-2022 character sets, the following custom sets are available too. The byte designation follows the <b>escape</b> <b>byte</b> (hexadecimal 1B). There is no intermediate byte.|$|E
50|$|The VEX prefix {{replaces the}} most {{commonly}} used instruction prefix <b>bytes</b> and <b>escape</b> codes. In many cases, the number of prefix <b>bytes</b> and <b>escape</b> <b>bytes</b> that are replaced {{is the same as the}} number of bytes in the VEX prefix, so that the total length of the VEX-encoded instruction is the same as the length of the legacy instruction code. In other cases, the VEX-encoded version is longer or shorter than the legacy code. In 32-bit mode VEX encoded instructions can only access the first 8 YMM/XMM registers; the encodings for the other registers would be interpreted as the legacy LDS and LES instructions that are not supported in 64-bit mode.|$|R
25|$|The bytes 0xFE and 0xFF do not appear, so a valid UTF-8 stream never {{matches the}} UTF-16 byte order mark and thus cannot be {{confused}} with it. The absence of 0xFF (0377) also eliminates the need to <b>escape</b> this <b>byte</b> in Telnet (and FTP control connection).|$|R
5000|$|The ISO/IEC 2022 coding {{specifies}} a two-layer mapping between {{character codes}} and displayed characters. In MARC-8, character codes from the 7-bit ASCII graphic range (0x20-0x7F) {{are referred to}} as [...] "G0" [...] codes, while codes from the [...] "high ASCII" [...] range (0xA0-0xFF) {{are referred to as}} the [...] "G1" [...] codes. Graphic character sets are designated and invoked by means of a multiple <b>byte</b> <b>escape</b> sequence consisting of the escape character, an Intermediate character sequence, and a Final character in the form ESC I F.|$|R
5000|$|Merrick <b>escapes</b> from <b>Bytes</b> {{with the}} help of his fellow freakshow attractions. Upon {{returning}} to London, he is harassed through Liverpool Street station by several young boys and accidentally knocks down a young girl. Merrick is chased, unmasked, and cornered by an angry mob. He cries, [...] "I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being! I ... am ... a ... man!" [...] before collapsing. Policemen return Merrick to the hospital and Treves. He recovers some of his health, but is dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Treves and Mrs. Mothershead take Merrick to see one of Mrs. Kendal's shows at the theatre, and Kendal dedicates the performance to him. A proud Merrick receives a standing ovation from the audience. Back at the hospital, Merrick thanks Treves for all he has done, and completes his church model. He lies down on his back in bed, imitating a sleeping child in a picture on his wall, and dies in his sleep. Merrick is consoled by a vision of his mother, who quotes Lord Tennyson's [...] "Nothing Will Die".|$|R
50|$|Unicode sets aside 65 code {{points for}} {{compatibility}} with ISO/IEC 2022. The Unicode control characters cover U+0000 - U+001F (C0 controls), U+007F (delete), and U+0080 - U+009F (C1 controls). Unicode only specifies semantics for U+001C - U+001F, U+0009 - U+000D, and U+0085. The {{rest of the}} control characters are transparent to Unicode and their meanings are left to higher-level protocols. The C1 characters in Unicode require 2 bytes to be encoded in UTF-8 (for instance CSI at U+009B is encoded as the bytes 0xC2, 0x9B in UTF-8). Thus the corresponding control functions are more commonly accessed using the equivalent two <b>byte</b> <b>escape</b> sequence intended for use with systems that have only 7-bit bytes.|$|R
