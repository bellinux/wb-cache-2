25|$|With 38 stations, the Harlem Line has {{the most}} of any Metro-North main line. Its {{northern}} terminal, Wassaic, is the northernmost station in the system. It is the only Metro-North line used exclusively by that carrier (no use by Amtrak, though CSX services <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> as far north as Mount Vernon) and the only one that uses the entirety of existing track. Metro-North has assigned it the color code blue, used as trim on station signs and spot color on printed timetables. The blue color-coding appears to have started with timetables issued by predecessor New York Central as far back as 1965.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} two {{high-level}} side platforms, each eight cars long; each {{is served by}} a passenger elevator and stairs. Platform A has the station's only station house, a two-story building. The two middle tracks, not next to either platform, are used by nearly all trains except the Hempstead Branch. A non-powered storage track is south of the south platform. The Queens Village Freight Yard is located {{just west of the}} station, and consists of three tracks. It is used by the LIRR for maintenance and storage, and was sporadically by LIRR <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> before the New York and Atlantic Railway assumed freight service operations.|$|E
25|$|GTW {{continued}} to dieselize its locomotive fleet in the 1940s and 1950s primarily with models from EMD which {{was owned by}} one of GTW's largest <b>freight</b> <b>customers,</b> General Motors. The exceptions were approximately 40 Alco S-2 and S-4 switching locomotives. Other diesel locomotives from EMD included several NW2s, SW900s and SW1200s purchased for switching duties in rail yards and on branch lines. Grand Trunk Western's first mainline road diesel locomotives were almost two dozen EMD F3As acquired in 1948. They would be followed in the 1950s by EMD GP9s and GP18s for freight and passenger service. The GP9s would be rebuilt by GTW's Battle Creek locomotive shops into GP9Rs with improved internal components and modern low-nose cabs.|$|E
50|$|Palmer {{would also}} {{construct}} large buildings along these streets and lease {{the space to}} Class 1 railroads as freight depots. A <b>freight</b> <b>customer</b> could ship or take delivery of their items with the West Shore, Erie or Central Railroad of New Jersey among others at these <b>freight</b> depots. <b>Customers</b> would now {{have a choice of}} carrier to transport their goods.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 the B&O assets, {{including}} the Frederick Branch, were acquired by CSX. As of 2012 {{the only remaining}} <b>freight</b> <b>customer</b> on the branch was Willard Agri Services of Frederick, located on Wisner Street.|$|R
50|$|Their {{facilities}} in Warminster include a private railroad spur, {{served by the}} New Hope and Ivyland Railroad. Traffic on the spur constitutes a sizable portion of the railroad's freight traffic; CRC Industries is their largest <b>freight</b> <b>customer.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{three major}} {{metropolitan}} areas - North Jersey, South Jersey/Philadelphia, and Detroit - Conrail Shared Assets Operations continues {{to serve as}} a terminal operating company owned by both CSX and NS. The Conrail Shared Assets Operations arrangement was a concession made to federal regulators who were concerned about the lack of competition in certain rail markets and logistical problems associated with the breaking up the Conrail operations as they existed in densely populated areas with many local customers. The smaller Conrail operation that exists today serves rail <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> in these markets on behalf of its two owners. A fourth area, the former Monongahela Railway in southwest Pennsylvania, was originally owned jointly by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Pennsylvania Railroad and Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. Conrail absorbed the company in 1993, and assigned trackage rights to CSX, the successor to the B and P With the Conrail breakup, those lines are owned by NS, but the CSX trackage rights are still in place.|$|E
2500|$|Only a few rail <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> {{remain in}} or near Boston, {{including}} a chemical packager in Allston, and food distribution facilities and a scrap metal processor in Everett. The Class III [...] Fore River Railroad serves two major customers in Quincy. A plan to ship ethanol by rail to a gasoline mixing plant in Revere was reviewed in 2013. In the face of community opposition and pressure from the state legislature, the company withdrew its proposal on July 2, days before the Lac-Mégantic derailment.|$|E
50|$|Several <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> {{are located}} along the branch, which is served several times weekly by the New York & Atlantic Railway.|$|E
50|$|The local stone quarry was an {{important}} <b>freight</b> <b>customer</b> with its own connecting tracks. There, grindstones and millstones were produced and loaded in the first decades. The connecting track from Weidenthal station is currently used by the Feinpapierfabrik Glatz paper factory in nearby Neidenfels.|$|R
50|$|After {{the turmoil}} of World War II, {{operations}} were resumed {{in the summer of}} 1945 and operations were taken over in 1949 by Deutsche Bundesbahn. In the 1950s a freight link was opened from Frenz station to Weisweiler power station. This eventually became the most important <b>freight</b> <b>customer</b> for the line.|$|R
50|$|Seminole Gulf {{has also}} {{operated}} general excursion trains in the past. Seminole Gulf introduced passenger excursion trains in 1991 after losing a major <b>freight</b> <b>customer.</b> Excursion trains and were initially based {{from a small}} platform in North Naples near Railhead Park, but moved to the current station at Colonial Boulevard in Fort Myers shortly after.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} in time, the company {{acquired}} a reputation for innovation and aggressiveness by developing several unique services for <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> and passengers.|$|E
50|$|Freight {{traffic is}} no longer carried out on the line. The last <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> were Lego and some other firms in Hohenwestedt and the Bundeswehr in Albersdorf.|$|E
50|$|The road served <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> {{from the}} beginning, notably cotton mills in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey. Several other factories, {{including}} a paper mill, were built {{due to the}} railroad.|$|E
50|$|Freight rail {{transportation}} had been provided by Norfolk Southern via off-peak use of New Jersey Transit's Gladstone Branch line until a final run on November 7, 2008, after 126 years of service. The Berkeley Heights plant of Reheis Chemical located on Snyder Avenue {{was the last}} <b>freight</b> <b>customer</b> on the Gladstone Branch, receiving shipments of hydrochloric acid.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, Yangtze River Express {{announced}} they too would cease their cargo operations at Frankfurt-Hahn Airport {{in favour of}} Munich Airport. Frankfurt-Hahn lost its largest <b>freight</b> <b>customer</b> and four cargo destinations. Months earlier, Qatar Airways and Aeroflot had also ceased their cargo operations at the airport. By July 2015, the airport's freight numbers dropped by 36 percent.{cn} ...|$|R
50|$|The Ontario Eastern Railroad was a shortline freight {{railroad}} {{formed in}} 1981 {{to operate a}} portion of the former Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad from Ogdensburg to DeKalb Junction. The primary <b>freight</b> <b>customer</b> was a paper mill located in Ogdensburg. When the mill shut down in 1985, the railroad ended operations. Formal abandonment followed in 1987 and the tracks were scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Metrolinx, {{the parent}} of GO Transit, {{purchased}} the 25 km Weston Subdivision from Canadian National Railway in 2009, including this section of track. CN will continue to serve its <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> {{in the area and}} VIA will operate trains on the line.|$|E
50|$|Hector Rail is a Swedish-based {{independent}} train haulage provider {{operating in}} the European rail transport market, operating 50 locomotives. The company provides locomotives and drivers to <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> who need to have whole unit trains hauled between two places with a regular time table.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Eric {{responded to}} the {{turbulence}} {{in the global economy}} by implementing a company-wide reinvigoration plan. Eric and his team drove growth in company performance and a culture of continuous improvement. The team drove improvements that led to new products and lower prices for Harbor <b>Freight</b> <b>customers.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1959, the {{passenger}} traffic was terminated. However, in 1991, the Verein Thörlerbahn (Thörlerbahn Association) {{took out a}} trial run with a nostalgic train. But when a bank failure bankrupted the local iron industry, the operator of the railway, Steiermärkische Landesbahnen, lost their largest (and actually the only) <b>freight</b> <b>customer.</b> As a consequence of that, they had to close the track.|$|R
50|$|The Peach Bottom Railway entered Delta in 1876, {{and shipped}} slate along its line to Red Lion and York, Pennsylvania. From the south, the Maryland Central Railroad reached Delta in 1883 and began {{operating}} trains from Delta to Bel Air, Maryland and Baltimore in 1884. Both lines were later succeeded by the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad, which operated until 1978. The slate quarry {{was a major}} <b>freight</b> <b>customer</b> until 1971.|$|R
50|$|Kindsbach {{station was}} founded after 1871 and {{is located in}} the north-west of the local {{community}} of Kindsbach. It belongs to station category 6 and is served by the services of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn and Regionalbahn services on the Kaiserslautern-Kusel route. From the 1920s onwards, the company of Formsandwerke Ludwigshafen am Rhein, which quarried moulding sand and transported it by cableway to the station, was a significant <b>freight</b> <b>customer.</b>|$|R
50|$|On December 29, 1954, Capital Transit {{lost one}} of its last <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> when the East Washington Railway took over the {{delivery}} of coal from the B&O to the PEPCO power plant at Benning. Previously this had been done using Capital Transit's steeple-cab electric locomotives operating over a remnant of the Benning car line.|$|E
50|$|Freight {{is handled}} at Altenkirchen {{operating}} over the Holzbach Valley Railway (Siershahn-Altenkirchen railway). Since 2006, Westerwaldbahn GmbH (WEBA) has been serving <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> by rail on the Selters-Raubach-Altenkirchen route, including a siding in Neitersen and the Schutztankbau company in Selters, {{where the line}} runs between the factory buildings. Class On Rail DH 1004 diesel locomotives are used.|$|E
50|$|The NY&A has {{substantially}} different crewing agreements than the Long Island Rail Road, allowing it more flexibility {{to match the}} needs of <b>freight</b> <b>customers.</b> NY&A has two crewbases, one in Glendale, Queens and another near the former LIRR station Pine Aire on the main line, between Deer Park and Brentwood. On a typical weekday, NY&A operates six crews.|$|E
50|$|Like all {{stations}} {{along the}} Ludwig Railway at that time, the station had facilities for handling freight. The local stone quarry {{was an important}} <b>freight</b> <b>customer</b> with its own connecting tracks. Grindstones and millstones were produced and loaded on them. In 1871, the normal freight trains on the Ludwig Railway on the Kaiserslautern-Mainz, Homburg-Frankenthal, Ludwigshafen-Neunkirchen, Worms-Homburg routes stopped at the station for between three and five minutes. In addition there was a stone train on the Kaiserslautern-Ludwigshafen route, which stopped at the station {{for a total of}} 15 minutes.|$|R
2500|$|Rolling {{stock in}} a rail {{transport}} system generally encounters lower frictional resistance than road vehicles, so passenger and freight cars (carriages and wagons) can be coupled into longer trains. The operation {{is carried out}} by a railway company, providing transport between train stations or <b>freight</b> <b>customer</b> facilities. Power is provided by locomotives which either draw electric power from a railway electrification system [...] or produce their own power, usually by diesel engines. Most tracks are accompanied by a signalling system. Railways are a safe land transport system {{when compared to other}} forms of transport. Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilization and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more capital-intensive than road transport, when lower traffic levels are considered.|$|R
50|$|A {{bank failure}} in 1995 {{led to the}} local iron {{industry}} going bankrupt, so after {{the loss of the}} largest (and practically only) <b>freight</b> <b>customer,</b> the National Railways felt compelled to close the railway. The Thörlerbahn Association was able to operate over {{the entire length of the}} railway until the end of the 1997 season, however for financial reasons were not able to take control of the entire 20 km length. There was a lack of support of the railway in the region, local preferences were to convert the railway into a bicycle track and to widen the federal highway. The Thörlerbahn Association announced bankruptcy after loss of the season 1998, and the vehicles were sold or returned to their owners. On 31 October 1999 a hand trolley was driven on the Thörlerbahn for the last time.|$|R
50|$|The {{railroad}} {{now holds}} the passenger rights {{on the entire}} State of NH-owned track running from Tilton to Lincoln, a total of 54 mi. This additional mileage allows the operation of many special excursion trains. The state owns another 19 mi of track from Tilton to Concord, which {{is used by the}} New England Southern Railroad for <b>freight</b> <b>customers.</b>|$|E
50|$|While <b>freight</b> <b>customers</b> {{remained}} on Metro-North's Harlem Line, the HRRC {{was not allowed}} to serve them directly. A few freight shipments were forwarded from Danbury by Metro-North crews, but this arrangement was only temporary until the remaining customers converted to truck transportation. On December 31, 1996, the Danbury Terminal Railroad was merged into the Housatonic Railroad.|$|E
50|$|NHRR is {{involved}} in the import and export of raw materials and manufactured products. <b>Freight</b> <b>customers</b> range from national chemical companies to consumer product manufacturers. NHRR interchanges with Pennsylvania Northeastern Railroad in Warminster, which in turn interchanges with CSX Transportation in Lansdale. NHRR's primary customers are based in Warminster; CRC Industries, Castrol and Double H Plastics are served on a weekly basis.|$|E
50|$|Local {{service from}} Oak Point Yard runs to an {{interchange}} with the New York and Atlantic Railway (NY&A) at Fresh Pond Junction Yard in Queens. From Fresh Pond the NY&A takes <b>freight</b> to <b>customers</b> on the Long Island Rail Road, {{as well as}} the city-owned 65th Street Yard in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, via the Bay Ridge Branch.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, CPR {{sold the}} middle {{part of the}} {{corridor}} to RailAmerica. Despite the purchase by RailAmerica, freight traffic continued to decline {{and the future of}} the E&N was still in doubt. RailAmerica sought a sale for its acquisition due to unprofitably and deferred maintenance issues. Restrictions from Canadian Pacific on the lease/sale agreement, and major reconstruction of Highway 1 from Victoria to Nanaimo and the new freeway from Nanaimo to Campbell River, led to reduced driving times for the full length of the E&N. This development also affected the privately owned rail line, which did not have the benefit of the provincial subsidies accorded to its competing highways. Freight traffic dropped to about 2000 carloads a year after the loss of their largest <b>freight</b> <b>customer,</b> a Catalyst Paper pulp mill in Port Alberni. RailAmerica ceased to operate the E&N on 30 June 2006, with the Washington Group's Southern Railway of British Columbia taking over operations the following day under the name Southern Railway of Vancouver Island.|$|R
50|$|The local brickworks, {{established}} in 1877 by Isaac Chippindale sr. {{close to the}} station, were a main <b>freight</b> <b>customer,</b> but were not permitted their own sidings and had to transport their products to the station by road. Upon doubling of the line in 1901, a second platform with a wooden waiting room was built, and a third goods siding added. In the 1950s the road bridge across the tracks south of the station was reconstructed. While the station closed to passengers on 6 January 1964, it remained open for goods until 27 April 1964. The stationmaster ran a coal sale as a private concern under licence from the railways. Following closure, the business continued from the former goods yard, and moved later to Garforth. It closed upon retirement of the last stationmaster in 1993. The station building was leased to an electrical contractor in the late 1960s and converted into a restaurant in 1979.|$|R
