5|$|The key {{geographical}} {{features that}} had influenced the landings also influenced {{the next phase}} of the battle: the <b>draws,</b> the natural exits off the beaches, were the main targets in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these <b>draws</b> meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault. In the areas between the <b>draws,</b> at the bluffs, units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the <b>draws,</b> thus most advances were made there.|$|E
