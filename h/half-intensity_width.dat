50|$|J2144-3933 {{is notable}} for other reasons: its mean pulse profile is very narrow in {{comparison}} to the pulse period with a <b>half-intensity</b> <b>width</b> of less than one degree of longitude. It also has the lowest spindown luminosity of any pulsar at about 3&times;1021 watts.|$|E
40|$|Review of interferometric, {{photoelectric}} {{scans of}} the interstellar calcium K-lines in the spectra of 65 stars. The scans were obtained with a PEPSIOS spectrometer having a passband {{with a full}} <b>half-intensity</b> <b>width</b> of 1. 0 km/sec or 0. 013 A. The fivefold improvement in resolution over that used by Adams reveals numerous line components which correspond very well {{to those of the}} interstellar sodium lines, apart from frequent differences in relative intensities...|$|E
40|$|A {{slotted disk}} type {{mechanical}} velocity selector, 10 cm long and 16 cm in diameter, consisting of six disks has been constructed and tested. The velocity resolution {{corresponding to the}} <b>half‐intensity</b> <b>width</b> is 0. 047; no velocity sidebands are transmitted. The effective fractional open time to the incident beam is 0. 35. At the highest rotor speed used (17 000 rpm) the transmitted velocity is 1. 05 × 105 cm∕sec. A general theoretical analysis of the transmission and resolution of selectors with disks of finite thickness is presented. The velocity distribution is reported for a molecular beam effusing from an oven equipped with Zacharias corrugated foil exit canals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Internal kinematics, spectroscopic {{binaries}} and galactic motion are {{investigated for}} the trapezium system BD+ 00 ◦ 1617 (which {{lies at the}} heart of the young open cluster Bochum 2) by means of 73 high resolution Echelle+CCD spectra secured over the period 1994 – 98. Two of the three O-type member stars are found to be binaries on close and highly eccentric orbits of 6. 8 and 11. 0 day period. The spectra of the two binaries show large variations in the <b>half-intensity</b> and equivalent <b>widths</b> of the HeI absorption lines, which are intrinsic to the primaries and are not correlated to the orbital phase. Astrometric and radial velocities exclude that one of the component is leaving as a runaway star, but upper limits are still compatible with the trapezium evaporating at very low relative velocities. The projected rotational velocities of the three constituent O– type stars are low. This conforms to expectations from the high frequency of binaries. The observed radial velocity of Bochum 2 agrees with Hron (1987) expression for the Galaxy rotation inside the latter’s quoted errors...|$|R

40|$|Monostatic and {{bistatic}} radar {{techniques for}} {{the measurement of}} the structure of volume targets in the troposphere and lower stratosphere are reviewed. The targets considered are thin turbulent layers in the lower stratosphere and rain in the troposphere. The measurements of scattering from thin turbulent layers show that layers are generally detected at or near the tropopause, and in 31 out of 34 sets of measurements, layers were detected above the tropopause in the lower 10 km of the stratosphere. The threshold for turbulent layer detection corresponds to an equivalent thickness product of ten to the minus 13 th power times the cube root of m at a range of 100 km and for layers with less than 1000 m thickness. The measurement of scattering by rain shows that in the New England area both convective and widespread rain consists of a number of small cells. On average, the cells appear to have a <b>half-intensity</b> <b>width</b> of 3 to 4 km as measured with a radar system with a 1. 8 km resolution cell size for cells at 100 km range...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{velocity}} {{dependence of the}} angular intensity distribution of potassium and cesium beams scattered by a crossed beam of mercury are presented. The alkali beam was velocity selected, with a triangular velocity distribution (<b>half‐intensity</b> <b>width</b> 4. 7 % of peak velocity); {{the velocity}} was varied over the range 185 – 1000 m/sec. The Hg beam had a thermal distribution; the average Hg speed was ∼ 235 meters per second. The scattering data have been converted to the center‐of‐mass system. The angular distributions show the expected strong forward scattering and evidence the phenomenon of rainbow scattering. The energy dependence of the rainbow angle is {{used to evaluate the}} interatomic potential well depth, interpreted as the dissociation energy De of the 2 Σ+ molecular ground state. Values (in erg× 1014) thus obtained (± 5 %) are 7. 46 for KHg and 7. 72 for CsHg. Absolute values of differential cross sections could not be obtained; only relative cross sections D(θ) are reported. The observed low‐angle behavior D(θ) ∝θ‐ 7 / 3 serves as direct experimental confirmation of the r— 6 dependence of the long‐range attractive potential for K☒Hg and Cs☒Hg systems...|$|E
