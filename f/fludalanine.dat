40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>fludalanine</b> (MK 641) combined with pentizidone (MK 642) {{so as to}} give a <b>fludalanine</b> /D-cycloserine ratio of 1 : 1 was compared with the activities of ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim against 452 recent isolates and known beta-lactam- and trimethoprim-resistant strains. In addition, the in vitro activity of <b>fludalanine</b> - pentizidone on four different media, including a defined medium (DFN - 2), was studied. The MIC of <b>fludalanine</b> - pentizidone against 90 % of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Providencia stuartii, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, and fecal streptococci was 4 micrograms or less per ml on DFN - 2, and activity was somewhat reduced on the other media. Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90 % MIC, {{less than or equal}} to 64 micrograms/ml) and Bacteroides spp. (90 % MIC, 16 micrograms/ml) were less susceptible. Generally, <b>fludalanine</b> - pentizidone was less active than ceftazidime and comparable in activity to cefuroxime. beta-Lactamase-producing and trimethoprim-resistant strains tended to be susceptible to <b>fludalanine</b> - pentidizone. In the absence of human serum, the MBC of <b>fludalanine</b> - pentizidone was similar to the MIC. In the presence of increasing concentrations of human serum, there tended to be a greater difference between the MIC and MBC...|$|E
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} agent <b>fludalanine</b> [2 - 2 H- 3 -fluoro-o-alanine (DFA) ] {{is a potent}} inhibitor of bacterial alanine racemase, an enzyme required for the generation of D-alanine, {{an essential component of}} the bac-terial cell wall. Primary metabolism of DFA involves its oxidation to fluoropyruvate (FP); this organic fluoride is then rapidly reduced to fluorolactate (FL) which is the major organic metabolite in laboratory animals. Gas-liquid chromatographic chemical ionization mass spec-trometric assays were developed for these two metabolites. FL is the predominant organofluoride metabolite of DFA in the circulation. FP was detected in the urine although recovery was very low. The rapid conversion of FP to FL precludes assay of the former in serum. Maximum serum FL concentrations in the rat appear about 1 hr after the dose of DFA and are relatively constant for several hours there-after. The peak FL concentration is proportional to the dose of DFA...|$|E
