2500|$|Kudzu {{has also}} been used for centuries in East Asia to make herbal teas and tinctures. Kudzu powder is used in Japan to make an herbal tea called kuzuyu. [...] Kakkonto (葛根湯, Mandarin Chinese: gěgēntāng, Japanese: kakkontō) is a herbal drink with its origin in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine. It is made from a mixture of ginger, cinnamon, Chinese peony, licorice, jujube, ephedra, and powder ground from {{the root of the}} kudzu plant, one of the 50 fundamental herbs. As the name, which translates literally to [...] "kudzu infusion", implies, kudzu, or pueraria lobata, serves as the main ingredient. Together these plants are used to create a drink containing puerarin, <b>daidzein,</b> paenoflorin, cinnamic acid, glycyrrhizin, ephedrine and gingerol.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Daidzein</b> {{and other}} {{isoflavone}} compounds, such as genistein, {{are present in}} a number of plants and herbs like Kwao Krua (Pueraria mirifica) and Kudzu (Pueraria lobata). It can also be found in Maackia amurensis cell cultures. [...] <b>Daidzein</b> can be found in food such as soybeans and soy products like tofu and textured vegetable protein. Soy isoflavones are a group of compounds found in and isolated from the soybean. Of note, total isoflavones in soybeans are—in general—37 percent <b>daidzein,</b> 57 percent genistein and 6 percent glycitein, according to USDA data. Soy germ contains 41.7 percent <b>daidzein.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While {{many more}} {{bacteria}} {{are involved in}} the related intermediate process of (S)-equol production, such as conversion of daidzin to <b>daidzein,</b> or genistein to 5-Hydroxy-equol, the bacteria that can produce a complete conversion of <b>daidzein</b> to (S)-equol, are the following:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884333/table/tbl1/ ...|$|E
5000|$|... (S)-Equol is a {{very stable}} {{molecule}} that essentially remains unchanged when digested, and this lack of further metabolism explains its very quick absorption and high bioavailability.When (S)-equol is consumed, it is rapidly absorbed and achieves a Tmax (rate of peak plasma concentration) {{in two to three}} hours. In comparison, the Tmax of the <b>daidzein</b> is 4 to 10 hours because it occurs in a glycoside (with a glucose (sugar) side chain) form and the body must, in order to use <b>daidzein,</b> convert <b>daidzein</b> to its aglycone form (without the glucose side chain), achieved through removal of the sugar during digestion. If consumed directly in aglycone form, <b>daidzein</b> has a Tmax of one to three hours.Also, the percent fractional elimination of (S)-equol in urine after oral administration is extremely high and, in some adults, can be close to 100 percent, which is far higher than the percent fractional eliminations of either <b>daidzein</b> (30 to 40 percent) or genistein (7 to 15 percent).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Daidzein</b> (7-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-chromen-4-one) is a {{naturally}} occurring compound found exclusively in soybeans and other legumes and structurally {{belongs to a}} class of compounds known as isoflavones. <b>Daidzein</b> and other isoflavones are produced in plants through the phenylpropanoid pathway of secondary metabolism and are used as signal carriers, and defense responses to pathogenic attacks. [...] In humans, recent research has shown the viability of using <b>daidzein</b> in medicine for menopausal relief, osteoporosis, blood cholesterol, and lowering the risk of some hormone-related cancers, and heart disease.|$|E

50|$|A radical {{mechanism}} {{has been}} proposed {{in order to obtain}} <b>daidzein</b> from liquiritigenin, where an iron-containing enzyme, as well as NAPDH and oxygen cofactors are used by a 2-hydroxyisoflavone synthase to oxidize liquiritigenin to a radical intermediate (C). A 1,2 aryl migration follows to form (D), which is subsequently oxidized to (E). Lastly, dehydration of the hydroxy group on C2 occurs through 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase to give <b>daidzein.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of <b>daidzein</b> {{begins with}} L-phenylalanine and undergoes a general phenylpropanoid pathway where the shikimate derived aromatic ring is {{shifted to the}} adjacent carbon of the heterocycle. The process begins with phenylalanine ligase (PAL) cleaving the amino group from L-Phe forming the unsaturated carboxylic acid, cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is then hydroxylated by membrane protein cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) to form p-coumaric acid. P-coumaric acid then acts as the starter unit which gets loaded with coenzyme A by 4-coumaroyl:CoA-ligase (4CL). The starter unit (A) then undergoes three iterations of malonyl-CoA resulting in (B), which enzymes chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone reductase (CHR) modify to obtain trihydroxychalcone. CHR is NADPH dependent. Chalcone isomerase (CHI) then isomerizes trihydroxychalcone to liquiritigenin, the precursor to <b>daidzein.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Most {{studies of}} phytoestrogens in soy have {{identified}} the isoflavones genistein and <b>daidzein</b> as its principal phytoestrogenic substances. For several soy flour samples analyzed by various persons using high-performance liquid chromatography, <b>daidzein</b> content ranged from 226 to 2100 micrograms per gram, and genistein content ranged from 478 to 1123 micrograms per gram. For four analyses of defatted soy meal, the concentrations were 616 and 753 micrograms per gram, respectively; for one analysis of soybean meal (whole), concentrations were 706 and 1000 micrograms per gram, respectively.

50|$|Isoflavones are {{produced}} via {{a branch of}} the general phenylpropanoid pathway that produces flavonoid compounds in higher plants. Soybeans are the most common source of isoflavones in human food; the major isoflavones in soybean are genistein and <b>daidzein.</b> The phenylpropanoid pathway begins from the amino acid phenylalanine, and an intermediate of the pathway, naringenin, is sequentially converted into the isoflavone genistein by two legume-specific enzymes, isoflavone synthase, and a dehydratase. Similarly, another intermediate naringenin chalcone is converted to the isoflavone <b>daidzein</b> by sequential action of three legume-specific enzymes: chalcone reductase, type II chalcone isomerase, and isoflavone synthase. Plants use isoflavones and their derivatives as phytoalexin compounds to ward off disease-causing pathogenic fungi and other microbes. In addition, soybean uses isoflavones to stimulate soil-microbe rhizobium to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules.|$|E
50|$|A 1995 review {{concluded}} that soy protein is correlated with significant decreases in serum cholesterol, LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides. However, HDL (good cholesterol) {{did not increase}} by a significant amount. Soy phytoestrogens (isoflavones: genistein and <b>daidzein)</b> adsorbed onto the soy protein were suggested as the agent reducing serum cholesterol levels.|$|E
