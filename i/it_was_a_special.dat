5|$|Following the {{expulsion}} of the Fatimids from Egypt, al-Ikhshid had his troops occupy all of Syria up to Aleppo, allying himself, as Ibn Tulun had done, with the local tribe of Banu Kilab to strengthen his hold over northern Syria. As governor of Syria, his remit extended to the borderlands (thughur) with the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia. Thus in 936/7 or 937/8 (most likely in autumn 937) he received an embassy from the Byzantine emperor, Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944), to organize a prisoner exchange. Although {{carried out in the}} name of Caliph al-Radi, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> honour and an implicit recognition of al-Ikhshid's autonomy, since correspondence and negotiations for such events were normally directed to the caliph rather than provincial governors. The exchange took place in autumn 938, resulting in the release of 6,300 Muslims for an equivalent number of Byzantine captives. As the Byzantines held 800 more prisoners than the Muslims, these had to be ransomed and were gradually released over the next six months.|$|E

It prioritised conservation of marine life and integrated management of biotopes, with a particular emphasis on international cooperation and coordination.

In 1993, Dimensions in Time was produced for the benefit of Children in Need, coinciding with the series' 30th Anniversary. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> in two parts, running about 12 minutes in total, which featured all surviving Doctors (including Tom Baker in his first appearance as the character since 1981), {{and more than a dozen}} former companions. Not meant to be taken seriously, the story had the Rani opening a hole in time, cycling the Doctor and his companions through his previous incarnations and menacing them with monsters from the show's past. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location.|$|E

500|$|The final credits {{movie that}} was in the PlayStation 2 version of the game was removed from the Wii version, much to Kamiya's regret as it removed the omoi—"a {{combination}} of thoughts, emotions, and messages" [...] — from the game: [...] " [...] the omoi of everyone who worked on the project, put together in a moment of bliss held out just for those who completed the journey. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> staff roll for a special moment. And now it is gone. All of it. ...It's incredibly disappointing and sad." [...] A Capcom representative stated that the credits, a pre-rendered movie, had the Clover Studio logo within it, and they had [...] "no legal right to use the Clover logo in a game they were not involved with directly". Since they also lacked the source to the credits, they opted to remove them entirely from the game. Ready at Dawn's co-founder Didier Malenfant also claimed that the Wii version of Ōkami took up much more space on the game media than the PlayStation 2 version, and that the movie was cut in order to fit everything on a single game disk, however despite these claims, the credit sequence was restored in the Japanese release of the Wii version and revealed that the port was co-developed by Tose, having provided additional planners, designers, programmers and test players. The images from the credits, although not the credits themselves, are still available as unlockable art.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{military}} government, self-named Proceso de Reorganización Nacional, {{put a stop}} to the guerrilla's campaigns, but soon it became known that extremely violent methods and severe violations of human rights had taken place, in what the dictatorship called a [...] "Dirty War" [...] a term refused by jurists during the 1985 Trial of the Juntas. Batallón de Inteligencia 601 (the 601st Intelligence Battalion) became infamous during this period. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> military intelligence service set up in the late 1970s, active in the Dirty War and Operation Condor, and disbanded in 2000. Its personnel collected information on and infiltrated guerrilla groups and human rights organisations, and coordinated killings, kidnappings and other abuses.

[...] Linda Gray also fondly remembered her time on the show: [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> time.

2500|$|As {{intended}} by Ribbentrop, the narrow time limit for {{acceptance of the}} [...] "final offer" [...] {{made it impossible for}} the British government to contact the Polish government in time about the German offer, let alone for the Poles to arrange for a Polish plenipotentiary envoy to arrive in Berlin that night, thereby allowing Ribbentrop to claim that the Poles had rejected the German [...] "final offer". As <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> meeting of the British cabinet called to consider the [...] "final offer", they declined to pass on the message to Warsaw under the grounds this was not a serious proposal on the part of Berlin. The [...] "rejection" [...] of the German proposal was one of the pretexts used for the German aggression against Poland on 1 September 1939. The British historian D.C. Watt wrote [...] "Two hours later, Berlin Radio broadcast the sixteen points, adding that Poland had rejected them. Thanks to Ribbentrop, they had never even seen them". On 31 August, Ribbentrop met with Ambassador Attolico to tell him that Poland's [...] "rejection" [...] of the [...] "generous" [...] German 16-point peace plan meant that Germany had no interest in Mussolini's offer to call a conference about the status of Danzig. Besides the Polish [...] "rejection" [...] of the German [...] "final offer", the aggression against Poland was justified with the Gleiwitz incident and other SS-staged incidents on the German–Polish border.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, a {{breakthrough}} in the sessions was achieved. While jamming on a song called [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—the band tried different chord progressions for the bridge. The jam stopped and the Edge tried playing them alone on an acoustic guitar, as [...] "everyone was trying to decide if they were any good." [...] At the suggestion of producer Daniel Lanois, the Edge played two separate sections sequentially. The band liked the way it flowed and decided to try and play it together. Speaking of the improvisation, the Edge said, [...] "suddenly something very powerful [...] happening in the room." [...] He added, [...] "Everyone recognized <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> piece. It was like we'd {{caught a glimpse of}} what the song could be." [...] Soon afterwards, the band had developed the piece of music into [...] "One". [...] Bono recalls that [...] "the melody, the structure—the whole thing was done in 15 minutes". [...] He also stated that the lyrics [...] "just fell out of the sky, a gift"; the concept was inspired by the band members' fracturing relationships, the German reunification, and Bono's scepticism of the hippie idea of [...] "oneness". Bono later sent a note to the Dalai Lama declining an invitation to a festival called Oneness, incorporating a line from the song: [...] "One—but not the same". [...] The song's writing inspired the band and changed their outlook on the recording sessions. Mullen Jr. said the song reaffirmed the band's [...] "blank page approach" [...] to recording and reassured the band that all was not lost.|$|E
2500|$|Adam is {{an expert}} swordsman; he carries a {{swordstick}} and will cold-bloodedly kill any enemy who deserves it. He {{is not the only}} British hero with such a weapon; John Steed of The Avengers had a sword umbrella, and Lord Peter Wimsey had a specially made sword cane with a compass, which was also marked in inches so it could serve as a measuring tool. [...] He was a Colonel and has been on the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895 – though he is naturally listed on their official records as being [...] "missing, presumed killed" [...] since 1902. He is also a good boxer and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in jujitsu, which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen. Adam immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina was threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by protection racketeers at a disco. Though there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adam rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, {{on the top of a}} multi-storey car park, which he had bought, at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. [...] It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a cleverly hidden call button. [...] He also purchased a Mini Cooper S with the personalised numberplate AA 1000.

2500|$|David Flying Hawk was {{the eldest}} son of Felix Flying Hawk. David was a {{performer}} with Wild West Shows and traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk. In 1924, David Flying Hawk performed in Rhode Island and had a notable encounter with a horse named “King Tut.” [...] “King Tut was a big bay, very rank horse, that we bought at Tribune, Kansas. [...] The real King Tut’s tomb had been discovered along about this time and papers were still carrying {{quite a bit of}} news about it, therefore the name King Tut. [...] The horse had been bucked away from a snubbing horse a few times and we thought he would develop; into a real good, tough bucking horse. [...] A lot of the credit for getting ole Tut started on the road to becoming a great horse must go to a Sioux Indian boy by the name of Dave Flying Hawk, who was on the Knights of Columbus rodeo with us in 1924. [...] This Indian and two others, of the carload that was with us, were bronc riders. [...] Dave was also part of the Indian dance troupe. The program for our opening performance in Providence, Rhode Island was somewhat in turmoil. [...] The Indian dancers had just finished when the arena director, Sammy Garrett, started calling for Flying Hawk to come to the bucking chutes, that his horse was in. [...] King Tut, being pretty wild. Had gone into the chutes first. [...] There being no time for Flying Hawk to change clothes, he came to the chutes in full dance costume—fringed buckskin clothes, feathers, bells—the whole works. [...] While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn’t been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut’s back. [...] When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk. [...] The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit. [...] It looked as though someone had shot a wild turkey—the crowd went wild. [...] They thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> act that Flying Hawk was putting on. [...] That was the funniest thong I’ve ever seen happened at a rodeo. [...] We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year. [...] I heard {{a few years ago that}} they bucked him until he was nearly twenty-six years old, but I’m sure that he was never as scared in his life as we was with Flying Hawk on board.” ...|$|E
