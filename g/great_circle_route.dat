5|$|The {{intended}} {{flight path}} was a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>route,</b> {{which would have}} taken them across the English Channel, over the southwestern part of England and Ireland, across the Atlantic to Newfoundland, then south over Nova Scotia, to Boston, and finally to a water landing in New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} autopilot modes. The standard mode for en-route navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>route</b> between waypoints, adjusting the aircraft's heading {{to compensate for}} wind. Other modes will maintain the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (flight path {{will be affected by}} winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (flight path in a straight direction). The latter two modes are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for the autopilot. Since Flight 370 flew near waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any waypoints in the Southern Indian Ocean. Waypoints MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these waypoints did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, many experimenters {{were looking for}} ways to use this concept for {{locating}} the position of a transmitter. Early radio systems generally used longwave or medium wave signals. Longwave, in particular, had good long-distance transmission characteristics due to their limited interaction with the ground, and thereby provided excellent <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>route</b> ground wave propagation that pointed directly to the transmitter. Methods of performing RDF on longwave signals was a major area of research during the 1900s and 1910s.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, Muslims from North America {{have used}} two rules to {{determine}} {{the direction of the}} Qiblah. According to spherical calculations, a Muslim praying from Anchorage, Alaska would pray almost due north if determining the Qiblah. However, when one looks at the world on most Mercator map projections, Mecca appears to be southwest of Anchorage. The shortest rhumb line (line of constant bearing) from most points in North America to Mecca will point toward the southeast, but the distance to Mecca along this route on the actual surface of the earth is longer than the <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{spring of}} 1947 Northwest began {{stationing}} employees at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, flying {{them from the}} United States via Alaska on its <b>Great</b> <b>Circle</b> <b>route.</b> On July 15, 1947 Northwest was the first airline to begin direct service between the United States and Japan, using a Douglas DC-4 airliner named The Manila. (All pre-war airline service to the Orient had been via Hawaii and the Philippines.) The flight to Japan originated at Wold-Chamberlain Field in Minneapolis and stopped at Blatchford Field in Edmonton, Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage, and Shemya AAF in the western Aleutian Islands. The flight continued from Tokyo to Lunghwa Airport in Shanghai and then to Nichols Field at Manila.|$|E

While the waves generated by the earthquake were limited, the event demonstrated the rapid onset of tsunami hazards, giving little time for coastal residents to prepare. And in this case, the strongest waves came ashore in Crescent City three to four hours after the initial surge, but it is possible to be just the opposite where the first waves could be the strongest. Also detailed from this event was that the wave hazard can be of long duration, with wave action lingering for more than eight hours.|$|E

50|$|The route was {{developed}} {{as one of}} four major routes along which United States aircraft were ferried to the major combat areas. It originated at several Army Air Bases in New England, which permitted short range single-engined aircraft to be flown to Britain using a series of intermediate airfields in Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland and Iceland. Long-range multi-engined aircraft could be flown from Newfoundland directly using <b>Great</b> <b>Circle</b> <b>routes</b> to airfields in Ireland and southwest England; or via the Azores to the UK or airfields in French Morocco to support Allied air forces in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO). Later in the war, air routes over the North Atlantic were developed from South Florida via Bermuda to the Azores.|$|R
5000|$|Strategic Air Command {{established}} a significant presence in Alaska {{in the late}} 1940s, initially {{as a result of}} its strategic reconnaissance mission.

With growing tensions in US-Soviet relations, SAC explored the possibility of attacking Soviet targets via <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>routes</b> over the North Pole as part of [...] "Project Nanook". Ladd AFB, however, due to the geography of its location, was unsuitable for SAC's postwar B-36 Peacemaker bomber as well as the new jet B-47 Stratojet. Ladd, being sited next to the Chena River, could not have its runway expanded to meet the requirements for these new aircraft.|$|R

50|$|During {{the pioneer}} powered flights over the Atlantic Ocean in the 1920s, {{it was already}} clear that an all-ocean route was suboptimal, {{especially}} when flying from east to west. The <b>Great</b> <b>Circle</b> <b>routes</b> from much of Europe to much of North America approach or pass over the island of Greenland, and strong jet stream winds are a further incentive to the westbound flyer to take a northern route. During the 1920s, however, little was known of climatic conditions on the coastline of Greenland, and almost literally nothing was known of the weather {{in the interior of}} Greenland during the polar winter. The Gino Watkins-led expedition of 1930-1931, the British Arctic Air Route Expedition, was intended to gather data aimed at solving these puzzles.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{aircraft}} and personnel reductions occurred in 1945 {{and almost all}} air bases other than Alexi Point, Shemya and Davis in the Aleutians were reduced to caretaker status. Weather hampered missions over the winter, although new B-24Js were received by the 404th Bomb Squadron and longer-range P-38L Lightnings were received by the 54th Fighter Squadron. Along with the mission against the Kuriels, the P-38s were assigned the mission of shooting down Japanese bomb-carrying Fire balloons which were launched from Japan along <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>routes</b> near the Aleutians. The balloons were designed to carry incendiary bombs over the United States and start fires in the Pacific Northwest. Although they floated above 38,000 feet, several were shot down, and one landed on Amchatka where intelligence personnel recovered it for inspection.|$|R

Northwest developed this route during World War II, when it flew soldiers and supplies from the Northwestern United States to Alaska; Northwest began painting its airliners' tails bright red as a visual aid in the often harsh weather conditions.

[...] The original DEW line was designed to detect bombers and was unable to detect intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). [...] To give warning of this threat, in 1958 a more sophisticated radar system was constructed, the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS).|$|E

40|$|Flight {{directions}} of birds migrating at high geographic and magnetic latitudes {{can be used}} to test bird orientation by celestial or geomagnetic compass systems under polar conditions. Migration patterns of arctic shorebirds, revealed by tracking radar studies during an icebreaker expedition along the Northwest Passage in 1999, support predicted sun compass trajectories but cannot be reconciled with orientation along either geographic or magnetic loxodromes (rhumb lines). Sun compass routes are similar to orthodromes (<b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>routes)</b> at high latitudes, showing changing geographic courses as the birds traverse longitudes and their internal clock gets out of phase with local time. These routes bring the shorebirds from high arctic Canada to the east coast of North America, from which they make transoceanic flights to South America. The observations are also consistent with a migration link between Siberia and the Beaufort Sea region by way of sun compass routes across the Arctic Ocean...|$|R
