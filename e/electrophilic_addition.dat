25|$|N-Bromosuccinimide or NBS is a {{chemical}} reagent used in radical substitution and <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition</b> reactions in organic chemistry. NBS {{can be a}} convenient source of Br•, the bromine radical.|$|E
25|$|Alkenes {{react in}} many {{addition}} reactions, which occur by {{opening up the}} double-bond. Most of these addition reactions follow the mechanism of <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition.</b> Examples are hydrohalogenation, halogenation, halohydrin formation, oxymercuration, hydroboration, dichlorocarbene addition, Simmons–Smith reaction, catalytic hydrogenation, epoxidation, radical polymerization and hydroxylation.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism occurs by initial {{formation of an}} iminium ion (2) followed by <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition</b> at the 3-position, {{in accordance with the}} expected nucleophilicity of indoles, to give the spirocycle 3. After migration of the best migrating group, deprotonation gives the product (5).|$|E

50|$|Fullerenes {{react in}} <b>electrophilic</b> <b>additions</b> as well. The {{reaction}} with bromine {{can add up}} to 24 bromine atoms to the sphere. The record holder for fluorine addition is C60F48. According to in silico predictions the as yet elusive C60F60 may have some of the fluorine atoms in endo positions (pointing inwards) and may resemble a tube more than it does a sphere.|$|R
25|$|Pyrroles react {{easily with}} nitrating (e.g. HNO3/Ac2O), sulfonating (Py·SO3), and halogenating (e.g. NCS, NBS, Br2, SO2Cl2, and KI/H2O2) agents. Halogenation {{generally}} provides polyhalogenated pyrroles, but monohalogenation can be performed. As is typical for <b>electrophilic</b> <b>additions</b> to pyrroles, halogenation generally {{occurs at the}} 2-position, but can also occur at the 3-position by silation of the nitrogen. This is a useful method for further functionalization of the generally less reactive 3-position.|$|R
25|$|Aromatic {{molecules}} typically display enhanced chemical stability, {{compared to}} similar non-aromatic molecules. A molecule {{that can be}} aromatic will tend to change toward aromaticity, and the added stability changes the chemistry of the molecule. Aromatic compounds undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution and nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, but not <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition</b> reactions as happens with carbon–carbon double bonds.|$|E
25|$|Thionyl {{chloride}} {{can engage}} {{in a range of}} <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition</b> reactions. It adds to alkenes in the presence of AlCl3 to form an aluminium complex which can be hydrolysed to form a sulfinic acid. Both aryl sulfinyl chlorides and diaryl sulfoxides can be prepared from arenes through reaction with thionyl chloride in triflic acid or the presence of catalysts such as BiCl3, Bi(OTf)3, LiClO4 or NaClO4.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{point for}} the {{synthesis}} of ring A was methoxydimethylindol 3 synthesised by condensation of the Schiff base from m-anisidine 1 and acetoin 2. Reaction with the Grignard reagent of propargyl iodide 4 give the propargyl indolenine 5 and ring-closure to 7 was brought about by boron trifluoride and mercuric oxide in methanol through intermediate 6 (<b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition)</b> with the two methyl groups forced into a cis-relationship.|$|E
50|$|Electron lone pair {{availability}} (basicity) {{is decreased}} compared to pyridine. Compared to pyridine, N-alkylation and N-oxidation are more difficult. The pKa value for protonated pyrimidine is 1.23 compared to 5.30 for pyridine. Protonation and other <b>electrophilic</b> <b>additions</b> {{will occur at}} only one nitrogen due to further deactivation by the second nitrogen. The 2-, 4-, and 6- positions on the pyrimidine ring are electron deficient analogous to those in pyridine and nitro- and dinitrobenzene. The 5-position is less electron deficient and substitutents there are quite stable. However, electrophilic substitution is relatively facile at the 5-position, including nitration and halogenation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Electrophilic</b> <b>additions</b> can be {{affected}} {{with a wide variety}} of organometallic reagents. Organosilanes offer the advantage of greater robustness to a wide array of reaction conditions than allyl compounds of more electropositive metals, and do not spontaneously undergo allylic rearrangement or epimerization. Additionally, organosilanes are rarely toxic and their reactions can be easily tracked by NMR spectroscopy (because of distinctive changes in the position of resonance of the methyl groups attached to silicon as addition occurs). Reactions of allylsilanes are similar in many respects to reactions of silyl enol ethers—in fact, allylsilanes can be used as masked enolate equivalents. After addition of the allylsilane, ozonolysis provides the corresponding carbonyl compound.(17) ...|$|R
25|$|In <b>addition</b> to <b>electrophilic</b> {{aromatic}} <b>addition,</b> resorcinol (and other poly-ols) undergo nucleophilic substitution via the enone form. With concentrated nitric acid, in {{the presence}} of cold concentrated sulfuric acid, it yields trinitro-resorcin (styphnic acid), which forms yellow crystals, exploding violently on rapid heating.|$|R
25|$|Many electrophilic substitutions on {{pyridine}} {{either do}} not proceed or proceed only partially; however, the heteroaromatic character can be activated by electron-donating functionalization. Common alkylations and acylations, such as Friedel–Crafts alkylation or acylation, usually fail for pyridine because they lead {{only to the}} addition at the nitrogen atom. Substitutions usually occur at the 3-position, {{which is the most}} electron-rich carbon atom in the ring and is, therefore, more susceptible to an <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fullerenes are stable, but {{not totally}} unreactive. The sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which {{are at their}} energy minimum in planar graphite, must be bent to form the closed sphere or tube, which {{produces}} angle strain. The characteristic reaction of fullerenes is <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition</b> at 6,6-double bonds, which reduces angle strain by changing sp2-hybridized carbons into sp3-hybridized ones. The change in hybridized orbitals causes the bond angles to decrease from about 120° in the sp2 orbitals to about 109.5° in the sp3 orbitals. This decrease in bond angles allows for the bonds to bend less when closing the sphere or tube, and thus, the molecule becomes more stable.|$|E
25|$|Boranes react {{rapidly to}} alkenes {{in a process}} called hydroboration. This concept was {{discovered}} by Dr. Herbert Charles Brown, work for which he eventually received the Nobel Prize (jointly with Georg Wittig for his discovery of the Wittig reaction). Although diborane as a pure compound is a dimer, BH3 forms 1:1 complexes with basic solvents, for instance THF. In an ordinary <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition</b> reaction of HX (X = Cl, Br, I, etc.), Markovnikov's rule, which states that the less electronegative atom, usually hydrogen, adds to the least substituted carbon of the double bond, this determines regioselectivity. With boranes the mode of action is the same, the hydrogen adds to the most substituted carbon because boron is less electronegative than hydrogen. When a positive charge develops in the alkene on the most substituted carbon atom, {{that is where the}} partially negatively charged hydrogen atom adds, leaving the least substituted carbon atom for the boron atom. The so-called anti-Markovnikov addition because when the boron is replaced with a hydroxyl group the overall reaction is addition of water over the double bond in what appears to be an anti-Makovnikov addition.|$|E
5000|$|In 1948, it was {{discovered}} that allyltrimethylsilane reacts with hydrobromic acid to give (2-bromopropyl)trimethylsilane. Six years later, the generation of (2-iodoethyl)trimethylsilane from vinylsilane and HI was observed. Since then, {{a number of studies have}} firmly established the mechanism of electrophilic attack on vinyl- and allylsilanes The electron-releasing strength of the carbon-silicon bond is large, and as a result, the position of silicon in the unsaturated silane controls the site of reaction and stereoselectivity. Formation of the new carbon-carbon bond is at the γ position of allyl silanes and the β position of vinylsilanes. The robustness of silanes makes them amenable to use in synthesis; however, because silicon is less electropositive than other metals employed in <b>electrophilic</b> <b>additions,</b> stronger electrophiles are required.(1) ...|$|R

2500|$|Major {{industrial}} {{reactions of}} ethylene include {{in order of}} scale: 1) polymerization, 2) oxidation, 3) halogenation and hydrohalogenation, 4) alkylation, 5) hydration, 6) oligomerization, and 7) hydroformylation. [...] In the United States and Europe, approximately 90% of ethylene is used to produce ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride, ethylbenzene and polyethylene. Most of the reactions with ethylene are <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In hydrohalogenation, an alkene {{reacts with}} a dry {{hydrogen}} halide (HX) like hydrogen chloride (...) or hydrogen bromide (...) to form a mono-haloalkane. The double bond of the alkene is replaced by two new bonds, one with the halogen and one with the hydrogen atom of the hydrohalic acid. Markovnikov's rule states that in this reaction, the halogen {{is more likely to}} become attached to the more substituted carbon. This is an <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition</b> reaction. Water must be absent otherwise there will be a side product of a halohydrin. The reaction is necessarily to be carried out in a dry inert solvent such as [...] or directly in the gaseous phase. The reaction of alkynes are similar, with the product being a geminal dihalide; once again, Markovnikov's rule is followed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{counterpart}} of elimination is the addition where {{double or triple}} bonds are converted into single bonds. Similar to the substitution reactions, there are several types of additions distinguished {{by the type of}} the attacking particle. For example, in the <b>electrophilic</b> <b>addition</b> of hydrogen bromide, an electrophile (proton) attacks the double bond forming a carbocation, which then reacts with the nucleophile (bromine). The carbocation can be formed {{on either side of the}} double bond depending on the groups attached to its ends, and the preferred configuration can be predicted with the Markovnikov's rule. This rule states that [...] "In the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne, the more electronegative (nucleophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{reactions}} of cis- and trans- 2 -tert-butyl- 4, 5 -epoxytetrahydropyran with HBr and with LAH {{have been examined}} {{as a model for}} the nucleophilic step of the reaction of the corresponding olefin with NBA in aqueous dioxane. A remarkable 90 : 10 preference for electrophilic attack syn to the tert -butyl group in the NBA reaction is found and shows that the two epoxides, as well as the intermediate epibromonium ions, undergo nucleophilic attack with high preference for diaxial opening, even when this requires reaction at carbon 5, which is more subject than carbon 4 to the unfavourable inductive effect of the pyran ring oxygen.

5000|$|<b>Electrophilic</b> <b>additions</b> of allylsilanes {{generally}} occur via an anti SE2' process. Allylsilanes react {{through a}} conformation {{in which the}} smallest substituent on the carbon attached to silicon is essentially eclipsing the double bond. The silyl moiety forces electrophilic attack on the face opposite the silyl group for steric and electronic reasons, although the effects are not large. This model predicts that when the double bond is 1,2-disubstituted, the Z isomer should exhibit greater selectivity than the E isomer, {{and this has been}} observed(5)Vinylsilane additions proceed with retention of double bond configuration, and follow a similar principle. After addition of the electrophile to the top or bottom face of the double bond, the silyl moiety rotates to become parallel to the adjacent empty 2p orbital. The principle of least motion provides that the electrophile moves into a position close to that formerly occupied by the silyl group. Thus, the configuration of the double bond is retained after loss of the silyl group.(6) ...|$|R

50|$|The carbon-silicon bond {{is highly}} electron-releasing and can {{stabilize}} a positive {{charge in the}} β position through hyperconjugation. <b>Electrophilic</b> <b>additions</b> to allyl- and vinylsilanes take advantage of this, and site selectivity generally reflects this property—electrophiles become bound to the carbon γ to the silyl group. The electron-donating strength of the carbon-silicon bond {{is similar to that}} of an acetamide substituent and equal to roughly two alkyl groups. After formation of the carbon-electrophile bond, silicon elimination is assisted by a nucleophile.(2)A model of the most likely reactive conformation of the allylsilane (see below) suggests that the new double bond that forms will predominantly possess the (E) configuration. However, addition of a nucleophile (such as the counterion of the electrophile) to the intermediate silyl-stabilized carbocation complicates this picture. Because the elimination to generate the double bond is stereospecifically anti, nucleophilic addition to either face of the silyl-stabilized carbanion leads to the formation of mixtures of double bond isomers. Diastereomeric mixtures of double bond isomers are common when Lewis acids are used to activate the electrophile.|$|R
