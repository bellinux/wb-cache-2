Kennedy Martin used the name GAIA for the <b>environmental</b> <b>organisation</b> Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial's conclusion from a passage in Lovelock's book that describes a dark marsh grass that grew {{on the surface of}} the Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was too cold to sustain life, simulated in Lovelock's Daisyworld model.|$|E
5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an <b>environmental</b> <b>organisation</b> founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E
5|$|Yorkshire {{police officer}} Ronald Craven (Bob Peck) is {{returning}} {{home with his}} daughter Emma (Joanne Whalley) having picked her up from a meeting of an <b>environmental</b> <b>organisation</b> at her university campus. On the doorstep of their home Emma is shot dead. The police concentrate their effort {{on the theory that}} her murder was a botched attempt on Craven's life by a criminal he had been responsible for convicting. However, as Craven goes through Emma's belongings, he discovers a geiger counter and a gun. He also learns that Emma's body and her possessions are radioactive. Travelling to London to assist with the inquiry, he is contacted by Pendleton (Charles Kay), a polished official “attached to the Prime Minister's office”, who informs him that Emma was known to them as a terrorist and that it may have been her, not Craven, who was the gunman's target.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The Committee inquired {{into the}} administration, {{transparency}} {{and effectiveness of}} the Register of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Organisations</b> under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. In seeking to improve the natural environment, many not-for-profit <b>environmental</b> <b>organisations</b> work hand-in-hand with communities across Australia. Much of this work relies on the generous financial contributions of members and supporters. Often these donations are tax-deductible, which recognises the public good that comes from environmental work. As such, public trust and confidence in the tax-concessional arrangements for <b>environmental</b> <b>organisations</b> is essential. The public should be assured that tax concessions are granted appropriately. Similarly, donors should be assured that their donations are distributed and used in line with their expectations. This inquiry considered the administration and transparency of the Register of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Organisations,</b> which is the Commonwealth scheme to enable eligible <b>environmental</b> <b>organisations</b> to receive tax-deductible donations. Consistent with the terms of reference, {{the focus of the}} inquiry was on the effectiveness of the Register in supporting communities to undertake practical action to improve the environment. In preparing the report of the inquiry, the Committee has identified measures to strengthen the integrity of tax-concessional arrangements for <b>environmental</b> <b>organisations.</b> The Committee has also identified scope to streamline the administration of the system. The recommendations outlined in the report are intended to make the system clearer for donors, <b>environmental</b> <b>organisations,</b> and the wider community...|$|R

500|$|American {{environmentalist}} {{and writer}} Bill McKibben lamented the {{film on the}} Climate Progress website, where he wrote [...] "The climate skeptics can crow. It's the kind of stupidity that hurts our side, reinforcing in people's minds a series of preconceived notions, {{not the least of}} which is that we're out-of-control and out of touch—not to mention off the wall, and also with completely misplaced sense of humor". McKibben added [...] "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10. When The Daily Caller asked about the film, <b>environmental</b> <b>organisation</b> Greenpeace spokeswoman Jane Kochersperger stated that [...] "as an organisation committed to non-violence, I think you can imagine how Greenpeace views this material. At this time, the only people promoting the material are climate skeptics and think tanks funded by corporations known for lobbying against climate change legislation". Five other environmental groups contacted by The Daily Caller did not comment on the film.|$|E

2500|$|Recognition for Holmgren's {{contribution}} as {{an environmental}} designer, educator and activist {{has been slow to}} develop after the initial enthusiasm generated by the publication of Permaculture One when he was 23. The inclusion in Ecological Pioneers (of Australia) was the first substantial recognition by academic authors. The inclusion of a three part series on Melliodora in a best of ten years of Gardening Australia, the most popular Australian TV gardening program and a person profile on the Australian broadcast network program Landline (ABC TV rural program) has been the most significant recognition by mainstream media. In 2012, following the publication of PP in Italian, the <b>environmental</b> <b>organisation</b> [...] recognised Holmgren's contribution with award Il Monito del Giardin.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there are}} {{currently}} no industrial activities on Bjørnøya or in its immediate vicinity, pollution by toxic and radioactive substances remains {{a threat to the}} island's virtually untouched nature. Exploration in the Barents sea and the recent development of the Snøhvit gas field off the northern coast of Norway shows that the ecologically sensitive polar and subpolar sea areas of the Norwegian and Barents Sea have come into the focus of the petrol and gas industry. The <b>environmental</b> <b>organisation</b> Bellona has criticised the Norwegian government for licensing these activities without sufficient studies of their ecological impact. Organic toxins, specifically PCBs, have been found in high concentrations in biological samples from Bear Island, especially in Arctic char of the freshwater lake Ellasjøen. The Soviet nuclear submarine Komsomolets sank on April 7, 1989 some [...] southwest of Bear Island. Leakage of radioactive material from the reactor and nuclear warheads currently poses a problem, and severe pollution of the surrounding waters remains possible.|$|E

2500|$|A {{larger and}} more {{controversial}} change occurred as from 2 June 2002, when the discount level was changed: a minimum adult fare of £10.00 was imposed for weekday journeys, and children now received an 81% discount on the full adult fare (equivalent to a 60% on the full child fare, and subject to a minimum fare of £1.00) instead of the former £1.00 flat fare for all journeys. [...] This meant that on a weekday, holders would receive no discount if the standard adult full fare was £10.00 or less, and a discount of less than 34% on fares between £10.05 and £15.00. [...] Longer journeys for children would also become more expensive. [...] Transport pressure group Transport 2000 and <b>environmental</b> <b>organisation</b> Friends of the Earth condemned the proposals, and Reading East MP Jane Griffiths tabled an Early Day Motion in the British Parliament opposing the changes. [...] This gained the support of 38 other MPs from all major parties. [...] Research commissioned by Transport 2000 indicated that 90% of journeys typically made in the railcard area would no longer gain any discount (as {{a result of the}} full adult fare being £10.00 or below), a further 3.5% would attract a discount of less than 34%, and only 6.5% would still be subject to the full 34% discount as before. [...] This reflects the fact that many journeys undertaken in the area are short and [...] "local" [...] in nature, and that the area as a whole is fairly small in size (as [...] shows, it does not extend a very long way from London in any direction).|$|E
