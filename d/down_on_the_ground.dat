5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech {{took over}} at its 33-yard line. Needing a score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, {{preventing them from}} gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech had to play defense as Kansas took over at its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to run the ball {{in an effort to}} keep the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> before the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two deep inside Virginia Tech territory.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an oestrus ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each oestrus lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus. Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression toward one another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who lies <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a few more times within the next few days. Polyandrous, females can mate with several males. The mean number of motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E
25|$|Two French priests, Fathers Urbain and Guy, {{were seen}} being led away and {{suffered}} a similar fate. Urbain's {{body was found}} buried alive, bound hand and foot. Guy, who was 48, was stripped of his cassock and forced to kneel <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> where {{he was shot in}} the back of the head. He was in the same grave with Father Urbain and 18 others.|$|E

25|$|On July 5, 2016, Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black man, {{was shot}} several times {{at close range}} while held <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> by two Baton Rouge Police Department officers, Howie Lake II and Blane Salamoni, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Police were {{responding}} to a report that {{a man in a}} red shirt was selling CDs, and that he had used a gun to threaten a man outside a convenience store. The shooting was recorded by multiple bystanders.|$|E
25|$|After Scott {{was shot}} and had dropped to the ground, Slager {{approached}} him, repeatedly instructed him to place {{his hands behind his}} back, and handcuffed him, leaving him face <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Although police reports stated that officers performed CPR on Scott, no such action is visible on the video. The video shows that Slager ran back toward where the initial scuffle occurred and picked something up off the ground. Moments later, he dropped the object, possibly the Taser, beside Scott's body.|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, San Jose State College {{witnessed}} {{a rise in}} political activism and civic awareness among its student body, including major student protests against the Vietnam War. One of the largest campus protests took place in 1967 when Dow Chemical Company — a major manufacturer of napalm used in the war — came to campus to conduct job recruiting. An estimated 3,000 students and bystanders surrounded the Seventh Street administration building, and more than 200 students and teachers lay <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{in front of the}} recruiters.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of the group's first album in 1973, they were banned from {{competing}} in the isicathamiya competitions because of their ability to win many of the competitions. They were, however, welcome to perform for the audience. Following this, the group started performing for their own audiences in shows that were specially made and, soon afterwards, the group began touring around South Africa in their own concerts, but due to the Apartheid system in use, they were often stopped by police guards; on some of these occasions they were even made to lie <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> whilst being searched. Shortly afterwards, they were allowed to tour without permits.|$|E
25|$|Once at the site, the Jews were {{housed in}} the barn and taken in groups of 20 of a time to a point 40 or 50 meters from the trench, where they were ordered to lie face <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Groups of ten were then ordered to stand up, and, except for children, remove their outer clothing. As they were {{moved closer to the}} pit, they were ordered to strip completely. A Latvian guard, Bulvāns, later testified that he saw two Germans, SS-Scharführer ("squad leader") Karl-Emil Strott and Philip (or Filip) Krapp, using a whip on people who did not move on to the pit.|$|E

Also, the P-47 Thunderbolts of Ninth Air Force would be dispatched to perform fighter sweeps over Juvincourt after the Marauder raids, then meet up with the heavy bombers and provide fighter escort back to England. As the P-51 Mustang groups of Eighth Air Force began accompanying the heavy bombers {{all the way to}} their German targets by mid-1944, it was routine for them to also attack Juvincourt on their return to England with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.|$|E
25|$|At first {{erected in}} the little village centre before the town hall, it was quickly dynamited off its {{pedestal}} by the priest, then successively kept in pieces behind a hair salon, repaired by welding, and at last moved several kilometres {{to the place where}} it still stands. There, it was once again torn off its pedestal by a tropical cyclone, then abandoned, face <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> for twenty years before finally being found by chance during construction work in 1968. It was then put back in place, rehabilitated as a memorial to World War I dead, celebrated in magnificent public ceremonies, registered in the general inventory of historic monuments, and finally classified as such in 2004.|$|E
25|$|LTTE had {{executed}} {{prisoners of}} war {{on a number of}} occasions, in spite of the declaration in 1988, that it would abide by the Geneva Conventions. One such incident was the mass murder of 600 unarmed Sri Lankan Police officers in 1990, in Eastern Province, after they surrendered to the LTTE on the request of President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Police officers were promised safe conduct and subsequent release; they were instead taken to the jungle, blindfolded, and had their hands tied behind their backs, before being made to lie <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> to be subsequently shot. In 1993, LTTE killed 200 Sri Lanka Army soldiers, captured in the naval base at Pooneryn, during the Battle of Pooneryn.|$|E

50|$|Chardigny {{designed}} many sculptures, some {{of which}} are held in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Princeton University Art Museum, the Château de Pau, and the Musée Baron-Martin.

25|$|Some animals {{would be}} living in the trees, as animals are always taking {{advantage}} of all available niches, both for feeding and protection. At the time, the reproductive organs were {{by far the most}} nutritious part of the plant, and these early plants show signs of arthropod consumption and adaptations to protect themselves, for example by placing their reproductive organs as high up as possible. But there will always be some species who will be able to cope with that by following their food source up the trees. Knowing that insects were terrestrial at that time and that some arthropods (like primitive insects) were living in the tree crowns, it seems less likely that they would have developed their wings <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> or in the water.|$|E
25|$|Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender {{when the}} play {{is coming from the}} corner {{to the front of the}} net and the puck carrier is {{carrying}} the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> parallel to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready to push. This works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.|$|E
25|$|Stance width helps {{determine}} the rider's {{balance on the}} board. The size of the rider {{is an important factor}} as well as the style of their riding when determining a proper stance width. A common measurement used for new riders is to position the bindings so that the feet are placed a little wider than shoulder width apart. Another, less orthodox form of measurement may be taken by putting your feet together and place your hands, palm <b>down,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in a straight line with your body by squatting down. This generally gives a good natural measurement for how wide of a base your body uses to properly balance itself when knees are bent. However, personal preference and comfort are important and most experienced riders will adjust the stance width to personal preference. Skateboarders should find that their snowboarding and skateboarding stance widths are relatively similar.|$|E

25|$|Sint-Truiden Air Base was a {{frequent}} target of USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The medium bombers would attack in coordinated raids, usually in the mid-to-late afternoon, with Eighth Air Force heavy bombers returning from attacking their targets in Germany. The attack was timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the Luftwaffe interceptors pinned <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also, the P-47 Thunderbolts of Ninth Air Force would be dispatched to perform fighter sweeps over Saint Trond after the Marauder raids, then meet up with the heavy bombers and provide fighter escort back to England.

25|$|The unit {{returned}} to the Union base at Newport News, Virginia, in July 1862, where it {{was assigned to the}} IX Corps (which formed on July 22, 1862). He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on July 1, 1861. He fought at the First Battle of Rappahannock Station on August 22 to August 25, 1862, in Culpeper County and Fauquier County, Virginia, and the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 28 to 30, 1862, in Prince William County, Virginia. His unit played a role in helping to stabilize the Union line at Fox's Gap during the Battle of South Mountain on September 14, 1862, near Boonsboro, Maryland. His unit came under friendly fire by the 9th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry, which opened fire before reaching the line of combat, and his soldiers only saved themselves by throwing themselves <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Although the IX Corps participated in the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 11 to 15, 1862, in and around Fredericksburg, Virginia, Gerhardt's unit was held in reserve and he did not fight in the battle. His unit provided covering fire for crossings of the Rappahannock River early in the battle. Two days later, he was promoted to Colonel on December 17, 1862. He stayed with the unit when it went into winter quarters at Falmouth, Virginia.|$|E
