500|$|In {{contrast}} to his output the previous year, Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937, Henry Hathaway's adventure film Souls at Sea. A critical and box-office failure, Cooper {{referred to it as}} his [...] "almost picture", saying, [...] "It was almost exciting, and almost interesting. And I was almost good." [...] In 1938, he appeared in Archie Mayo's biographical film The Adventures of Marco Polo. Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay, the film became Goldwyn's biggest failure to that date, losing $700,000. During this period, Cooper turned down several important roles, including the role of Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind. Cooper was producer David O. Selznick's first choice for the part. He made several overtures to the actor, but Cooper had doubts about the project, and did not feel suited to the role. Cooper later admitted, [...] "It {{was one of the best}} roles ever offered in Hollywood ... But <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no.</b> I didn't see myself as quite that dashing, and later, when I saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection, I knew I was right." ...|$|E

But, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>no,</b> this is a country song." [...] She later contacted Shelton and told him that a country song is what type of song she wanted to do due to the [...] "acoustic guitars, that type of narrative, songs that have a traditional structure." ...|$|E

And then Tash was thinking she wanted to do a bawdy song. And <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no.</b> She wanted to do a bawdy British schoolboy read on a carol. And I said, “no, we’re not doing that, we’re not shocking grandma”. I came up with this idea of ‘Holly, Ivy and Rose’ and she really took to that idea. So in the end both of them are there. And I thought that was important because we all sing together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lounes Matoub {{was born}} on 24 January 1956 {{in the village of}} Taourirt Moussa in Algerian Kabylie. [...] When he turned 9, he built his first guitar from an empty car oil can and {{composed}} his first songs as a teenager. His political and cultural identity was awakened by armed confrontations between Kabyles and government forces in 19631964. In 1968, the Algerian government introduced a policy of Arabization in the education system. Matoub reacted by skipping school; his memoirs recall: [...] "We had to give up Berber and reject French. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no!</b> I played hooky in all my Arabic classes. Every class that I missed was an act of resistance, a slice of liberty conquered. My rejection was voluntary and purposeful." [...] By 1975, he had abandoned formal education.

Blackmore then contacts Torque, telling him to come to the drowning pool beneath the prison's factory. As Torque heads there, he is attacked by Foundation soldiers backed up by a helicopter piloted by Jordan, who was lying about her men betraying her. Torque defeats the soldiers and kills Jordan.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{unexpectedly}} limited {{releases of}} [...] "Dear Angie" [...] and Maybe Tomorrow, Griffiths complained about The Iveys' handling by Apple {{in an interview}} for the Disc & Music Echo magazine, saying: [...] "We do feel a bit neglected. We keep writing songs for a new single and submitting them to Apple, but they keep sending them back, saying they're not good enough". McCartney read the interview and offered the song [...] "Come and Get It" [...] to the group, although he had written the song for the soundtrack of The Magic Christian. Before the recording on Saturday, 2 August 1969, Griffiths remembered the whole group being so excited they couldn't sleep. Producing the track in under one hour, McCartney made sure that they copied his own demo note-for-note: [...] "They were a young band ... they said, 'We {{want to do it}} a bit different, wanna get our own thing in'. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>No,</b> this has gotta be exactly like this, [...] 'cos this is the hit'." ...|$|E

After Phil and Steve wrongfully framed Dan for Phil's shooting, Dan sought revenge by kidnapping Mel and demanding a ransom. An EastEnders insider reportedly told The Mirror, [...] "This has be [...] {{one of the most}} dramatic storylines we have ever filmed. Dan has vowed to get even with Phil and Steve for framing him over the shooting. Kidnapping Mel kills two birds with one stone. Although Mel and Phil have had their differences, he still harbours feelings for her." [...] As part of the storyline, Outhwaite, as Mel, was tied up to a radiator in a council flat. Outhwaite commented, [...] "They offered to untie my wrists between scenes, but <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> so I could feel what it was really like.

2500|$|In October 2017, Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka Addams {{alleged that}} she was sexually {{assaulted}} by the band's bassist Twiggy Ramirez in their shared apartment while the pair were a couple in the mid-90s.

I knew nothing about these allegations until very recently and am saddened by Jessicka's obvious distress." [...] Soon after, Manson announced on Twitter that Twiggy had been fired from the band. Several days later, Twiggy said in a statement: [...] "I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain, I apologize and truly regret it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Sparks {{had been}} {{wrapping}} up The Lucky One {{and beginning to}} ponder an original plot for his next book. The author told himself he could [...] "either go younger than 20 or older than 50", having recently written about every age in between. Wary of venturing above 50 again after his best-seller The Notebook, Sparks had already been leaning toward writing a teenage story when he {{received a phone call}} from Gibgot on behalf of the film in August 2008. Sparks recalled, [...] "Jennifer asked if I had anything laying around? <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no,</b> but funny you should say that…" [...] Sparks returned with a premise by the end of July 2008. Once the proposal had been agreed upon by Cyrus, her family, and Offspring Entertainment, Sparks, with the aid of co-screenplay writer Jeff Van Wie, completed the screenplay before starting the book. Sparks explained that such an arrangement was necessary in order to accommodate filming in summer 2009, as Disney had scheduled, but that [...] "this is similar to the way it’s gone with movies based on my novels; it’s just out of order." [...] Sparks and Van Wie completed the first draft of the screenplay in December 2008, the first rewrite later that month, and the second and final rewrite in January 2009. Both rewrites took approximately one or two days, and Sparks found them relatively simple. The finished screenplay was approximately 100 pages long. While The Last Song is not the first screenplay Sparks has written, it is his first to be optioned for film. The novel was completed in June 2009, the same time shooting for the film began, and was published on September 8, 2009 by Grand Central Publishing. The plot of the film and novel remained secret throughout development.|$|E

2500|$|During early 1990, Velasquez began {{recording}} {{her second}} studio album, Nineteen 90. After marginal sales from her debut album, Velasquez {{signed a contract}} with Vicor Music Corporation, who was {{at the helm of the}} production of her sophomore release. For the project, Velasquez worked with Louie Ocampo, who provided the musical arrangement for the album’s lead single [...] "Narito Ako", a song originally recorded and performed by Maricris Belmont and written by Nonong Pedero for the 1978 Metro Manila Popular Music Festival. Nineteen 90 was released and accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor. The album, though being all original recordings in content, was largely driven by its lead single cover and managed sales of over 80,000 units. In July 1990, Velasquez headlined her first major venue concert as a solo artist in support of the album at the Folk Arts Theater. That 1990, Velasquez recorded a duet with Jose Mari Chan, [...] "Please Be Careful With My Heart", for his sixth studio album, Constant Change and contributed backing vocals for Gary Valenciano's [...] "Each Passing Night", a single featured on his sixth album, Faces of Love. By the end of 1990, Velasquez made her North American concert debut at the Isaac Stern Auditorium of the Carnegie Hall in Manhattan, New York City, a first for any other Asian solo artist. Soon after, British theatrical producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh, invited Velasquez to audition for the West End production of the musical Miss Saigon. Velasquez later received a letter from the production company offering intensive musical theater training in London, United Kingdom, she ultimately declined the offer citing inadequate theatrical experience: [...] "I’ve never done theater before.
