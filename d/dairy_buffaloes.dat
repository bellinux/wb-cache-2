Historically Chinese buffalo is mainly used for drought since their milk production is very low with an annual milk yield of 500 - 700 kg.

40|$|Buffalo {{farming is}} a dairy {{enterprise}} emerging in Italy and other European and non-European countries {{due to the}} progressive saturation of the dairy market, which requires product diversification. As {{a response to the}} increasing demand for <b>dairy</b> <b>buffalo</b> products, most farms are undertaking a progressive intensification of rearing techniques.

Additionally, lactating buffaloes receive concentrates with an even higher environmental impact, whereas more fibrous feeds are used in the dry period. Although the emission factors for enteric fermentation and manure management in buffaloes appear to be 38. 4 % and 20. 5 % less than in dairy cows, respectively, the contribution of <b>dairy</b> <b>buffalo</b> farms to global warming has been estimated as higher than that produced by dairy cow farms.

Simulation results showed that age, number of lactation, body weight and calving interval had no direct effect on the actual milk production and nutrient utilization of the <b>dairy</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> Significantly higher metabolizable energy (ME) and metabolizable protein (MP) allowable milk were predicted by the model compared to the actual milk production of the buffaloes. Using the actual ration, the model predicted 91 days for the buffaloes to gain one BCS while 70 days was needed when the CNCPS feed library is used. The model predicted significantly lower DMI (12. 8 vs. I 6 kg/d) and forage intake (9. 10 vs. I 0. 3 kg/d) with a difference of 21 % and 16 % than the actual ration.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the thermoregulatory response of <b>dairy</b> <b>buffaloes</b> in pre-milking and post-milking. To identify animal thermoregulatory capacity, skin surface temperatures were taken by an infrared thermometer (SST), a thermographic camera (MTBP) as well as respiratory rate records (RR).

Artificial Neural Networks analyzed those indices as well as animal physiological data, using a single layer trained with the least mean square (LMS) algorithm. The results indicated that pre-milking and post-milking environments reached BGHI, RR, SST and MTBP values above thermal neutrality zone for buffaloes. In addition, limits of surface skin temperatures were mostly influenced by changing ambient conditions to the detriment of respiratory rates.
