5|$|Operation Rolling Thunder was {{the title}} of a gradual and {{sustained}} aerial bombardment campaign conducted by the U.S. 2nd Air Division (later Seventh Air <b>Force),</b> <b>U.S.</b> Navy, and Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) from 2 March 1965 until 2 November 1968, during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} July 5 Battle of Osan, US troops began a {{continuous}} and unsuccessful ground {{campaign against the}} North Koreans, {{and many of the}} US air assets were used in close air support and airstrike roles to aid the faltering ground troops. From this point on bombers mounted strategic bombing missions against military targets of all types supporting the North Korean ground troops, including ports, armor concentrations and supply stockpiles. A massive interdiction campaign ensued which would have implications for the upcoming conflicts. As more US Air <b>Force,</b> <b>US</b> Navy and US Marine Corps aviation assets arrived in the country, they increased their interdiction campaigns for several days striking bridges and strategic areas though going mostly unthreatened by the North Korean Air Force, though at least one F-80 was lost when it hit power lines during a bombing run.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{returned}} to normal peacetime duties in January 1919, when she arrived in Norfolk on the 4th. She steamed to the Azores to take weather observations for Navy seaplanes that were {{to make the first}} aerial crossing the Atlantic. In August 1920, Florida was present during the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims' landing at Provincetown, Massachusetts. In December 1920, she made a good-will cruise to South America with US Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby aboard and {{over the next three years}} conducted amphibious operation training with the Marine Corps in the Caribbean. Florida also participated in the normal routine of exercises and midshipman cruises. During this period, she was made the flagship of the Commander, Control <b>Force,</b> <b>US</b> Fleet.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} notable units to operate out of a FOB was the brigade's 74th Long-Range Surveillance (LRS) detachment. 74th LRS {{operated}} out of FOB Price {{near the town of}} Gereshk in the Helmand Province. LRS provided the 173rd Brigade command group with key recon and intel of the province, and held control of Helmand with a 5th Special Forces Group ODA element. Assisting the LRS and 5th Group ODA were elements of the 82nd Airborne, Iowa National Guard, and ANA. The LRS detachment and 5th Group ODA conducted many combined and individual operations to ensure the stability of the region. The LRS detachment was also tasked at times for recon and intel gathering for other brigade assets, and target acquisition and designation for U.S. Air <b>Force,</b> <b>U.S.</b> Army, and RAF aircraft. The brigade returned to Italy in March 2006. Seventeen soldiers from the brigade died during this deployment.|$|E
5|$|Thus, the 24th Infantry Division was {{the first}} American armed force sent to South Korea with the mission to blunt the advance of the North Korean Army and {{to set up a}} {{defensive}} perimeter around Pusan (the Pusan Perimeter) with the aid of Air <b>Force,</b> <b>U.S.</b> Navy, and Marine Corps aviation forces. The Supreme United Nations military commander in the area, General Douglas MacArthur, decided to have his American and South Korean troops to dig in around Pusan and hold on until he could assemble a powerful force (the American 10th Corps) to make an amphibious counterattack at Inchon on the northwestern coast of South Korea, near Seoul, later on in 1950. The 24th Infantry Division, along with its South Korean allies, was hence nearly alone for several weeks while the Americans and South Koreans held out inside the Pusan Perimeter and awaited reinforcements and counterattacks against the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Iranian {{students}} {{seized the}} American embassy in Tehran {{and held the}} embassy staff hostage; the first rescue operation, code-named Eagle Claw ended in failure due to equipment and coordination problems, culminating in the crash of a RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopter into a parked C-130 Hercules in the Iranian desert, killing eight servicemen. A second rescue attempt, Operation Credible Sport, was ordered, and Brown was involved in planning and preparation. The follow-up rescue included U.S. Air <b>Force,</b> <b>U.S.</b> Navy and Army assets. The Army units involved were the battalions {{that made up the}} 101st Aviation Group: the 158th Aviation Battalion, the 229th Aviation Battalion and the 159th Aviation Battalion. All three battalions formed Task Force 158. President Carter meanwhile appointed the former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral James L. Holloway, III, to head a commission to study the deficiencies revealed by the failure of Eagle Claw. Among the presented findings {{was the fact that the}} military lacked aircraft and crews who were trained and prepared to perform these mission types.|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{argues that}} {{studying}} places and identities as a tension yields useful research insights, because it <b>forces</b> <b>us</b> to do three things.

Second, it <b>forces</b> <b>us</b> {{to think about them}} as embodied, material processes. The concrete ways in which this tension pans out cannot be known in the abstract or a priori – they must be studied in concrete settings, as they play out in different historical moments, geographical contexts and in relation to different individuals or social groups. It therefore <b>forces</b> <b>us,</b> third, to think about the unequal power relations that shape these tensions, both in their global and structured as well as in their fluid, situated and embodied configurations.
