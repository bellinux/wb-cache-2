40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the integration of}} the authoring of a mathematical document with the formalisation of the mathematics contained in that document. To achieve this we have started the development of a Coq plugin for the TEXmacs scientific editor, called tmEgg. TEXmacs allows the wysiwyg editing of mathematical documents, much in the style of LATEX. Our plugin allows to integrate into a TEXmacs document mathematics formalised in the Coq proof assistant: formal definitions, lemmas and proofs. The plugin is still under development. Its main current hallmark is a document-consistent interaction model, instead of the calculator-like approach usual for TEXmacs plugins. This means that the Coq code in the TEXmacs document is interpreted as one (consistent) Coq file: executing a Coq command in the <b>document</b> <b>means</b> to execute it in the context (state) of all the Coq commands before it. ...|$|E

Fact-finding algorithms attempt to identify the “truth ” among competing claims in a corpus, but fail {{to take advantage of the}} user’s prior knowledge and presume that truth itself is universal and objective rather than subjective. We introduce a framework for incorporating prior knowledge into any factfinding algorithm, expressing both general “common-sense ” reasoning and specific facts already known to the user as first-order logic and translating this into a tractable linear program. As our results show, this approach scales well to even large problems, both reducing error and allowing the system to determine truth respective to the user rather than the majority. Additionally, we introduce three new fact-finding algorithms capable of outperforming existing fact-finders in many of our experiments. ...|$|E

40|$|Information {{institutions}} use text-based {{information retrieval}} systems to store, index and retrieve metadata, full-text, or both metadata and full-text (hybrid) contents. The {{aim of this}} research was to evaluate impact of these contents on information retrieval performance. For this purpose, metadata (MIR), full-text (FIR) and hybrid (HIR) content information retrieval systems were developed with default Lucene information retrieval model for a small scale Turkish corpus. In order to evaluate performance of this three systems, “precision - recall” and “normalized recall” tests were conducted. Experimental findings showed that there was no significant differences between MIR and FIR in mean average precision (MAP) performance. On the other hand, MAP performance of HIR was significantly higher in comparison to MIR and FIR. When information retrieval performance was evaluated as user-centered, the “normalized recall” performances of MIR and HIR were significantly higher than FIR. Additionally, there was {{no significant differences between the}} systems in retrieved relevant <b>document</b> <b>means.</b> Processing different types of contents such as metadata and full-text had some advantages and disadvantages for information retrieval systems in terms of term management.

The design of air yards has a great influence on creating natural, humanized buildings and enhancing the interior space. However, it goes against the goal of ecological energy-saving that the space of high-rise building is relatively closed and its environment is always simulated. By analyzing air yard’s layout in high-rises, this document compares the climate conditions and the quality of internal environment at different locations. This document also compares the influence that various compositions of more than one air courtyards could have on high-rise building’s light and wind environment. At last, the document try to put forward principles and strategies to arrange the air yards in a high-rise building ecologically in different climate. Ecological Meaning of High-rises Building’s Air Yards The high-rise is an important architectural form. It has positive significance on intensive usage of lands and improving urban environment.
