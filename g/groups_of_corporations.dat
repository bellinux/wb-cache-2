5000|$|Tort victims {{differ from}} {{commercial}} creditors {{because they have}} no ability to contract around limited liability, and are therefore regarded differently under most state laws. The theory developed in the mid-20th century that beyond the corporation itself, it was more appropriate for the law to recognize the economic [...] "enterprise", which usually composes <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations,</b> where the parent takes the benefit of a subsidiary's activities and is capable of exercising decisive influence. A concept of [...] "enterprise liability" [...] was developed in fields such tax law, accounting practices, and antitrust law that were gradually received into the courts' jurisprudence. Older cases had suggested that there was no special right to pierce the veil in favor of tort victims, even where pedestrians had been hit by a tram owned by a bankrupt-subsidiary corporation, or by taxi-cabs that were owned by undercapitalized subsidiary corporations. More modern authority suggested a different approach. In a case concerning one of the worst oil spills in history, caused by the Amoco Cadiz which was owned through subsidiaries of the Amoco Corporation, the Illinois court that heard the case stated that the parent corporation was liable by the fact of its group structure. The courts therefore [...] "usually apply more stringent standards to piercing the corporate veil in a contract case than they do in tort cases" [...] because tort claimants do not voluntarily accept limited liability. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the US Supreme Court in United States v Bestfoods held if a parent corporation [...] "actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of" [...] a subsidiary's facilities it [...] "may be held directly liable". This leaves the question {{of the nature of the}} common law, in absence of a specific statute, or where a state law forbids piercing the veil except on very limited grounds. One possibility is that tort victims go uncompensated, even while a parent corporation is solvent and has insurance. A second possibility is that a compromise liability regime, such as pro rata rather than joint and several liability is imposed across all shareholders regardless of size. A third possibility, and one that does not interfere with the basics of corporate law, is that a direct duty of care could be owed in tort to the injured person by parent corporations and major shareholders to the extent they could exercise control. This route means corporate enterprise would not gain a subsidy at the expense of other people's health and environment, and that there is no need to pierce the veil.|$|E
40|$|Cooperativist integration, {{an example}} of the sixth {{cooperative}} principle of inter-cooperation, means the concentration of cooperative enterprises. Of the different means of organization that are covered by the legislation on cooperatives, cooperative groups appear to be a similar concept to that of <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations.</b> However, there are actually {{significant differences between the two}} concepts due to the very nature of cooperative groups in the light of the cooperative formula as an independent entity. This paper analyses, on the one hand, to what degree it would be possible to transfer the principles that govern <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations</b> to the concept of cooperative groups and, on other hand, in what conditions and under what assumptions a cooperative enterprise could be a member of a mixed group consisting of cooperatives and other types of corporation. Our second objective will then be to determine, in this case, the requirements in terms of preparing consolidated annual accounts, if cooperative enterprises could be brought within the scope of consolidation, especially as a result of the new concept of “horizontal groups”, which has arisen as a consequence of the modification of company legislation in Spain prior to its adaptation to international accounting legislation. Cooperativist integration, cooperative groups, accounting consolidation, horizontal groups. ...|$|E

40|$|Board {{independence}} {{is an essential}} mechanism of corporate governance for stock market listed corporations {{in most of the}} world’s countries including the United States and Saudi Arabia. Reforming the requirements of board independence under the corporate governance regulations is a primary demand by many commentators and various stakeholder <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations.</b> While large US listed corporations collapses are still continuing after adopting some reforms, some empirical research shows positive correlation between board independence and corporate performance. Likewise, a current Saudi empirical study shows a positive association between board independence and corporate performance while many Saudi key stakeholders in Saudi listed corporations are requiring more restrictions. This dissertation examines the board independence mechanisms of corporate governance in two different stock exchange countries, the United States and Saudi Arabia. The examination was conducted by analyzing two different empirical studies for each country. For the US empirical studies, the paper uses Bhagat & Black (2001) and Bhagat & Bolton (2013). For the Saudi empirical studies, the paper uses Ghabayen (2012) and Albassam (2014). The paper suggests that US board independence regulations need more reform in the following areas: board independence standards, stock ownership incentives, a corporate reward system to encourage hard work independent director, and the monitoring of independent directors. The Saudi board independence regulations need more reform in the following areas: election process of the independent directors, developing the awareness of the independence concept, becoming a listed corporation, and how to have effective corporate governance practices in Saudi Arabia...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} complex {{networks}} is a dominant 26 trend in recent research that transcends domain 27 boundaries. The pervasiveness of networked 28 systems in biology, technology, and society has 29 {{led to a}} recent surge of interest in uncovering the 30 organizing principles that govern the topology 31 and the dynamics of various complex networks 32 (Park and Barabasi 2007). Indeed, complex 33 networks research can be conceptualized as 34 lying at the intersection between graph theory 35 and statistical mechanics, which endows it with 36 a truly multidisciplinary nature (Costa et al. 37 2007). In particular, many social systems can 38 be modelled as complex networks. These include 39 online social media, collaborations of scientists, 40 interconnected <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations</b> and banks 41 with shareholding links between them, ecological 42 systems of species, communities of people who 43 are subject to spread of infection, and operational 44 hierarchies in defense organizations, among 45 others. It {{has been shown that}} many of these 46 networks from various domains can exhibit 47 surprisingly similar underlying structures. For 48 example, most social networks are shown to 49 have the “scale-free” structure (Dorogovtsev and 50 Mendes 2003; Piraveenan et al. 2012 b, 2007, 51 2008, 2010), where the topological structure 52 is largely independent of scale, and many 53 also display the “small-world” property, where 54 the average diameter of the network remains 55 largely independent {{of the size of the}} network(Albert and Barabasi 2002; Milgram 1967). 58 A number of structural properties of these 59 networks such as modularity, topological 60 robustness, mixing patterns, network diameter, 61 and clustering have been analyzed in detail. 62 Furthermore, it has been explained that many 63 of these structural features are closely related to 64 the functions the networks, or subnetworks and 65 motifs contained therein, are intended to perform 66 (Dorogovtsev and Mendes 2003). Therefore, 67 many topological and behavioral patterns of 68 social networks can be studied generically across 69 domains...|$|E

40|$|Section 1501 allows all of {{the members}} <b>of</b> an {{affiliated}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations</b> to elect to file a consolidated return. A consolidated return permits the includible members <b>of</b> an affiliated <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations</b> to combine their incomes into a single return.
