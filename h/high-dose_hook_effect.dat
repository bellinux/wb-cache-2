40|$|Very {{often in}} Electrical Bioimpedance (EBI) {{spectroscopy}} measurements {{the presence of}} stray capacitances creates a measurement artefact commonly known as <b>Hook</b> <b>Effect.</b> Such an artefact creates a hook-alike deviation of the EBI data noticeable when representing the measurement on the impedance plane.

Only four kits gave normal ranges determined with the kit in question. All values {{were compared with}} the kit in routine use. Although correlation of results was good in 10 cases, (r = 0. 903 - 0. 993) the numerical values varied greatly, (slope of the regression line b = 0. 437 - 1. 94). These values were obtained from at least 30 sera for each kit. Seven kits gave significantly different results from the routine kit (p less than 0. 05 - Wilcoxon matched pairs test- two tail value).

40|$|Summary: We have {{established}} a new chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay for Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), designated ACCESS CEA, which is adapted to the fully automated ACCESS ® immunoassay analyzer. The assay {{is based on a}} one step sandwich-type method using two monoclonal antibodies, one of which is immobilized on micrometer-size paramagnetic particles and the other is conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Ten microliters of calibrators or sera are incubated for 5 minutes at 37 °C with the particles and with the alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The particles are then magnetically separated and washed to remove unbound components. Time needed to obtain the first result is less than 15 minutes. The assay range was 0. 04 — 1000 μg/l of CEA, and the possible <b>high-dose</b> <b>hook</b> <b>effect</b> was prevented at CEA concentrations up to 100000 μg/l in this working range.

METHODS: A multicentre evaluation was carried out to assess the analytical performance of the POC NT-proBNP test at seven different sites. RESULTS: The majority of all coefficients of variation (CVs) obtained for within-series imprecision using native blood samples was below 10 % for both 52 samples measured ten times and for 674 samples measured in duplicate. Using quality control material, the majority of CV values for day-to-day imprecision were below 14 % for the low control level and below 13 % for the high control level. In method comparisons for four lots of the POC NT-proBNP test with the laboratory reference method (Elecsys proBNP), the slope ranged from 0. 93 to 1. 10 and the intercept ranged from 1. 8 to 6. 9. The bias found between venous and arterial blood with the POC NT-proBNP method was < or = 5 %. All four lots of the POC NT-proBNP test investigated showed excellent agreement, with mean differences of between - 5 % and + 4 %. No significant interference was observed with lipaemic blood (triglyceride concentrations up to 6. 3 mmol/L), icteric blood (bilirubin concentrations up to 582 micromol/L), haemolytic blood (haemoglobin concentrations up to 62 mg/L), biotin (up to 10 mg/L), rheumatoid factor (up to 42 IU/mL), or with 50 out of 52 standard or cardiological drugs in therapeutic concentrations. With bisoprolol and BNP, somewhat higher bias in the low NT-proBNP concentration range (< 175 ng/L) was found. Haematocrit values between 28 % and 58 % had no influence on the test result. Interference {{may be caused by}} human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) types 1 and 2. No significant influence on the results with POC NT-proBNP was found using volumes of 140 - 165 muL.

40|$|Glutamatergic {{neurotransmission}} is of key {{importance for}} short-term and long-term plasticity in the hippocampus, {{a part of}} the medial temporal lobe which is responsible for processes of explicit semantic and spatial memory. Short-term plasticity is mainly regulated by the presynaptic neuron and long-term plasticity is to large parts regulated by the post-synaptic neuron. In this thesis we have looked into cellular and molecular biophysical mechanisms in glutamatergic neurons mainly in the hippocampus. We first reviewed the presynaptic mechanisms underlying short-term plasticity like assembly of the release machinery, positional and molecular priming, site preparation, calcium dynamics regulation, intrinsic vesicular fusogenicity, endocytosis, acidification and filling. In study 1 we looked into the role of intrinsic vesicle fusogenicity on short-term plasticity by formulating a deterministic vesicular release model based on ordinary differential equations. Intrinsic vesicular fusogenicity was an allosteric property we invented in order to test the hypothesis of calcium independence. The model was able to simulate properties of resting neurons, by reproducing the spontaneous release rates {{and the size of the}} readily releasable pool. Furthermore, assuming that the heterogeneity in vesicular release probability arises due to differences in intrinsic vesicular fusogenicity, the model was able to explain depression by an imbalance between fusion and vesicular priming. It also predicted that facilitation could be due to an increase in intrinsic vesicular fusogenicity, which together with build-up of calcium gave rise to initial increase in vesicular release. Finally, we investigated the effect of three different modes of regulation of release probability on short-term plasticity. It was seen that differences in intrinsic vesicular fusogenicity gave rise to a more significant change in shortterm plasticity than change in calcium sensitivity of release. All in all the results tell us that intrinsic vesicular fusogenicity has an important role in tuning short-term plasticity. In study 2 we investigated the regulation of the postsynaptic allosteric AMPA receptor. To do this we developed a model based on the Monod Wyman Changeux framework which described the ligand concentration dependence of the conductance states by increasing affinity to conductance states. The model was able to explain thermodynamic behaviours of native and recombinant receptors when stimulated with full agonists like glutamate and quisqualate as well as partial agonists like willardiines. It was also predicted that the receptor stabilizes its large conductance state within the rise time of a so-called 'mini' post-synaptic current, providing a possible underlying mechanism for the peak of the current. In study 3 we investigated the <b>high-dose</b> <b>hook</b> <b>effect</b> in allosteric proteins by first developing a combinatorical theory for how linker proteins behave under conditions of perfect binding. The theory predicted that the steady-state concentration of fully bound linker-proteins decreases at a critical concentration of initial free linker protein as the free linker protein concentration is increased. This effect is however decreased in proteins where binding of ligand occurs in a cooperative fashion. The outcome was validated by simulations of dimeric and tetrameric linker proteins under imperfect binding. We also simulated the cooperative synaptic protein calmodulin, and it was seen to be subject to the hook effect. The hook effect was stronger in the presence of the allosteric activator Ca 2 +/calmodulin kinase II (CamKII). We show that increased amounts of the allosteric activator can decrease the activity of calmodulin. At 140 uM calmodulin behaved only as if the molecule only appeared in the relaxed (R) state. The relaxed state has no cooperativity, but has higher ligand affinity than the wild-type calmodulin. Even though this phenomenon may be present in many different biochemical systems, synapses contain several linker proteins that are pivotal for synaptic plasticity for instance AMPA receptors, synaptotagmin, calbinding and calmodulin. In summary, this thesis gives insight into allosteric mechanisms in glutamatergic hippocampal neurons by using whole-cell voltage clamp and algebraic modelling. Specifically, it suggests an explanation for the important role of allosteric mechanisms in vesicular release probability and short-term plasticity. It also provides an explanation for the ligand concentration dependence of AMPA receptors and puts forward a theory for how complexes and active forms of linker proteins behave under increase of free linker protein concentration, a behaviour might contribute to pre-and postsynaptic processes...|$|E

Occurrence of the <b>hook</b> <b>effect</b> and linearity of the assays were evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed by Wilcoxon's test and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Undiluted peritoneal fluids, assayed for their CA 125 content, showed falsely underestimated values of the antigen when IRMA-II and ELSA-II assays were performed. The phenomenon disappeared only at high dilutions of the sample (> 50). Conversely, immunoenzymatic ETI-II and EIA-II assays performed on undiluted peritoneal fluids did not show underestimated CA 125 values. CA 125 values obtained by immunoenzymatic assay were lower than those obtained using their respective immunoradiometric versions at a dilution of 1 : 100 (P < 0. 001). A good correlation was observed between ELSA-II and EIA-II (r = 0. 929) CA 125 values. CONCLUSION: The EIA-II immunoenzymatic assay {{appears to be more}} suitable for CA 125 measurement in peritoneal fluid in that it is not subject to the <b>hook</b> <b>effect</b> and its results correlated well with those obtained via its immunoradiometri...|$|R
50|$|The <b>hook</b> <b>effect</b> or the {{prozone effect}} {{is a type of}} {{interference}} which plagues certain immunoassays and nephelometric assays, resulting in false negatives or inaccurately low results.

40|$|International audienceUNLABELLED: The <b>hook</b> <b>effect,</b> {{which has}} long been {{detected}} and documented for immunoradiometric assays (IRMA) such as those measuring prolactin or thyroglobulin, occurs when the serum antigen level is extremely high, thus inducing a bias in the methodology of measurement. RESULTS: We report {{the case of an}} 80 -year-old man with confirmed medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In the case reported here, the clinical status of the patient contrasts with his tumor antigen, serum calcitonin (CT), concentrations. The measured increased CT concentrations revealed the presence of a <b>hook</b> <b>effect.</b> This phenomenon occurs due to an excess of antigen during the one-step IRMA where the signal antibodies, bound to the non-captured antigens, are washed out during the measurement, inducing the loss of signal. Aiming to prevent the "hook effect", successive dilutions of the same sample of serum were done. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have shown when one-step IRMA reveals high concentrations of a tumor serum antigen (i. e. prolactin or thyroglobulin), a two-step IRMA or a systematic 1 : 10 dilution of the serum sample prevents the formation of the "hook effect". In our case report, the CT "hook effect" formation was prevented by performing serial dilutions of the serum sample...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} technical and analytical performance of the first automated thyroglobulin (Tg) assay (DPC-Immulite(R); Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, USA). In imprecision studies using several human serum pools ranging from 21 to 58 replicates, a coefficient of variation of 9. 0 % was obtained at a mean Tg concentration of 0. 84 ng/ml and of 6. 1 % at a Tg concentration of 62. 1 ng/ml. In a method comparison with a non-automated assay (BRAHMS LUMItest Tg(R), BRAHMS, Berlin, Germany) using 383 sera of 303 patients with thyroid carcinoma, regression analysis according to Passing and Bablock yielded in the following equation: Immulite Tg= 1. 6 x BRAHMS Tg - 0. 1 ng/ml (Pearson's r= 0. 979). Sera obtained from 59 patients with thyroid carcinoma enabled comparative follow-up studies; in all cases qualitative agreement was found with regard to increase or decrease of serum Tg; in eight cases, however, Tg was detected with the Immulite assay but not with the BRAHMS assay. Further follow-up proved the presence of thyroid tissue in these patients. From these and further methodological data (dilution linearity, interference studies, carry-over study, <b>high-dose</b> <b>hook</b> properties, and short report time) it is concluded that the DPC-Immulite Tg assay meets the requirements of routine diagnostic use. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesProtein {{induced by}} vitamin K absence or {{antagonist}} II (PIVKA-II), an abnormal form of prothrombin, {{has been used}} as an aid in the diagnosis of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) as a tumor marker. We developed a fully automated quantitative immunoassay for PIVKA-II on the ARCHITECT® i systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the analytical performance of this assay. Design and MethodAssay imprecision, sensitivity, dilution linearity, high dose <b>hook</b> <b>effect,</b> sample type equivalency, assay interferences of potential interfering materials and correlation with Picolumi PIVKA-II (Eidia, Tokyo, Japan) were evaluated. ResultsThe percentage coefficient of variation (%CV) of total imprecision ranged from 2. 8 % to 5. 4 % with 10 levels of samples. The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were less than 0. 63 mAU/mL, 1. 62 mAU/mL, and 8. 25 mAU/mL, respectively. Linearity up to 30, 000 mAU/mL, no high dose <b>hook</b> <b>effect,</b> no difference among sample types and no interference of common drugs and endogenous substances were observed. Correlation study with the Picolumi PIVKA-II gave a correlation coefficient of 0. 93 and a regression slope of 1. 07.

30|$|However, {{there are}} still several {{problems}} in the dual-QDs-labeled LFS designed in this paper.

Secondly, to minimize the <b>hook</b> <b>effect,</b> competitive inhibition method employed to detect CRP in the dual-QDs-labeled LFS caused the quantifying limit not low enough to detect the contents of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP). Thirdly, the dual-QDs-labeled LFS method needs to be applied in a temperature-humidity controlled environment or calibrated frequently, since the fluorescence intensity signal is easily affected by environmental factors.|$|R

We present the analytical evaluation of the newly developed Philips Minicare cTnI point-of-care immunoassay. Design & methodsLi-heparin whole blood and plasma were used to perform analytical studies. The sample type comparison study was performed at 4 different hospitals. The 99 th percentile upper reference limit (URL) study was performed using Li-heparin plasma, Li-heparin whole blood and capillary blood samples from 750 healthy adults, aging from 18 to 86 years. ResultsLimit of the blank, limit of detection and limit of quantitation at 20 % coefficient of variation (CV) were determined to be 8. 5 ng/L, 18 ng/L and 38 ng/L respectively without significant differences between whole blood and plasma for LoQ. Cross-reactivity and interferences were minimal and no <b>high-dose</b> <b>hook</b> was observed. Total CV was found to be from 7. 3 % to 12 % for cTnI concentrations between 109. 6 and 6135. 4 ng/L. CV at the 99 th percentile URL was 18. 6 %. The sample type comparison study between capillary blood, Li-heparin whole blood and Li-heparin plasma samples demonstrated correlation coefficients between 0. 99 and 1. 00 with slopes between 1. 03 and 1. 08. The method comparison between Minicare cTnI and Beckman Coulter Access, AccuTnI+ 3 demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0. 973 with a slope of 1. 09.
