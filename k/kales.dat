25|$|In 1960 the Frisco wasn't {{the only}} {{railroad}} experimenting with racks mounted on flat cars to carry automobiles. In January the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) constructed a prototype trilevel rack mounted on 53-foot flat ATSF 90082. Santa Fe's first production auto racks were 85-foot trilevel Auto-Veyor units supplied by Dana-Spicer and Whitehead & <b>Kales</b> {{later in the}} year, both mounted on General American-built G85 cars. The Southern Pacific actually took delivery of the first Whitehead & <b>Kales</b> Auto-Pack tri-level racks in April, mounting them on General American-built Clejan and G85 cars. The slightly longer 85-foot racks could carry 12 full size or 18 compact autos per car. Several other railroads quickly ordered their own auto racks from Dana and W or from American Car & Foundry, Darby Corporation, Evans Products, Paragon Bridge & Steel, or Thrall Car Manufacturing. The Santa Fe and Frisco also built some of their autoracks in their own car shops.|$|E

25|$|The first {{production}} {{fully enclosed}} racks were delivered in late 1974 and early 1975. The Whitehead & <b>Kales</b> tri-level design, renamed Safe-Pak, {{was delivered to}} ATSF, CP, CRR, FEC, NW, SCL, SSW, UP, and WP, all of them riding on railroad-owned flats. Portec's RailPac design, developed in cooperation with Chrysler, was placed into service by ATSF, C, C, D, GTW, N, RF, SLSF, SP, UP and several other roads, with most riding on leased Trailer Train flats. These two designs were refined during the late 1970s and by 1980 fully enclosed tri-levels accounted for roughly {{a third of the}} in-service fleet, however fully enclosed bi-levels lagged far behind.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} left to solve {{was that the}} new {{autorack}} cars did not provide any protection from theft, vandalism, or from severe weather. Individual railroads began installing mesh side screens and solid panels to their racks to protect the vehicles from impact and debris in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s new racks were being delivered with these side panels. However, thieves and vagrants could still {{gain access to the}} automobiles. In 1973 the first fully enclosed racks with continuous side panels, end doors, and roofs were developed to address this problem. Whitehead & <b>Kales,</b> Ford, N and DT jointly developed a Snap-Pak prototype enclosed tri-level car, NW 400000. The car side was made up of overlapping perforated steel sheets. The ends were protected with two trifold doors, and a corrugated steel roof extended the full length of the car. A competing RailPac prototype was developed by Portec-Paragon, Chrysler, and several railroads. It featured mesh screen side panels, vertically sliding three-piece doors, and a similar roof. The Southern Railway and Greenville Steel Car developed a unique 124-foot articulated three-unit Autoguard car with single axle trucks, SOU 599000-599001.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stages of}} sleep were first {{described}} in 1937 by Alfred Lee Loomis and his coworkers, who separated the different electroencephalography (EEG) features of sleep into five levels (A to E), representing the spectrum from wakefulness to deep sleep. In 1953, REM sleep was discovered as distinct, and thus William C. Dement and Nathaniel Kleitman reclassified sleep into four NREM stages and REM. The staging criteria were standardized in 1968 by Allan Rechtschaffen and Anthony <b>Kales</b> in the [...] "R sleep scoring manual." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{stage is}} {{characterized}} by the presence of a minimum of 20% delta waves ranging from 0.5–2Hz and having a peak-to-peak amplitude >75 μV.

This is the stage in which parasomnias such as night terrors, nocturnal enuresis, sleepwalking, and somniloquy occur. Many illustrations and descriptions still show a stage N3 with 20–50% delta waves and a stage N4 with greater than 50% delta waves; these have been combined as stage N3.|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} {{manufacturers}} offering autoracks declined during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

Pacific Car & Foundry briefly produced a few racks at about the same time, as did Thrall. Whitehead & <b>Kales,</b> one of two dominant producers since the late 1960s, was acquired by Thrall in 1981. Paragon, the other leading rack-builder, was purchased by Portec in the early 1970s, which was in turn acquired by Thrall in 1985. Paragon's autorack designs were sold to Greenville Steel Car, also in 1985, which was itself acquired by Trinity Industries in 1986. Thrall itself was eventually acquired by Trinity as well in 2001.
