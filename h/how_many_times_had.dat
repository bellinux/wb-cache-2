At 8pm, the organiser, Félix Lévitan, told the press that the UCI had ruled that Pollentier would be fined 5,000 Swiss francs and start an immediate suspension of two months. The question was obvious: if a rider was prepared to take drugs and win a stage, knowing he would be tested, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> the ruse been shown to work before? ...|$|E

60|$|The {{great room}} with its countless little tables, {{arranged}} so that every man might {{have the support of}} the gold walls to his back, began to regain its influence on Shelton. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> he not sat there, carefully nodding to acquaintances, happy if he got the table he was used to, a paper with the latest racing, and someone to gossip with who was not a bounder; while the sensation of having drunk enough stole over him.

Not often, however, had he seen such placid, lolling, good-natured men change their expression, their attitude so swiftly. His advent apparently was momentous. They evidently took him for an unusual visitor. So far as Duane could tell, not one of them recognized him, had a hint of his identity.|$|E
6000|$|... (2.) As Satan, {{so every}} sin {{of the coming}} sinner, comes in with a voice against him, if perhaps they may prevail with Christ to cast off the soul. When Israel {{was coming out of}} Egypt to Canaan, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> their sins thrown them out of the mercy of God, had not Moses, as a type of Christ, stood in the breach to turn away his wrath from them! (Psa 106:23).

60|$|It was {{the hour}} he had dreaded, stolen {{suddenly}} upon {{him out of}} the night. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> he rehearsed this scene to himself! He, Stephen Brice, who had preached and slaved and drilled for the Union, a renegade to be shunned by friend and foe alike! He had talked for his country, but he would not risk his life for it. He heard them repeating the charge. He saw them passing him silently on the street. Shamefully he remembered the time, five months agone, when he had worn the very uniform of his Revolutionary ancestor. And high above the tier of his accusers he saw one face, and the look of it stung to the very quick of his soul.|$|E

6000|$|Two such letters Bertram {{received}} that morning, and read while {{the eyes of}} the parsonage breakfast-table were--not fixed on him, but which under such circumstances is much worse--were purposely turned away. He knew well the handwriting of each, and would fain have escaped with them from the room. But this he felt to be cowardly; and so he read them both, sitting there in the family circle. They were from Caroline and Sir Henry. We will give precedence to the lady; but Bertram did not so read them. The lady's letter was the most trying to his nerves, and was therefore taken the last. It can hardly be said that their contents surprised him. When they both came into his hands together, he seemed to feel by intuition what was the news which they contained. That from Caroline was very fairly written. But <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> it been rewritten before that fair copy was prepared? ...|$|E
6000|$|Pharaoh said he would, ay, that he would, but {{he could}} not touch so much as a thread or a rag of Israel, because the will of God was in that thing {{contrary}} to him. Saul said that he would have David, and to that end would search for him among the thousands of Judah; but David was designed for another purpose, and therefore Saul must go without him (1 Sam 23:25) Rabshakeh said that he was come from Assyria to Jerusalem to make [...] "Judah eat their own dung, and drink their own piss" [...] (Isa 36:12). But God said he should not shoot an arrow there. And it came to pass as God had said (Isa 37:33; 2 Kings 18; 2 Chron 28). Jeremiah and Baruch's enemies would have killed them, but they could not, for God hid them. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> the Jews a mind to have destroyed Jesus Christ; but they could not touch a hair of his head until his hour was come.|$|E
60|$|The bridegroom! <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> Ethel {{to remind}} herself of her esteem, and {{security}} of Mary's happiness, besides frowning down Gertrude's saucy comments, and trying to laugh away Tom's low growl that good things always fell to the share of poor hearts and narrow minds. Mr. Cheviot did in fact cut a worse figure than George Rivers of old, having a great fund of natural bashfulness and self-consciousness, which did not much damage his dignity, but made his attempts at gaiety and ease extremely awkward, not to say sheepish. Perhaps the most trying moment was the last, when hearing a few words between Ethel and Mary about posting a mere scrap, if only an empty envelope, from the first resting-place, he turned round, with his laugh, to object to rash promises, and remind his dear sister Ethel that post-offices were not always near at hand! After that, when Mary in her bright tenderness hung round her sister, {{it was as if}} that was the last fond grasp from the substance--as if only the shadow would come back and live in Minster Street.|$|E

6000|$|Softly, stumbling, {{clinging}} together, {{they went}} down to the last turn of the wide stairs. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> she not sat there, in white frocks, her hair hanging down as now, twisting the tassels of little programmes covered with hieroglyphics only intelligible to herself, talking spasmodically to spasmodic boys with budding 'tails,' while Chinese lanterns let fall their rose and orange light on them and all the other little couples as exquisitely devoid of ease. Ah! it was worth those hours of torture to sit there together now, comforting each other with hands and lips and whisperings. It was more, as much more than that moment in the orchard, as sun shining after a Spring storm is more than sun in placid mid-July. To hear him say: [...] "Nedda, I love you!" [...] to feel it in his hand clasped on her heart was much more, now that she knew how difficult it was for him to say or show it, except in the dark with her alone. Many a long day they might have gone through together that would not have shown her so much of his real heart as that hour of whispering and kisses.|$|E
6000|$|So she {{reverted to}} the non-literal {{application}} of the scriptures. Her father very rarely read, but he had collected many books of reproductions, and he would sit and look at these, curiously intent, like a child, yet with a passion that was not childish. He loved the early Italian painters, but particularly Giotto and Fra Angelico and Filippo Lippi. The great compositions cast a spell over him. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> he turned to Raphael's [...] "Dispute of the Sacrament" [...] or Fra Angelico's [...] "Last Judgment" [...] or the beautiful, complicated renderings of the Adoration of the Magi, and always, each time, he received the same gradual fulfilment of delight. It {{had to do with}} the establishment of a whole mystical, architectural conception which used the human figure as a unit. Sometimes he had to hurry home, and go to the Fra Angelico [...] "Last Judgment". The pathway of open graves, the huddled earth on either side, the seemly heaven arranged above, the singing process to paradise on the one hand, the stuttering descent to hell on the other, completed and satisfied him. He did not care whether or not he believed in devils or angels. The whole conception gave him the deepest satisfaction, and he wanted nothing more.|$|E
6000|$|He walked home, {{going over}} in his mind very anxiously all the {{evidence}} he had of Fort's feeling for Noel. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> he been to them since she came back? Only three times--three evening visits! And {{he had not been}} alone with her a single minute! Before this calamity befell his daughter, he would never have observed anything in Fort's demeanour; but, in his new watchfulness, he had seen the almost reverential way he looked at her, noticed the extra softness of his voice when he spoke to her, and once a look of sudden pain, a sort of dulling of his whole self, when Noel had got up and gone out of the room. And the girl herself? Twice he had surprised her gazing at Fort when he was not looking, with a sort of brooding interest. He remembered how, as a little girl, she would watch a grown-up, and then suddenly one day attach herself to him, and be quite devoted. Yes, he must warn her, before she could possibly become entangled. In his fastidious chastity, the opinion he had held of Fort was suddenly lowered. He, already a free-thinker, was now revealed as a free-liver. Poor little Nollie! Endangered again already! Every man a kind of wolf waiting to pounce on her! ...|$|E
40|$|Very often programmers find {{themselves}} re-running the same code with slight modifications {{to reflect a}} new filename, date or directory. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>have</b> you found yourself making minor edits to existing code to help it run on a new day or handle a slightly different input file? <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>have</b> administrative notes not been updated such as who ran the code or where it is located? Even worse, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>have</b> deadlines been missed because a program’s author wasn’t there {{to make the necessary}} minor edits to the code? Thankfully SAS has a number of tools to help you reduce the tedium of manual updates and avoid their associated errors. SAS provides a number of resources that can be easily incorporated in your code to make your programs more extensible and robust. Many hard-coded dataset and variable references in your code can be replaced through the use of SAS dictionaries. Through the use of automatic macro variables, DATA steps and PROCs can be run conditionally based on the proper execution of previous code. Automatic macro variables and information from the operating system can also enhance logs with runtime information. This paper will introduce the basics of dictionaries, automatic macro variables, and operating system environment variables as well as provide a number of examples of how they might be used to automate code and control program flow...|$|R

6000|$|To Smither and Cook that {{preparation}} came like final {{evidence of}} what they had never believed possible--the end of the old Forsyte family on earth. Poor Mr. Timothy must now take a harp and sing in the company of Miss Forsyte, Mrs. Julia, Miss Hester; with Mr. Jolyon, Mr. Swithin, Mr. James, Mr. Roger, and Mr. Nicholas of the party. Whether Mrs. Hayman would be there was more doubtful, seeing that she had been cremated. Secretly Cook thought that Mr. Timothy would be upset--he had always been so set against barrel organs. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> she not said: [...] "Drat the thing! There it is again! Smither, you'd better run up and see what you can do." [...] And in her heart she would so have enjoyed the tunes, if she hadn't known that Mr. Timothy would ring the bell in a minute and say: [...] "Here, take him a halfpenny and tell him to move on." [...] Often they had been obliged to add threepence of their own before the man would go--Timothy had ever underrated the value of emotion. Luckily he had taken the organs for blue-bottles in his last years, which had been a comfort, and they had been able to enjoy the tunes. But a harp! Cook wondered. It was a change! And Mr. Timothy had never liked change. But she did not speak of this to Smither, who did so take a line of her own in regard to heaven that it quite put one about sometimes.|$|E
6000|$|This aged butler {{lay in bed}} {{waiting for}} the {{inevitable}} striking of a small alarum clock placed in the very centre of his mantelpiece. Flanking that round and ruthless arbiter, which drove him day by day to stand up on feet whose {{time had come to}} rest, were the effigies of his past triumphs. On the one hand, in a papier-mache frame, slightly tinged with smuts, stood a portrait of the [...] "Honorable Bateson," [...] in the uniform of his Yeomanry. Creed's former master's face wore that dare-devil look with which he had been wont to say: [...] "D---n it, Creed! lend me a pound. I've got no money!" [...] On the other hand, in a green frame which had once been plush, and covered by a glass with a crack in the left-hand corner, was a portrait of the Dowager Countess of Glengower, as this former mistress of his appeared, conceived by the local photographer, laying the foundation-stone of the local almshouse. During the wreck of Creed's career, which, following on a lengthy illness, had preceded his salvation by the Westminster Gazette, these two household gods had lain at the bottom of an old tin trunk, in the possession of the keeper of a lodging-house, waiting to be bailed out. The [...] "Honorable Bateson" [...] was now dead, nor had he paid as yet the pounds he had borrowed. Lady Glengower, too, was in heaven, remembering that she had forgotten all her servants in her will. He who had served them was still alive, and his first thought, when he had secured his post on the [...] "Westminister," [...] was to save enough to rescue them from a dishonourable confinement. It had taken him six months. He had found them keeping company with three pairs of woollen drawers; an old but respectable black tail-coat; a plaid cravat; a Bible; four socks, two of which had toes and two of which had heels; some darning-cotton and a needle; a pair of elastic-sided boots; a comb and a sprig of white heather, wrapped up with a little piece of shaving-soap and two pipe-cleaners in a bit of the Globe newspaper; also two collars, whose lofty points, separated by gaps of quite two inches, had been wont to reach their master's gills; the small alarum clock aforesaid; and a tiepin formed in the likeness of Queen Victoria at the date of her first Jubilee. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>had</b> he not gone in thought over those stores of treasure while he was parted from them!
