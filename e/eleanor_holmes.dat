5|$|The {{shooting}} led to {{the creation}} of the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization managed by the Capitol Police Board which provides funds for the families of Chestnut and Gibson. In November 2005, the fund was expanded to include the family of Sgt. Christopher Eney, a USCP officer killed during a training accident in 1984. The shooting was cited as one reason for the development of the Capitol Visitors Center. The legislation authorizing the construction of the facility was introduced by Washington, D.C. Delegate <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> Norton and was entitled the Jacob Joseph Chestnut-John Michael Gibson United States Capitol Visitor Center Act of 1998. The door where Weston entered was renamed in honor of the two officers, from the Document Door to the Chestnut-Gibson Memorial Door.|$|E

50|$|Holmes {{was widely}} admired {{during his last}} years, and on his ninetieth {{birthday}} was honored {{on one of the}} first coast-to-coast radio broadcasts, during which the Chief Justice, the Dean of Yale Law School, {{and the president of the}} American Bar Association read encomia; the Bar Association presented him with a gold medal. Notably, Alger Hiss clerked for Holmes during his last year on the Court. Holmes served on the court until January 12, 1932, when his brethren on the court, citing his advanced age, suggested that the time had come for him to step down. By that time, at 90 years of age, he was the oldest justice to serve in the court's history. On his ninety-second birthday, newly inaugurated President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his wife <b>Eleanor</b> called on <b>Holmes</b> at his house in Washington.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, the American Legion {{called for}} {{conversion}} of the District of Columbia War Memorial as well. To give added impetus to the effort, local D.C.-area attorney Edwin Fountain formed the World War I Memorial Foundation to solicit funds and act as a lobby for the effort. D.C. Council member Jack Evans (in whose ward the D.C. War Memorial was located) and <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> Norton, D.C.'s Delegate to Congress, both became honorary trustees of the foundation.|$|E
25|$|In a July 2016 {{statement}} issued {{jointly by the}} offices of Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine; Representatives Don Beyer, Gerald Connolly, and Barbara Comstock; and Delegate <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> Norton, the NPS plans repair the bridge in two phases. The first phase, which addresses the bridge's most urgent repairs, will refurbish and reinforce the approach spans on {{either end of the}} bridge at a cost of $166 million. These repairs will permit the bridge to stay open until 2030. The second phase, whose cost was estimated at $94 million, would replace the bascule span and make other repairs to the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Significant cost {{increases}} {{led to the}} project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from {{the cost of the}} building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that the Bush administration was meddling in the project's design. Two days later, <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> Norton, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.|$|E

500|$|The District {{is not a}} {{state and}} {{therefore}} has no voting representation in the Congress. D.C. residents elect a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives, currently <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> Norton (D-D.C. At-Large), who may sit on committees, participate in debate, and introduce legislation, but cannot vote on the House floor. The District has no official representation in the United States Senate. Neither chamber seats the District's elected [...] "shadow" [...] representative or senators. Unlike residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam, which also have non-voting delegates, D.C., residents are subject to all federal taxes. In the financial year 2012, D.C., residents and businesses paid $20.7billion in federal taxes; more than the taxes collected from 19 states and the highest federal taxes per capita.|$|E

[...] Kevin Naff, editor of the Blade, said employees [...] "found out when two of the corporate officers were waiting for us when we got to work this morning". [...] Since the Blade had been a profitable newspaper, and because the debt-ridden Window Media was no longer draining the publication's finances, the same day the Blade shut down, Naff told the Washington City Paper he and the remaining staffers [...] "We're all together.

Director Julia Pierson said {{that in addition to}} an investigation, there would be an increase in security patrols and surveillance. District of Columbia representative <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> Norton sent a letter to Pierson requesting a meeting to discuss the Gonzalez incident as well as other security breaches at the White House, saying: [...] "Before any action is taken, the first step must be to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the White House breach. The next step is to recognize that the area in front of the White House, including Lafayette Park, is a First Amendment area, which must not be taken away from District of Columbia residents and the millions of other Americans who visit each year." [...] New York representative Peter T. King said the incident was [...] "absolutely inexcusable", adding: [...] "This demands a full investigation, an investigation as to what happened, why it happened and what's being done to make sure it never happens again". Utah representative Jason Chaffetz said the incident was [...] "totally unacceptable" [...] and was just one of several security failings at the White House. Chaffetz said [...] "the Secret Service leadership has a lot of questions to answer", adding incredulously [...] "Was the door open?" ...|$|E

President George W. Bush signed it into law (P.L. 110-359) on October 8. As enacted, the Redevelopment Act required the GSA to proceed with redevelopment of the Old Post Office Building and relocate all federal tenants.

2500|$|The {{biggest issue}} of Chavous' third term was school {{vouchers}}. [...] Chavous had opposed vouchers in the past, but by February 2003, The Washington Post reported, Chavous {{was much more}} interested in providing ways to given parents a choice in whether to send their child to public school, private school, or charter school. Chavous and Mayor Williams met with Secretary of Education Rod Paige on February 6, 2003, to discuss vouchers and other [...] "choice" [...] programs, during which time Paige pledged a voucher program would not be forced on the city. After the meeting, Chavous said he had not yet decided if he would support vouchers or not. Chavous then began to significantly moderate his criticism of Williams. By March 31, Chavous said that he had come to support vouchers, but only if the program were not forced on the city and only if federal (not city) funds were used to finance the program. On February 8, 2003, President George W. Bush announced that he would seek federal legislation to impose a school voucher program on the city. As Bush's proposal was considered by the House of Representatives, Chavous and D.C.'s Delegate to Congress, <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> Norton (a strong opponent of vouchers), blamed one another for a series of snubs, missed meetings, and attacks. By the time the measure moved to the Senate in September, Chavous (along with Mayor Williams and Board President Cafritz) was opposed on the voucher issue by a significant majority of elected officials in the city. The Senate passed the school voucher bill on January 23, 2004, and President Bush signed it into law. [...] The legislation provided for a temporary, five-year experiment under which 1,700 low-income students would received up to $7,500 a year so that they could attend a private school in the city or nearby jurisdictions. Congress provided $14 million for the project.|$|E
2500|$|On January 6, 2009, Senators Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, and D.C. Delegate <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> Norton {{introduced}} in the House the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009 ( [...] and [...] ). On February 26, 2009, the Senate passed S. 160 {{by a vote of}} 61â€“37. However, before passing the bill, the Senate adopted an amendment by Senator John Ensign that would have removed the authority of the District of Columbia to prohibit or unduly burden the ability of its residents to possess guns in their homes, on their property, or at their places of business. The Ensign amendment would have also repealed District legislation requiring gun registration, the District's ban on semiautomatic weapons, and the District's criminal penalties for possession of an unregistered handgun. Following the Senate's passage of the bill, as amended, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on March 4 that he had postponed a House vote on the bill for at least a week, but it quickly became clear there were not enough votes to bring the bill to the floor without any amendments. Despite Hoyer's efforts to have the amendment's supporters withdraw it and propose it as separate legislation, and Norton's efforts to achieve consensus within the District's political community, where there is strong opposition to Ensign's amendment, Hoyer had to announce on June 9 that the bill was on hold indefinitely. In April 2010, the bill rather abruptly returned to the agenda, but the week a vote was expected, Hoyer declared the bill was unlikely to be passed during the 111th Congress. District politicians reiterated their opposition to the House passing the bill with Ensign's amendment. The House bill was re{{introduced in}} the 112th Congress as H.R.267.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the stadium}} threat to Langston Golf Course gone, {{a number of}} {{improvements}} went ahead. In 1988, the Nation's Capital Bicentennial Celebration committee said it would spearhead a $15 million fund-raising project to build a family golf center at Langston. This project, however, was not forthcoming. In 1999, heavy rains washed away some fairways and greens, exposing buried trash (such as household appliances). An $8 million project to regrade the course to improve drainage began. A year later, the concessionaire agreed to begin a series of projects to bring Langston Golf Course up to Professional Golfers Association standards. In 2002, a print of a painting by noted local artist Linwood Barnes depicting Clyde Martin taking the first drive at Langston Golf Course was hung in the clubhouse. In May 2002, Langston Golf Course {{became one of the}} first courses to host a First Tee chapter, a program designed to interest minorities and economically disadvantaged children in golf. In 2002 and 2003, Langston Golf Course opened a putt-and-chip practice area for young golfers and a four-hole course for novices. An academic resource center with computer stations, a small library, and tutoring and study programs was also opened. Students from local junior and senior high schools who study their schoolwork in the education center for an hour are awarded a free hour golf on the course. In 2002, about 200 students took advantage of the educational center. (The number had risen to 400 students by 2006.) The National Park Service and the concessionaire also established a strategic plan to raise $12 million to $17 million in public and private funds to complete the upgrade to PGA tour standards, build a new clubhouse with banquet facilities, establish a museum dedicated to African American golfers, replace the driving range, and expand the education center. In 2007, D.C. Delegate to Congress <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> Norton introduced the [...] "Golf Course Preservation and Modernization Act" [...] in Congress, legislation which would allow the National Park Service (NPS) to lease Langston and the other federally owned golf courses in the District of Columbia (rather than simply offer a concession contract). A long-term lease, Norton said, would allow the lessee to obtain high levels of capital investment funds and greatly improve the courses.|$|E
