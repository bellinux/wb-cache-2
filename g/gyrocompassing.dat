Objective. The purpose of our paper is to research possibility to use PID-control for initial alignment of {{inertial navigation system}}. Two alignment modes ? leveling and <b>gyrocompassing</b> of platform are discussed. Methods. Literature review on alignment and state of problem are considered {{in the first part}} ? introduction. The second part of the paper presents details of standard gyrostabilized platform leveling by scheme ?accelerometer?gyroscope?platform?. In the third part a possibility to use PID-control for coarse leveling by ?accelerometer?platform? scheme is discussed. <b>Gyrocompassing</b> mode is the subject of the last fourth part. Results. Calculation formulas for determining the coefficients of the PID control, dynamic and precision characteristics of <b>gyrocompassing</b> mode for gyroscope proportional control law are obtained. The results of computational modeling of the process of leveling for multiple selection criteria of the coefficients of the PID-control are brought. Conclusions. It is concluded that using of standard Butterworth forms and integral criterion of minimum weighted error module allows us to bring and provide the necessary precision. Using the PID-control for the coarse leveling mode ensures the necessary control process quality. ????????????. ???????? ???????????? ????????????? ???????

In general GPS solutions can be two or more orders cheaper than their inertial sensors counterparts. This paper addresses the north alignment by <b>gyrocompassing</b> in the context of more modern smoothing techniques.

40|$|Abstract — North-finding {{based on}} micromachined {{gyroscopes}} {{is an attractive}} possibility. This paper analyzes north-finding methods and demonstrates a measured 4 mrad standard devia-tion azimuth uncertainty using an in-house developed vibratory silicon MEMS quadruple mass gyroscope (QMG). We instru-mented a vacuum packaged QMG with isotropic Q-factor of 1. 2 million and Allan deviation bias instability of 0. 2 °/hr for azimuth detection by measuring the earth’s rotation. Continu-ous rotation (“carouseling”) produced azimuth datapoints with uncertainty diminishing as the square root {{of the number of}} turns. Integration of 100 datapoints with normally distributed errors reduced uncertainty to 4 mrad, beyond the noise of current QMG instrumentation. We also implemented self-calibration methods, including in-situ temperature sensing and discrete ± 180 ° turning (“maytagging ” or two-point <b>gyrocompassing)</b> as potential alternatives to carouseling. While both mechanizations produced similar azimuth uncertainty, we conclude that carousel-ing is more advantageous as it is robust to bias, scale-factor, and temperature drifts, although it requires a rotary platform providing continuous rotation. Maytagging, on the other hand, can be implemented using a simple turn table, but requires calibration due to temperature-induced drifts.

40|$|The {{concept of}} carouseling an IMU is {{simulated}} {{in order to}} improve the accuracy of MEMS IMUs. Carouseling consists of slewing the IMU through a pre-determined trajectory that is selected based on inherent properties that lead to improved performance. MEMS devices typically have far more uncertainty than standard inertial measurement devices, yet are considerably less massive and require less power, so implementing this carouseling scheme could make the use of these lightweight systems possible even in high-accuracy situations, such as <b>gyrocompassing.</b> In <b>gyrocompassing,</b> the most significant benefit provided by the carouseling scheme is the reduction in the error contribution of gyroscope bias, as this error is almost completely eliminated. Additionally, it was found that although implementing the carouseling scheme required the addition of error states to account for the size effect, in many cases these error states may not be necessary. Overall, the carouseling of the MEMS IMUs was shown to be effective in reducing azimuth error covariance significantly. by Benjamin Matthew Renkoski. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{improving}} the orbital <b>gyrocompassing</b> process involving the attitude angle estimation of an earth-pointing satellite in low-Earth orbit uses an electro-optical sensor for direct measurement of the satellite azimuth angle. Simulations have shown that this additional measurement drastically reduces the estimator convergence time, especially when the sun sensor is rendered ineffective, e. g., by high solar elevations. The azimuth-sensing method is based on estimation of the image shift between successive picture frames of an on-board, Earth-pointing, charge-coupled device (CCD) full-matrix camera. The shift-estimation algorithm is based on minimizing a cost function which expresses mean-squared differences in brightness patterns of selected areas of the two frames. An extensive evaluation program with a computer-controlled 2 -axis light table and actual satellite images has demonstrated high robustness {{for a wide range}} of variation of parameters including image texture content; camera focal length; sampling rate; and number of pixels processed.

Obviously, it’s necessary to consider the impact of vibration disturbance during the alignment process to achieve better performance. In order to guarantee the alignment accuracy on the rocking base and shorten the convergence time of alignment, a <b>gyrocompass</b> alignment method of SINS based on Kalman filter pretreatment and dynamic gain adjustment was proposed. The output of gyros and accelerometers was firstly pre-filtered by Kalman filter to remove the impact of high-frequency small-amplitude rocking interference.

The vehicle test of a ring laser SINS showed that the new <b>gyrocompass</b> alignment method can suppress high-frequency disturbances when the vehicle underwent low-frequency large-amplitude rocking interference.
