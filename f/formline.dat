50|$|Two-dimensional Northwest Coast art is {{distinguished}} {{by the use}} of formlines, and the use of characteristic shapes referred to as ovoids, U forms and S forms. Before European contact, the most common media were wood (often Western red cedar), stone, and copper; since European contact, paper, canvas, glass, and precious metals have also been used. If paint is used, the most common colours are red and black, but yellow is also often used, particularly among Kwakwaka'wakw artists. Chilkat weaving applies <b>formline</b> designs to textiles. Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian have traditionally produced Chilkat woven regalia, from wool and yellow cedar bark, that is important for civic and ceremonial events, including potlatches.|$|E

Haida carvers include Charles Edenshaw, Bill Reid, and Robert Davidson. Besides working in wood, Haida also work with argillite. Traditional <b>formline</b> designs translate well into glass sculpture, which is increasingly popular thanks to efforts by contemporary glass artists such as Preston Singletary (Tlingit), Susan Point (Coast Salish) and Marvin Oliver (Quinault/Isleta Pueblo).|$|E

50|$|Chilkat weaving {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex weaving {{techniques}} in the world. It is unique in that the artist can create curvilinear and circular forms within the weave itself. A Chilkat blanket can take a year to weave. Traditionally mountain goat wool, dog fur, and yellow cedar bark are used in Chilkat weaving. Today sheep wool might be used. The designs used Northwest Coast <b>formlines,</b> a traditional aesthetic language made up of ovoid, U-form, and S-form elements to create highly stylized, but representational, clan crests and figures from oral history—often animals and especially their facial features. Yellow and black are dominant colors in the weavings, as is the natural buff color of the undyed wool. Blue can be a secondary color.Looms used in Chilkat weaving only have a top frame and vertical supports, with no bottom frame, so the warp threads hang freely. The weaver works in vertical sections, as opposed to moving horizontally from end to end. Consequently, many designs are broken into vertical columns. As with most Northwest Coast art, these columns are bilaterally symmetrical.|$|R

Three current projects involve dam removals, construction of fish ladders and other channel modifications in support of fish passage along a three mile section of the river near Shannock, RI, {{all of which have}} been funded through public organizations and state/federal programs including the allocations from the ARRA. One of these three projects at the Horseshoe Falls Dam involves design of a fish ladder and eel pass sandwiched between a bridge and a historic dry stone masonry horseshoe-shaped dam. An underwater diving inspection and structural evaluation was performed to assess the existing spillway and bridge structure’s conditions and identify deficiencies. Several alternative layouts were evaluated, based on the targeted fish species and populations expected to pass and utilize upstream spawning habitat. The project is in a historic district and required coordination with three property owners to address aesthetic concerns. Renderings were developed depicting the various structural faces and elevations in relation to existing structures and to visualize potential concrete <b>formlining</b> options matching the composition and hue of adjacent stone structures. Through extensive coordination with the state historic preservation agency and property owners under Section 106 requirements, a final configuration and design was developed fitting the character of adjacent historic features. Evaluating alternative solar panel locations for a small pump at the eel pass ramp was particularly challenging. After several meetings to review alternatives, the project team decided to develop new technology providing an innovative autonomously-adjusting mechanical assembly to regulate inlet water flows throughout the range of the dam’s seasonal headwater evaluations.

Schoppert learned that the Tlingit <b>formline</b> that was considered the traditional method was only a relatively recent development among the Northwest Indian. It was his opinion that enforcing the practices of 1850's or 1950's as the rule for all time amounted to artistic tyranny. He has been quoted as saying [...] "Learn the rules, then break them". When talking about his panels, his intention was to further the art by following what he considered its natural progression.

Za dio gospodarske jedinice ‘Donja Kupčina – Pisarovina’ (14 odsjeka) na sistematskom uzorku ploha provedena je manualna (klasična/analogna) stereo fotogrametrijska izmjera na aerosnimkama GSD 30 cm i 10 cm (GSD – eng. Ground Sample Distance). Svakom stablu na plohi određena (interpretirana) je vrsta drveća, izmjerena visina i delineirana krošnja, na temelju čega su procijenjeni glavni strukturni elementi sastojina. Kako bi se utvrdila točnost fotogrametrijski procijenjenih strukturnih elemenata sastojina provedena je usporedba s podacima terenske izmjere. Rezultati provedenog istraživanja potvrdili su velik potencijal primjene digitalnih aerosnimaka visokih prostornih rezolucija u stereomodelu pri inventuri šuma. Usporedbom rezultata fotogrametrijske izmjere na digitalnim aerosnimkama GSD 30 cm i GSD 10 cm s rezultatima terenske izmjere utvrđeno je da aerosnimke GSD 30 cm pružaju mogućnost procjene srednjih sastojinskih visina, sastojinske temeljnice i volumena s gotovo jednakom točnošću kao i aerosnimke GSD 10 cm. Međutim, pogreške procijene srednjeg sastojinskog promjera i broja stabala bile su gotovo dvostruko veće na aerosnimkama GSD 30 cm nego na aerosnimkama GSD 10 cm. Stoga se može zaključiti kako aerosnimke GSD 10 cm sveukupno daju bolje rezultate procjene strukturnih elemenata sastojina, jer prikazuje strukturu sastojine bliže stvarnoj. Although the {{application}} of aerial stereo photogrammetry in forest inventory has a long tradition, in many countries including Croatia forest inventories are based on labour and time consuming field surveys. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} research was to evaluate the applicability of using the digital aerial images of high spatial resolution (ground sampling distance – GSD of 10 cm and 30 cm) for predicting forest stand attributes (basal-area weighted mean dbh – DBHg, Lorey’s mean height – HL, stand density – N, basal area – G, volume – V). This research continues the work of the previous research (Balenović et al. 2013, 2015 a), where accuracy of photogrammetrically estimated arithmetic mean diameter and arithmetic mean height of forest stands were evaluated. The research was conducted in the even-aged (sessile oak management class) and the multi-aged stands (European beech and common hornbeam management classes) of a privately owned forest in the management unit Donja Kupčina – Pisarovina, 25 km south of Zagreb, Croatia (Figure 1). Field data were collected during {{the spring and summer of}} 2009 as part of the regular forest inventory conducted according to the valid Regulation on Forest Management. A total of 183 circular plots with radii of 8 or 12 m were systematically set in the 14 selected subcompartments. The positions of the sample plot centres were recorded with GPS receiver. Within each plot, the diameter at breast height (dbh) was measured and tree species was determined for all trees with dbh&# 8805; 10 cm. The height of each tree was calculated by means of the constructed local height curves fitted with Michailloff’s function. The basal area (g) of each tree was calculated from the measured dbhs using standard equation, whereas the merchantable tree volume up to a diameter of 7 cm overbark (v) was calculated from field-measured dbh and estimated h using the Schumacher-Hall function and parameters from Croatian volume tables. The forest stand attributes were calculated by averaging data of all sampled tree within each stand (DBHg, HL) or summing the tree data and dividing it by the total area of all plots for each stand (N, G, V). Stand-level field data were used in the statistical analysis and comparison with photogrammetric data as a ground-truth reference data (Table 1). The colour infrared (CIR) digital aerial images of GSD 30 cm and GSD 10 cm were acquired using a Microsoft UltraCamX digital large-format aerial camera during two aerial surveys in July 2009 (Figure 1, Table 2). The digital terrain data (breaklines, <b>formlines,</b> spot heights and mass points) for the digital terrain model (DTM) generation were collected by stereo-mapping of digital aerial images according to the rules of the Croatian State Geodetic Administration. The whole procedure of image acquisition, aerial triangulation, and collection of 3 D data was conducted by Geofoto Ltd. (Zagreb, Croatia). The photogrammetric stereo measurements and the visual interpretation of tree attributes were performed on digital aerial images of 30 cm GSD and 10 cm GSD using PHOTOMOD 5. 24 digital photogrammetric system according to procedures described in Balenović et al. 2013, 2015 a. The photogrammetric plots were overlaid upon the aerial images based on the spatial coordinates (x, y) of the field plot centres recorded by the GPS receiver. The determination of tree species and crown tops as well as the delineation of crown areas was performed manually for each tree whose top fell inside the plot. The height of each tree was calculated as the difference between the tree top elevations and the corresponding tree bottom elevations determined from the DTM. A raster DTM of 1 m grid size was generated through linear interpolation of a triangular irregular network (TIN) which was previously created from the digital terrain data. The dbh of each tree on the plot was calculated using local regression models with tree height and crown diameter as inputs (Balenović et al. 2012). Crown diameter was calculated from delineated crown area by applying the equation for circle surface area. Further calculations of photogrammetric tree (g, v) and stand variables (DBHg, HL, N, G, V) were identical to previously described calculations of field data. The accuracy of the photogrammetrically estimated stand attributes was evaluated by calculating differences (D), mean differences (MD) and RMSE between photogrammetric- and field-estimates. The relative values of D%, MD%, RMSE% were calculated according to the mean of the field reference values. The D and D% were calculated for each subcompartment, whereas MD, MD%, RMSE and RMSE% were calculated for the whole study area. The results in Table 3 show that photogrammetric measurements of the aerial images of 30 cm GSD (PM 30) and 10 cm GSD (PM 10) produced reasonable accurate estimates for HL, G, V with relative RMSEs ranging from 3. 65 % to 5. 36 %. Similar accuracy was obtained for DBHg estimated by PM 10 (RMSE= 4. 94 %), while lower accuracy was obtained for N estimated by PM 10 (RMSE= 7. 71 %) and DBHg estimated by PM 30 (RMSE= 9. 460 %). The lowest accuracy was obtained for N estimated by PM 30 (RMSE= 15. 90 %). Both photogrammetric measurements (PM 10 and PM 30) estimated HL and G with similar level of accuracy, whereas V was estimated with slightly higher accuracy by PM 10 then by PM 30. For estimation of DBHg and V, PM 10 produced considerably better results, i. e. estimates of approximately twice higher accuracy then PM 30. Figure 2 shows relations between D% and field estimates of corresponding attributes for each subcompartment. As can be seen, photogrammetrically estimated HL and V varied between overestimation and underestimation (HL: from - 13. 6 % to 2. 8 % for PM 10, from - 12. 8 % to 3. 7 % for PM 30; V: from - 7. 0 % to 2. 2 % for PM 10, from - 10. 2 % to 8. 2 % for PM 30), but with a slight tendency to underestimate field estimates. Photogrammetrically estimated G also varied between overestimation and underestimation (from - 6. 2 % to 12. 9 % for PM 10, from - 5. 0 % to 10. 2 % for PM 30), but with a slight tendency to overestimate field estimates. DBHg was overestimated for all subcompartments by both photogrammetric measurements (from 1. 1 to 9. 5 % for PM 10; from 3. 0 % to 16. 5 % for PM 30). On the contrary, both photogrammetric measurements underestimated N throughout all subcompartments (from - 2. 6 % to - 10. 6 % for PM 10; from - 5. 1 % to - 24. 4 % for PM 30). For both DBHg and N, PM 30 produced estimates of lower accuracy than PM 10. This is a consequence of lesser visibility of details (e. g. crown boundaries) on images of lower spatial resolution (GSD 30 cm) and decreased ability to detect individual trees, especially in the part of stands with greater proportion of younger trees. According to Figure 3, the notable underestimation of N by PM 30 was found in the lowest dbh size class (10. 0 - 14. 9 cm). The results of this research showed that HL, G and V can be accurately estimated by manual measurements of digital aerial images of high spatial resolution. The use of images of high spatial resolution, along with the use of local dbh models, led to improved accuracy regarding individual tree detection and dbh estimation. Moreover, the errors of N underestimation and DBH overestimation have been mutually abolished, which in the end resulted with reasonably accurate estimates of G and V at stand level. Since the errors of N underestimation and DBH overestimation with PM 30 were both proportionally (twice) greater than with PM 10, G and V were estimated on both 10 cm and 30 cm GSD images with similar level of accuracy. Although PM 10 overall produced the more accurate results than PM 30, it should be noted that the price of 10 cm images is several time higher than of 30 cm images. Therefore, a potential user should decide which images to use depending on desired accuracy and available funds...|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Schoppert came to Anchorage for a {{construction}} job which, it turned out, {{was no longer}} available. On February 26 of that year, using {{the last of his}} money, he bought a piece of soapstone and carved an owl. He put it up for sale at the urging of his sister and was able to sell it quickly, which marked the formal beginning of his career as an artist. Understanding that knowledge was important, he went on to earn a BFA from the University of Alaska Anchorage and a MFA from the University of Washington. But [...] "his apprenticeship was with himself" [...] according to Steven Brown, associate curator at the Seattle Art Museum. Continuing to produce work while still an undergraduate, he won first place in the statewide Earth, Fire and Fiber juried show in 1976. This sculpture should have been an indication of things to come as it was a separation from his traditional work which would define him as an artist and create controversy and curiosity in later years. Although he created art using the traditional <b>formline,</b> he chose a different approach for a great deal of his work that did not neatly fit into either contemporary or Northwest Coast art. He was quoted as saying [...] "There is tremendous pressure for conformity from collectors and scholars, who want work that fits into the classic definition of Northwest Indian art. When things don't fit their expectations there's a raised eyebrow, and a sort of suggestion of 'What do we do with it now?'". This mindset is what allowed Schoppert to create his most recognizable pieces which are large carved panels made of multiple planks, painted in non traditional colors and the planks rearranged to create an entirely new look and a break from traditional methods and form line. Examples of this style are seen in his works Teasing Eagle and Raven Opens Box of Stars.|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores {{contemporary}} artistic {{production by}} First Nations artists along the Northwest Coast of Canada. Focus {{is given to}} {{an exploration of the}} choices made by a growing number of emerging artists who are challenging conventions recognized as the visual language of Aboriginal artists of this region, namely <b>formline</b> design. Two Northwest Coast First Nations artists are my focus: Sonny Assu and Shawn Hunt. A complex intersection between tradition and contemporaneity is revealed in the work of Assu and Hunt. An exploration into the artistic practices of these two contemporary artists leads to an important question: why does <b>formline</b> continue to circulate in contemporary Northwest Coast First Nations art and what meaning(s) does it convey in the present moment? This thesis seeks to uncover how Assu and Hunt manipulate and challenge Northwest Coast aesthetic conventions, raising questions regarding how Native art of this region is defined, interpreted, and valued. Attention will also be given to the work of historical and established Northwest Coast First Nations artists who have set artistic precedents and greatly influenced this emerging generation of artists. Discussion will include Charles Edenshaw, Bill Reid, Robert Davidson, and Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun. Assu and Hunt push aesthetic boundaries, challenging the notion that <b>formline</b> design circulates within a historical context that does not allow room for innovation. This thesis highlights artists who are mastering and manipulating “traditional” aesthetics in a journey to achieve balance between an articulation of Aboriginal traditions and community belonging, and expressions of individual ingenuity and voice...|$|E
