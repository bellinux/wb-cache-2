50|$|Prior to {{incorporation}} on December 31, 1937, the Fendt brothers produced several tractors in {{a blacksmith}} shop {{under the guidance}} of their father, Johann Georg. The tractors built featured a 6 HP engine, a <b>mounted</b> <b>plow,</b> and an independently driven mower.|$|R
50|$|It {{can travel}} at speeds {{of up to}} 55 mph {{on the road and}} it also has {{off-road}} capabilities. The vehicle also has a trailer <b>mounted</b> <b>plow</b> which can be used to dig the launcher into the earth in order to help protect it were it within the vicinity of a nuclear detonation.|$|R
50|$|The Midgetman was to {{be carried}} by a Hard Mobile Launcher (HML) vehicle. Most of these {{vehicles}} would normally remain on bases, only being deployed in times of international crisis when nuclear war was considered more likely. The Hard Mobile Launcher was radiation hardened and had a trailer <b>mounted</b> <b>plow</b> to dig the HML into the earth for additional nuclear blast protection.|$|R

40|$|Removal of {{ice from}} roads {{is of the}} more {{challenging}} task in winter highway maintenance. The best mechanical method {{is to use a}} truck with underbody plow blade, but such equipment is not available to all agencies charged with winter maintenance operations. While counties and cities often use motor graders to scrape ice, it would be of great benefit if front <b>mounted</b> <b>plows</b> could be used effectively for ice removal. To reveal and understand the factors that influence the performance of these plows, measurement of the forces experienced by the plow blades during ice scraping is desirable. This study explores the possibility of using accelerometers to determine the forces on a front-mounted plow when scraping ice. The plow was modeled by using a dynamic approach. The forces on the plow were to be determined by the measurement of the accelerations of the plow. Field tests were conducted using an "as is" front-mounted plow instrumented with accelerometers. The results of the field tests indicate that in terms of ice removal, the front-mounted plow is not favorable equipment. The major problem in this study is that the front <b>mounted</b> <b>plow</b> was not able to cut ice, and therefore experienced no significant scraping forces. However, the use of accelerometers seems to be promising for analyzing the vibration problems of the front-mounted plow...|$|R

5000|$|Terminal strip construction, {{which is}} often {{referred}} to as point-to-point construction within the tube guitar amplifier community, uses terminal strips (also called [...] "tag boards"). A terminal strip has stamped tin-plated copper terminals, each with a hole through which wire ends could be pushed, fitted on an insulating strip, usually made of a cheap, heat-resistant material such as synthetic-resin bonded paper (FR-2), or bakelite reinforced with cotton. The insulator has an <b>integral</b> <b>mounting</b> bracket, sometimes electrically connected to one or more of the stamped loops to ground them to the chassis.|$|R

40|$|Plowing is an art, {{and good}} plowing is {{the pride of}} every farmer. A good job of plowing is {{apparent}} even to the casual observer. A well-adjusted plow will do better work, have lighter draft, give less wear on plow parts, and will make the tractor easier to operate than a poorly set plow. Most plows are received from the factory “knocked down,” and must be set up and adjusted before being used. Variations in plowing conditions may make frequent plow adjustments necessary. Most modern tractor plows have all adjustments necessary to set the plow properly. When properly set, a plow should {{do a good job}} under usual plowing conditions. If a poor plowing job is done with a tractor plow, it is usually traceable to improper adjustment or extremely unfavorable plowing conditions. In most cases, failure to do first-class plowing results from careless adjustments or lack of knowledge as to how to set the plow. Because of the many different kinds of <b>mounted</b> <b>plows,</b> this bulletin deals principally with the “pulled” type moldboard tractor plow...|$|R
5000|$|Tillage, {{also known}} as cultivation, is the turning over of the soil. This method is more often used in {{agricultural}} crops. [...] Tillage can be performed {{on a small scale}} with tools such as small, hand pushed rotary tillers or on a large scale with tractor <b>mounted</b> <b>plows.</b> [...] Tillage is able to control weeds because when the soil is overturned, the vegetative parts of the plants are damaged and the root systems are exposed causing desiccation. [...] Generally, the younger the weed is, the more readily it can be controlled with tillage. [...] To control mature perennial weeds, repeated tillage is necessary. By continually destroying new growth and damaging the root system, the weed's food stores are depleted until it can no longer re-sprout. [...] Also, when the soil is overturned, the soil seed bank is disrupted which can cause dormant weed seeds to germinate {{in the absence of the}} previous competitors. These new weeds can also be controlled by continued tillage until the soil seed bank is depleted.|$|R

40|$|The Clementine {{spacecraft}} {{was launched}} in January 1994 to demonstrate advanced lightweight technologies for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). One of the key technologies was the first use of a multi-cell nickel hydrogen (NiH 2) common pressure vessel (CPV) battery. The 5. 0 inch diameter, 22 cell, 15. 0 ampere-hour NiH 2 CPV battery was manufactured by Johnson Controls Battery Group Inc., (JCBGI). Battery test and integration was performed by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The battery was mounted to the spacecraft using a unique, lightweight graphite epoxy structure. An <b>integral</b> <b>mounted</b> pressure transducer provided battery pressure data for a pressure based charge control method.

40|$|This report {{details the}} {{development}} of a reconfigurable in-tank robotic cleanup system called Houdini{trademark}. Driven by the general need to develop equipment for the removal of radioactive waste from hundreds of DOE waste storage tanks and the specific needs of DOE sites such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Fernald, Houdini{trademark} represents one of the possible tools {{that can be used to}} mobilize and retrieve this waste material for complete remediation. Houdini{trademark} is a hydraulically powered, track driven, mobile work vehicle with a collapsible frame designed to enter underground or above ground waste tanks through existing 24 inch riser openings. After the vehicle has entered the waste tank, it unfolds and lands on the waste surface or tank floor to become a remotely operated mini-bulldozer. Houdini{trademark} utilizes a vehicle <b>mounted</b> <b>plow</b> blade and 6 -DOF manipulator to mobilize waste and carry other tooling such as sluicing pumps, excavation buckets, and hydraulic shears. The complete Houdini{trademark} system consists of the tracked vehicle and other support equipment (e. g., control console, deployment system, hydraulic power supply, and controller) necessary to deploy and remotely operate this system at any DOE site. Inside the storage tanks, the system is capable of performing heel removal, waste mobilization, waste size reduction, and other tank waste retrieval and decommissioning tasks. The first Houdini{trademark} system was delivered on September 24, 1996 to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The system acceptance test was successfully performed at a cold test facility at ORNL. After completion of the cold test program and the training of site personnel, ORNL will deploy the system for clean-up and remediation of the Gunite storage tanks...|$|R

40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this thesis {{are those of the}} author and do not relfect the offical policy or position of the Department of Defense or the U. S. Government. Previous modifications were made to the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Lidar System to enable comparison of lidar returns with radiosonde vertical profiles. Inaccuracies due to flexing of the lidar mounting structure limited observation of correlation between lidar and balloon data. Reconstruction with anew telescope and <b>integral</b> <b>mounting</b> now provides stable overlap of laser illumination and receiver field-of-view while maintaining eye safety. This revised system permits more measurement of profile correlation. Both day and night lidar measurement series have been compared with concurrent radiosonde launches in the Monterey Bay area. Maximum ranges from clouds greater than 3500 meters by day and greater than 5000 meters by night have been achieved. Within this range comparison can be made with moderate accuracy with the temperature and pressure profile boundary layer ceiling. Recommendations are made for future enhancement of sensitivity of correlation. Naval Postgraduate School (U. S.)
