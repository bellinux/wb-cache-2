5|$|After several months, Noriega was {{transferred}} to the province of Chiriquí, where Torrijos and Díaz Herrera were posted. That year's presidential election was contested by Arnulfo Arias, a native of that province. The sitting President, Rodolfo Chiari, ordered Torrijos to harass Arias's party members, to weaken his election bid. Torrijos passed this task on to Noriega, whose men arrested a number of people. Several prisoners said that they had been tortured; others stated they had been raped in prison.

The main <b>item</b> <b>of</b> debate during the Coalition Ministry was the East India Bill, which provoked bitter arguments in both the House of Lords and House of Commons. In an attempt to speed up the process of passing the bill, Mansfield left his position as Speaker to debate directly on 15 December; when this failed to help he returned to the Woolsack the next day. The failure of the bill caused the government to be immediately dismissed, and Mansfield left his position on 23 December 1783.|$|E
40|$|The {{stochastic}} independece property demonstrated {{among the}} <b>items</b> <b>of</b> a questionnaire {{by means of}} the Rasch Simple Logistic Model could be violated when specific similariets are hypothesised among items which belong to subsets <b>of</b> <b>items</b> <b>of</b> the original questionnaire.

Three subsets <b>of</b> <b>items</b> have been analysed {{by means of the}} DLIM. the dispersion parameter, redenomated dependece parameter, account for dependencies among the <b>items</b> <b>of</b> the subtest "expressiveness".

5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any <b>item</b> <b>of</b> Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E

The <b>items</b> <b>of</b> epistemic modality are found to be polysemous and poly - functional which are reflected pragmatically in the forms of politeness, ne gotiative and constructive functions.
