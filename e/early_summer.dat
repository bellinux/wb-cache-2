50|$|Council Fire follows every Sunday dinner. The entire camp congregates at {{specific}} site {{to recognize the}} achievements of the past week, including awards earned and good deeds done. This tradition dates back to the <b>earliest</b> <b>summers</b> at Timanous.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of Saint Columba in 1958, she became the year-round Ardrishaig boat. She spent some <b>early</b> <b>summers</b> cruising out of Oban, with [...] substituting on the Clyde. She made the last ever run on the Royal Route 30 September 1969.|$|R
5|$|Approximately 40,000 {{medium to}} large icebergs {{annually}} calve from Greenland glaciers, {{and depending on}} wind, and air and water temperature, between 400 and 800 of these go {{as far south as}} 48° north latitude (St. John's). Icebergs are most commonly seen in the waters off Newfoundland in the spring and <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{as a source of}} nectar for the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) in winter to <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> (May to December), from field studies in the Scott National Park, replaced by Adenanthos meisneri in the summer. Several honeyeater species visit and pollinate Banksia ilicifolia. The western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus) in particular prefers this species over other banksias.|$|E
5|$|Castle Lake and the {{surrounding}} area contain a wide variety of animals and plants including trout, bears, deer, otters, frogs, and osprey. The area is also well-known for <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> displays of flowers, including red Columbine (Aquilegia truncata), fawn lily (Erythronium sp.), and Shasta pentstemon (Pentstemon laetus).|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} park is {{bathed in a}} subarctic climate (Dfc according to the Köppen classification). The maritime influence explains why its <b>early</b> <b>summers</b> are colder than they are farther inland, but its autumns are in contrast more mild. The topography causes important local variations.|$|R
50|$|The Palacio de Galiana is {{a palace}} in Toledo, Spain, on {{the borders of}} the Tagus River. It was built on the site of an <b>earlier</b> <b>summer</b> villa and garden of Al-Mamun, the king of the Taifa of Toledo, in the thirteenth century by king Alphonso X.|$|R
5000|$|It {{seems likely}} that earlier fairs were held on the same days, {{one of which is}} the feast day of St Ætheldreda, long {{associated}} with the site. Historian Graham Platts' view is that there should be scepticism over a belief that the fair developed from <b>earlier</b> <b>summer</b> solstice rites.|$|R
5|$|Construction {{began in}} August 2005, with work on both {{platforms}} and the intermediate tower occurring {{through the summer}} of that year. The bulk of the construction occurred in 2006. Installation of the engines and other equipment occurred during the spring and <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 2006, which was followed by installation of the cables during the late summer and early fall.|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its fog which occurs most often {{in the spring and}} <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> because of the {{contrast}} between sea and air temperatures. Argentia has 206 days of fog per year. Fog in Newfoundland is frequently accompanied by strong onshore winds; while usually winds disperse fog, here the fog is too widespread for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|Other {{breeding}} birds include ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers {{in the sand}} dunes, and water rails in the reed bed. Sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers all nest in the wetland, and little egrets are now common on the reserve. In <b>early</b> <b>summer,</b> scarcer migrants like the little gull, black tern, Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The Black Sea Coast {{region was}} among the most {{severely}} hit regions of Russia with significant loss of life due to a tornado that hit the tourist region and destroyed homes. This was after <b>earlier</b> <b>summer</b> floods in southern Russia. All told, damage in the region was calculated at more than $400 million.|$|R
50|$|The film bears a {{striking}} resemblance to AIP’s <b>earlier</b> <b>summer</b> box office hit, I Was a Teenage Werewolf. With a story and screenplay credit by I Was a Teenage Werewolf writer Ralph Thornton (a pseudonym for AIP producer Herman Cohen and Aben Kandel), Blood of Dracula features many other similarities to Werewolf.|$|R
5000|$|During <b>early</b> <b>summers</b> at the University of Manitoba, Mendelsohn {{would travel}} to Quebec City to teach to {{supplement}} his $3,000 annual salary at the University of Manitoba. In 1958, Mendelsohn and Dulmage published the paper [...] "Coverings of biparte graphs", {{in which the}} Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition is described. Mendelsohn is also remembered for Mendelsohn triple systems.|$|R
5|$|Seed {{multiplication}} may be {{used for}} the development of new cultivars or to increase the yield of native species. Seeds are generally sown in <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> in seedbeds, and then transplanted to larger containers. They require warmth frequent watering, and should not be given a dormant period. Seeds do not breed true. Plants obtained from seeds take about six years to bloom.|$|E
5|$|The Dime Store {{opened in}} the <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 2014 (June–July), with a grand opening on June 16. It began {{operating}} with a limited menu during the hours of 7am to 3pm; hours were later extended to 6pm. The restaurant's weekend brunch launched in July, offering a larger menu from 9am to 3pm.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor {{returned}} to Hungary in the <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 1044, and was joined in his advance by many Hungarian lords. The decisive battle was fought on 5 June at Ménfő (near Győr), where Samuel Aba's forces were defeated. Although Aba {{escaped from the}} battlefield, Peter's supporters soon captured and killed him.|$|E
5000|$|George Noble Jones (1811-1876) was an American wealthy {{southern}} plantation {{owner who}} owned the El Destino Plantation and Chemonie Plantation. In 1839 he hired English architect, Richard Upjohn, to build Kingscote one of the <b>earliest</b> <b>summer</b> [...] "cottages" [...] on Bellevue Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island. Kingscote, a classic Gothic Revival building, is now a National Historic Landmark.|$|R

5|$|The Final Frontier grossed $49,566,330 in the {{domestic}} box office for a global total of $63million. The season proved to be another record-breaker for the film industry, with domestic summer box-office revenues of $2.05billion. The Final Frontier was the season's tenth-best-grossing film, although it failed to make expected returns. It and Pink Cadillac were the <b>early</b> <b>summer's</b> biggest box-office disappointments.|$|R
5|$|The time of {{breeding}} {{depends on the}} elevation and latitude of the salamander's habitat. Generally, the lower-elevation salamanders breed in the fall, winter, and early spring. Higher-elevation salamanders breed in spring and <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> In the higher climates especially, salamanders will enter ponds and lakes that still have ice floating.|$|E
5|$|The western painted turtle's {{consumption}} {{of plants and}} animals changes seasonally. In <b>early</b> <b>summer,</b> 60% of its diet comprises insects. In late summer, 55% includes plants. Of note, the western painted turtle aids in the dispersal of white water-lily seeds. The turtle consumes the hard-coated seeds, which remain viable after passing through the turtle, and disperses them through its feces.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum is {{most common}} in rich, mixed upland forests. It is easily {{recognised}} by its attractive three-petaled white flowers, opening from late spring to <b>early</b> <b>summer,</b> that rise above a whorl of three, leaf-like bracts. It {{is an example of}} a spring ephemeral, a plant whose life-cycle is synchronised with that of the deciduous woodland which it favours.|$|E
50|$|The club {{also has}} a summer camp, Hammer-Ro, located on the Hammergården estate at Holbæk Fjord. It was inaugurated in 2006 as a {{replacement}} for an <b>earlier</b> <b>summer</b> camp at Mosede which was sold in 2004. The Mosede site was acquired in 1945. The first house was built on the land in 1856 and replaced by a new one in 1967.|$|R
50|$|Point Comfort is a {{historic}} house on South Skakutakee Road in Harrisville, New Hampshire. Built in 1892, this 2-1/2 story wood frame house {{is one of the}} <b>earliest</b> <b>summer</b> resort houses to be built along the shores of Silver Lake. It is eclectically styled, with steeply pitched gables, bands of shingles on the walls, exposed rafter ends, and decorative rake boards.|$|R
5000|$|Armstrong {{soon began}} to study at the Université de Dijon {{and then at the}} Sorbonne. [...] Living in an {{unheated}} apartment, he spent time at the Louvre, finding the warm museum as welcoming during the Parisian winter as the cool ones had been in <b>earlier</b> <b>summers.</b> [...] Armstrong returned to finish his BA degree in Art History at Lake Forest in 1973.|$|R
5|$|Wildflowers, which bloom {{mainly in}} the spring and <b>early</b> <b>summer,</b> include pincushions, golden bee plant, dwarf purple monkey flower, and {{sagebrush}} mariposa lily at the Painted Hills Unit. Munro's globemallow, lupines, yellow fritillary, hedgehog cactus, and Applegate's Indian paintbrush are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} white rot in its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow singly, in groups, or in fused and overlapping clusters on the wood of dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. In central Europe, its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> to autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E
5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> and are red, orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in horticulture {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E
50|$|Paralabrax species {{generally}} spawn <b>early</b> in <b>summer,</b> their larvae {{joining the}} ichthyoplankton {{when the water}} is warmest.|$|R
50|$|More prominently, {{the entire}} Hamptons region {{increasingly}} became {{a haven for}} affluent summer season vacationers. Southampton Village, which hosted the <b>earliest</b> <b>summer</b> community of socially prominent residents and was arguably the center for upper class Americans, served as home {{to members of the}} Ford, Du Pont, Morgan, Atterbury, Woolworth and Eisenhower families. Other affluent communities developed over time in East Hampton Village, Wainscott (particularly in its Georgica Association) and in Bridgehampton.|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{several of}} the other villages and hamlets {{in what has become}} called the Hamptons {{increasingly}} became a haven for affluent summer season vacationers. Southampton Village, which hosted the <b>earliest</b> <b>summer</b> community of socially prominent residents and was arguably the center for upper class Americans, grew larger and faster than the others. Southampton has served as home to members of the Ford, Du Pont, Morgan, Atterbury, Woolworth and Eisenhower families.|$|R
