30|$|Note {{that the}} SCC of each {{component}} of optimized welded detail decreases gradually {{with the increase}} in the <b>filler</b> <b>plate</b> thickness and their relationship is approximately linear. When the <b>filler</b> <b>plate</b> thickness changes from 8.0 to 12.0  mm, the SCC variation of web, flange and weld is 18.3, 17.6 and 16.3 %, respectively.

Each of the rasp bars has studs secured thereto which extend therefrom through the cylinder backing plates. Springs are mounted on the studs behind the backing plates for yieldably urging the rasp bar inwardly towards the backing plate. Centrifugal force causes the rasp bar to move out radially towards the concave as the cylinder is rotated.

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} results of sixteen experiments of bolted slip-critical connections with fillers. Fifteen of the connections used oversized holes and one connection used standard holes to establish a baseline comparison. Such connections with oversized holes are commonly fabricated for use with structures such as long-span trusses, since the use of oversized holes allows erection in-place rather than first assessing fit-up on the ground. <b>Filler</b> <b>plates</b> are used to connect members of different depths or widths. The Specification for Structural Steel Buildings of the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC, 2005) currently requires connections with oversized holes to be designed as slip-critical at what is termed the ???required strength level,??? for which a resistance factor (LRFD) ?? of 0. 85 and a safety factor ?? (ASD) of 1. 76 are specified. These slip strengths are typically below values {{that had been used}} for years in the Specification for Structural Steel Buildings: Allowable Stress Design and Plastic Design (AISC, 1989). In addition, when fillers are used in these connections, the AISC (2005) provisions do not require changes in the strength calculations, whereas if standard holes are used, options are provided for connection design that include reduction of the bolt shear strength or development of the connection. The sixteen experiments reported herein highlight the behavior of bolted steel connections with oversized holes in which fillers are included and are undeveloped, partially developed, or fully developed. Both single-ply and two-ply filler are investigated, as are welded fillers, and specimens fabricated using either turn-of-the-nut or tension-controlled bolts. Extensive instrumentation was used on the specimens to document the flow of forces through the connection. The results document the slip and shear strengths of these connections, propose formulas for assessing these strengths for the different conditions investigated, provide revised recommendations for design of these types of connections, and include suggestions for further work. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the static shear strength and fatigue properties of the newly developed refilled friction stir spot welded AA 6061 -T 6 joints. The keyhole, the process disadvantage of conventional friction stir spot welding, was refilled successfully, using an additional <b>filler</b> <b>plate,</b> with specially designed tools. Two different tool profiles, namely, convex and concave, {{were used for the}} refilling process. Sound and defect free joints were obtained by the refilling process. Joints refilled with convex tools showed better static shear strength than those with the concave ones. The variation of microhardness in different regions of the weld was analysed. Fatigue tests were conducted on the lap shear specimens at a stress ratio of R= 0. 1. The optical micrographs of the welds after fatigue failure in both the conventional and refilled processes were examined to study the fatigue crack propagation and failure modes...|$|E
30|$|The fatigue {{performance}} of optimized welded detail {{has been investigated}} by fatigue experiments of three welded specimens under different loadings. In addition, local finite element models of this welded detail were established using finite element software ANSYS. The influences of different factors such as plate thickness, plate gap and initial geometric imperfections on the stress concentration coefficient (SCC) were discussed. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} fatigue life of three specimens for this welded detail is 736, 000, 1, 044, 200 and 1, 920, 300 times, respectively. The web thickness, the <b>filler</b> <b>plate</b> thickness and the initial geometric imperfection have relatively less effect on the SCCs of this welded detail. However, cope-hole radius is influential on the SCCs of the web and the weld. The SCC of weld is significantly affected by the weld size and plate gap, but the SCCs of other parts of the welded detail are hardly affected by the plate gap.|$|E

FSP has developed as a new processing technique to improve the surface characteristics of materials especially Aluminium. In this research we have tried to improve the surface properties, mainly corrosion resistance of Aluminium alloy AA 6061 by using an external <b>filler</b> <b>plate</b> during the FSP. A thin sheet of commercial Aluminium was coated on the AA 6061 base plate with the help of FSP technique. Different combinations of process parameters like tool speed and plunge depth along with various external cooling modes and backing plates were tested to optimize the process. FSP was also carried out on weld zones of fusion welded samples. Later the processed samples were subjected to various tests like salt spray corrosion test, grain size measurement etc. The test results show that the coating of commercial Aluminium plate did improve the corrosion resistance considerably...|$|E

It also {{acts as a}} buffer to the mismatch of {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} between die and printed circuit board, releasing thermal stress. To meet the new challenge from the high reflow temperatures due to the use of Pb-free solder, substrates made of high performance engineering plastic materials with sophisticated microstructures are increasingly employed in the packaging industry. However, we have limited knowledge on many newly invented substrates, for instance, their thermal and mechanical properties, their performance under difference conditions including temperature and stresses, particularly the structure-property relationships. With insufficient database, packaging engineers have difficulty in package structure design, performance simulation and service life prediction. In this study, five different plastic substrates manufactured for Pb-free PBGA assembly were tested. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEW and X-Ray analysis were employed to disclose the material compositions, microstructure and filler loading. Elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the substrates were determined at room temperature by tensile tests. Thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) was performed to determine the CTE and the glass transition temperature in x-, y- and z-directions. Dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) was used to determine the dynamic behavior under cyclic loadings. The effects of the glass fibers, polymer matrix, <b>fillers</b> and <b>plated</b> through hole (PTH) on the thermal and mechanical properties of the substrates were discussed...|$|R

Hull and superstructure of yachts are covered by filler to obtain smooth surfaces necessary for faired and painted shiny exteriors. Simple tests were designed and carried out on several commercially available fillers: compression tests on isolated filler specimens and three point bending tests on specimens made by filler applied onto a steel substrate were considered sufficient to obtain an isotropic constitutive model characterization.

40|$|A {{steel frame}} {{structure}} of a few storey building is considered in European project FRAMEUP. Each column of the building is constructed from steel profiles connected by column-to-column connection, called column splice. In FRAMEUP project new type of column splice connection is designed to facilitate assembly. This connection consists of a plate, called finger plate with characteristic shape of holes, called long open slotted holes. A column splice with long open holes {{is a type of}} friction connection, where finger plate transfer load between bottom of one column and top of a second part and preloaded bolts are used to clamp segments together. In this work, the behaviour of the connection is investigated. Moreover, general information about column splices, friction connection and loss of pretension are introduced in literature review. A recommendations, for the preloaded bolts are investigated in accordance with European standard EN 1993 - 1 - 8. An experimental static compression tests are performed in order to observe the real behaviour of the column splice with long open slotted holes. Several number of numerical tests are performed to predict behaviour of the connection by use of Abaqus software. The Numerical model is validated against experimental results. Further tests are performed in order to check an influence of other important factors on the behaviour of connection system. An influence of connection geometry i. e. <b>filler</b> <b>plate</b> thickness, characteristic of the surface and the material properties are analyzed.

40|$|High quality {{aesthetics}} is a de-facto necessity on luxury vessels such {{as large}} yachts. However, high thermal loads due to solar radiation cause uneven expansions in the hull. The classic colour {{of the conventional}} yacht fleet is thus unsurprisingly white. However, recent trends see owners opting for darker colours such as black, which absorb much more solar heat, resulting in deformations that destroy the aesthetics of the yacht. To compound matters, other problems such as degradation of hull coatings, increased energy needs to maintain thermal comfort are manifested. Currently, stronger scantlings and more expensive hull coatings are being used, besides larger ship cooling systems. More systems dramatically increase a ship’s weight and cost. In order to study in detail this subject, a joint research program has been started by Baglietto Shipyard of La Spezia and the University of Genova, aimed at investigating the influence of thermal loads on superyacht hull shells. The preoject has been divided into two phases, starting from the analysis of temperature effects of solar radiation on yacht hulls, up to {{the evaluation of the}} interaction between finishing <b>filler</b> and hull <b>plates,</b> both in aluminium light alloys and steel.

40|$|Joining {{processes}} and techniques {{need to meet}} the trend of new applications {{and the development of}} new materials. The application in connection with thick and thin plates in industrial fields is wide and the joining technology is in very urgent need. The laser-TIG hybrid welding technology can play the respective advantages of both of them. One major advantage of the hybrid laser-TIG welding technology is its efficient use of laser energy. Additionally, it can develop into a high and new advanced welding technology and become a hot spot in both the application and research area. This thesis investigated laser –TIG hybrid welding with the aim of enlightening the reader on its advantages, disadvantages and future areas of improvement. The main objective is to investigate laser-TIG hybrid on the welding of various metals (steels, magnesium, aluminium etc.). In addition, it elaborates on various possible combinations on hybrid laser-TIG welding technology and their benefits. The possibility of using laser-TIG hybrid in welding of thick materials was investigated. The method applied in carrying out this research is by using literature review. The results showed that hybrid laser-TIG is applicable to almost all weldable metals. Also it proves to be effective in welding refractive metals. The possibility of welding with or without filler materials is of economic advantage especially in welding of materials with no <b>filler</b> material. Thick <b>plate’s</b> hybrid laser-TIG welding is showing great prospects although it normally finds its used in welding thin materials in the range of 0. 4 to 0. 8 mm. The findings show that laser-TIG hybrid welding can be a versatile welding process and therefore will be increasingly used industrially due to its numerous advantages and the development of new TIG arc that enhances its capabilities...|$|R
30|$|Atomic {{energy is}} one of the good and {{practical}} options instead of fossil fuel and gradually has been replaced with fossil fuel in a lot of countries. However, atomic energy has got a lot of disadvantages since environmental pollution and disposal of residual material are daunting and the need for special and cost-effective start-up plants is now being abandoned [3]. Among renewable energies such as wind, water, and solar, sunlight energy is more important than others due to constant access and many studies have been done on the production of solar cells from the past, and also it is currently used globally {{in some parts of the}} world. But due to the high cost of the required equipment, as well as the need for large space to install them, in addition to continuous and costly maintenance, it has not yet been able to be introduced as a promising source for the replacement of fossil fuels and widely used. Also, in some parts of the world, because of the atmospheric conditions of that area or the angle of the sun’s radiation, it is virtually impossible to use this source of energy [4, 5]. But proton-exchanging fuel cells have been emerging for some time now as a tempting substitute for fossil fuels, especially in fuel for vehicles [6]. These devices, such as a battery, convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy without creating any environmental pollution. Moreover, due to high efficiency and elimination of noise pollution, interest in using these new sources of energy is increasing. Fuel cells play an important role in the economy of this century and probably in the future. It is anticipated that the development and expansion of reliable and economical fuel cells will launch the era of hydrogen [7]. The proton-exchange fuel cell system is an energy system that can convert hydrogen and oxygen (air) to electricity and produce water as the only peripheral product. So much of the environmental stress is considered. It is also used for all human societies because of its low cost. Considering all the benefits and applications of these cells, due to the presence of some of the existing barriers, such as reliability, stability, weight, and price, the use of these cells is still in research and demonstration and their commercialization has been delayed. Today, many studies are underway to remove existing barriers that promise to bring this energy to live in the near future. The highest weight of a fuel cell (about 80 %) is made up of bipolar plates, which is about 38 % of the total cost of the cells. Electrodes cost 32 %, membranes 12 %, and electrolytes 11 % of the total fuel cell price. Considering that the bulk density of the fuel cells is the highest in bipolar plates, it can be assumed that the most important components of these cells are the bipolar plates and should be the most efficient with the least weight and cost. That is why most recent research on fuel cells focuses on optimizing these fuel cell components and continues. So far, a lot of materials have been proposed for these components such as stainless steel, titanium and graphite composites. Graphite due to its electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance is a reference material for durability and performance. But its porous structure makes it fragile and also allows for the penetration of gases after use. Corrective processes, such as a combination with a saturated resin, are used to fill the holes. But this will increase the price. A solution has been proposed to solve these problems, and it is the use of polymer nanocomposites that combine the mechanical properties and processability of polymers with the conductivity properties of carbon <b>fillers.</b> Nanocomposite conducting <b>plates</b> (CPs) are widely used alternative materials for bipolar plates in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) due to good corrosion resistance, good electrical and thermal conductivity, low cost, easy fabrication, and suitable weight instead of metal and graphite alone. Metals’ bipolar plates have benefits such as good electrical and thermal conductivity, ease of machinery, and suitable weight. The main disadvantage of metals, on the other hand, is their high corrosion current density. Also, graphite bipolar plates have good electrical and thermal conductivity and low-cost characterization. Due to their low mechanical strength, the thickness of the plates cannot be reduced, leading to their higher weights [8].|$|R
