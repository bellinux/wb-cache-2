'We had to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of}} the night, in order to get our twenty-six oboes together.' The recording, issued in 1959, was {{received}} with critical acclaim for attempting to reproduce the sound Handel would have heard, rather than the smoother orchestral arrangements usually played at that time.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people have}} {{characterized}} his removal as a rendition. That {{is not what}} happened here. It was a deportation. And {{even if it were}} a rendition, we understand as a government what our obligations are with respect to anyone who is rendered by this government to another country, and that is that we seek to satisfy ourselves {{that they will not be}} tortured. And we <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> every case. And if in fact he had been rendered to Syria, we would have sought those same kind of assurances, as we do in every case.|$|E

25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
500|$|For most of Bullock's shots, she {{was placed}} inside a giant, {{mechanical}} rig. Getting into the rig took {{a significant amount}} of time, so Bullock chose to stay in it for up to 10 hours a day, communicating with others through a headset. Costume Designer Jany Temime said the spacesuits were fictitious – [...] "no space suit opens up at the front – but we had to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> order for her to get out. So I had to redesign it and readapt all the functions of the suit for front opening." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2000, Luongo was {{publicly}} {{criticized by}} Islanders general manager Mike Milbury for having gone {{looking for an}} apartment in New York on a game day before letting in seven goals to the Boston Bruins. Milbury told the media, [...] "You can't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the NHL. You have to prepare yourself." [...] Luongo defended himself by saying he did not divert from his usual game day routine by looking at just one apartment.

His 86.2%completion percentage set a new single-game record for UT, breaking his previous record of 85.7%set against Oklahoma State in 2004. After the game, Colorado Head Coach Gary Barnett said of Young's passing performance, [...] "We can't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> practice against air."

500|$|Filming {{began on}} September 23, 2006. The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg {{was used for}} the {{interior}} of Neville's home, while Greenwich Village {{was used for the}} exterior. Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan, the aircraft carrier Intrepid, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look like it had been overgrown with them. The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers. Will Smith said, [...] "I don't think anyone's {{going to be able to}} <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> New York again anytime soon. People were not happy.

Taylor said, [...] "I crave confusion and quite like people to be surprised. I try to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the words and music and try to be what people don't think we are.

He's a brilliant actor – but Paul honestly said to me, 'I don't {{know what to do with}} that character'. He didn't want to just bring everybody back, so that the audience go, 'Oh, look, it's Bill Fichtner again!' – he honestly thought, 'I'm not sure where to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the plot.' So if someday there's another chapter of this, maybe then Bill will be back. But I think the characters that are there, each of our moments that we have, are key to the storytelling, which is how it should be." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{members of}} the band were {{involved}} in the writing of songs, and there may have been more than one person's set of lyrics appearing in a single release. Powell said that [...] "It's quite interesting to have two people's viewpoints within the same song. I'm not sure how many bands actually <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>In</b> most bands, the guitarist writes the music and the singer writes the lyrics. We tend to share things out more evenly." [...] He also criticised the attachment of an indie pop label to the band, saying [...] "We're seen as one of the indie bands. But we've always just tried to make pop music. Even if it is pop music with a hard edge and quite a twisted little view of life. We've always seen ourselves as a little bigger than an indie band." ...|$|E

Jennifer Lopez commented, [...] "You did a beautiful job on it...If I was Beyoncé and I was home and I heard that, I'd be like 'I got to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> my next concert, slow that one down.'" [...] Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as [...] "great" [...] while Randy Jackson noted that it was [...] "unbelievable, sensational". James Montgomery of MTV News graded her performance with a B, and called the cover [...] "a bit of an odd choice, and yet also a supremely confident one". He added, [...] "For once, she pulled things back, and maybe suffered a bit for doing so, but there were still plenty of subtly great moments, particularly in the verses. Might not have been her best—it definitely lacked in vocal fireworks...And really, it was good enough".|$|E

500|$|Discussing his {{decision}} to join The Young and the Restless, Burton said on The Talk, [...] "I told my manager if I can keep my family there and I can spend time with them {{and come back and}} forth, I would <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a second. Without hesitation, CBS Daytime made that deal. Really quickly. This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to have {{the best of both worlds}} for my family, because before, I couldn't." [...] Burton was happy with the flexibility of his [...] "short term" [...] contract, [...] "I'll get a lot of long weekends and frequent weeks off so I can get back to Nashville. I don't want to work five days a week like I did at GH", he said during a TV Guide interview. The actor said he had [...] "those first-day-of-school jitters" [...] when he first arrived at the CBS building, but was welcomed by everyone. A week before Burton's debut on the series, a promotional ad aired, teasing his arrival with the slogan Daytime's Hottest Soap Just Got Hotter!. In November 2014, Burton confirmed he had re-signed for another year with the series.|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{co-pilot}} {{who lost}} her family in a Kaiju attack. Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro stated: [...] "I was very careful how I built the movie. One {{of the other things}} I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's {{not going to be a}} sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character." [...] Noting that the other actors were exhausted and [...] "destroyed physically" [...] by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: [...] "The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained… I asked Rinko her secret and she said 'I think of gummi bears and flowers.' I try to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> my life now." [...] Mana Ashida plays Mako as a child.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{the film}} {{initially}} came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could instant message with an artificial intelligence. [...] "For the first, maybe, 20 seconds of it, it had this real buzz," [...] said Jonze. [...] "I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', {{and it was like}} whoa [...] this is trippy. After 20 seconds, it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works, and it wasn't that impressive. But it was still, for 20 seconds, really exciting. The more people that talked to it, the smarter it got." [...] Jonze's interest in the project was renewed after directing the short film I'm Here (2010), which shares similar themes. Inspiration also came from Kaufman's writing approach for Synecdoche, New York (2008). Jonze explained, [...] " [...] said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script. I was very inspired by that, and tried to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> [...] And a lot of the feelings you have about relationships or about technology are often contradictory." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1952, Jones, halfbacks Gib Dawson and Billy Quinn and fullback Dick Ochoa created Texas' all-time {{greatest}} backfield combination.

Against Texas A&M, Jones, Dawson and Quinn all rushed for more than 100 yards, the first time 3 players ever <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a single game for a Longhorn team, and a feat that has only been repeated once since. The team set the school record for rushing, and the school and conference records for total offense. Jones won the Houston Post's Southwest Conference MVP Trophy.

500|$|A bird-beaked {{member of}} the Green Lantern Corps who teaches Hal Jordan how to use his cosmic powers. Rush stated he was not {{initially}} familiar with Green Lantern but {{was drawn to the}} part after seeing the concept art explaining, [...] "When I got the offer for it I said, ‘Haven’t they made that film?’ They said, ‘No, it’s a completely computer-generated character.’ I saw the artwork and I said, I would love to be that guy. Because I had voiced an owl in [...] and I’d voiced a pelican in Finding Nemo and I thought I could really improve on that now by being half-bird, half-fish, part lizard. You don’t get to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a live-action film." [...] Rush compared the role to previous roles where he played a mentoring figure, [...] "You could say that I’ve mentored Queen Elizabeth I as [...] Walsingham, and [...] Trotsky has mentored Frida Kahlo and now Tomar Re is going to mentor Hal Jordan, and I was sort of mentoring King George VI in The King's Speech. But I can’t imagine Tomar Re setting up an office on Harley Street in London. They’re all very different people to me, but {{there is a kind of}} theme I suppose".|$|E
500|$|In the EuroBasket 2005, Nowitzki {{came back}} strong. He {{surprisingly}} led a depleted German squad into the Finals, beating title favorites Slovenia in the quarter-finals and Spain in the semi-finals on the way. EuroBasket pundits praised Nowitzki in both matches: against Slovenia (76–62), the forward scored a game high 22 points and commented: [...] "The Slovenians underestimated us. They {{said we were}} the team they wanted and that was wrong, you shouldn't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the quarter-finals." [...] Against Spain (74–73), Nowitzki scored a game-high 27 points and scored the decisive basket: down by one and {{with only a few}} seconds to go, he drove on Spanish forward Jorge Garbajosa, and hit a baseline jump shot over Garbajosa's outstretched arms with 3.9 seconds to go. The German later commented: [...] "It was indescribable. Garbajosa kind of pushed me towards the baseline so I just went with it." [...] Despite losing the Finals, 78–62, to the Greeks, Nowitzki was the tournament's leading scorer (26.7 per game) and second-leading rebounder (10.8 per game) and shot blocker (1.8 per game), and was voted Most Valuable Player of the tournament. When he was subbed out {{towards the end of the}} final, Nowitzki received standing ovation from the crowd, which he later recalled as [...] "one of the best moments of [...] career". In the 2006 FIBA World Championship, Nowitzki led the German team to an eighth place and commented: [...] "It's tough luck. But overall, finishing eighth in the world is not bad." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{lived for}} a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but {{returned}} to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no [...] "innocent little flower". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became [...] "Hey Jude". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: [...] "We'd been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life". Cynthia recalled, [...] "I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." [...] She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: [...] "It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> those days". In contrast, Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] about an affair he was having, but rendered it in [...] "gobbledegook" [...] so Cynthia would not know.|$|E
