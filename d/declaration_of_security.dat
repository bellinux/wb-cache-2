40|$|The Arctic {{region is}} rich in natural {{resources}} such as oil, gas, minerals and fish. Climate change causes the Arctic ice melt, making resource extraction possible as well as opening up new transport routes through the Northwest Passage and the Northeast Passage. This has led to competition and cross-border strife among the Arctic States. The two largest states in the Arctic are Russia and Canada, which are also members of the Arctic Council. Russia and Canada are at the moment involved in several disputes regarding the Arctic territory where the ownership of the North Pole is one example. This study aims to explain the Russian and Canadian actions in the Arctic in a geopolitical aspect {{and to what extent}} it is consistent with the objectives of the Arctic Council’s Kiruna <b>Declaration.</b> The presence <b>of</b> <b>security</b> aspects like economic, military and environmental security is examined through a text analysis where the Arctic policies and the National security policies are compared, where the results then are compared with the objectives in the Kiruna Declaration to find similarities and differences. The result shows that the economic security is the most important aspect for both Russia and Canada, while the environmental security is the most important in the Kiruna <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Arctic council. The conclusion is that the significant economic and strategic potential of the Arctic guides Russia’s and Canada’s behaviour and that the financial benefits outweigh the environmental risks that are associated with the development of the area...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{consider}} that a state has a responsibility not to recognize as a state any entity that has attained the qualifications for statehood by a violation of basic principles of the UN Charter: the UN Security Council has in several instances (Resolution 216 (1965) and Resolution 217 (1965), concerning Rhodesia; Resolution 541 (1983), concerning Northern Cyprus; and Resolution 787 (1992), concerning the Republika Srpska) issued Chapter VII resolutions (binding in international law) that denied their statehood and precluded recognition. In the 2010 International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> independence, the ICJ ruled that [...] "general international law contains no applicable prohibition <b>of</b> <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> independence." [...] The Court carefully noted [...] "that in all of those instances the Security Council was making a determination as regards the concrete situation existing {{at the time that}} those <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> independence were made; the illegality attached to the <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> independence thus stemmed not from the unilateral character <b>of</b> these <b>declarations</b> as such, but from the fact that they were, or would have been, connected with the unlawful use of force or other egregious violations of norms of general international law, in particular those of a peremptory character (jus cogens). In the context <b>of</b> Kosovo, the <b>Security</b> Council has never taken this position. The exceptional character of the resolutions enumerated above appears to the Court to confirm that no general prohibition against unilateral <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> independence may be inferred from the practice <b>of</b> the <b>Security</b> Council." ...|$|R
