500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself, 'People have to hear this stuff'. What I had to offer was the music and I figured if we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E
500|$|Barnes {{was made}} captain of New South Wales for the 1946–47 Australian season, though he only managed to play three matches {{for the state}} team. One of those was the match against the touring MCC team, and Barnes was {{approached}} during the match about becoming an opening batsman for the forthcoming Test series. He wrote in his autobiography: [...] "I had never opened before and was a little dubious. I had, however, struck new balls at different periods of innings and was not afraid of that." [...] He also {{liked the idea of}} batting ahead of Bradman in the batting order: [...] "Much better, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>to</b> get in before him than to come later, like flat beer after champagne." ...|$|E

500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>to</b> hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} and commercially successful films of Hoffman's career was The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), which he considered [...] "as edgy {{as you can get}} for a Hollywood movie". He played a [...] "preppy bully" [...] who taunts Matt Damon's Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called [...] "the truest upper class twit in all of American movies". Hoffman's performance caught the attention of Meryl Streep– another of his cinematic idols– with his performance: [...] "I sat up straight in my seat and said, 'Who is that?' <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself: My God, this actor is fearless. He's done what we all strive for– he's given this awful character the respect he deserves, and he's made him fascinating." [...] In recognition of his work in Magnolia and The Talented Mr. Ripley, Hoffman was named the year's Best Supporting Actor by the National Board of Review.|$|E
500|$|On August 23, Feldman threw seven {{scoreless}} innings {{while allowing}} only four hits in {{a win over}} the Tampa Bay Rays. It was his 13th win of the season (tied for third in the AL) and put his season record at 13–4. It was Feldman's ninth road win of the season (bringing him to 9–1 on the road), tying him with Sabathia for best in the AL. The win put the Rangers two games ahead of the Rays in the AL wild card standings, and one game behind the Red Sox. [...] His career-high 11 strikeouts were the most by a Ranger since Matt Perisho struck out 12 in 1999 (see [...] ). [...] Commenting on Feldman's last strikeout, Carlos Peña said: [...] "I was on second base, and I saw a pitch that he made to B. J. , and I was like, 'Wow.' <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself, 'That's unhittable right there.'" [...] Rays manager Joe Maddon called Feldman's performance [...] "the best-pitched game against us all year", in spite of Mark Buehrle's perfect game against them earlier in the season.|$|E

2500|$|Although Brach {{began writing}} the {{screenplay}} in late 1981, Annaud took on another project, that of directing a film adaptation of Umberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose. Between preparing for and filming his next film, Annaud traveled and visited zoos {{in order to}} research animal behavior. In an interview he later gave with the American Humane Association, Annaud stated: [...] "Each time I was fascinated with the tigers, {{to a point that}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> do a movie called The Tiger instead of The Bear. In those days I felt that the bear, because they're so often vertical, would give me a better identification, or would provide more instant identification from the viewers."

2500|$|Gubby's single {{attempt to}} {{participate}} in a Formula One World Championship race, the 1965 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, also ended with problems in practice. At the Woodcote corner, his Lotus jumped out of sixth gear at 170mph, and Gubby was forced to hold the gear lever in position whilst cornering at high speeds. He decided there and then to retire from the sport, and did not attend the following day's practice session. He later recalled, [...] "I was driving on a shoestring, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself, 'Brian, you've got a family to look after and you'll end up killing yourself'." [...] He had entered the 1965 Mediterranean Grand Prix, but withdrew his entry and sold his Lotus to Stirling Moss for use by a film company working with Steve McQueen.|$|E

He {{therefore}} delays yet again, deciding that Claudius must be dispatched in drunken revels at the court. The King rises. Thinking {{he has seen}} a ghost, he calls out for Polonius. Polonius comes rushing in. The King tells him he has seen the ghost of the dead king. Polonius tries to calm the King and warns him to beware lest a word betray them both. The King rushes out followed by Polonius. Hamlet emerges from behind the tapestry (Hamlet: Polonius est son complice! le père d'Ophélie! [...] "Polonius is his accomplice. Ophelia's father!"). He regrets having overheard this terrible revelation.|$|E
2500|$|Kamo later {{discussed}} his experiences at feigning insanity {{for over three}} years: [...] "What can I tell you? [...] They threw me about, hit me over the legs and the like.

[...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself, 'Maybe I've really gone mad!' It was a terrible moment, but I regained my bearings and spat upon the mirror. [...] You know I think they liked that....I thought a great deal:'Will I survive or will I really go mad?' That was not good. [...] I did not have faith in myself, see?..., of course, know their business, their science. [...] But they do not know the Caucasians. [...] Maybe every Caucasian is insane, as far as they are concerned. [...] Well, who will drive whom mad? [...] Nothing developed. [...] They stuck to their guns and I to mine. [...] In Tiflis, they didn't torture me. [...] Apparently they thought that the Germans can make no mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Egyptian hieroglyphs {{from the}} early dynasties also testify to Libyans, the Berbers of the [...] "western desert". First {{mentioned}} as the Tehenou during the pre-dynastic reigns of Scorpion II (c. 3050) and of Narmer (on an ivory cylinder), their appearance is later disclosed in a bas relief of the Fifth Dynasty temple of Sahure. Ramses II (r. 1279–1213) placed Libyan contingents in his army. Tombs of the 13th century BC show paintings of Libu leaders wearing fine robes, with ostrich feathers in their [...] "dreadlocks", short pointed beards, and tattoos on their shoulders and arms. Evidently, Osorkon the Elder (Akheperre setepenamun), a Berber of the Meshwesh tribe, became the first Libyan pharaoh. Several decades later, his nephew Shoshenq I (r. 945–924) became Pharaoh of Egypt, {{and the founder of}} its Twenty-second Dynasty (945–715). In 926 Shoshenq <b>I</b> (<b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be Shishak of the Bible) successfully campaigned to Jerusalem then ruled by Solomon's heir. For several centuries Egypt was governed by a decentralized system based on the Libyan tribal organization of the Meshwesh. Becoming acculturated, Libyans also served as high priests at Egyptian religious centers. Hence during the classical era of the Mediterranean, all of the Berber peoples of North Africa were often known collectively as Libyans.|$|E
