5|$|On the October 27 {{episode of}} Raw, after John Cena, the #1 {{contender}} for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, rejected an offer to join the Authority, Triple H announced a Traditional Survivor Series tag team elimination match, with a team representing the Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon announced that if Team Authority loses at Survivor Series, the Authority will be ousted from power. During the match, Triple H {{tried to get the}} last member of Team Cena, Dolph Ziggler, eliminated by attacking two referees and placing Seth Rollins (who was also the final member of Team Authority) on top of Ziggler and calling crooked referee Scott Armstrong into the ring to make the count, however the debuting Sting came out and attacked Armstrong and Triple H, giving Team Cena the win and thus disbanding The Authority. Stephanie and Triple H appeared on the episode of Raw after Survivor Series stating that without them the company would be driven to the ground. They were then escorted out of the arena by the returning Daniel Bryan and only to be insulted by Mr.McMahon for letting him down and the McMahon family before exiting the arena. On the December 29 episode of Raw, The Authority was brought back in power by John Cena, and she and her husband entered and stepped on the entrance ramp celebrating their return with a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> and a kiss. Stephanie and Triple H then proceeded to fire Erick Rowan, Ryback and Dolph Ziggler.|$|E
25|$|The {{race has}} {{finished}} since 1975 with laps of the Champs-Élysées. This stage rarely challenges the leader {{because it is}} flat and the leader usually has {{too much time in}} hand to be denied. But in 1987, Pedro Delgado broke away on the Champs to challenge the 40-second lead held by Stephen Roche. He and Roche finished in the peloton and Roche won the Tour. In modern times, there tends to be a gentlemen's agreement: while the points classification is still contended if possible, the overall classification is not fought over; because of this, {{it is not uncommon for}} the de facto winner of the overall classification to ride into Paris holding a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b>|$|E
500|$|The last {{scene in}} the film was {{arranged}} for {{the last day of}} filming. Initially, the language was supposed to be more somber and classical, but Meyer made some last minute changes. Flinn said that Meyer [...] "was in an optimistic mood", and the director suggested that Kirk quote Peter Pan for the last lines: [...] "Second star to the right, and straight on till morning." [...] Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured; Shatner said, [...] "By the time we finished the last scene, which extended longer than we expected, {{there was a sense of}} irritation. We raised a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne,</b> but everybody was actually a little antsy." ...|$|E

500|$|The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first {{printed in}} Vogue in 1959, and {{included}} in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way – and I shan't – my Christmas Day {{eating and drinking}} would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> on a tray in bed in the evening." [...] The pattern of the book follows that of earlier ones, with recipes interspersed with more discursive essays on subjects such as avocado pears, persimmons, historical menus, and Christmas hampers, and extracts from prose by writers whom David admired, including Sybille Bedford and George Eliot.|$|E
500|$|The last of {{the books}} planned by David was Elizabeth David's Christmas (2003). She and Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as the}} 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out the author's papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. The Christmas recipes David had most often been asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page work. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks. The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first printed in Vogue in 1959, and included in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way—and I shan't—my Christmas Day eating and drinking would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> on a tray in bed in the evening." ...|$|E

She drank several <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne,</b> ate scarcely anything, and rushed him away {{before he had}} taken the edge off his appetite.

Her extravagant lifestyle amused journalists, particularly when it was revealed she had a multi-million pound overdraft with Coutts Bank.|$|R
2500|$|An {{even more}} extreme example was his notorious [...] "sick bag" [...] prank. This {{involved}} carrying {{on to an}} aircraft a tin of Heinz Russian Salad, which he would then surreptitiously empty into an air-sickness bag. At the appropriate point in the flight, he would pretend to vomit loudly and violently into the bag. Then, to the horror of passengers and crew, he would proceed to eat the contents. One April Fools' Day Humphries placed a roast dinner and <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> in an inner-city rubbish bin. Later in the morning, when there were many businesspeople queuing at a nearby building, Humphries approached {{the group as a}} dirty, dishevelled man. He walked to the bin, opened the lid and proceeded to lift the roast and <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> and drink from the glass. Much to the amazement of watchers-by, he found a suitable seating area and began to eat the meal. Such stunts were the early manifestations of a lifelong interest in the bizarre, discomforting, and subversive.|$|E

Tadić pleaded guilty, saying [...] "I did not know that consumption of alcohol, even if only for a toast, has been forbidden so I fully take responsibility for the violation" [...] and was fined 400.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to former}} Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Boris Nemtsov, the bizarre {{behavior}} of Yeltsin resulted from [...] "strong drugs" [...] {{given to him}} by Kremlin doctors, which were incompatible even {{with a small amount of}} alcohol. This was discussed by journalist Yelena Tregubova from the [...] "Kremlin pool" [...] in connection with an episode during Yeltsin's visit to Stockholm in 1997 when Yeltsin suddenly started talking nonsense (he allegedly told his bemused audience that Swedish meatballs reminded him of Björn Borg's face), lost his balance, and almost fell down on the podium after drinking a single <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b> Journalist Yelena Tregubova barely escaped an assassination attempt after publishing this material.|$|E

Determined to humiliate her rival, Paulette invites herself to Renal's table and taunts Kiki into drinking several <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b> Kiki becomes drunk, embarrassing Renal. He deposits her in his limousine and asks where she lives. As she has been evicted for not paying the rent, she confesses she has no place to go, so he takes her home.|$|R

Barney reacts in horror at the thought they might marry, and Ted reveals Robin reacted with similar horror. The proposal was actually meant for a couple at another table; when the mix-up is clarified, the other woman accepts, but Robin's horror and subsequent relief unearths unresolved issues between Ted and her.|$|R

50|$|Gary and Val {{began their}} {{new life in}} Knots Landing just {{after the start of}} their second {{marriage}} in 1979, where they met their new neighbors, Sid and Karen Fairgate, where Gary was offered a job at Knots Landing Motors by Sid. Gary settled down into his new life in California, had a great marriage and was good at his job. However, after being given more responsibility by Sid, who promoted Gary to the position of vice-president of Knots Landing Motors, Gary had a few <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne,</b> at the urging of his neighbors, who didn't know Gary's past problems with alcohol. It {{was the first time that}} Gary had drank alcohol in over 2 years. After the initial <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne,</b> Gary's drinking quickly turned into nasty mood swings and a full blown alcoholic binge. Gary's drinking quickly caused him to hit rock bottom, where he would become extremely aggressive and violent in his desperation for more alcohol, even to the point of possibly killing somebody, and stealing a small bottle of beer from a sleeping homeless man. Val has Gary committed to a rehab facility, lying that Gary had tried to commit suicide in order to get Gary committed. Gary's aggression and violence from falling off the wagon, eventually made Gary admit out loud to himself and to other members of an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, that he was an alcoholic.|$|R

5000|$|At the beginning, {{the series}} was a gameshow, which was filmed in studio and {{broadcast}} live. Two selected viewers took part and had to guess who was guilty when inspector Bourrel said the famous line: [...] "Good God! But it’s… Of course!". Each of the two contestants {{had the opportunity to}} repeat two parts of the show, which would also be seen by the audience at home. This famously happened during the pilot episode when <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> were given out. In some of the original episodes, there was also participation from the viewers at home, but this was abandoned during the first series.|$|R
5000|$|In the present, media {{reporters are}} paying {{tribute to the}} {{deceased}} Hans, as he is being put into his casket and driven away in a hearse. Ironically, Hans Wieck is now remembered {{not only as a}} wealthy industrialist but also as a Righteous Among the Nations who saved [...] "a thousand Hungarian Jews" [...] during the war. In the closing scene of the film, the middle-age waiter at Szabó's pours two <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> and returns to the kitchen, where his elderly mother (Ilona) is washing out András' now empty bottle of poison. Her son congratulates her on her birthday and the two embrace as the song [...] "Gloomy Sunday" [...] playing in the background.|$|R
500|$|The inauguration {{ceremony}} {{was held on}} August 5, 1966. Sarno and his partner, Nate Jacobsen, spent one million dollars on the event. The cost included [...] "the largest order of Ukrainian caviar ever placed by a private organization", two tons of filet mignon, [...] of Maryland crabmeat and 50,000 <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b> Cocktail waitresses in Greco-Roman wigs would greet guests and say [...] "Welcome to Caesars Palace, I am your slave". Among the performers at the opening were Andy Williams and Phil Richards. According to author Ovid Demaris, Caesars Palace was [...] "a mob-controlled casino from the day it opened its doors". By the time it opened, the significant publicity of the new hotel had generated $42 million in advanced bookings.|$|R

60|$|I left him, {{and went}} home {{just in time to}} dress. There were some people to dinner, at which Jane appeared. Her {{lassitude}} had vanished, and, as was her manner when in good spirits, she was very humorous and amusing. Also I had never seen her look so beautiful, for her colour was high and her dark eyes shone like the diamond stars in her hair. But again I observed that she ate nothing, although she, who for the most part drank little but water, took several <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> and two tumblers of soda. Before I could get rid of my guests she had gone to bed. At length they went, and going to my study I began to smoke and think.|$|R
6000|$|Anne had {{a little}} party, where Lady Charlotte Bury, Lady Hopetoun, and others met the Caradori, who sung to us very kindly. She sung Jock of Hazeldean very well, and with a {{peculiar}} expression of humour. Sandie Ballantyne kindly came and helped us with fiddle and flageolet. Willie Clerk was also here. We had a lunch, and were very gay, not the less so for the want of Mr. Bury, who is a thorough-paced coxcomb, with some accomplishments, however. I drank two <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne,</b> which have muddled my brains for the day. Will Clerk promised {{to come back and}} dine on the wreck of the turkey and tongue, pigeon-pie, etc. He came, accordingly, and stayed till nine; so no time for work. It was not a lost day, however.[335] ...|$|R
5|$|In {{his inaugural}} season of {{competitive}} football, Liddell confirmed {{his status as}} a regular and contributed to Liverpool's first championship since 1923. Positioned on the left wing, he appeared in 34 matches, scored seven goals, and supplied strikers Albert Stubbins and Jack Balmer with numerous assists. Severe conditions in the winter disrupted the league's schedule and Liverpool did not secure the title until 14 June 1947. The club won its final game away against Wolves 2-1, with Liddell setting up one of the goals, but the championship was decided by Sheffield United defeating contenders Stoke in the season's last fixture. The game coincided with the Senior Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton at Anfield, where tannoys announced the result during the match. As a strict teetotaler, Liddell refrained from accepting <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> to celebrate the success.|$|R
