500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy for him {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song.

According to Hilson, she said that song was {{partially}} inspired by [...] "that conversational, back-and-forth thing" [...] they did on [...] "The Way I Are", stating, [...] "We got a great response from that {{that we wanted to}} do it again." [...] The initial draft of the hook featured the line [...] "If you kiss me then I’ll kiss you back", but according to Hilson in an interview with That Grape Juice, it was changed by unknown reason by Timbaland. After it was reported that In a Perfect World... would be pushed back to October 2008, [...] "Return the Favor" [...] surfaced online, and it was rumored to be the follow-up to [...] "Energy." [...] The sample was later removed by Hilson's management, before it was announced as the album's second single. The song was featured on December 15, 2008 episode of The Hills.|$|E
500|$|DVD Talk's John Sinnott {{rated the}} first series {{four and a}} half out of five stars, writing that it [...] "keeps a lot of the charm and {{excitement}} of the original (as well as the premise), while making the series easily accessible for new viewers". Sinnott praised the faster pace and the design changes that made it feel [...] "fresh", as well as Eccleston's Doctor. However, he felt that Piper only did a [...] "credible" [...] job as Eccleston eclipsed <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that the writing was [...] "uneven" [...] with many of the episodes [...] "just slightly flawed". Looking back on the series in 2011, Stephen Kelly of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Eccleston's Doctor may have had many faults– looking like an EastEnders extra and bellowing [...] "FANTASTIC!" [...] at every opportunity being two of them– but he was merely a reflection of a show that, at the time, still didn't know what it wanted to be. The first series of the revived Doctor Who– which featured farting aliens– was a world away from the intelligent, populist science-fiction we know it as now. But then, it is thanks to Eccleston that it got this far at all– a big, respectable name who laid the foundations for Tennant to swag away with the show." ...|$|E

Bush and Barbara Bush at the White House and was scheduled to give a testimony to Congress on education. Instead, during the September 11 attacks, Bush was taken to inside the White House and placed in an underground bunker, later being met by her husband, who had returned to Washington from Florida. Two weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush inaugurated a music concert at the Kennedy Center, organized to fundraise for families of the victims. Though she received applause, she returned the compliment {{to members of the}} audience and added that although the event was tragic, Americans had deepened their appreciation [...] "of life itself, how fragile it can be, what a gift it is and how much we need each other." [...] Senator Ted Kennedy, who introduced Bush at the event, praised <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he knew his deceased sibling, the late President John F. Kennedy, would also be proud of her. Bush believes the September 11 attacks ignited the interest in the way Afghanistan women were treated, who were not allowed to leave their homes and of which composed a high number of widows due to terrorist attacks in Afghanistan prior to the attacks.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} idea {{was written by}} Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for The X-Files {{in order to get}} a TV agent. [...] "I was actually flying home to Kentucky and I read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Don’t take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.’ She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed," [...] said Reddick. [...] "I thought, that’s creepy—what if she was supposed to die on that flight?" [...] Building on his idea, Reddick wrote script and got an agent, but never submitted the script to The X-Files after a colleague at New Line Cinema suggested he write it as a feature film. [...] One of the biggest misconceptions about the project is that it was based on the real-life disaster of TWA Flight 800 that occurred in 1996. Like in the movie, the TWA disaster involved a Boeing 747 that exploded after take-off from JFK International Airport in New York en route to Paris. [...] Moreover, five chaperones and sixteen high school students from Montoursville, Pennsylvania, were aboard the doomed flight, heading to Paris with their high school French club. The TV spec script for The X-Files [...] however, was actually written in 1994.|$|E

On {{the night}} of February 24, 1951, Alexis was being looked after by John Sanborne while Northrup had {{a night at the}} movies. Hubbard turned up and took the child. A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Northrup, who was now back at her apartment: [...] "We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless you come with us." [...] She was bundled {{into the back of a}} car and driven to San Bernardino, California, where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. Northrup agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations. Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "he had cut [...] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was my fault, I'd done it because I'd left him." ...|$|E
