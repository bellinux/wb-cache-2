5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E

The others are distracted by various temptations: George is distracted in the hospital his mother is staying at by an attractive nurse giving an even more attractive woman a daily sponge bath; Elaine visits a fitness club which is also patronized by John F. Kennedy, Jr.; Jerry is tempted by the naked woman across the street and frustrated because the woman he's dating won't have sex with him since she wants to remain a virgin. One method he uses to distract himself is by watching wholesome shows like Tiny Toons on Nickelodeon.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{investigates the}} impact of energy renovation on the indoor environmental quality of apartment buildings. Two case studies were carried out. The first field study was performed in three pairs of residential buildings. One of <b>the</b> buildings <b>in</b> each pair has been renovated and <b>the</b> other was <b>in</b> its original state. The second field study investigated one residential building before and after its renovation. Both objective measurements and subjective evaluation using questionnaire were used. Temperature, relative humidity and the concentration of CO 2, were measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bedrooms of <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> <b>in</b> both studies. Moreover, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second case study additional measurements of indoor air pollutants were carried out, such as nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde and (total) volatile organic compounds. CO 2 concentration was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> renovated dwellings that reflected lower air exchange rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> <b>in</b> winter. <b>The</b> higher CO 2 concentrations and lower air exchange indicated increase of formaldehyde concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments.</b> Moreover, strong association was found between levels of formaldehyde and relative humidity. These observations were linked to insufficient airing out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> and occupants´ lower satisfaction with perceived air quality after renovation. In a greater fraction of <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> <b>the</b> occupants ventilated as frequently as before renovation and was inadequate to achieve better indoor air quality indoors. The results of the simulations confirmed that energy renovation without considering additional ventilation, which is often the common practice, may increase CO 2 concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments.</b> Adding standard air handling units in bedrooms, or, at the minimum, exhaust systems in kitchens and bathrooms {{while at the same}} time keeping internal doors open, may significantly improve indoor air quality in newly energy-renovated residential buildings...|$|R

5|$|The Forensic Science Service email was {{translated}} into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, {{if she were to}} admit that Madeleine had died in an accident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E

Grannis and Baker are two elderly {{boarders}} who share adjoining rooms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall {{and listen to the}} other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.|$|E
5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Ed Harris {{directed}} Connelly in the biopic Pollock {{in which}} she played Ruth Kligman, Jackson Pollock's mistress. In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film, Requiem for a Dream, directed by Darren Aronofsky {{and based on the}} novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. Connelly played Marion Silver, the girlfriend of Harry, played by Jared Leto; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn. Her character is a middle-class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop. She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution. Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived. During her time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> Connelly isolated herself, painted, listened to music that she considered that her character would, designed clothes, and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin. Connelly also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery. Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation. Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions and their effects on the lives and affections of the characters and their relatives.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine was {{on holiday}} from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, her two-year-old twin siblings, {{and a group}} of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a {{restaurant}} 55 metres (180ft) away. The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine's mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given arguido (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal's attorney general archived the case in July 2008 {{because of a lack of}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 27–28 February 1917, Michael {{attempted}} to return to Gatchina from Petrograd, {{where he had been}} in conference with Rodzianko and from where he had telegraphed the Tsar, but revolutionary patrols and sporadic fire prevented his progress. Revolutionaries patrolled the streets, rounding up people connected with the old regime. Michael managed to reach the Winter Palace, where he ordered the guards to withdraw to the Admiralty, because it afforded greater safety and a better tactical position, and because it was a less politically charged location. Michael himself took refuge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> of an acquaintance, Princess Putyatina, on Millionnaya street. In the neighbouring apartments, the Tsar's Chamberlain Nikolai Stolypin and the Procurator of the Holy Synod were detained by revolutionaries and in the house next door General Baron Staekelberg was killed when his house was stormed by a mob.|$|E

5|$|The {{bad feeling}} between the McCanns and the Polícia Judiciária reached such a height that Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, {{the officer who}} coordinated the {{investigation}} from May to October 2007, resigned in June 2008 {{to write a book}} alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> and that the McCanns had faked an abduction. Amaral had been removed from the case in October 2007 after telling a Portuguese newspaper that the British police pursued leads helpful to only the McCanns. Three days after the case closed in July 2008, his book, Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira ("Maddie: The Truth of the Lie"), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz. By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies, and was later translated into six languages. A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million.|$|E

5|$|Minority Report also {{continues}} Spielberg's {{tradition of}} depicting broken families.*Vest. pg. 136 In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main motives are self-preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division. While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E

40|$|Apartment {{buildings}} {{have been built}} in a wind exposed area situated close to <b>the</b> seaside <b>in</b> Malmö, Sweden. Several goals when building these apartments have been articulated, for example low energy usage, validation of the leakage factor and a satisfying indoor environment. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine how <b>the</b> people living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> experience <b>the</b> indoor climate. Their experience has been studied by a questionnaire. 201 persons have responded to the questionnaire. <b>The</b> overall result <b>in</b> terms of indoor climate and health experience shows a sufficient experience of the indoor climate. One interesting finding is that a factor related to the air-tightness; the experience of draught stands out. <b>The</b> <b>apartments</b> have also been divided into sub-groups and one finding has been that <b>the</b> people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> exposed to wind, the outer layer of the city block, experience a doubled amount of draught compared to the people living inside the city block and sheltered from wind. The results may also be interpretated as that if a building is planned to be built in wind exposed surroundings this issue should be addressed and that a tight building is important to build, also for indoor climate reasons...|$|R
