500|$|Frankie {{begins to}} hear their tiny voices calling to her and, though World tries to {{distract}} her from it, she finally discovers her friends. World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever. She calms him down enough to befriend and unshrink the gang, but Mr. Herriman bursts in, having <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> toy box and somehow past the gang's obstacles, and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World. World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void. World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera-like creature to attack them all (made of the remaining refuse of his world). The gang manages to escape the toy box. Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box. Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box, due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence. World gets happy already and shouts that he's free and everyone is really confused, Frankie's answer is: [...] "Well, {{think of it this}} way: Imagine if you were able to have anything you wanted, except one thing, but that one thing is what you wanted more than anything else. For him, that thing is a friend. That's all he wanted; that's {{what he was trying to}} protect. So I brought him here. Here he can have all the friends in the world! I mean come on, isn't friendship what Foster's is all about?" [...] Instantaneously Bloo shouts, [...] " [...] No, it's all about me!" [...] promptly Herriman slaps him with a glove, to the delight of everyone else.|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, {{the series}} has {{developed}} {{into one of}} the most bitter and hateful rivalries in college sports. In the early football match ups, the sidelines would be occupied by Civil War Veterans from both sides. They once stood across from each other on the battlefield, now they looked across an athletic field. The emotions of an actual war once fought between the states became infused into the athletic contests between the 2 institutions. Overtime, even the coaches have <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rivalry. Former Kansas football coach Don Fambrough, when referred to a physician across the state line in Kansas City, Missouri, for treatment, exclaimed [...] "I'll die first!" [...] Not to be outdone, Missouri's former basketball coach Norm Stewart would traditionally have his players stay in Kansas City, Missouri, before playing at Kansas, going so far as to require the team bus to buy its gasoline at a Missouri filling station and reprimanding players who ate in Kansas, as he did not want to put any money into Kansas' economy.|$|E

2500|$|Mad Love was {{released}} in the United States on July 12, 1935 and, as Hands of Orlac, in the United Kingdom on August 2, 1935. Official reaction in the UK was mixed with Edward Shortt of the BBFC initially declaring his intention to ban the film. The initial critical reception, however, was focused on praise for Lorre's performance. The Hollywood Reporter said that [...] "Lorre triumphs in a characterization that is sheer horror", Time magazine called him [...] "perfectly cast", Graham Greene described his performance as [...] "convincing", and Charlie Chaplin called him [...] "the greatest living actor". Reviews {{for the rest of}} the cast were less positive. The New York Times said that [...] "Ted Healy, a highly amusing comedian, has <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wrong picture", and The Hollywood Reporter said that Colin Clive [...] "jitters his way through". The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film was [...] "neither important or particularly compelling... falls right in the middle between Art and Box Office". Time magazine called it [...] "completely horrible", and The New York Times wrote that [...] "Mad Love is not much more than a super-Karloff melodrama, an interesting but pretty trivial adventure in Grand Guignol horror." [...] Mad Love was not a hit at the box office, and had a small domestic gross of $170,000. Its foreign gross was larger, at $194,000.|$|E
2500|$|One {{feature of}} Curll's career, {{and the one}} that most {{cemented}} his reputation through the ages, was the unauthorized publication of works originally produced by another house, often against the author's wishes. [...] Usually, Curll stayed just across the legal line from piracy, but not always. [...] In 1707, Curll announced in the newspapers {{that he was going to}} publish Poems on Several Occasions by Matthew Prior. [...] Jacob Tonson had the sole rights to Prior's works, but Curll published anyway. [...] In 1716, Curll again announced his intent to publish Matthew Prior's works, and Prior himself wrote letters of protest to the newspapers. [...] The quarrel with Tonson, and Prior's objections, only served as publicity, however, and Curll published the book anyway. [...] In 1710, he printed up Jonathan Swift's Meditation Upon a Broomstick. [...] He also that year wrote a [...] "key" [...] to other Swift works, and in 1713 he produced a key to A Tale of a Tub. [...] Swift was angry at Curll for revealing his authorship of the works (as Swift was ascending in the Church of England), but he was also amused at the dullness of Curll's explication of his works. [...] He wrote to Alexander Pope that dunces like Curll were tools for a satirist, that they were valuable in their way. [...] Having <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> habit of sapping Swift, Curll did not relent, especially after Swift incorporated Curll's notes (without permission) into the apparatus of A Tale of a Tub. [...] In 1726, Curll produced a wildly inaccurate [...] "key" [...] to Swift's Gulliver's Travels. [...] Another alleged case of unauthorized publication came with the poet Edward Young, who sent a poem to Curll for publication, with a letter of solicitation. [...] When the poem was published in 1717, Young took out an ad claiming that the poem and letter were forgeries. [...] In fact, the poem was in praise of a politician who had lost place, and Young's letter was authentic.|$|E
2500|$|The manga {{has been}} {{generally}} well received in Japan, with the compilations appearing as topsellers multiple times. It also has one {{million copies in}} print as of January 2017. The manga's first volume has also sold well in North America. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network admitted Boruto appealed to her despite having never <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Naruto manga. She praised how the writers managed {{to deal with the}} protagonist's angst without coming across as [...] "teen whining" [...] as well as how Sasuke Uchiha decides to train him. Amy McNulty found it appealing to fans of the original Naruto series, stating that while Mitsuki does not have a large role in the story, the sidestory helps to expand his origins. Nik Freeman, another writer from the same site, criticized Boruto's lack of development when comparing him with his first introduction in the Narutos finale and there were multiple differences as to why both the young Naruto and Boruto vandalized their city. Nevertheless, Freeman also liked Mitsuki's backstory as he did not feel it rehashed stories from the past. Reviewing, the first chapter online, Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post was more negative, complaining more about the large focus between Naruto and Boruto's poor relationship, the rehash elements of [...] and criticized the adaptation of Kishimoto's artwork. Nevertheless, she praised the relationship between Naruto and Sasuke as well as the foreshadowing of an older Boruto fight. Melina Dargis from the same site reviewed the first volume, commenting she was looking forward {{to the development of the}} characters despite having already watched the Boruto movie and was also pleased by seeing Mitsuki's role in his own sidestory. Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin recommended it to Naruto fans, explaining how the new authors managed to use the first volume to establish the protagonists' personalities. Melina Dargis from the Fandom Post was impressed by the apparent message of the series as it she found it is trying to connect to modern audiences due to its themes such as the parental issues, the use of technology in contrast to Naruto. Leroy Douresseaux liked how Boruto's character has already started development by the second volume of the series.|$|E

2500|$|Tyndall was an {{experimenter}} {{and laboratory}} apparatus builder, not an abstract model builder. But in his experiments on radiation and the heat-absorptive power of gases, {{he had an}} underlying agenda to understand the physics of molecules. Tyndall said in 1879: [...] "During nine years of labour {{on the subject of}} radiation , heat and light were handled throughout by me, not as ends, but as instruments by the aid of which the mind might perchance lay hold upon the ultimate particles of matter." [...] This agenda is explicit in the title he picked for his 1872 book Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat. It is present less explicitly in the spirit of his widely read 1863 book Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion. Besides heat he also saw magnetism and sound propagation as reducible to molecular behaviours. Invisible molecular behaviours were the ultimate basis of all physical activity. With this mindset, and his experiments, he outlined an account whereby differing types of molecules have differing absorptions of infrared radiation because their molecular structures give them differing oscillating resonances. He'd <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> oscillating resonances idea because he'd seen that any one type of molecule has differing absorptions at differing radiant frequencies, and he was entirely persuaded that the only difference between one frequency and another is the frequency. He'd also seen that the absorption behaviour of molecules is quite {{different from that of the}} atoms composing the molecules. For example, the gas nitric oxide (NO) absorbed more than a thousand times more infrared radiation than either nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2).] the amount of radiant heat which they absorb is augmented more than a thousandfold. It may be a millionfold, for we do not yet know how small the absorption of the absolutely pure mixture really is. The act of chemical union is the sole cause of the enormous alteration in the amount of heat intercepted. The converse is also true: dissolve the chemical bond of the ammonia, and you instantly destroy the absorption." [...] He'd also seen in several kinds of experiments that – no matter whether a gas is a weak absorber of broad-spectrum radiant heat – any gas will strongly absorb the radiant heat coming from a separate body of the same type of gas.|$|E
