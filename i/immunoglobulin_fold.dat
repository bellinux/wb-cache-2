A full homology model for CEA based on V-type, I-type and C 2 -type <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>folds,</b> 28 oligosaccharides and the interdomain angle of CD 2 was validated using solution scattering data. The superimposition of the intermolecular contacts observed in our recent crystal structure of MFE 23 with the N-terminal domain of CEA permitted the MFE 23 –CEA complex to be modelled. Good surface and electrostatic complementarity and carbohydrate-unhindered access of MFE 23 with the indentation between the first two CEA domains was observed.

MSP can be classified as an s-type of this fold, because two of its strands are switching between separate β sheets, unlike in the conserved c-type of the Ig folds. The unique strand switches between the sheets result from two distinct kinks at cis-proline residues 13 and 57 in A. suum protein.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{well-known}} crucial role of intradomain disulfide bridges for <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>folding</b> and stability, the single-chain variable fragment of the anti-viral antibody F 8 is functionally expressed when targeted to the reducing {{environment of the}} plant cytoplasm. We show here that this antibody fragment is also functionally expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. A gel shift assay revealed that the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) accumulating in the plant and bacterial cytoplasm bears free sulfhydryl groups. Guanidinium chloride denaturation/renaturation studies indicated that refolding occurs even in a reducing environment, producing a functional molecule with the same spectral properties of the native scFv(F 8). Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} folding and functionality of this antibody fragment are not prevented in a reducing environment.

50|$|Siglecs are Type I transmembrane {{proteins}} {{where the}} NH3+-terminus {{is in the}} extracellular space and the COO−-terminus is cytosolic. Each Siglec contains an N-terminal V-type immunoglobulin domain (Ig domain) which acts as the binding receptor for sialic acid. These lectins are placed into the group of I-type lectins because the lectin domain is an <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>fold.</b> All Siglecs are extended from the cell surface by C2-type Ig domains which have no binding activity.

50|$|The Ig alpha-1 chain C {{region is}} {{contained}} {{on the first}} of the constant regions of IgA, and is composed of an amino acid sequence 353 residues long. The secondary structure contained within this region is dominated by beta strands, which define four antiparallel beta sheets. These antiparallel beta-sheets are then sandwiched to form two beta-sandwiches, a typical tertiary structure of the <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>fold</b> class. The two beta sheets that comprise each beta-sandwich are joined by an alpha helix on one side. These alpha helices define the binding site for this protein, with the binding site incorporating one antiparallel beta strand {{on either side of the}} helix. In addition to the binding sites, the opposite side of the beta-sandwich is connected by a series of loops, which define a hypervariable loop system, that may have a role in determining the specificity of an interaction between IgA and an antigen.|$|E

40|$|The CD 4 antigen is a {{membrane}} glycoprotein of T lymphocytes that {{interacts with}} {{major histocompatibility complex}} class II antigens and is also a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus. the extracellular portion of CD 4 is predicted to fold into four immunoglobulin-like domains. The crystal structure of {{the third and fourth}} domains of rat CD 4 was solved at 2. 8 angstrom resolution and shows that both domains have <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>folds.</b> Domain 3, however, lacks the disulfide between the beta sheets; this results in an expansion of the domain. There is a difference of 30 degrees in the orientation between domains 3 and 4 when compared with domains 1 and 2. The two CD 4 fragment structures provide a basis from which models of the overall receptor can be proposed. These models suggest an extended structure comprising two rigid portions joined by a short and possibly flexible linker region...|$|R
40|$|Ermap (erythroid membrane-associated protein), a gene coding for a novel {{transmembrane protein}} {{produced}} exclusively in erythroid cells, is described. It is mapped to murine Chromosome 4, 57 cM distal to the centromere. The initial cDNA clone was isolated from a day 9 murine embryonic erythroid cell cDNA library. The predicted peptide sequence suggests that ERMAP is a transmembrane protein with two extracellular <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>folds,</b> {{as well as}} a highly conserved B 30. 2 domain and several phosphorylation consensus sequences in the cytoplasmic region. ERMAP shares a high homology throughout the entire peptide with butyrophilin, a glycoprotein essential for milk lipid droplet formation and release. A GFP-ERMAP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic vesicles in transiently transfected 293 T cells. Northern blot analysis and in-situ hybridization demonstrated that Ermap expression was restricted to fetal and adult erythroid tissues. ERMAP is likely a novel adhesion/receptor molecule specific for erythroid cells. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Cell-cell {{adhesion}} is {{a fundamental}} requirement for all multicellular organisms. The calcium-independent cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF-CAMs) represent a major subgroup. They consist of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>folds</b> alone or {{in combination with other}} protein modules, often fibronectin type-III folds. More than 100 IgSF-CAMs have been identified in vertebrates and invertebrates. Most of the IgSF-CAMs are cell surface molecules that are membrane-anchored either by a single transmembrane segment or by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Some of the IgSF-CAMs also occur in soluble form, e. g., in the cerebrospinal fluid or in the vitreous fluid of the eye, due to naturally occurring cleavage of the GPI anchor or the membrane-proximal peptide segment. Some IgSF-CAMs, such as NCAM, occur in various forms that are generated by alternative splicing. This unit contains a series of protocols that have been used to study the function of IgSF-CAMs in vitro and in vivo. Curr. Protoc.

40|$|MPT 63 is a small, major {{secreted}} protein {{of unknown}} function from Mycobacterium tuberculosis {{that has been}} shown to have immunogenic properties and has been implicated in virulence. A BLAST search identified that MPT 63 has homologs only in other mycobacteria, and is therefore mycobacteria specific. As MPT 63 is a secreted protein, mycobacteria specific, and implicated in virulence, MPT 63 is an attractive drug target against the deadliest infectious disease, tuberculosis (TB). As part of the TB Structural Genomics Consortium, the X-ray crystal structure of MPT 63 was determined to 1. 5 -Ångstrom resolution with the hope of yielding functional information about MPT 63. The structure of MPT 63 is an antiparallel -sandwich immunoglobulin-like fold, with the unusual feature of the first -strand of the protein forming a parallel addition to the small antiparallel -sheet. MPT 63 has weak structural similarity to many proteins with <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>folds,</b> in particular, Homo sapiens 2 -adaptin, bovine arrestin, and Yersinia pseudotuber-culosis invasin.

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} that the folding and assembly of IgG in transgenic tobacco plants is orchestrated by BiP (binding protein), an endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone. Expression of BiP and calreticulin was examined in transgenic tobacco plants that express immunoglobulin chains, either singly or in combination to form IgG antibody. BiP mRNA expression was lowest in wild-type nontransformed plants and those that expressed immunoglobulin light chain alone. Higher mRNA levels were detected in plants expressing fully assembled immunoglobulin (light and heavy chains), and the most abundant levels of RNA transcript were found in those plants that expressed immunoglobulin heavy chain alone. Estimation of total BiP demonstrated a similar pattern, with the highest levels detected in plants expressing immunoglobulin heavy chain alone. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that BiP was associated with immunoglobulin chains extracted from protoplast lysates, but not from secreted fluids. Again, most BiP was coprecipitated from plants expressing heavy chain only and those that produced full length IgG. The binding of BiP to Ig heavy chains was ATP-sensitive. Co-expression of heavy and light chain resulted in IgG assembly and displacement of BiP from the heavy chain {{as the amount of}} light chain increased. Although calreticulin mRNA and total protein levels varied in a similar manner to those of BiP in the transgenic plants, there was no evidence for association between calreticulin and Ig chains, by coimmunoprecipitation.

40|$|Amyloid fibrils {{formed from}} {{initially}} soluble proteins with diverse sequences {{are associated with}} an array of human diseases. In the human disorder, dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA), fibrils contain two major constituents, full-length human β[subscript 2]-microglobulin (hβ 2 m) and a truncation variant, ΔN 6 which lacks the N-terminal six amino acids. These fibrils are assembled from initially natively folded proteins with an all antiparallel β-stranded structure. Here, backbone conformations of wild-type hβ[subscript 2]m and ΔN 6 in their amyloid forms have been determined using a combination of dilute isotopic labeling strategies and multidimensional magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR techniques at high magnetic fields, providing valuable structural information at the atomic-level about the fibril architecture. The secondary structures of both fibril types, determined by the assignment of ~ 80 % of the backbone resonances of these 100 - and 94 -residue proteins, respectively, reveal substantial backbone rearrangement compared with the location of β-strands in their native <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>folds.</b> The identification of seven β-strands in hβ[subscript 2]m fibrils indicates that approximately 70 residues are in a β-strand conformation in the fibril core. By contrast, nine β-strands comprise the fibrils formed from ΔN 6, indicating a more extensive core. The precise location and length of β-strands in the two fibril forms also differ. The results indicate fibrils of ΔN 6 and hβ[subscript 2]m have an extensive core architecture involving the majority of residues in the polypeptide sequence. The common elements of the backbone structure of the two proteins likely facilitates their ability to copolymerize during amyloid fibril assembly. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)
