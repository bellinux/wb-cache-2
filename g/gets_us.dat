500|$|The Virginia Tech offense {{averaged}} 31.5points {{per game}} {{during the regular}} season. In the weeks before the San Francisco Bowl, Virginia Tech running back Lee Suggs was cast as the key for that offense in the game. Suggs, for whom the game {{would be his last}} as a collegiate player, rushed for 1,255yards and 20touchdowns during the regular season. He needed just 149more rushing yards to set the team's record for single-season rushing yards, which stood at 1,403. Even without the record, Suggs was predicted to be a high pick in that year's NFL Draft. Suggs was supported by Virginia Tech center Jake Grove, who anchored a strong Tech offensive line. Though criticized as being too [...] "nasty," [...] Grove led the team in knockdown blocks and was graded as the team's most efficient lineman. About Grove, Suggs said, [...] "He gets the blocking scheme straight. ... He <b>gets</b> <b>us</b> ready to go." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} the album, Shirley Shipin of Rolling Stone opined that [...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{the highlight of}} the album where Clarkson sounded [...] "more Avril than Ashlee". Rhonda Lynn of Florida Entertainment Scene praised the acoustic guitar in the song which is instrumental in holding the whole structure together. Tammy La Gorce of Amazon.com thought that the song would not wear out due to its [...] "rock-friendly thumps, dips, and rolls." [...] In a different perspective, Joan Anderman of Boston.com remarked that [...] "Breakaway" [...] is not new or exciting-sounding but he admitted that the [...] "hit single accomplishes the rare feat of being thoroughly middle-of-the-road without sacrificing grace or intelligence". Chuck Taylor of Billboard felt that the song was a weak choice as a single compared to Clarkson's previous hits, writing Breakaway' sounds more like an Irish folk song propped up with pop production than the anthemic material with which Clarkson has won over legions of fans." [...] Kathi Kamen Goldmark of Disney Family.com felt that the song was tedious, simultaneously dull and so emotionally overwrought that it almost sounds like a parody of itself. Michael Wood of The Village Voice described the song as [...] "a swoony acoustic folk-pop that Goo Goo Doll Johnny Rzeznik would trade his hair gel for". Jill Salama of Oprah.com listed [...] "Breakaway" [...] as one of her nine favourite Idol singles of all time, writing [...] "There is nothing that <b>gets</b> <b>us</b> more than a song about a girl going out on her own. Making a wish, making a change and, of course, breaking away. But seriously, this song {{is more than just a}} high school graduation anthem." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 9, 2017, {{the band}} {{announced}} that they were signed to Sony Masterworks via a feature in Local Spins, {{and they said they}} are looking forward to releasing the album internationally sometime during the spring of the same year. According to the band, the album will feature multiple guest performers, including Jack White bassist Dominic John Davis, Jenny Conlee of The Decemberists, Keller Williams, Kaki King, Lily & Madeleine, and Carbon Leaf. Buist described Masterworks as [...] "a family that <b>gets</b> <b>us</b> and our music, and wants to support that authentically", while Larson added, [...] "We feel like we can be truly who we are and they appreciate the honesty." [...] Masterworks is primarily a classical and jazz label, having previously signed such names as Yo-Yo Ma, Sonny Rollins, and Yanni, though it has recently expanded its reach with its signing of indie folk duo Tall Heights and acknowledgement of bluegrass on The Goat Rodeo Sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Paranormal {{researcher}} John Champion {{writes in}} Skeptical Inquirer Magazine {{that he understands}} why people persist in believing that Queen Mary is haunted when the only evidence given is anecdotes, creepy feelings and shadows. Tourists who {{sign up for the}} haunted tour are given access to normally off-limit areas of the ship, while tours {{of the history of the}} ship are more limited. Champion believes that the owners are doing a disservice to the real history, the people who should be honoured [...] "by remembering who they really were and what they actually did". He understands why people report strange occurrences, the ship still creaks and groans, and people's imaginations can get away from them such that they start seeing and hearing all kinds of things, attributing them to the paranormal which they have been primed for. [...] "Ghost stories are fine", concludes Champion [...] "when presented as such. The confusion of science and history with fiction ... <b>gets</b> <b>us</b> further away from the ability to relish in and truly explore our own recent history." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kierkegaard, {{the human}} self desires {{that which is}} beyond reason. Desire itself {{appears to be a}} desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, {{according}} to Plato, is a kind of desire for immortality—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. Erotic love itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of time and space. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that <b>gets</b> <b>us</b> through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals {{in the name of a}} higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion.|$|E
2500|$|The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode the highest grade of the site, an [...] "A". Alasdair Wilkins writes [...] "Steven Moffat’s script is inordinately clever {{in how it}} uses {{the trappings of a}} fluffy, silly Christmas special to crank up the scariness of a good old-fashioned monster story. But after all that, tonight’s episode manages {{something}} that not all of its Christmas predecessors manage, as it anchors its story in something that feels particular to the holidays. There is a melancholy to the comings and goings that define this time of year, and “Last Christmas” recognises that from its title outward." [...] Praise was also given to Capaldi's performance in the special, [...] "If there’s one thing we never really saw in Capaldi’s first season as the Doctor, {{it was the kind of}} unabashed joy that so animated the 10th and 11th Doctors and made the tail-end of the 9th Doctor’s journey—including his Santa claim to Rose at the end of “The Doctor Dances”—so powerful. Well, it takes the full hour, but “Last Christmas” <b>gets</b> <b>us</b> there. It was worth the wait." [...] Digital Spy awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, stating that [...] "Moffat pulls off a number of difficult balancing acts spectacularly well, refusing to deliver another throwaway special that's heavy on the frothy festive cheer but light on real substance". They closed their review by saying [...] "Last Christmas is an absolute cracker. The festive fun factor is high, as is only right and proper, but it's often been said that Doctor Who is at its best when its roots are showing and here Moffat apes both Christopher Nolan's Inception and Ridley Scott's Alien to provide the viewer with both food for thought and fuel for our nightmares". The Daily Telegraph awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "marvellously merry" [...] and stating that it [...] "had heart as well as head, so ended like a festive special should: happily, with a cockle-warming cosy glow". The Mirror also praised the episode, saying that it [...] "might have borrowed, somewhat heavily, from a few films, but it still had the Doctor Who spin". They also expressed praise over Clara's continuation, saying [...] "It’s great news that we will have another series with these two verbally sparring" [...] and closed their review by claiming the episode [...] "was [...] real Christmas treat to join Capaldi and Coleman on another adventure, and it was the icing on the cake that Clara is staying with the Doctor".|$|E
