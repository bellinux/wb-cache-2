40|$|The {{decision}} of Greppo v Jam-Cal Bundaberg Pty Ltd [2015] QCA 131 illustrates a defect in s 128 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) which gives {{a right to}} a lessee to apply for relief against forfeiture against loss of a right to exercise an option to renew. The defect arises because the legislation does not adequately deal with breaches that occur after the exercise of the option but before the <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lease.</b> Most commercial <b>leases</b> <b>of</b> all kinds have a standard provisions, as the lease in this case, as a conditions of the exercise of the option to renew that the lessee will have given notice of exercise within the time specified to the lessor and will have up to the date <b>of</b> <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lease</b> paid all rent and observed all lessee’s covenants. The difficulties occur because invariably an option must be exercised before the <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lease</b> when a lessee may not be in breach <b>of</b> the <b>lease</b> but may later prior to the <b>expiry</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lease</b> fall into breach. As this decision indicates,at least in Queensland, that the lessee who desires to challenge the lessor’s right to enforce those conditions can neither seek relief under s 128 against forfeiture of the right to exercise the option,or indeed, under s 124 of the Property Law Act 1974 to preserve the agreement for lease brought about by the otherwise regular exercise of the option to renew. The decision cries out for legislative reform along the lines of s 133 E of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) which was amended in 2001 to meet this contingency...|$|R
