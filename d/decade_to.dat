5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate.|$|E

5|$|Heffernan brought suit {{alleging that}} his {{demotion}} violated his First Amendment rights. The case took a <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> reach the Supreme Court. For {{most of that}} time it was in federal district court, where it was heard by three different judges. A jury verdict in Heffernan's favor was set aside. A later summary judgment in the city's favor was overturned on appeal before being granted again in the third trial.|$|E

5|$|Whisky {{is one of}} Scotland's more known {{goods of}} {{economic}} activity. Exports increased by 87% in the <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> 2012 and were valued at £4.3 billion in 2013, which was 85% of Scotland's food and drink exports. It supports around 10,000 jobs directly and 25,000 indirectly. It may contribute £400–682 million to Scotland, rather than several billion pounds, as more than 80% of whisky produced is owned by non-Scottish companies.|$|E
5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E

Cheek to Cheek debuted at {{number one on}} the US Billboard 200, with 131,000 copies sold in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan, and has since sold 750,000 copies in the US. The album became Bennett's second number-one album and Gaga's third consecutive number-one album in the US; Gaga became the first female artist in the 2010 <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> have three number-one albums, while Bennett extended his record as the oldest person to achieve a number-one album on the chart. The album also reached the top ten in Greece, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1821 the Royal Academy {{accepted}} and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, {{and many of}} Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected {{for his ability to}} capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty tried over the next <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to natural calamities and jiedushi amassing autonomous control, the Huang Chao Rebellion (874–884) {{resulted in the}} sacking of both Chang'an and Luoyang, and took an entire <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> suppress. Although the rebellion was defeated by the Tang, it never recovered from that crucial blow, weakening it for the future military powers to take over. There were also large groups of bandits, {{in the size of}} small armies, that ravaged the countryside {{in the last years of}} the Tang, who smuggled illicit salt, ambushed merchants and convoys, and even besieged several walled cities.|$|E

5|$|In the inter-war period, Sleaford's {{population}} remained static, but the Great Depression in the 1930s caused unemployment to rise. Council-housing developments along Drove Lane proved {{insufficient to}} house low-income families after the Westgate slums were cleared in the 1930s so Jubilee Grove opened in that <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> meet the demand. In the post-war period, there were new housing developments at St Giles Avenue, the Hoplands, Russell Crescent, Jubilee Grove and Grantham Road. Parts {{of the town}} were redeveloped: in 1958, the Bristol Arms Arcade opened, the Corn Exchange was demolished in the 1960s and the Waterside Shopping Precinct opened in 1973, as did Flaxwell House, designed to house a department store, though later becoming the national headquarters for Interflora.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{population}} peaked {{in the mid}} 19th century at just over 32,000 and declined for a century thereafter {{to a low of}} fewer than 18,000 in the 1970s. Declines were particularly significant in the outlying islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses. Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends are very similar to those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki is {{best known}} for her The Tale of Genji, a three-part novel {{spanning}} 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken a <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.|$|E

5|$|Public Act51 of 1951 amended and {{clarified}} {{the current}} system of jurisdiction over roads in the state. The existing tri-level system was maintained, splitting road jurisdiction between the state, counties and cities, as well as subdividing each level into several classifications. Further legislation redefined the exact distribution, but Act51 set up a system to distribute road funding from gas taxes from a single funding source, currently the Michigan Transportation Fund. Funding was increased during the 1950s as the fuel taxes were increased. Whereas those revenues during the war dropped to levels barely sufficient to keep existing highways in usable condition, they were increased during the following <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> deal with increasing traffic. The state highway department was also authorized to sell bonds to provide funding for the proposed road improvements.|$|E
5|$|The Triumph of Cleopatra {{illustrates}} {{a scene from}} Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, in which Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a magnificently decorated ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general Mark Antony. An intentionally cramped and crowded composition, it shows a huge {{group of people in}} various states of undress, gathering on the bank to watch the ship's arrival. Although not universally admired in the press, the painting was an immediate success, making Etty famous almost overnight. Buoyed by its reception, Etty devoted much of the next <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> creating further history paintings containing nude figures, becoming renowned for his combination of nudity and moral messages.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{this point}} the Redman {{investment}} {{had not been a}} notable success: in the <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> 1934, despite an additional capital injection by Churchill, the business had made losses in half of the years, and in only one of the other years had it made any more than a modest profit. However, growth was steady after 1934, with profits of £23,000, £38,000, £54,000 and then a large jump to £139,000 in 1938. By 1939 the Redman operation alone employed 300 people, compared to around 30 in 1920. Motor industry expansion assisted in this growth, with Ford becoming a customer and Gabriel setting up a new machine tool division at Coventry Road, South Yardley, Birmingham, in 1938 to give easy access for the industry's centre, but rearmament was the most significant factor.|$|E
