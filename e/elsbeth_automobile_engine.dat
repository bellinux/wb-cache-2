40|$|Abstract — In {{this review}} {{we have done}} studies in two parts, in first part we {{mentioned}} the possibilities of LPG as refrigerant and in second part the effects of emissions on <b>automobile</b> <b>engine</b> when use Air conditioner. In first part we investigated the use of LPG in domestic refrigerator and their limitations and safety, this study gave the potential {{how to use the}} LPG in refrigerator and in the second part we studied the load of Air Conditioner on an <b>automobile</b> <b>engine</b> and their effects on tail pipe emissions and fuel efficiency. So studies shows that LPG {{can be used in a}} car air conditioner as a refrigerant and as a fuel for an <b>automobile</b> <b>engine</b> we designed a system which works on LPG as a refrigerant and a fuel for an <b>automobile</b> <b>engine...</b>|$|R
