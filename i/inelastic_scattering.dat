5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is a form}} of elastic scattering; {{the outgoing}} X-rays have the same energy, and thus same wavelength, as the incoming X-rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, <b>inelastic</b> <b>scattering</b> occurs when energy is transferred from the incoming X-ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner-shell electron to a higher energy level. Such <b>inelastic</b> <b>scattering</b> reduces the energy (or increases the wavelength) of the outgoing beam. <b>Inelastic</b> <b>scattering</b> is useful for probing such excitations of matter, but not in determining the distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|The quark {{model was}} {{independently}} proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964.

5|$|The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory deep <b>inelastic</b> <b>scattering</b> {{experiments}} of {{the late}} 1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data {{in a way that}} did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.|$|E
40|$|The most {{fundamental}} approach {{to an understanding}} of electronic, optical, and transport phenomena which the condensed matter physics (of conventional as well as nonconventional systems) offers is generally founded on two experiments: the <b>inelastic</b> electron <b>scattering</b> and the <b>inelastic</b> light <b>scattering.</b> This work embarks on providing a systematic framework for the theory of <b>inelastic</b> electron <b>scattering</b> and of <b>inelastic</b> light <b>scattering</b> from the electronic excitations in GaAs/Ga 1 −xAlxAs quantum wells. To this end, we start with the Kubo's correlation function to derive the generalized nonlocal, dynamic dielectric function, and the inverse dielectric function within the framework of Bohm-Pines’ random-phase approximation. This is followed by a thorough development of the theory of <b>inelastic</b> electron <b>scattering</b> and of <b>inelastic</b> light <b>scattering.</b> The methodological part is then subjected to the analytical diagnoses which allow us to sense the subtlety of the analytical results and the importance of their applications. The general analytical results, which know no bounds regarding, e. g., the subband occupancy, are then specified so as to make them applicable to practicality. After trying and testing the eigenfunctions, we compute the density of states, the Fermi energy, the full excitation spectrum made up of intrasubband and intersubband – single-particle and collective (plasmon) – excitations, the loss functions for all the principal geometries envisioned for the <b>inelastic</b> electron <b>scattering,</b> and the Raman intensity, which provides a measure of the real transitions induced by the (laser) probe, for the <b>inelastic</b> light <b>scattering.</b> It is found that the dominant contribution to both the loss peaks and the Raman peaks comes from the collective (plasmon) excitations. As to the single-particle peaks, the analysis indicates a long-lasting lack of quantitative comparison between theory and experiments.

The scattered photon can go in any direction, but a direction similar to the original direction is more likely, especially for high-energy X-rays.

To compare this result with the measured critical exponent, the Fermi-liquid approximation was used, where the Coulomb interactions between electrons are assumed to be finite. Under this assumption, the ground state of the free electron gas can be adiabatically transformed into the ground state of the interacting system and this gives rise to an <b>inelastic</b> <b>scattering</b> length so that the canonical correlation length exponent can be compared to the measured critical exponent.|$|E

25|$|Raman {{scattering}} {{is another}} phenomenon that involves <b>inelastic</b> <b>scattering</b> of light {{caused by the}} vibrational properties of matter. The detected range of frequency shifts and other effects are very different compared to Brillouin scattering. In Raman scattering, photons are scattered by the effect of vibrational and rotational transitions in the bonds between first-order neighboring atoms, while Brillouin scattering results from the scattering of photons caused by large scale, low-frequency phonons. The effects of the two phenomena provide very different information about the sample: Raman spectroscopy {{can be used to}} determine the transmitting medium's chemical composition and molecular structure, while Brillouin scattering can be used to measure the material's properties on a larger scale – such as its elastic behaviour. The frequency shifts from Brillouin scattering, a technique known as Brillouin Spectroscopy, are detected with an interferometer while Raman scattering uses either an interferometer or a dispersive (grating) spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|When {{the primary}} {{electron}} beam {{interacts with the}} sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the interaction volume, which extends from less than 100nm to approximately 5µm into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron's landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by elastic scattering, emission of secondary electrons by <b>inelastic</b> <b>scattering</b> and the emission of electromagnetic radiation, each {{of which can be}} detected by specialized detectors. The beam current absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. Electronic amplifiers of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a computer monitor (or, for vintage models, on a cathode ray tube). Each pixel of computer video memory is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is therefore a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. In older microscopes images may be captured by photography from a high-resolution cathode ray tube, but in modern machines they are digitised and saved as digital images.|$|E

In {{the first method}} the energy loss of a beam of neutrons that excite a magnon is measured, typically {{as a function of}} scattering vector (or equivalently momentum transfer), temperature and external magnetic field. <b>Inelastic</b> neutron <b>scattering</b> measurements can determine the dispersion curve for magnons just as they can for phonons. Important <b>inelastic</b> neutron <b>scattering</b> facilities are present at the ISIS neutron source in Oxfordshire, UK, the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France, the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, and at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Maryland, USA. Brillouin scattering similarly measures the energy loss of photons (usually at a convenient visible wavelength) reflected from or transmitted through a magnetic material. Brillouin spectroscopy is similar to the more widely known Raman scattering but probes a lower energy and has a superior energy resolution {{in order to be able}} to detect the meV energy of magnons. Ferromagnetic (or antiferromagnetic) resonance instead measures the absorption of microwaves, incident on a magnetic material, by spin waves, typically as a function of angle, temperature and applied field. Ferromagnetic resonance is a convenient laboratory method for determining the effect of magnetocrystalline anisotropy on the dispersion of spin waves. Very recently, one group in Max Planck Institute for Microstructure Physics in Halle Germany proved that by using spin polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy (SPEELS), very high energy surface magnons can be excited. This technique allows people for the first time to probe the dispersion of magnons in the ultrathin ferromagnetic films. The first experiment was performed for a 5 ML Fe film. With momentum resolution, the magnon dispersion was explored for an 8 ML fcc Co film on Cu(001) and an 8 ML hcp Co on W(110), respectively. The maximum magnon energy at the border of the surface Brillouin zone was 240 meV.|$|R
