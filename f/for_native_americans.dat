5|$|Oklahoma is on a {{confluence}} of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives, a destination for Southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned territory <b>for</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> The main Sioux tribe that originally inhabited the state were the Ponca.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, salmon was a reliable food source <b>for</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> living along the Rogue. Salmon migrations were so huge that early settlers claimed {{they could hear}} the fish moving upstream. These large runs continued into the 20thcentury despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in the 1850s and large-scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter. The fishing industry fed demands for salmon in the growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for canned salmon in England.|$|E

5|$|Multnomah County {{is named}} <b>for</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> {{who lived in}} the area before {{settlement}} by non-indigenous people in the 19thcentury. Members of the Multnomah tribe of the Chinookan people lived on Sauvie Island in the Willamette River and on the mainland across from the island, downstream from the mouth of Balch Creek. Much of the area near the lower creek was swampy, and was not favored by the Multnomah. By the 1830s, diseases carried by white explorers and traders reduced the native population by up to 90percent in the lower Columbia basin.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> Pontiac's War {{demonstrated}} {{the possibilities of}} pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, {{and was the first}} war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{gained control}} of Indiana, the entire region {{was in the middle}} of Pontiac's Rebellion. During the next year, British {{officials}} negotiated with the various tribes, splitting them from their alliance with Pontiac. Eventually, Pontiac lost most of his allies, forcing him to make peace with the British on July 25, 1766. As a concession to Pontiac, Great Britain issued a proclamation that the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains was to be reserved <b>for</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> Despite the treaty, Pontiac was still considered a threat to British interests, but after he was murdered on April 20, 1769, the region saw several years of peace.|$|E

5|$|The Klamath is {{the most}} {{important}} North American river south of the Columbia River for anadromous fish migration. Its salmon, steelhead and rainbow trout have adapted to unusually high water temperatures and acidity levels relative to other rivers in the Pacific Northwest. The numerous fish were a major source of food <b>for</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> who have inhabited the basin for at least 7,000years. The first Europeans to enter the Klamath River basin were fur trappers for the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1820s; they established the Siskiyou Trail along the Klamath and Trinity rivers into the Sacramento Valley. Within several decades of white settlement, native peoples were forced into reservations. During the latter days of the California Gold Rush, increasing numbers of miners began working the Klamath River and its tributaries, causing considerable harm to the environment. Conflict and introduced diseases left indigenous tribes with only 10% of their original population.|$|E
