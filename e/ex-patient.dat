25|$|While {{public opinion}} {{of the mentally ill}} has {{improved}} somewhat, it is still often stigmatized. Advocacy movements in support of mental health have emerged. These movements focus on reducing stigma and discrimination and increasing support groups and awareness. The consumer or <b>ex-patient</b> movement, began as protests in the 1970s, forming groups such as Liberation of Mental Patients, Project Release, Insane Liberation Front, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).|$|E
25|$|Freud {{continued}} {{to maintain his}} optimistic underestimation of the growing Nazi threat and remained determined to stay in Vienna, even following the Anschluss of 13 March 1938, in which Nazi Germany annexed Austria, and the outbreaks of violent anti-Semitism that ensued. Ernest Jones, the then president of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA), flew into Vienna from London via Prague on 15 March determined to get Freud {{to change his mind}} and seek exile in Britain. This prospect and the shock of the detention and interrogation of Anna Freud by the Gestapo finally convinced Freud {{it was time to leave}} Austria. Jones left for London the following week with a list provided by Freud of the party of émigrés for whom immigration permits would be required. Back in London, Jones used his personal acquaintance with the Home Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, to expedite the granting of permits. There were seventeen in all and work permits were provided where relevant. Jones also used his influence in scientific circles, persuading the president of the Royal Society, Sir William Bragg, to write to the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, requesting to good effect that diplomatic pressure be applied in Berlin and Vienna on Freud's behalf. Freud also had support from American diplomats, notably his <b>ex-patient</b> and American ambassador to France, William Bullitt.|$|E
2500|$|Controversy {{has often}} {{surrounded}} psychiatry, and the term anti-psychiatry was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967. The anti-psychiatry {{view is that}} psychiatric treatments are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients, and psychiatry's history involves what may now be seen as dangerous treatments, such as lobotomy. Several <b>ex-patient</b> groups have become anti-psychiatric, often referring to themselves as [...] "survivors." ...|$|E

The National Mental Health Center and <b>Ex-Patients</b> Sanatorium were predecessor institutions to the modern, non-sectarian National Jewish Health, an academic medical research facility located in Denver specializing in respiratory, cardiac, immune and allergic disorders.|$|R

60|$|A {{week later}} this tension {{terminated}} by {{the return of}} Calton to Roanoke Ledge, a convalescent man. A very pretty watch and chain afterward were received by Miss Trotter, with a few lines expressing the gratitude of the <b>ex-patient.</b> Mr. Bilson was highly delighted, and frequently borrowed the watch to show to his guests as an advertisement of the healing powers of the Summit Hotel. What Mr. Calton sent to the more attractive and flirtatious Frida did not as publicly appear, and possibly Mr. Bilson did not know it. The incident of the cardroom was forgotten. Since that discovery, Miss Trotter had felt herself debarred from taking the girl's conduct into serious account, {{and it did not}} interfere with her work.|$|E

50|$|His {{treatment}} was also {{brought to light}} by the Australian media in 1997, originally in an article by The Age (Melbourne), reporting an inquiry that was being undertaken by Australia's federal health department regarding girls who were subjected to a trial of DES to control their height outcomes. Concerned <b>ex-patients,</b> and parents of <b>ex-patients,</b> contacted the media, leading to a flurry of media coverage regarding the issue. A group of <b>ex-patients</b> who called themselves 'Tall Girls inc', demanded an inquiry into {{the long-term effects of}} the treatment, especially DES, which it appeared was used as a 'trial', not as an approved medical treatment. Wettenhall refused to partake in the inquiry.|$|R

50|$|MindFreedom International {{is rooted}} in the {{psychiatric}} survivors movement, which arose out of the civil rights ferment of the late 1960s and early 1970s and the personal histories of psychiatric abuse experienced by some ex-patients rather than the intradisciplinary discourse of antipsychiatry. The precursors of MFI include <b>ex-patient</b> groups of the 1970s such as the Portland, Oregon-based Insane Liberation Front and the Mental Patients' Liberation Front in New York. The key text in the intellectual development of the survivor movement, at least in the US, was Judi Chamberlin's 1978 text, On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System. Chamberlin was an <b>ex-patient</b> and co-founder of the Mental Patients' Liberation Front. Coalescing around the <b>ex-patient</b> newsletter Dendron, in late 1988 leaders from several of the main national and grassroots psychiatric survivor groups felt that an independent, human rights coalition focused on problems in the mental health system was needed. That year the Support Coalition International (SCI) was formed. In 2005 the SCI changed its name to MFI with David W. Oaks as its director. SCI's first public action was to stage a counter-conference and protest in May 1990 in New York City {{at the same time as}} (and directly outside of) the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} noted that [...] "the most {{persistent}} critics of psychiatry have always been former mental hospital patients", but that very few were able {{to tell their stories}} publicly or to confront the psychiatric establishment openly, and those who did so were commonly considered so extreme in their charges that they could seldom gain credibility. In the early 20th century, <b>ex-patient</b> Clifford W. Beers campaigned to improve the plight of individuals receiving public psychiatric care, particularly those committed to state institutions, publicizing the issues in his book, A Mind that Found Itself (1908). While Beers initially condemned psychiatrists for tolerating mistreatment of patients, and envisioned more <b>ex-patient</b> involvement in the movement, he was influenced by Adolf Meyer and the psychiatric establishment, and toned down his hostility since he needed their support for reforms.|$|E

5000|$|His {{reliance}} on rich donors and {{his need for}} approval from experts led him to hand over to psychiatrists the organization he helped found, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene which eventually became the National Mental Health Association. In the UK, the National Society for Lunacy Law Reform was established in 1920 by angry ex-patients who sought justice for abuses committed in psychiatric custody, and were aggrieved that their complaints were patronisingly discounted by the authorities, who were seen to value the availability of medicalized internment as a 'whitewashed' extrajudicial custodial and punitive process. In 1922, <b>ex-patient</b> Rachel Grant-Smith added to calls for reform {{of the system of}} neglect and abuse she had suffered by publishing [...] "The Experiences of an Asylum Patient". In the US, We Are Not Alone (WANA) was founded by a group of patients at Rockland State Hospital in New York, and continued to meet as an <b>ex-patient</b> group.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1870s in North America, {{officials}} who ran Lunatic Asylums renamed them Insane Asylums.
