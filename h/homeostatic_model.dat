Four patients are described who developed this disorder during the paralytic phase of their illness and one who was hyperinsulinaemic but not hyperglycaemic. The mean age of the patients was 34. 4 yr. No patient received steroids and three were ventilated. The mean cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration was 1. 6 g/l. Two patients required short term insulin therapy. Four had intravenous glucose tolerance tests performed acutely (AP) and after one month (1 M). Three had a repeat study after long term follow-up. One subject had increased his Body Mass Index from 23. 8 - 26. 8 and therefore his IVGTT reflected insulin resistance. The other three patients had elevated basal glucose during GBS and similar first phase glucose response to IVGTT. The mean fasting glucose was 6. 9 mmol/l (AP), 3. 9 mmol/l (1 M) and 4. 4 mmol/l at 6 yr. The mean fasting insulin was 114. 9 pM/l (AP), 114. 9 pM/l (1 M) and 25. 9 pM/l (6 yr).

40|$|Abstract Background TMEM 18 is a {{hypothalamic}} {{gene that}} {{has recently been}} linked to obesity and BMI in genome wide association studies. However, the functional properties of TMEM 18 are obscure. Methods The evolutionary history of TMEM 18 was inferred using phylogenetic and bioinformatic methods. The gene's expression profile was investigated with real-time PCR in a panel of rat and mouse tissues and with immunohistochemistry in the mouse brain. Also, gene expression changes were analyzed in three feeding-related mouse models: food deprivation, reward and diet-induced increase in body weight. Finally, we genotyped 502 severely obese and 527 healthy Swedish children for two SNPs near TMEM 18 (rs 6548238 and rs 756131). Results TMEM 18 {{was found to be}} remarkably conserved and present in species that diverged from the human lineage over 1500 million years ago. The TMEM 18 gene was widely expressed and detected in the majority of cells in all major brain regions, but was more abundant in neurons than other cell types. We found no significant changes in the hypothalamic and brainstem expression in the feeding-related mouse models. There was a strong association for two SNPs (rs 6548238 and rs 756131) of the TMEM 18 locus with an increased risk for obesity (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 002).

A {{combination}} of drugs {{is required for}} treatment of obese subjects with diabetes, due to multiple pathogenic mechanisms implicated {{in the development of}} both diabetes and obesity. Objective. Assessment of the effect of sitagliptin added to insulin glargine and metformin, in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Methods. A total of 23 obese subjects on metformin and insulin glargine participated in the study. Titration of insulin glargine during a one-month period preceded the addition of 100 mg of sitagliptin daily. Body mass index, waist circumference, fasting, and prandial glucose were measured monthly, lipids and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) every three months, insulin, c-peptide and glucagon at the start and after six months of treatment. <b>Homeostatic</b> <b>models</b> for insulin secretion (HOMA B) and insulin resistance (HOMA IR) were calculated.

With the titration of insulin glargine, target fasting glucose levels were not achieved. Waist circumference and body mass index decreased during three months of sitagliptin treatment, thereafter remaining stable. HbA 1 c decreased significantly after three and six months of therapy. C-peptide increased significantly, while glucagon level fell. HOMA indexes were unchanged. Conclusion. Sitagliptin can improve diabetes control and induce modest weight loss in obese subjects poorly controlled on insulin glargine and metformin.

50|$|Life {{satisfaction}} can reflect {{experiences that}} have influenced {{a person in}} a positive way. These experiences have the ability to motivate people to pursue and reach their goals. There are two kinds of emotions that may influence how people perceive their lives. Hope and optimism both consist of cognitive processes that are usually oriented towards the reaching of goals and the perception of those goals. Additionally, optimism is linked to higher life satisfaction, whereas pessimism is related to symptoms in depression. The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) is a single scale that is used by UNESCO, the CIA, the New Economics Foundation, the WHO, the Veenhoven Database, the Latinbarometer, the Afrobarometer, and the UNHDR to measure how one views his or her self-esteem, well-being and overall happiness with life. Previous modeling showed that positive views and life satisfaction were completely mediated by the concept of self-esteem, together with the different ways in which ideas and events are perceived by people. Several studies found that self-esteem plays a definite role in influencing life satisfaction. There is also a <b>homeostatic</b> <b>model</b> that supports these findings. A person's mood and outlook on life can also influence their perception of their own life satisfaction.|$|E

Limited information is available regarding potential adaptations or abnormalities in anaerobic metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Whole-body glucose production was assessed at rest and during exercise in COPD patients with moderate disease severity (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, 52 % ± 3 %), prestratified into normal-weight (n = 7; body mass index [BMI], 27. 5 ± 0. 9 kg·m(- 2)) and underweight subjects (n = 6; BMI, 20. 6 ± 0. 7 kg·m(- 2)), and in 8 healthy controls matched for age and BMI with the normal-weight COPD group. Glucose tolerance was normal in all subjects. Rate of appearance (R(a)) of glucose at rest and during submaximal cycling exercise was measured in postabsorptive state by infusion of stable isotope tracer [6, 6 -(2) H(2) ]glucose. Resting glucose R(a) was significantly enhanced in underweight COPD patients compared with controls (16. 7 ± 0. 3 vs 15. 1 ± 0. 4 μmol·kg fat-free mass(- 1) ·min(- 1), P <. 05) and was inversely related to fat-free mass (r = - 0. 75, P <. 01).

40|$|Abstract To {{maintain}} {{activity in}} a functional range, neurons constantly adjust membrane excitability to chang-ing intra- and extracellular conditions. Such activity-dependent homeostatic regulation (ADHR) {{is critical for}} normal processing {{of the nervous system}} and avoiding pathological conditions. Here, we posed a homeostatic regulation problem for the classical Morris-Lecar (ML) model. The problem was motivated by the phenomenon of the functional recovery of stomatogastric neurons in crustaceans in the absence of neuromodulation. In our study, the regulation of the ionic conductances in the ML model depended on the calcium current or the intracellular calcium concentration. We found an asymptotic solution to the problem under the assumption of slow regulation. The solution provides a full account of the regulation in the case of correlated or anticorrelated changes of the maximal conductances of the calcium and potassium currents. In particular, the solution shows how the target and parameters of the regulation determine which perturbations of the conductances can be compensated by the ADHR. In some cases, the sets of compensated initial perturbations are not convex. On the basis of our analysis we formulated specific questions for subsequent experimental and theoretical studies of ADHR.

40|$|AbstractHomeostatic {{mechanisms}} {{are essential for}} the protection and adaptation of organisms in a changing and challenging environment. Previously, we have described molecular mechanisms that lead to robust homeostasis/adaptation under inflow or outflow perturbations. Here we report that harmonic oscillations occur in <b>models</b> of such <b>homeostatic</b> controllers and that a close relationship exists between {{the control of the}} p 53 /Mdm 2 system and that of a homeostatic inflow controller. This <b>homeostatic</b> control <b>model</b> of the p 53 system provides an explanation why large fluctuations in the amplitude of p 53 /Mdm 2 oscillations may arise as part of the homeostatic regulation of p 53 by Mdm 2 under DNA-damaging conditions. In the presence of DNA damage p 53 is upregulated, but is subject to a tight control by Mdm 2 and other factors to avoid a premature apoptotic response of the cell at low DNA damage levels. One of the regulatory steps is the Mdm 2 -mediated degradation of p 53 by the proteasome. Oscillations in the p 53 /Mdm 2 system are considered {{to be part of a}} mechanism by which a cell decides between cell cycle arrest/DNA repair and apoptosis. In the <b>homeostatic</b> inflow control <b>model,</b> harmonic oscillations in p 53 /Mdm 2 levels arise when the binding strength of p 53 to degradation complexes increases. Due to the harmonic character of the oscillations rapid fluctuating noise can lead, as experimentally observed, to large variations in the amplitude of the oscillation but not in their period, a behavior which has been difficult to simulate by deterministic limit-cycle models. In conclusion, the oscillatory response of homeostatic controllers may provide new insights into the origin and role of oscillations observed in homeostatically controlled molecular networks...|$|R

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the extent to which insulin {{resistance}} and beta cell dysfunction account for differences in impaired fasting blood glucose (IFBG) levels in sub-Saharan African individuals living in different locations in Europe and Africa. We also aimed to identify determinants associated with insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction among this population. METHODS: Data from the cross-sectional multicentre Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study were analysed. Participants included Ghanaian individuals without diabetes, aged 18 - 96 years old, who were residing in Amsterdam (n[*]=[*] 1337), Berlin (n[*]=[*] 502), London (n[*]=[*] 961), urban Ghana (n[*]=[*] 1309) and rural Ghana (n[*]=[*] 970). Glucose and insulin were measured in fasting venous blood samples. Anthropometrics were assessed during a physical examination. Questionnaires were used to assess demographics, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption and energy intake. Insulin resistance and beta cell function were determined using <b>homeostatic</b> <b>modelling</b> (HOMA-IR and HOMA-B, respectively). Logistic regression analysis was used to study the contribution of HOMA-IR and inverse HOMA-B (beta cell dysfunction) to geographical differences in IFBG (fasting glucose 5. 6 - 6. 9 mmol/l). Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to identify determinants associated with HOMA-IR and inverse HOMA-B. RESULTS: IFBG was more common in individuals residing in urban Ghana (OR 1. 41 [95 % CI 1. 08, 1. 84]), Amsterdam (OR 3. 44 [95 % CI 2. 69, 4. 39]) and London (OR 1. 58 [95 % CI 1. 20 2. 08), but similar in individuals living in Berlin (OR 1. 00 [95 % CI 0. 70, 1. 45]), compared with those in rural Ghana (reference population). The attributable risk of IFBG per 1 SD increase in HOMA-IR was 69. 3 % and in inverse HOMA-B was 11. 1 %. After adjustment for HOMA-IR, the odds for IFBG reduced to 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 72, 1. 27), 2. 52 (95 %CI 1. 94, 3. 26) and 1. 02 (95 % CI 0. 78, 1. 38) for individuals in Urban Ghana, Amsterdam and London compared with rural Ghana, respectively. In contrast, adjustment for inverse HOMA-B had very minor impact on the ORs of IFBG. In multivariate analyses, BMI (β[*]=[*] 0. 17 [95 % CI 0. 11, 0. 24]) and waist circumference (β[*]=[*] 0. 29 [95 %CI 0. 22, 0. 36]) were most strongly associated with higher HOMA-IR, whereas inverse HOMA-B was most strongly associated with age (β[*]=[*] 0. 20 [95 % CI 0. 16, 0. 23]) and excess alcohol consumption (β[*]=[*] 0. 25 [95 % CI 0. 07, 0. 43]).

It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that insulin resistance {{plays a role}} in the development of the loss of skeletal muscle; however, no cohort studies on insulin resistance and low relative appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) have been published to date.

The loss of ASM in the low relative ASM and normal groups was – 1. 8 kg and – 0. 35 kg, respectively (p ≤. 05). The low relative ASM group was older and had higher insulin and <b>homeostatic</b> <b>model</b> assessment of insulin resistance values at baseline. The risk of developing low relative ASM at 4. 6 -year follow-up was 2. 9 times higher (95 % CI, 1. 00 – 7. 8; p =. 04) among the participants with <b>homeostatic</b> <b>model</b> assessment of insulin resistance levels more tha...|$|E

40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article by Tjønna et al 1 that addressed the efficacy of different modes of exercise training to reverse features of the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syn-drome, considered an ailment of the 20 th century, consists of a clustering of risk factors, with insulin resistance still viewed as the common pathophysiological pathway. 2 We were intrigued {{by the fact that}} in patients with the metabolic syndrome, aerobic interval training substantially improved insulin sensitivity (<b>homeostatic</b> <b>model</b> assessment score increasing from 62. 28. 0 % to 77. 24. 9 %), whereas continuous moderate exercise seemed to decrease insulin sensitivity (64. 45. 7 % versus 50. 24. 9 % before and after training, respectively). It {{should be noted that the}} <b>homeostatic</b> <b>model</b> assess-ment score as a derivate index for insulin sensitivity has clear limitations. 3 The gold standard for measuring insulin sensitivity is the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, with the frequently sample...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{show that}} {{psychiatric}} disorders cannot be defined within an essentialist perspective – i. e. by means of necessary and sufficient properties. We introduce the <b>Homeostatic</b> Property Cluster <b>model</b> (HPC) which proves useful for addressing {{the question as to}} whether psychiatric disorders are continuous or discrete entities. From this discussion we find that psychiatric kinds are discrete. We then analyze the disease model – recognized in the medical field as an essentialist model – bringing attention to its limitations and raising objections to its applicability. Finally, we argue that the HPC model offers a good starting point for identifying and classifying psychiatric kinds, and show how it can provide a bridge between the rigidly discrete and rigidly continuous perspectives on kinds, bringing together aspects of both...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide a {{framework}} for ongoing analyses of the neuronal connections of the insular cortex of the macaque monkey using modern high-resolution methods, we examined its anatomical organization in serial coronal sections stained alternately with Nissl and Gallyas (myelin) techniques. We observed the same 15 distinct architectonic areas in 10 brains. Within the granular, dysgranular, and agranular regions described in prior studies, we identified 4, 4, and 7 distinct areas, respectively. Across brains, these areas have consistent architectonic characteristics, and in flat map reconstructions they display a consistent topological or neighborhood arrangement, despite variations in the size of individual areas between cases. The borders between areas are generally rather sharply defined. Some areas, in particular the dysgranular areas, appear to consistently contain subtle transitions that suggest possible sub-areas or modules within the well-delimited areas. The presence of a distinct granular area that straddles the fundus of the superior limiting sulcus over its entire posterior-to-anterior extent is consistent with the available evidence on interoceptive thalamo-cortical projections, and also with the tensile anchor theory of species-specific cortical gyrification. These observations are consonant with the <b>homeostatic</b> afferent <b>model</b> of processing in the primate insula, and they suggest that discrete modules within insular cortex provide the basis for its polymodal integration of all salient activity relevant to ongoing emotional behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{patterning}} of anatomical structures from specific cellular fields in developing organisms relies on organizing centers that instruct surrounding cells {{to modify their}} behavior, namely migration, proliferation, and differentiation. We discuss here how organizers can form in adult organisms, a process of utmost interest for regenerative medicine. Animals like Hydra and planarians, which maintain their shape and fitness thanks to a highly dynamic homeostasis, offer a useful paradigm to study adult organizers in steady-state conditions. Beside the <b>homeostatic</b> context, these <b>model</b> systems also offer the possibility to study how organizers form de novo from somatic adult tissues. Both extracellular matrix remodeling and caspase activation {{play a key role}} in this transition, acting as promoters of organizer formation in the vicinity of the wound. Their respective roles and the crosstalk between them just start to be deciphered...|$|R
