Some drugs such as paracetamol exhibit predictable dose-dependent liver damage while others such as isoniazid cause idiosyncratic and unpredictable reactions that vary among individuals.

40|$|The role of RhoA in {{promoting}} <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration has been complicated by {{studies showing that}} it is activated both {{in the front and}} the rear of migrating cells. We report here that the RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Syx is required for the polarity of actively migrating brain and breast tumor cells. This function of Syx is mediated by the selective activation of the RhoA downstream effector Dia 1, the subsequent reorganization of microtubules, and the downregulation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers. The data argue that <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration requires the precise spatiotemporal regulation of Dia 1 and ROCK activities in the cell. The recruitment of Syx to the cell membrane and the subsequent selective activation of Dia 1 signal-ing, coupled with the suppression of ROCK and activation of cofilin-mediated actin reorganization, {{plays a key role in}} establish-ing <b>cell</b> polarity during <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration. Rho GTPases (including RhoA, Rac 1, and Cdc 42) are key me-diators of cytoskeletal dynamics (1). In concert with adhesion receptors and polarity complexes, Rho GTPases regulate apico-basal polarity and epithelial cell adhesion, or front-end polarity and <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration (2 – 4). Rac 1 and Cdc 42 activities are associated with actin reorganization and membrane protrusion at the leading cell edge, promoting either <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration or cell-cell contact (1, 2, 4, 5).

40|$|<b>Directed</b> <b>cell</b> {{migration}} {{is critical for}} numerous physiological processes including development and wound healing. However chemotaxis is also exploited during cancer progression. Recent reports have suggested links between vesicle trafficking pathways and <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration. Very {{little is known about}} the potential roles of endocytosis pathways during metastasis. Therefore we performed a series of studies employ-ing a previously characterised model for chemotactic invasion of can-cer cells to assess specific hypotheses potentially linking endocytosis to <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration. Our results demonstrate that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is indispensable for epidermal growth factor (EGF) directed chemotactic invasion of MDA-MB- 231 cells. Conversely, caveolar endo-cytosis is not required in this mode of migration. We further found that chemoattractant receptor (EGFR) trafficking occurs by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and is polarised towards the front of migrating cells. How-ever, we found no role for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in focal adhe-sion disassembly in this migration model. Thus, this study has char-acterised the role of endocytosis during chemotactic invasion and has identified functions mechanistically linking clathrin-mediated endocyto-sis to <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> motility...|$|R
40|$|<b>Directed</b> <b>cell</b> {{migration}} plays {{a principal}} role in {{various aspects of}} important cellular phenomena such as wound healing, development and cancer metastasis. Although the mechanism of gradient stimulus leading to <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration is well understood and exploited, the geometrical and topographical cues that cause directed migration has been largely unexplored. With the advent of accessible microfabrication techniques to precisely control the topography of the extracellular matrix (ECM) on substrates, researchers {{are just starting to}} study the complex mechanical signals that can alter <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> motility. A key challenge now is to parse out the precise factors that affect directional movement of cells on certain micropatterns, use that understanding to design strategies to enhance the motility and bias of <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration, and further apply these concepts to multiple cell types and higher-order cell systems. Here, we investigate the tunability of directional bias through various geometrical manipulations using quantitative analysis of cell movement on micropatterns. We observe that MCF- 10 A epithelial cells in general jump with an unnaturally high bias between teardrop-based islands with specific gap distance, asymmetry and positional placement. Throughout the studies, we observe that lamellipodial protrusions and unilamellar morphology {{play a crucial role in}} dictating not only the directional bias of epithelial cells, but also their speed and persistence, and find that moderate alteration of Rac 1 signal leads to an unexpected flip of bias. We further extend the concept of directional bias to design patterns to successfully control cell flux and effectively partition cell population, as well as induce unilamellar morphology in different cell types to promote <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> motility. We also investigate the combinatorial effect of hybrid micropatterns in enhancing motility and unravel the unique properties and possible mechanisms behind <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> motility on teardrop-based micropatterns. Our results demonstrate a new type of <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> motility using a micropattern that involves the use of physical constraints to stabilize the unilamellar morphology and guidance of the unilamella in the correct direction through purely geometrical cues. These studies offer multiple design strategies to modulate the cell motility and directional bias on micropatterns for various applications, such as tissue engineering. ...|$|R

40|$|During animal development, organ size is {{determined}} {{primarily by the}} amount of cell proliferation, which must be tightly regulated to ensure the generation of properly proportioned organs. However, {{little is known about the}} molecular pathways that <b>direct</b> <b>cells</b> to stop proliferating when an organ has attained its proper size. We have identified mutations in a novel gene, shar-pei, that is required for proper termination of cell proliferation during Drosophila imaginal disc development. Clones of shar-pei mutant cells in imaginal discs produce enlarged tissues containing more cells of normal size. We show that this phenotype is the result of both increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Hence, shar-pei restricts cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis. By contrast, shar-pei is not required for cell differentiation and pattern formation of adult tissue. Shar-pei is also not required for cell cycle exit during terminal differentiation, indicating that the mechanisms <b>directing</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation arrest during organ growth are distinct from those <b>directing</b> <b>cell</b> cycle exit during terminal differentiation. shar-pei encodes a WW-domain-containing protein that has homologs in worms, mice and humans, suggesting that mechanisms of organ growth control are evolutionarily conserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Directed</b> <b>cell</b> {{migration}} often {{occurs when}} individual cells move {{in response to}} an external chemical stimulus. Cells can respond by moving in either the direction of increasing (chemoattraction) or decreasing (chemorepulsion) concentration. Many previous models of <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration use a lattice-based framework where agents undergo a lattice-based random walk and the direction of nearest-neighbour motility events is biased in a preferred direction. Such lattice-based models can lead to unrealistic configurations of agents, since the agents always move on an artificial lattice structure which is never observed experimentally. We present a lattice-free model of <b>directed</b> <b>cell</b> migration that incorporates two key features. First, agents move on a continuous domain, with the possibility that there is some preferred direction of motion. Second, to be consistent with experimental observations, we enforce a crowding mechanism so that motility events that would lead to agent overlap are not permitted. We compare simulation data from the new lattice-free model with a more traditional lattice-based model. To provide additional insight into the lattice-free model, we construct an approximate conservation statement which corresponds to a nonlinear advection–diffusion equation in the continuum limit. The solution of this mean-field model compares well with averaged data from the individual-based model...|$|R
