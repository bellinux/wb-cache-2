5000|$|During {{the years}} 1974 to 1978 the floodings were more {{intensive}} than normal and <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> <b>cropping</b> was not possible, so that severe food and fodder shortages occurred. In response, the Molapo Development Project was initiated. It protected the molapo's with bunds {{to control the}} flooding and prevent severe flooding. The bunds are provided with sluice gates so that the stored water can be released and <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> <b>cropping</b> can start.|$|R
50|$|In many {{developing}} countries the savanna and forest ecology of the floodplains depend on seasonal flooding from rivers. Also, <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> <b>cropping</b> is practiced extensively whereby the land is cultivated {{taking advantage of the}} residual soil moisture after floods recede. Dams attenuate floods which may affect the ecology and agriculture seriously.|$|R

The plant would increase installed capacity in Niger from 240 Megawatt (MW) in 2007 to 370 MW (+55%).

50|$|Although it {{is a large}} country, most of Mauritania is desert. In {{the late}} 1980s, arable land was scarce, and, except for some oases, crop {{production}} was limited to a narrow band along the southern borders with Senegal and Mali. Farmers practiced four types of agriculture: rain-fed dryland <b>cropping,</b> called dieri; <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> <b>cropping</b> along the Senegal River and its seasonal tributaries, called oualo; oasis cultivation, the least important; and modern irrigated agriculture.|$|R
50|$|The central zone, or the sahelian zone, {{comprises}} {{the area with}} average annual rainfall of between 350 and 800 millimeters. The minimum rainfall needed for berebere, is 350 millimeters. The western area of the zone {{is dominated by the}} Chari and Logone rivers, which flow north from their sources in southern Chad and neighboring countries (see fig. 3). The courses of these rivers, joining at N'Djamena to flow on to Lake Chad, create an ecological subregion. Fishing is important for the peoples along the rivers and along the shores of Lake Chad. <b>Flood</b> <b>recession</b> <b>cropping</b> is practiced along the edges of the riverbeds and lakeshore, areas that have held the most promise for irrigation in the zone. International donor attention focused on this potential beginning in the mid-1960s. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} the traditional construction of polders (see Glossary) along the shores of Lake Chad. Land reclaimed by the use of such methods is extremely fertile. Chad's only wheat crop is cultivated in these polders.|$|R
50|$|In {{the rest}} of the sahelian zone, the hardier {{varieties}} of millet, along with peanuts and dry beans, are grown. Crop yields are far lower than they are in the south or near rivers and lakes. Farmers take every advantage of seasonal <b>flooding</b> to grow <b>recession</b> <b>crops</b> before the waters dry away, a practice particularly popular around Lake Fitri. The sahelian zone is ideal for pasturage. Herding includes large cattle herds for commercial sale, and goats, sheep, donkeys, and some horses are common in all villages.|$|R
40|$|In the Senegal river floodplain, {{irrigated}} agriculture and traditional <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> <b>crops</b> (mainly sorghum) coexist. The latter {{depends upon the}} extent of the annual flood, which is partly a function of the amount of water released from the upstream Manantali reservoir. Even though recession sorghum yield is clearly smaller than that of irrigated rice, this production system, because it covers a large area, is a major contributor to total food production in Podor and Matam departments. It is therefore important to quantify areas and yields. In collaboration with the West Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA) and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), SAED has carried out a survey of the 2000 - 2001 agricultural campaign based on remote sensing and GIS analysis. In 2000, inundations in the Podor department covered 37. 635 hectares. 3. 277 million m 3 of water were released from the Manantali reservoir specifically to support the natural flooding due to uncontrolled tributaries of the Senegal river. However, over the entire rainy season, the inflow into the reservoir exceeded the water released from it. In the Podor department, 18. 998 hectares were cultivated, corresponding to 51 % of the inundated area. In total, in both departments, the total area under sorghum cultivation amounted to 25. 745 hectares in 2000 - 2001, that is only 44 % of the area of the previous season, particularly wet. The total production of recession sorghum grain in the Matam department is about 4. 075 tons and the average yield 638 kg/hectare. The method used gives reliable results, particularly a good relationship between yield and spectral response. It requires not more than 3 weeks of fieldwork but timing is crucial. Coupled with SAED?s Geographic Information System (GIS) and complementary to the survey of rice production using remote sensing analysis, this work provides a more accurate estimation of food production at the level of each Rural Community. It also provides objective information to assess the mutual influence of recession sorghum and irrigated rice cropping systems...|$|R
30|$|Data were {{collected}} on <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> and rain-fed agriculture at the seven case study wetlands. Sorghum is the main cereal grown in <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> conditions while both millet and sorghum are grown in rain-fed fields. Only production from <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture is used to value production from the wetland depression, since rain-fed farming {{does not depend on}} the wetland resource. Data on vegetable production are also included as the activity is dependent on the wells associated with shallow aquifers in wetland depressions.|$|R

30|$|This {{study has}} {{demonstrated}} that cultivation frequency influenced weed species composition and diversity in <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> farming areas of the Okavango Delta. Frequently cultivated molapo fields were dominated by weed species. Uncropped sites were composed of wetland species that tolerate some dry periods or seasonal flood plains. Findings from this study contribute towards development of weed management strategies in <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> farming.|$|R
40|$|This review {{describes}} {{a range of}} physical and socio-economic scientific methods and field activities that will be implemented in a proposed research project to develop {{a better understanding of}} the extent and patterns of flooding and the potential of flood-recession agriculture. These activities will allow the hydrological characteristics of the river to be matched to crop-livestock systems of <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture that are well suited to the study communities and their organizational and institutional frameworks in order to support sustainable growth of such systems. This detailed study will provide recommendations on the technical, economic, institutional and policy measures needed to achieve sustainable intensification of <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture in northern Ghana, while complementing efforts undertaken to promote other types of water management systems. Options for out-scaling of <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture beyond the study area to other suitable areas will also be explored. The expectation is that the proposed project will improve food security by enhancing knowledge on effective <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> practices, enhance rural incomes through expanded dry-season farming with new opportunities for rural employment, and improve adaptation to climate change by building more resilient farming communities. To achieve these expected outcomes, proactive policies that clearly identify <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture as an alternative farming practice and provide institutional mandates to irrigation support services to promote it through training, demonstration, and outreach programs will be equally valuable.

50|$|The dam {{has proved}} {{controversial}} for its displacement of 10,000 {{people from the}} flooded area, and for its environmental and health-related impacts. In the irrigated areas the incidence of water-borne diseases such as bilharzia increased substantially, while local fisheries declined sharply. The annual flood of the Senegal river had been the basis of <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture, fishing, and cattle grazing. With the Manantali dam, the annual flood {{has been reduced to}} an artificial two-week flood. Traditionally, the Senegal river inundated about 150,000 hectares on average, and up to 350,000 hectares in high-flow years. In 1999,this was expected to be reduced to between 30,000 and 50,000 hectares in an average year, and much less in a dry year. It has been estimated that about 370,000 people had lived from <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture in the Senegal river valley before the dam was built. <b>Flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture has now completely disappeared. Only a small share of the farmers affected was compensated with land irrigated from the Manantali reservoir.|$|R
40|$|Ecosystems {{characterized}} by brackish waters are favorable {{for the development}} of An. melas during dry season and of An. gambiae during the rainy season. A longitudinal entomological monitoring was conducted in Aguégués, a fluvial, lagoon, coastal and lacustrine commune of Benin from January to December 2010. It was to identify the vectors responsible for malaria and to study the vector transmission by the capture of mosquitoes on human volunteers inside and outside the rooms. 4 capture sessions were conducted each month by six internal catchers and six outside catchers, 48 men nights per month or 576 men nights during the whole study. About 10, 800 mosquitoes captured, we counted 6734 An. melas and 4066 An. gambiae. The composition varies according to during flood periods or <b>flood</b> <b>recession.</b> An. melas represents 90. 46 % in <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> and An. gambiae 8. 54 %.

30|$|The highest earning {{wetlands}} {{in terms}} of arable production are Leweija and Sawana, although Sawana’s revenue fell from over 52 million UM in 1999 / 2000 to zero in 2000 / 2001 (due {{to the lack of}} rainfall at the site), clearly demonstrating the importance of diversifying revenue-creating activities (Table  3). The lowest earners in 1999 / 2000 were Tali, Chlim and Boichiche, with attention in Tali being turned to rain-fed agriculture due to extensive and prolonged flooding, while Chlim and Boichiche depended equally on rain-fed and <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture as sources of revenue. Chlim, Sawana and Tali had zero revenue from agriculture in 2000 / 2001 (again {{due to a lack of}} rainfall) indicating the unreliability of <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture as a single livelihood strategy.|$|R

30|$|Previous {{studies in}} the Okavango Delta such as Tsheboeng et al. (2014), Murray-Hudson et al. (2006), McCarthy et al. (2005), Bonyongo (1999) and Ellery et al. (1993) have {{demonstrated}} that vegetation communities are influenced by flood duration, depth and frequency. In <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> farming areas of the Okavango Delta, weed species composition and diversity {{were found to be}} influenced by frequency of cultivation, suggesting that cultivation frequency can be an important driver of weed species assemblages in <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> farming. Species diversity decreased with increasing frequency of cultivation while species evenness was not affected. This was probably due to cultivation over the years that might have stimulated germination of weed seeds from the seed bank resulting in a decrease in the seed bank especially when there is no seed rain to replenish the seed bank. In support of this assertion, Froud-Williams et al. (1983) stated that non-dominant buried seeds will be brought to the soil surface and germinate upon cultivation.|$|R
40|$|Streams are {{naturally}} dynamic, adjusting their form {{in response to}} changes in natural processes and human activity. Streambank mass movements (slumps) that affect human utilities such as land-use and infrastructure may occur {{as part of the}} natural stream processes, or may be accelerated by flow regulation or encroachment on the stream. Slumping commonly occurs when the subsurface water levels in the bank remain above the falling water levels in the stream. This condition is referred to as 'rapid drawdown', and typically develops when alluvial stream banks, saturated prior to or during flood inundation, are subject to a rapid <b>recession</b> of <b>flood</b> water levels. Rock revetment has been used traditionally in the treatment of bank slumps in order to surcharge the bank as well as to prevent fluvial erosion. Alternative treatments, incorporating subsurface drainage have been used successfully in north Queeensland, Australia, but {{more needs to be done}} to fully understand the attributes and mechanisms associated with slumping and to identify performance characteristics of existing drainage treatments. This study will provide practitioners with a better understanding of slumping and improved treatment methods. Subsurface water conditions affecting streambank slumping are a function of stratigraphy, local rainfall, <b>flood</b> infiltration, <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> and regional water table levels. Pressure, moisture and raingauge instrumentation were installed at a streambank case study site on the Herbert River Anabranch in tropical north Queensland, to monitor subsurface water response to river flooding, site rainfall and regional water table heights. Monitoring results show bank stratigraphy and drainage treatments affect flood infiltration and regional water table inundation of the bank. Furthermore, subsurface water levels within the bank remain elevated during rapid <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> and continue to be elevated until the regional water table has fallen. Modelling of various streambank and artificial drainage configurations has confirmed the response of subsurface water levels and seepage face progression to <b>flood</b> <b>recession,</b> has demonstrated that subsurface drainage lowers elevated water levels, and identified slumping thresholds associated with typical <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> rates and bank permeabilities. This research provides an understanding of the attributes and mechanisms of slumping in tropical streams, illustrates the performance of subsurface drainage, and will lead to techniques for better management of slump failures...|$|R
40|$|The Okavango Delta {{is subject}} to annual and inter-annual {{inundation}} of varying magnitude. The inundation impacts on livelihoods of communities reliant upon the Delta for subsistence. One such livelihood option is <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> (molapo) farming. <b>Flood</b> <b>recession</b> farming contributes substantially to rural livelihoods, however communities are faced with many challenges, particularly the unpredictability and unreliability of flooding. The study sought to determine the spatial and temporal variation in flooding that {{has occurred in the}} floodplains. Nine Landsat images were analysed. The analysis covered the period 1989 to 2008, it focused on three flood seasons each 10 years apart. The study took place in three villages on the peripheries of the Delta. Results show that the three study villages not only have very different floodplain lands available, but they also show different flooding patterns. The implication of this is that for both farmers and planners, {{it is not possible to}} have a single, blanket response to Delta flood inflows. Research outputs need to be communicated at the village level so that people can better accommodate the variation experienced where they live...|$|R

40|$|Historically, Malawi has {{depended}} on rain-fed agricultural systems. It is {{reported that the}} frequent droughts and unreliable rainfall since early 1990 s have caused many small-scale farmers {{to turn to the}} wetlands as alternative sites for crop production. There they use low-cost farming methods and various forms of ‘informal’ irrigation. This study, to better understand the water management practices and the socioeconomic characteristics of the wetland farmers, was carried out in the Shire Valley, at the southern tip of Malawi. This covers about 600, 000 ha and supports around 250, 000 farming families. More than half is wetland, characterized by a network of small streams, rivers, and swamps, and a mosaic of many very small farms separated by bush. Phase I mainly documented the agriculture technologies and socioeconomic characteristics of wetland farming and small-scale informal irrigation systems. 200 farmers and other key informants were interviewed. Phase II aimed to define and measure the benefits of the current systems. The major farming systems groups were identified using cluster analysis and focus group discussions were carried out with 7 to 10 members of each. The results were assessed using gross margin analysis. The results show that <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture, river diversion and treadle pumps were the commonest water management technologies among the farmers interviewed. Most preferred <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> and river diversion to treadle pump, citing capital requirements and running costs as major obstacles. However, the government and NGOs were promoting treadle pump technology (mostly) and river diversion, but not recession agriculture. Motorized pumps, introduced under various schemes, were no longer in use due to farmers’ inability to meet fuel costs and repairs. Farmer access to land was largely under the control of individual farmers who pass on ownership to their children under traditional custom. This finding is contrary to the documented land policy which describes chiefs as custodians of the land. Many farmers viewed group farming as a surrender of their land ownership rights. However, team work was seen to be common in river diversion technologies where a committee was usually chosen to manage a main canal traversing several farms. Even under these circumstances, farmers still preferred to manage their plots individually. The economic analysis showed low farmer-benefits, except where <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture was used to grow sweet potatoes, although this receives no attention from government or NGOs. Among the problems were the farmers’ inability to afford inputs, promotion of unsuitable technologies, and government controlled market prices. The study found that the increased wetland use was partly a livelihood diversification strategy linked to droughts and the worsening of the economic situations caused by structural adjustments in the early 1990 s. This study encourages government or NGOs to promote the technologies that are acceptable to the farmers and seen to benefit them under the local socioeconomic conditions. Locally, these include <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture and small river diversions. Reducing production costs and increasing yields through more efficient water use and improved extension services should be encouraged, and subsidizing input costs and freeing market prices would also help.

50|$|The main {{economic}} activities of Central Africa are farming, herding and fishing. At least 40% {{of the rural}} population of northern and eastern Central Africa lives in poverty and routinely face chronic food shortages. Crop production based on rain is possible only in the southern belt. <b>Flood</b> <b>recession</b> agriculture is practiced around Lake Chad and in the riverine wetlands.Nomadic herders migrate with their animals into the grasslands of {{the northern part of}} the basin for a few weeks during each short rainy season, where they intensively graze the highly nutritious grasses. When the dry season starts they move back south, either to grazing lands around the lakes and floodplains, or to the savannas further to the south.|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{changes in}} {{land use and}} {{management}} practices can influence vegetation composition, especially weed flora in agro-ecosystems. Early studies by Kellman (1980) on geographic patterning in tropical weed communities and early secondary successions found that changing from shifting to intensive or permanent agriculture in the tropics eliminated many woody species {{and replaced them with}} aggressive herbaceous weed species. In <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> farming, plant species composition can be influenced by desiccation and/or reduced flooding. Handa et al. (2012) showed that facultative upland weeds completely dominated the drained cultivated sites as opposed to permanently inundated areas dominated by either obligate or facultative wetland species. Similarly, in the Okavango Delta, Setaria sphacelata was found to be more pronounced in areas subjected to shallow flooding (Bonyongo 1999) while Eleocharis dulcis and Leersia hexandra were found to be facultative wetland species as they were more tolerant to prolonged flooding (Tsheboeng et al. 2014). These studies were focused on the floodplains, and no vegetation studies to date have been done in molapo farming. Molapo farming includes intensive cultivation of the floodplains (Oosterbaan et al. 1987; Petermann 1989; Bendsen 2002; Mmopelwa 2011). It is practised along the edges of the river channels or seasonally flooded depressions on the fringes of the Okavango Delta (Bendsen 2002). Given that this farming system is an essential livelihood activity {{for the majority of the}} communities that reside along the Okavango Delta, it warrants that similar studies should also be conducted in molapo farming. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the influence of cultivation frequency on weed species composition and diversity in <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> farming in the Okavango Delta.|$|R
40|$|Major {{changes in}} estuarine water quality {{following}} flood events {{are influenced by}} the duration of floodwater-floodplain contact and the dynamics of floodwater recession as controlled by floodplain geomorphology. Episodic large-scale deoxygenation events causing mass mortality of benthic and aquatic biota can follow these events. This study examines the timing and sources of poor quality water entering a sub-tropical coastal estuary in eastern Australia following a flood event. The results have implications for targeted river and floodplain management to improve water quality. The Richmond River is a mature barrier estuary with a large floodplain to upper catchment ratio. The lower floodplain is characterised by extensive, well-developed natural levees grading into large backswamp basins. Prior to European modification of floodplain hydrology, these backswamp basins were semi-permanent wetlands and natural storage basins for floodwaters occluded from the main channel by the morphology of natural levee systems. Following a 1 : 10 year flood event, the Richmond River estuary was closed to commercial and recreational fishing due to a fish-kill event attributed to deoxygenation of 3 ̆e 30 km of the main channel. Floodwater samples were collected along the estuary for one month following the flood peak and aqueous geochemistry analysed. Upper catchment inflows to the estuary remained well-oxygenated during the event and therefore, were not the source of the deoxygenating water. The primary source of the deoxygenating waters during the <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> phase were the major mid-estuary backswamp basins identified by their unique anaerobic geochemical signature. Large constructed drains, which alter floodplain hydrology, dissect the natural levees bordering backswamp basins to allow floodwaters to drain from the backswamps into the main river channel at an enhanced rate. Whilst lower quality floodwaters were previously largely retained in backswamp basins during the <b>flood</b> <b>recession</b> phase, these waters are now exported to the main river channel causing declines in river health...|$|R
