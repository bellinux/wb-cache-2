5000|$|A {{retarder}} is {{a device}} used to augment or replace {{some of the}} functions of primary friction-based braking systems, usually on heavy vehicles. Retarders serve to slow vehicles, or maintain a steady speed while traveling down a hill, and help prevent the vehicle from [...] "running away" [...] by accelerating down the hill. They are not usually capable of bringing vehicles to a standstill, as their effectiveness diminishes as vehicle speed lowers. They are usually used as an additional [...] "assistance" [...] to slow vehicles, with the final braking done by a conventional <b>friction</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> As the friction brake will be used less, particularly at higher speeds, their service life is increased, and since in those vehicles the brakes are air-actuated helps to conserve air pressure too.|$|E

50|$|When {{the trains}} brake, the 3-phase motors act as {{generators}} and return electricity {{to the system}} rather than converting power to heat, as on a <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> The current that is produced is conducted back to the overhead lines.

50|$|A DC {{injection}} <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{can be used}} as {{an alternative}} to a <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> DC injection <b>brakes</b> only require a small module located with the other motor switchgear and/or drivers, mounted in a remote and convenient location, whereas a <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> must be mounted somewhere on the rotating <b>system.</b> <b>Friction</b> <b>brakes</b> eventually wear out with use and require replacement of braking components. DC brake modules do not have consumable parts and should not require maintenance. <b>Friction</b> <b>brakes</b> also require a method of actuation, requiring either a human operator or system controlled actuator, adding to the complexity of the <b>system.</b> A DC <b>brake</b> is easily integrated into the motor control circuitry.|$|R
40|$|All {{electric}} machines {{have two}} mechanical operations, motoring and braking. The nature of braking can be regenerative, where the kinetic {{energy of the}} rotor is converted into electricity and {{sent back to the}} power source or non-regenerative, where the source supplies electric power to provide braking. This thesis investigates several critical issues related to regenerative braking in both DC and AC electric machines, including the determination of boundaries in the torque-speed plane defining the regenerative braking capability region and the evaluation of operating points within that capability region that result in maximum regenerative braking recharge current. Electric machines are used in the powertrains of electric and hybrid-electric vehicles to provide motoring or braking torque in response to the driver's request and power management logic. Since such vehicles carry a limited amount of electrical energy on-board their energy storage systems (such as a battery pack), it is important to conserve as much electrical energy as possible in order to increase the range of travel. Therefore, the concept of regenerative braking is of importance for such vehicles since operating in this mode during a braking event sends power back to the energy storage system thereby replenishing its energy level. Since the electric machine assists the mechanical <b>friction</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> of the vehicle, it results in reduced wear on components within the mechanical friction brake system. As both mechanical friction braking and electric machine braking are used to provide the requested vehicle braking torque, braking strategies which relate to splitting of the braking command between the two braking mechanisms are discussed. The reduction in energy consumption of a test vehicle along different driving schedules while using different braking strategies is also studied.

50|$|Brake fade is {{not always}} due to overheating. Water between the {{friction}} surfaces and the drum {{can act as a}} lubricant and reduce braking efficiency. The water tends to stay until heated sufficiently to vaporize, at which point braking efficiency returns. All <b>friction</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion. Once that rate is reached, applying greater pedal pressure doesn't change it—in fact, the effects mentioned can substantially reduce it. Ultimately, this is what brake fade is, regardless of the mechanisms of its causes. Disc brakes are not immune to any of these processes, but they deal with heat and water more effectively than drums.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>friction</b> in <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> shows a complex dynamic dependence of friction and wear. Friction produces wear but wear affects the surface topography {{and by that}} the friction power itself. The wear in technical <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> causes a dynamic equilibrium of growth and destruction of surface structures on the brake pad, carrying the friction power. This interaction between friction and wear generates a new dynamic friction law, which describes the effects on friction, wear and temperature on different time scales. For very slow processes the friction law reduces to the classical form, describing only the velocity and heat dependence of friction. For unsteady processes the dynamic friction law is able to describe and explain even complex measured <b>friction</b> events in <b>brake</b> <b>systems.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Prediction of {{the surface}} {{temperature}} in <b>friction</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> is the main problem {{in the analysis of}} thermal dissipation and surface degradations such as wear, phase transformation, cracks, etc. The first difficulty of the thermal prediction is presented by the complex interactions between the thermal, mechanical and tribological behaviour. The second problem is due to the multiscale aspect, from the macroscopic response of the disc and brake pads (conduction, distortions, etc.) to local surface effects (surface roughness, wear debris, phase changes, etc.). This paper aims to propose a macrostructural model of the thermomechanical behaviour of the disc brake, taking into account the real three-dimensional geometry of the disc–pad couple. Contact surface variations, distortions and wear are taken into account. Real body geometry and thermoelastoplastic modelling of the disc material are specially introduced. Such a model aims to give predictions of the thermal gradients varying with time and of the thermomechanical response of the components. Predictions of the temperature distributions are compared with experimental measurements obtained by thermographs and thermocouples. Such a model seems to be a suitable base {{for the study of the}} thermal dissipation and the thermomechanical behaviour and for the introduction of local friction effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{presented}} {{thesis is}} a part of a funded project between Saab automotive and Chalmers University of Technology. Within the organization the project is known as ‘EVBB project’ which stands for; ‘Electric Vehicle Blended Braking’. A blended brake control merges a regenerative <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> with a <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> The aim is to get a better understanding regarding to what extent a regenerative <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> is capable of recovering energy and how it will affect vehicle stability and maneuverability. The variable torque and power limitations of the electric motor require a brake-by-wire system that can apply the remaining brake torque to fulfill the total brake torque demanded by the driver. Proper brake torque proportioning and the working area of the electric motor are visualized by means of brake force distribution plots. Simulations are performed for a mild parallel hybrid electric vehicle with a separate axle drive train. The drive train has a 30 [kW] electric motor mounted on the rear axle. A two track model with electric power train has been developed. The simulation results are based on this 7 DOF planar vehicle model, meaning that any pitch and roll motion of the vehicle body is excluded. The vehicle model has a closed-loop torque control, enabling velocity tracking of driving cycles. The control of lateral dynamics by means of the steering input is open-loop. A method of ‘non-linear tyre force estimation’ by means of look-up tables, based upon Pacejka’s Magic Formulas, has been used. Simulation results of two proposed control strategies show that rear wheel regenerative braking is effective. A control that initially biases the brake torque to the rear axle is able to recuperate 90 % of the brake energy on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Controlling the 30 [kW] regenerative <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> conforming to the ideal brake force distribution diminishes the power limitations of the electric motor. The strategy reduces the portion of regenerative brake torque but might recuperate more energy during extra urban use...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{trains are}} {{equipped}} with different <b>braking</b> <b>systems,</b> between which the braking effort can be distributed. Among these, tread braking {{is still the most}} common system for <b>friction</b> <b>braking.</b> Tread <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> are cheap and robust. However, extensive usage of tread brakes demands knowledge of operational limits to ensure safety and decrease life cycle costs (LCC) of the running gear. In the present work, a state-of-the-art literature survey has been compiled which covers topics related to establishing operational limits such as: brake control and blended braking, braking temperatures, brake block materials, wear and rolling contact fatigue of wheels due to tread braking, and capacity of tread brakes and brake discs. A methodology to simulate full-scale brake rig tests, including wheel-rail contact, has been further developed. It includes an axisymmetric thermal analysis, a 3 D mechanical wheel-rail contact analysis, and a 3 D thermomechanical analysis of the braked wheel. The behaviour of ER 7 grade railway wheel material is mimicked by use of a plasticity model calibrated against results from cyclic experiments on test specimens. The results from the simulations in terms of predicted fatigue lives show good agreement with full-scale test rig results for three combinations of initial velocity and brake block material. The developed methodology is employed in parametric studies. These consist of braking load cases characterised by operational parameters such as axle load, maximum vehicle speed, deceleration, block material, and initial wheel temperature. Damage evolution in the wheel tread is studied. A strong infuence of high temperatures on rolling contact fatigue formation in the wheel tread was observed. In particular, braking temperatures over 450 °C can result in a very short life up to crack initiation. However, for braking temperatures in the range of 300 - 350 °C, wheel tread material is more resistant to fatigue due to strain hardening...|$|R

In this paper, the domain of attraction for the steady sliding equilibrium point ischaracterized for a system in which normal force is coupled to tangential displacement. Perturbations consisting of sudden changes in the position and velocity of the loading point are considered.

40|$|Modern hybrid {{electric}} vehicles employ electric braking to recuperate energy during deceleration. However, currently anti-lock <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> (ABS) functionality is delivered solely by <b>friction</b> <b>brakes.</b> Hence regenerative braking is typically deactivated {{at a low}} deceleration threshold in case high slip develops at the wheels and ABS activation is required.
