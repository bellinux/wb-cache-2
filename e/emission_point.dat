In a RICH detector, a cone of Cherenkov light is produced when a high speed charged particle traverses a suitable medium, often called radiator. This light cone is detected on a position sensitive planar photon detector, which allows reconstructing a ring or disc, the radius {{of which is a}} measure for the Cherenkov emission angle. Both focusing and proximity-focusing detectors are in use. In a focusing RICH detector, the photons are collected by a spherical mirror and focused onto the photon detector placed at the focal plane. The result is a circle with a radius independent of the <b>emission</b> <b>point</b> along the particle track. This scheme is suitable for low refractive index radiators—i.e. gases—due to the larger radiator length needed to create enough photons. In the more compact proximity-focusing design, a thin radiator volume emits a cone of Cherenkov light which traverses a small distance—the proximity gap—and is detected on the photon detector plane. The image is a ring of light, the radius of which is defined by the Cherenkov emission angle and the proximity gap. The ring thickness is determined by the thickness of the radiator. An example of a proximity gap RICH detector is the High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID), a detector currently under construction for ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), one of the six experiments at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) reporting programs contain provisions to avoid excessive reporting burdens on affected sources while ensuring maximum reporting of significant emissions. Some programs specify an overall reporting threshold that determines {{whether or not the}} facility or organization must submit a report. Regardless of the reporting threshold, a reporting facility in most cases will have <b>emission</b> <b>points</b> that are significant emitters of GHG and a number of <b>emission</b> <b>points</b> that are relatively minor emitters compared to total facility emissions. In some cases, monitoring of minor <b>emission</b> <b>points</b> can be burdensome or infeasible. As a result, many reporting programs are designed so that the same level of effort is not always required for estimating, documenting, and reporting emissions from minor <b>emission</b> <b>points</b> as for the larger sources. 1 These provisions sometimes are referred to as “de minimis ” reporting provisions.

40|$|Optogenetics {{is a novel}} {{method to}} control cells using light. This lightcontrol is {{accomplished}} through a genetic modification of the cells. Invivo neurophysiological research is increasingly using optogenetics, since it offers complementary capabilities to traditional electrophysiology. This has encouraged the development of implantable photonic devices {{that are able to}} optically interact with the genetically modified cells. The most basic and widely used device for this purpose is anoptical fiber. Despite its widespread use, this device is not suitable for performing complex experiments involving multiple <b>emission</b> <b>points</b> and electrical recording of neural activity. More complex devices have been engineered to address these limitations. Such devices are either hybrid assemblies of existing microfabricated neural probes with specificallytailored optical fibers or they are neural probes with few integrated optical waveguides. Both types allow combined electrical recording and optical emission. Although such photonic neural probes (optoprobes) perform well, they have a limited number of <b>emission</b> <b>points,</b> use bulky off-chip light sources such as laser or permit the emission of only one wavelength.
