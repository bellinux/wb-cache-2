5|$|The outer {{boundary}} of the heliosphere, the <b>heliopause,</b> is {{the point at which}} the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of interstellar space. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84AU from the Sun, respectively. Voyager 1 is reported to have crossed the <b>heliopause</b> in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|Turbulence {{and dynamic}} {{forces in the}} {{heliosphere}} cannot affect {{the shape of the}} solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfvén waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere, forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape, until it impacts the <b>heliopause</b> more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought {{to be part of the}} <b>heliopause.</b> In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the <b>heliopause</b> and entered the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 {{became the}} first {{spacecraft}} to cross the <b>heliopause</b> in August 2012, then {{at a distance of}} 121 AU from the Sun, although this was not confirmed for another year.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 2013, NASA officially {{confirmed}} that Voyager 1 {{had reached the}} interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed, with a generally accepted date of August 25, 2012, the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected. By this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause; {{a new model of}} the <b>heliopause</b> predicted that no such change would be found. A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the <b>heliopause</b> had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013, triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012 (electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the <b>heliopause</b> than within). Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012 provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because Voyager 1s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980. In September 2013, NASA released audio renditions of these plasma waves. The recordings represent the first sounds to be captured in interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|As Voyager 1 {{headed for}} {{interstellar}} space, its instruments continued {{to study the}} Solar System. Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists used the plasma wave experiments aboard Voyager 1 and 2 {{to look for the}} <b>heliopause,</b> the boundary at which the solar wind transitions into the interstellar medium. , the probe was moving with a relative velocity to the Sun of about 17030m/s.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{announced}} in June 2012 that the probe was detecting {{changes in the}} environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the <b>heliopause.</b> Voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space, which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the Sun. The craft thus began to enter the interstellar medium {{at the edge of}} the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Outer space, also simply called space, {{refers to}} the {{relatively}} empty regions of the universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies. Outer space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at {{what is known as}} the <b>heliopause.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and {{interstellar}} space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this <b>heliopause,</b> the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{size of the}} two outer CO shells remains elusive, {{preliminary}} estimates suggest that one shell extends from about 1.5 to 4.0 arcseconds and the other expands as far as 7.0 arcseconds. Assuming the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU as the star radius, the inner shell would extend roughly 50 to 150 stellar radii (~300 to 800AU) with the outer one as far as 250 stellar radii (~1400AU). The Sun's <b>heliopause</b> is estimated at about 100 AU, so {{the size of this}} outer shell would be almost fourteen {{times the size of the}} Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The solar wind, {{a stream}} of charged {{particles}} flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The <b>heliopause</b> is {{the point at which}} pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out {{to the edge of the}} scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the <b>heliopause</b> in the Solar System).|$|E
5|$|Within our Solar System, {{interplanetary space}} {{is filled with}} the plasma {{expelled}} via the solar wind, extending from the Sun's surface out to the <b>heliopause.</b> Furthermore, all the distant stars, and much of interstellar space or intergalactic space is also likely filled with plasma, albeit at very low densities. Astrophysical plasmas are also observed in Accretion disks around stars or compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes in close binary star systems. Plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets, which have been observed with accreting black holes or in active galaxies like M87's jet that possibly extends out to 5,000 light-years.|$|E
25|$|The main {{objective}} of the VIM is to extend {{the exploration of the}} Solar System beyond the outer planets to the outer limit and if possible even beyond. The Voyagers continue to search for the <b>heliopause</b> boundary which is the outer limit of the Sun's magnetic field. Passing through the <b>heliopause</b> boundary will allow the spacecraft to make measurements of the interstellar fields, particles and waves unaffected by the solar wind.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 2012, {{scientists}} at NASA reported that Voyager 1 {{was very close}} to entering interstellar space, indicated by a sharp rise in high-energy particles from outside the Solar System. In September 2013, NASA announced that Voyager 1 had crossed the <b>heliopause</b> on August25, 2012, making it the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space.|$|E
25|$|These {{medium wave}} {{emissions}} were modulated with {{a period of}} about , which was interpreted as Saturn's rotation period. Nevertheless, the evidence available in the 1970s was too inconclusive and some scientists thought that Saturn might lack a magnetic field altogether, while others even speculated that the planet could lie beyond the <b>heliopause.</b> The first definite detection of the saturnian magnetic field was made only on September 1, 1979, when it was passed through by the Pioneer 11 spacecraft, which measured its magnetic field strength directly.|$|E
25|$|The flux of {{incoming}} cosmic rays {{at the upper}} atmosphere {{is dependent on the}} solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field, and the energy of the cosmic rays. At distances of ~94AU from the Sun, the solar wind undergoes a transition, called the termination shock, from supersonic to subsonic speeds. The region between the termination shock and the <b>heliopause</b> acts as a barrier to cosmic rays, decreasing the flux at lower energies (≤1GeV) by about90%. However, the strength of the solar wind is not constant, and hence it has been observed that cosmic ray flux is correlated with solar activity.|$|E
500|$|Interplanetary space, {{the space}} around the Sun and planets of the Solar System, is the region {{dominated}} by the interplanetary medium, which extends out to the <b>heliopause</b> where {{the influence of the}} galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun. Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the heliosphere) for billions of kilometers into space. This wind has a particle density of 5–10 protons/cm3 and is moving at a velocity of [...] The distance and strength of the <b>heliopause</b> varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind. The discovery since 1995 of extrasolar planets means that other stars must possess their own interplanetary media.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to a lack}} of data, {{conditions}} in local interstellar space are not known for certain. It is expected that NASA's Voyager spacecraft, as they pass the <b>heliopause,</b> will transmit valuable data on radiation levels and solar wind to Earth. How well the heliosphere shields the Solar System from cosmic rays is poorly understood. A NASA-funded team has developed a concept of a [...] "Vision Mission" [...] dedicated to sending a probe to the heliosphere.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} {{its primary}} mission with the flyby of Saturn on November 20, 1980, Voyager 1 became {{the third of}} five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity {{that will allow them}} to leave the Solar System. [...] It is pursuing an extended mission to explore the regions and boundaries of the outer heliosphere. On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 crossed the <b>heliopause</b> to become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space and study the interstellar medium.|$|E
500|$|The {{shape and}} {{form of the}} outer edge of the {{heliosphere}} is likely affected by the fluid dynamics of interactions with the interstellar medium as well as solar magnetic fields prevailing to the south, e.g. it is bluntly shaped with the northern hemisphere extending 9AU farther than the southern hemisphere. Beyond the <b>heliopause,</b> at around 230 AU, lies the bow shock, a plasma [...] "wake" [...] left by the Sun as it travels through the Milky Way.|$|E
500|$|A {{solar wind}} of plasma {{particles}} constantly streams {{outward from the}} Sun until, at the outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the <b>heliopause.</b> As the solar wind passes the Earth, it interacts with the Earth's magnetic field (magnetosphere) and deflects the solar wind, but traps some creating the Van Allen radiation belts that envelop the Earth [...] The aurora are created when solar wind particles are guided by the magnetic flux lines into the Earth's polar regions where the lines the descend into the atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|Space is {{a partial}} vacuum: its {{different}} regions {{are defined by}} the various atmospheres and [...] "winds" [...] that dominate within them, and extend to {{the point at which}} those winds give way to those beyond. Geospace extends from Earth's atmosphere to the outer reaches of Earth's magnetic field, whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space. Interplanetary space extends to the <b>heliopause,</b> whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the interstellar medium. Interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy, where it fades into the intergalactic void.|$|E
500|$|In late 2012, {{researchers}} reported that particle {{data from the}} spacecraft suggested that the probe had passed through the <b>heliopause.</b> Measurements from the spacecraft revealed a steady rise since May in collisions with high energy particles (above 70 MeV), which {{are thought to be}} cosmic rays emanating from supernova explosions far beyond the Solar System, with a sharp increase in these collisions in late August. At the same time, in late August, there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low-energy particles, which are thought to originate from the Sun. Ed Roelof, space scientist at Johns Hopkins University and principal investigator for the Low-Energy Charged Particle instrument on the spacecraft declared that [...] "Most scientists involved with Voyager 1 would agree that [...] have been sufficiently satisfied." [...] However, the last criterion for officially declaring that Voyager 1 had crossed the boundary, the expected change in magnetic field direction (from that of the Sun to that of the interstellar field beyond), had not been observed (the field had changed direction by only 2 degrees), which suggested to some that the nature of the edge of the heliosphere had been misjudged. On December 3, 2012, Voyager project scientist Ed Stone of the California Institute of Technology said, [...] "Voyager has discovered a new region of the heliosphere that we had not realized was there. We're still inside, apparently. But the magnetic field now is connected to the outside. So it's like a highway letting particles in and out." [...] The magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than Voyager 1 encountered before the termination shock. It was expected to be the last barrier before the spacecraft exited the Solar System completely and entered interstellar space.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interstellar}} medium begins where the interplanetary medium of the Solar System ends. The solar wind slows to subsonic velocities at the termination shock, 90—100 astronomical units from the Sun. In the region beyond the termination shock, called the heliosheath, interstellar matter {{interacts with the}} solar wind. Voyager 1, the farthest human-made object from the Earth (after 1998), crossed the termination shock December 16, 2004 and later entered interstellar space when it crossed the <b>heliopause</b> on August 25, 2012, providing the first direct probe of conditions in the ISM [...]|$|E
2500|$|Voyager 1 {{completed}} {{the phase of}} termination shock in December 2004 {{at a distance of}} 94 AU while Voyager 2 completed it in August 2007 at a distance of [...] 84 AU. After entering into the heliosheath the spacecraft are in an area that is dominated by the Sun's magnetic field and solar wind particles. The thickness of the heliosheath is not known clearly so the time required to traverse this space is not quite clear. Scientists estimate this space to be tens of AU thick and that it could take several years to cross. After passing through the heliosheath the two Voyagers will begin the phase of interstellar exploration. The outer boundary of the heliosheath is called the <b>heliopause</b> which is where the spacecraft are headed now. This is the region where the Sun's influence begins to decrease and the interstellar space can be detected. The <b>heliopause</b> has never been reached by any spacecraft so far and the Voyagers may be the first spacecraft to reach it. Currently, Voyager 1 is escaping the solar system at the speed of 3.6 AU per year, while Voyager 2s speed is about 3.3 AU per year. The Voyager spacecraft will eventually go on to the stars. In about 40,000 years, Voyager 1 will be within 1.6 light years of AC+79 3888, which is a star in the constellation of Camelopardalis. In 40,000 years Voyager 2 will be within 1.7 light years from star Ross 248 and in 296,000 years it will pass within 4.6 light years of Sirius which is the brightest star in the night sky. The main objective of the Voyager Interstellar Mission is interstellar exploration.|$|E
5000|$|In theory, the <b>heliopause</b> causes {{turbulence}} in {{the interstellar}} medium as the sun orbits the Galactic Center. Outside the <b>heliopause,</b> would be a turbulent region caused by {{the pressure of the}} advancing <b>heliopause</b> against {{the interstellar medium}}. However, the velocity of Solar wind relative to the interstellar medium is probably too low for a bow shock.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{distance}} to, {{and shape}} of the <b>heliopause</b> is still uncertain. Interplanetary/interstellar spacecraft such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11 and Voyager 2 are traveling outward through the Solar System and will eventually pass through the <b>heliopause.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Heliopause</b> was {{released}} 17 October 2011.|$|E
50|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the <b>heliopause</b> could be smaller {{on the side of}} the Solar System facing the Sun's orbital motion through the galaxy. It may also vary depending on the current velocity of the solar wind and the local density of the interstellar medium. It is known to lie far outside the orbit of Neptune. The current mission of the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft is to find and study the termination shock, heliosheath, and <b>heliopause.</b> Meanwhile, the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission is attempting to image the <b>heliopause</b> from Earth orbit within two years of its 2008 launch. Initial results (October 2009) from IBEX suggest that previous assumptions are insufficiently cognisant of the true complexities of the <b>heliopause.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{outer edge}} of the Solar System is the {{boundary}} between the flow of the solar wind and the interstellar medium.
