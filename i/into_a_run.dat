5|$|To avoid a narrator, {{the serial}} delegates the novel's first ironic {{sentence}} to Elizabeth {{in an early}} scene. The adaptation opens {{with a view of}} Darcy's and Bingley's horses as they race across a field toward the Netherfield estate, expressing vitality; Elizabeth watches them before breaking <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>run.</b> While the novel indicates Elizabeth's independence and energy in her three-mile trek to Netherfield, the adaptation of this scene also shows her rebelliousness and love of nature.|$|E
25|$|Following the International break, Tottenham entered <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> of {{fixtures}} to {{test their}} early form, starting with the Champions Manchester United at White Hart Lane. Spurs made a fast start, with Jermain Defoe scoring an overhead kick within the first minute of the game. Manchester United, however, turned the game around, taking all three points thanks to goals from Ryan Giggs, Anderson and Wayne Rooney.|$|E
25|$|The crisis, which {{eventually}} became {{the catalyst for}} the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, almost developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> on money funds: the redemptions caused a drop in demand for commercial paper, preventing companies from rolling over their short-term debt, potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis: if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt, {{and do not have}} cash on hand to pay it back, they will default on their obligations, and may have to file for bankruptcy. Thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies, a debt deflation spiral, and serious damage to the real economy, as in the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|The next is the “low flight with {{sustained}} grip attack”, {{which is}} used for hunting ungulates. Here, the golden eagle flies over a herd of ungulates which in turn often huddle or break <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>run.</b> The eagle then selects it prey (typically young animals, though sometimes infirm or exceptionally healthy grown animals) and lands on prey's back or neck, talons gripping firmly, attempting to pierce vital organs or cause shock via a crushing grip to bone and cartilage. The hunting eagle typically rides its prey for several minutes with wings outstretched and flapping to maintain balance until the prey collapses, either as result of exhaustion, shock or internal injury.|$|E
25|$|The western {{defenses}} were {{pierced by}} two gates: the Lenba (the main gate) and a secondary one, {{closer to the}} beach. By that stage there were scarcely 300 Spaniards left, most of which had no fireams. Carleill ordered Sergeant-Major Powell to assault the secondary gate with a storming party, while the lieutenant-general led {{the rest of his}} men towards the Lenba. Both English columns broke <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> and charged at the push of pike. Following a mingled fierce hand-to-hand fight, the Spanish were swept on through both gates and then melted away, after which neither column met with any serious opposition. The stormers did not stop until the two English columns met in the Plaza.|$|E
25|$|The 1982–83 subcontinental season started {{well for}} Gavaskar on an {{individual}} note, as he made 155 in a one off Test against Sri Lanka in Madras. It was the first Test between the two nations, with Sri Lankan having only recently been awarded Test status. Despite this, India were unable to finish off their novice opponents, the draw heralding a start of a winless summer. India played in twelve Tests, losing five and drawing seven. The first series was a six Test tour to Pakistan. India started well enough, drawing the First Test in Lahore, with Gavaskar scoring 83. Pakistan then defeated India in three consecutive matches. In the Third Test in Faisalabad, Gavaskar managed an unbeaten 127 in the second innings to force Pakistan <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> chase, but the other two losses were substantial, both by an innings. Despite holding on for draws {{in the last two}} Tests, Gavaskar was replaced by Kapil Dev as captain after the 3–0 loss. Despite his team's difficulties, Gavaskar remained productive with 434 runs at 47.18 with a century and three half centuries. Gavaskar went on to the West Indies for a five Test tour purely as a batsman, but could not reproduce the form that he had shown in the Caribbean in 1971 and 1976. He managed only 240 runs at 30, as India were crushed 2–0 by the world champions. Apart from an unbeaten 147 in the drawn Third Test in Georgetown, Guyana, his next best effort was 32.|$|E

The tunnels that Martin is seen wandering within are located both in and around London St Pancras and King's Cross railway stations, and the filming for the video took place during the time of the redevelopment and expansion of London St Pancras International. Martin is then seen walking across Waterloo Bridge, which crosses the River Thames, connecting the Southbank with The Strand.

The audience sings along with the song's final refrain, and at the end of the video Martin thanks them for their support and wishes them goodnight.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>run,</b> and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Athenian {{line was}} ready, {{according}} to one source, the simple signal to advance was given by Miltiades: [...] "At them". Herodotus implies the Athenians ran the whole distance to the Persian lines, a feat {{under the weight of}} hoplite armory generally thought to be physically impossible. More likely, they marched until they reached the limit of the archers' effectiveness, the [...] "beaten zone" [...] (roughly 200 meters), and then broke <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> towards their enemy. Another possibility is that they ran up to the 200 meter-mark in broken ranks, and then reformed for the march into battle from there. [...] Herodotus suggests that {{this was the first time}} a Greek army ran into battle in this way; this was probably because it was the first time that a Greek army had faced an enemy composed primarily of missile troops. All this was evidently much to the surprise of the Persians; [...] "... in their minds they charged the Athenians with madness which must be fatal, seeing that they were few and yet were pressing forwards at a run, having neither cavalry nor archers". Indeed, based on their previous experience of the Greeks, the Persians might be excused for this; Herodotus tells us that the Athenians at Marathon were [...] "first to endure looking at Median dress and men wearing it, for up until then just hearing the name of the Medes caused the Hellenes to panic". Passing through the hail of arrows launched by the Persian army, protected for the most part by their armour, the Greek line finally made contact with the enemy army. The Athenian wings quickly routed the inferior Persian levies on the flanks, before turning inwards to surround the Persian centre, which had been more successful against the thin Greek centre. The battle ended when the Persian centre then broke in panic towards their ships, pursued by the Greeks. Some, unaware of the local terrain, ran towards the swamps where unknown numbers drowned. The Athenians pursued the Persians back to their ships, and managed to capture seven ships, though the majority were able to launch successfully. Herodotus recounts the story that Cynaegirus, brother of the playwright Aeschylus, who was also among the fighters, charged into the sea, grabbed one Persian trireme, and started pulling it towards shore. A member of the crew saw him, cut off his hand, and Cynaegirus died.|$|E

2500|$|On May 12, 1911, Cobb's play {{illustrated}} his {{combination of}} skill and cunning. Playing against the New York Highlanders, he scored from first base on a single to right field, then scored another run from second base on a wild pitch. In the seventh inning, he tied {{the game with a}} two-run double. The Highlanders catcher vehemently argued the safe call at second base with the umpire in question, going on at such length that the other Highlanders infielders gathered nearby to watch. Realizing that no one on the Highlanders had called time, Cobb strolled unobserved to third base, and then casually walked towards home plate as if {{to get a better view}} of the argument. He then suddenly broke <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> and slid into home plate for the eventual winning run.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} possible {{employment of}} volley fire for firearms occurred in late 14th century China during a military conflict between Ming and Mong Mao forces. Volley fire was also possibly implemented with firearms in 1414 during the Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols, and possibly again in another expedition in 1422. However {{the language used}} in these sources is unclear {{as to whether or}} not repeating fire was part of the technique implemented. For example, during the 1388 anti-insurrection war waged against the Mong Mao by the Ming general Mu Ying, the Ming troops equipped with guns and fire arrows were arrayed in three lines. The general Mu Ying explained this was so that [...] "when the elephants advance, the front line of guns and arrows will shoot all at once. If they do not retreat, the next line will continue this. If they still do not retreat, then the third line will continue this." [...] When the armored war elephants broke <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>run,</b> charging the Ming lines, the Ming forces stood their ground, [...] "shooting arrows and stones, the noise shaking the mountains and vallies. The elephants shook with fear and ran." [...] According to the Ming Shilu, half the elephants were killed while 37 were captured, and of the 100,000 strong insurrection force, at least 30,000 were killed, and 10,000 were captured. Andrade and other historians have interpreted this passage as evidence of volley fire, however he admits that it is ambiguous {{as to whether or not}} the Ming lines practiced repeated fire and reloading, so at best it can only be considered a limited form of volley fire.|$|E
