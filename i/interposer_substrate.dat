40|$|The {{applications}} of inertial sensors {{have a wide}} variety in terms of accuracy and costs. A new technology approach is joining higher sensor accuracy and lower production costs by using a new Interposer / sensor interconnect technology applied on 300 mm wafer diameter without changing the sensor element itself. The higher accuracy is mainly covered by a multiple point program: (1) stress less assembly due interface silicon Interposer to silicon MEMS; (2) better Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by polymer redistribution layer on the interposer (due to better wiring geometry and less parasitic capacities / inductivities); (3) reduction of mechanical stress by using flexible bar springs for mechanical decoupling of sensor and Interposer substrate; (4) additional stress reduction by using a polymer layer for mechanical decoupling of metal redistribution layer (RDL) and <b>Interposer</b> <b>substrate.</b> The cost efficiency even in small scale serial production based on: (1) 300 mm multi project wafer technology including warehouse ready system packaging; (2) a new MEMS contact technology, which gives technical benefit, smaller dimensions and simplifies the assembly of MEMS and ASIC (which are placed on a 2. 5 D-Interposer in order to enable a System In Package (SiP) {{as well as for}} higher sensor accuracy); (3) the flexible ASIC feature enables the integration of different MEMS with analogue signal output;(4) minor costs for integration of different sensors into the existing package. The heterogeneous 3 D integration is a key enabler and justifies the additional process steps (mainly TSV-processing, thin wafer handling) by implementing the advantages of the polymer RDL. This integration approach results leads to improved mechanical and electrical properties. This paper will give an overview about the current achievements in the SIMEIT-project, which are predestined to improve the accuracy of different MEMS-applications with analogue signal transfer to the ASIC as well as MEMSapplications with need of stress less integration...|$|E
40|$|Silicon interposers enable {{advanced}} package architectures {{through the}} integration of multiple die and passive components onto a single silicon substrate, while offering high interconnect density and low thermal expansion mismatch. This paper will describe the processing and characterization of copper-filled through silicon vias (TSVs) for Si interposers and related three-dimensional wafer-level packaging (3 D-WLP) applications. To evaluate potential reliability concerns, the thermomechanical behavior of Cu-filled TSVs was characterized experimentally over a range of TSV dimensions and also modeled using finite element analysis. The paper will include discussion of {{the correlation between the}} experimental observations and modeling data obtained for the TSV structures. Demonstrations of functional Si <b>interposer</b> <b>substrates</b> are also reported, based on three different design variations of TSV diameter and substrate thickness, respectively: 25 × 100 m, 50 × 200 m, and 80 × 300 m. Finally, alternative TSV structures, based on Cu-lined vias with polymer filled cores, are demonstrated as a possible approach to reducing the thermomechanical concerns for Cu-filled TSVs in Si interposer or 3 D-WLP substrates...|$|R
40|$|A new wafer level package {{has been}} {{designed}} and fabricated in which the entire package can be constructed at the wafer level using batch processing. Peripheral bondpads are redistributed from the die periphery to an area array using a redistribution metal of sputtered aluminum or electroplated copper and a redistribution dielectric. Redistribution of metal at the wafer level aids in eliminating {{the use of an}} <b>interposer,</b> or <b>substrate.</b> The redistributed bondpads are plated with the underbump metallurgy and then bumped using solder ball placement. The solder balls are reflowed onto the wafer creating a large standoff that improves reliability. This wafer level chip-scale package (WL-CSP) technology has been evaluated using a test vehicle, which has a 0. 5 mm pitch of an 8 x 8 array of bumps on a 5 x 5 mm 2 die. The bump structure and package geometry have been optimized using simulation and validated by experimentation. The board used for reliability testing is a 1. 2 mm thick, 2 -layer FR- 4 board with non-soldermask defined landpads with OSP (organic solderability preservative). The landpads are the same diameter as the redistributed bondpads. Package and board level reliability data will be presented...|$|R
