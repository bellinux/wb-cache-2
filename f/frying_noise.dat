40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{with the}} characteristics of the pulsative <b>frying</b> <b>noise</b> which is heard under the sea of coastal waters. The paper, also, describes a new method of observing the noise by the use of a digital counter. The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1. The spectrum of the <b>frying</b> <b>noise</b> showed a typical pattern. The maximum frequency was over the audible frequency range of man. The peak of the spectrum level was seen at the frequency of 16 KHz. 2. The spectrum of a snap produced by snapping shrimp was {{similar to that of the}} <b>frying</b> <b>noise.</b> The maximum frequency was about 50 KHz, showing a peak at the frepuency of 16 KHz. 3. By filtering the ambient noise with a band-pass-filter which had a pass frequency of 16 KHz, the number of pulses in the unit time were able to be counted with the digital counter. It was found that the method was useful to study the diurnal variation and the local characteristics of the <b>frying</b> <b>noise...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the coastal}} waters of Nagasaki Prefecture, 24 -hour {{observations}} {{were made for}} the sound level of TEMPURA NOISE (<b>frying</b> <b>noise)</b> at 6 stations with less traffic noise. It was revealed that the TEMPURA NOISE level shows diurnal variations and high peak values at sunrise and sunset being 3 - 5 dB higher than that in daytime or nighttime. There was observed no characteristic difference in noise level between the daytime and the nighttime, but {{it was observed that}} the noise level of daytime is sometimes higher than that of nighttime and vice versa. The level of the noise varied by the quality of the bottom materials, and variation was remarkable in the sea area of sandy mud bottom. The variation of noise level was considered to be caused by the sudden change in brightness of the sunbeam at sunrise or sunset, and not so much to be influenced by the factors of the tide and so on. It seems that the frequency characteristics of the noise is variable by the bottom condition and the biological noise at any station depends on the life of the sea at the station. The range of the noise level was about 65 - 85 dB (2 X 10 - 4 μ bar). !?﻿ 1) The diurnal variation of the underwater sound was investigated 10 times at 6 stations on the coastal waters of Nagasaki Prefecture from January to September in 1969. 2) The underwater noise level reached to the peak value twice a day (at sunset and sunrise) being 3 - 5 dB higher than that in nighttime and daytime. 3) The noise level in daytime was sometimes higher than that in nighttime and sometimes equal with the latter. No obvious difference in the noise level was observed between the nighttime and the daytime. 4) The noise was influenced even by the condition of the bottom materials, for example, the noise at the bottom of sandy mud was the hugest. 5) This variation was caused chiefly by sudden change of brightness and it did not seem that the variation was influenced by the tide, water temperature, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and so on. 6) The frequency distribution of the underwater noise was somewhat different by the condition of the bottom materials and the underwater life in the area, and the considerably powerful noise level was observed between 1 and 4 kHz at sunrise and sunset in the area where many snapping shrimps might possibly live as mentioned in the previous paper. 7) The sound pressure level was about 65 - 85 dB. 8) It was not likely that the sessile animals which adhere to the tidal zone are the main cause of the TEMPURA NOISE...|$|E
50|$|Fry and Carwardine {{travel to}} Indonesia and Malaysia to out a rare, endemic species. At Snake Island they {{encounter}} a venomous yellow-lipped sea krait, causing Fry to rue {{his decision to}} wear open-toed sandals. At Turtle Island, conservationists are working to protect sea turtles. The presenters help to collect eggs from a female green turtle that has come ashore to lay, and then release new hatchlings back into the sea. Heading further south, the pair dive and snorkel on Indonesia's coral reefs, viewing adult turtles and seahorses. On Mabul Island they find sharks' fins and jawbones, dried seahorses and sea cucumbers for sale. Carwardine explains that the demand from Asian markets, for food and traditional medicine, is driving these species to extinction. At Labuk Bay they view proboscis monkeys in a mangrove sanctuary surrounded by oil palm plantations. <b>Fry</b> compares their <b>noises</b> to lunchtime at the Garrick Club. Their final destination is the Indonesian island of Rinca, home to the Komodo dragon. The world's largest lizard {{is not to be}} underestimated: they meet rangers and villagers who have been attacked by dragons, and hear of a child who was killed. However, the dragons are entwined in the islanders' culture, and the tourists they attract bring much-needed income. Fry and Carwardine help Park rangers to fit a radio collar to a dragon as part of a research project. With protection, tolerance from locals and the ability of female dragons to procreate through parthenogenesis, Fry is confident that the species can survive.|$|R
