The niqabi is also required to refrain from forcing or propagating her niqab wearing practice upon others, especially against their will. Then, a niqabi shall also not be criticized for her wearing the niqab because {{she thought it was}} obligatory, or because she had been taught it was obligatory, or because she wishes to <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of caution in an incorrect but good faith gesture of extreme modesty.|$|E

500|$|Clarke had to {{deal with}} four natural {{disasters}} during his tenure. An outbreak of smallpox in 1894 was the result of labour migration and men returning from working in Witwatersrand. When it proved too costly for the people, he waived the charge for the vaccination. Locust swarms in 1894 and 1895 caused damage to crops and resulted in famine in 1896. The government response was to offer the chief of each tribe a reward of 3d for every muid of locusts collected as well as cattle to slaughter when a swarm was eradicated. At the same time, Clarke bought 1,090 muids of quick-growing mealies to be given on payment to families requiring immediate relief, a measure of which Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Natal, approved: [...] "It is better to <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of unnecessary expenditure than to run the risk of exposing the people to starvation." [...] Finally, in 1897, an outbreak of rinderpest killed many cattle and the government responded with a programme of inoculation.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{critical}} acclaim, Homicide: Life on the Street {{suffered from}} poor ratings throughout its , prompting NBC to consider taking {{it off the}} air. After a nine-episode , the network approved four more episodes for the show's [...] as a trial run to determine whether to continue or cancel the show. The script for [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was completed before the first season ended, but NBC executives asked for several refinements [...] including less involved plots and fewer camera movements [...] before approving a second season. In an attempt to appease the network and improve ratings, executive producers Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana sought to make subtle changes to give the show a stronger mainstream appeal, while aiming not to compromise its integrity or originality. With [...] "Bop Gun", the producers slightly toned down the bleak visual style and hand-held photography motif. It is also the first episode {{to focus on a}} single story, rather than multiple subplots, which Fontana felt allowed the writers to tell the main story better.

[...] "Bop Gun" [...] marked the first episode with Jean de Segonzac as director of photography. The first scene, which depicts the moments immediately before the shooting, juxtaposes shots of the Ellison family admiring the tourist attractions of Baltimore with shots of their shooters playing basketball before following the family. The photography depicts the different sides of Baltimore by presenting the Ellison family shots like a cheerful tourist advertisement, with the other shots presenting a grittier image of the city.|$|E

2500|$|Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained (2002), {{based in}} part on his anthropological field work, treats belief in God {{as the result of the}} brain's {{tendency}} towards agency detection.

The listener is transported into Milla's medieval faerie land of Russian folk influences and contemporary synth-pop via a series of eclectic yet seamless tracks like the mesmerizing [...] "Charlie" [...] and the dramatic [...] "Don't Fade Away" [...] (produced by Richard Feldman and Rupert Hine, respectively. Feldman's tracks have a more Celtic sound while Hine's are more pop-friendly and otherworldly). Although many were quick to dismiss Milla for attempting to crossover into yet another industry (she has since gone on to headline the Resident Evil film franchise and continues to record music independently), The Divine Comedy stands as one of the best lost pop albums of the '90s." ...|$|E
