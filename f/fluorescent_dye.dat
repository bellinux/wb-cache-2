Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E

The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>dye</b> using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube.

Bioaffine ligands are covalently bound to silica beads with terminal negatively charged silanol groups or polystyrene beads and are used for isolation and purification of basic proteins or adsorption of biomolecules. After binding the separation is performed by centrifugation (density separation) or by magnetic field attraction (for magnetic particles only). The beads can be washed to provide purity of the isolated molecule before dissolving it by ion exchange methods.

500|$|The western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} visitor to the flowers. A territorial species, the territories are smaller when they contain more Adenanthos obovatus bushes. Their long curved bills fit the tube-like flowers exactly, so that the pollen-presenter brushes against the spinebill's head while it is probing for nectar. The birds then carry pollen from plant to plant, fertilising other plants. A field study marking the pollen with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>dye</b> found that pollen could be deposited on flowers of plants up to [...] away from the original flower visited. The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) [...] and brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta) have also been recorded with pollen from A. obovatus. The silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) drinks nectar from the flowers, but punctures the tube with its short bill. Larger honeyeaters in one field study tended to avoid A. obovatus, possibly seeking sources of more abundant nectar elsewhere. These species are too heavy for the fine branches and their bills are too large for the tubes.|$|E

2500|$|A further {{method to}} {{differentiate}} converted from unconverted bisulfite-treated DNA is using high-resolution melting analysis (HRM), a quantitative PCR-based technique initially designed to distinguish SNPs. [...] The PCR amplicons are analyzed directly by temperature ramping and resulting liberation of an intercalating <b>fluorescent</b> <b>dye</b> during melting. [...] The degree of methylation, {{as represented by}} the C-to-T content in the amplicon, determines the rapidity of melting and consequent release of the dye.

GBM cells are widely infiltrative through the brain at diagnosis, and so despite a [...] "total resection" [...] of all obvious tumor, most people with GBM later develop recurrent tumors either near the original site or at more distant locations within the brain. Other modalities, typically radiation and chemotherapy, are used after surgery in an effort to suppress and slow recurrent disease.|$|E
2500|$|A seminal {{paper by}} Menzel (1975) {{described}} the morphology and spectral {{sensitivity of the}} honey bee eye that underlie their color vision. He examined color-coding in the honey bee retina by marking individual cells with a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>dye</b> and recording from these cells as single units. From this analysis he determined {{that there are three}} types of receptors in the honey bee eye: 1) UV receptors, 2) blue receptors, and 3) green receptors The three receptors contain three rhodopsin-like pigments which have maximal absorbance at wavelengths of 350nm, 440nm, and 540nm. Menzel also found that most of the cells he studied had secondary sensitivities that corresponded to wavelength regions at which the other two receptor types were maximally active. He used spectral efficiency experiments to suggest that these secondary sensitivities result from electric coupling between the receptors.|$|E

2500|$|Aminoallyl {{nucleotide}} is a nucleotide with {{a modified}} base containing an allylamine. They {{are used in}} post-labeling of nucleic acids by fluorescence detection in microarray. They are reactive with N-Hydroxysuccinimide ester group which helps attach a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>dye</b> to the primary amino group on the nucleotide. These nucleotides are known as 5-(3-aminoallyl)-nucleotides since the aminoallyl group is usually attached to carbon 5 of the pyrimidine ring of uracil or cytosine. The primary amine group in the aminoallyl moiety is aliphatic and thus more reactive compared to the amine groups that are directly attached to the rings (aromatic) of the bases. Common names of aminoallyl nucleosides are initially abbreviated with aa- or AA- to indicate aminoallyl. The 5-carbon sugar is indicated {{with or without the}} lowercase [...] "d" [...] indicating deoxyribose if included or ribose if not. Finally the nitrogenous base and number of phosphates are indicated (i.e. aa-UTP = aminoallyl uridine triphosphate).|$|E

The researchers could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals.
