25|$|On December 5, 2008, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal {{held that}} her {{statements}} {{were taken in}} violation of her Miranda rights, but that the search of <b>her</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> still valid under the inevitable discovery exception to the search warrant requirement because the police would have inevitably {{found it in the}} normal course of the investigation despite her illegal statement. The case was sent back for trial. A pre-trial status hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2009. On April 1, 2009, the judge ordered Nowak to undergo two psychiatric evaluations before June 12, 2009.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Uhura and Chekov {{question}} passersby about the location of nuclear vessels was filmed with a hidden camera. However, {{the people with whom}} Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day's shooting and, despite legends to the contrary, knew they were being filmed. In an interview with StarTrek.com, Layla Sarakalo, the extra who said, [...] "I don't know if I know the answer to that... I think it's across the bay, in Alameda," [...] stated that after <b>her</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> impounded because she refused to move it for the filming, she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras, hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment. She had been told to act naturally, and so she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film, though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept.|$|E
500|$|While {{still out}} at sea, Ismael brought [...] waves to Southern California, though waves {{from the storm}} were less than expected. One person was swept away at a beach.

25|$|Throughout the episode, Tony vigorously defends Ziva's innocence to the FBI, {{as well as}} berating any {{agent who}} dares {{question}} her loyalty when <b>her</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> found at a bombing in downtown Georgetown. She is eventually cleared of all wrongdoing. Though Ziva never addresses Bashan's accusation and her relationship with Tony is left undefined, there is no overt romantic connection in subsequent episodes.|$|R

Delany describes her character in Body of Proof as being [...] "complicated, smart, and definitely complex." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} {{was reported to}} police, who soon came to doubt Biryukova's account since <b>her</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> found to have enough gas in its tank and was in working order. It also shared similarities with an episode of [...] that had been rebroadcast in the Seattle area the night before. Shortly before, Biryukova had decided to withdraw from a mediated custody agreement {{that was the last}} stage of an acrimonious divorce from Sky's father, Solomon Metalwala. Solomon has remained active in assisting police with the investigation, believing Sky's disappearance was related to the custody dispute.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2015, {{a county}} grand jury {{declined}} {{to issue an}} indictment in connection to Bland's death. A special prosecutor said that [...] "the case is still open", and that the grand jury would meet again in January 2016 to discuss other aspects. Those aspects were widely assumed to include Encinia's actions during the traffic stop, and Bland's family urged prosecutors to pursue criminal charges against him. Reconvening the following month, the grand jury indicted Encinia for perjury, a Class A misdemeanor with a possible penalty of one year in jail and a $4,000 fine. The charge resulted from his statement in an affidavit that his reason for removing Bland from <b>her</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> [...] "to further conduct a safe traffic investigation". [...] The grand jury found that statement to be false, according to a special prosecutor. Hours after the indictment was announced, DPS said they had begun the process to terminate Encinia's employment as a state trooper. After an arrest warrant was issued, Encinia surrendered at the Waller County Jail and was released after posting a $2,500 bond. His attorney {{said that he would}} appeal his termination, while Bland's family called for more serious criminal charges including battery and false arrest. On June 28, 2017, a judge granted a motion by prosecutors to dismiss the perjury charge against Encinia.

6000|$|The car {{had been}} once a common day-coach, but those who had sat in it and gringed to the conductor's hat-band slips would never have {{recognised}} it in its transformation. Paint and gilding and certain domestic touches had liberated it from any suspicion of public servitude. The whitest of lace curtains judiciously screened its windows. From its fore end drooped in the torrid air the flag of Mexico. From its rear projected the Stars and Stripes and a busy stovepipe, the latter reinforcing in its suggestion of culinary comforts the general suggestion of privacy and ease. The beholder's eye, regarding its gorgeous sides, found interest to culminate in a single name in gold and blue letters extending almost its entire length--a single name, the audacious privilege of royalty and genius. Doubly, then, was this arrogant nomenclature here justified; for the name was that of [...] "Alvarita, Queen of the Serpent Tribe." [...] This, <b>her</b> <b>car,</b> <b>was</b> back from a triumphant tour of the principal Mexican cities, and now headed for San Antonio, where, according to promissory advertisement, she would exhibit her [...] "Marvellous Dominion and Fearless Control over Deadly and Venomous Serpents, Handling them with Ease as they Coil and Hiss to the Terror of Thousands of Tongue-tied Tremblers!" ...|$|E

Frankie is found a short time later. Strode tries {{to get her to}} surrender, but when she runs away, she is shot in the back and killed. Stoney tearfully watches this from a passing bus. Strode sees her from a distance but lets her go, realizing he was the reason she and her friends did what they did.|$|R
