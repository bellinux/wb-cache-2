First of all, the concept of mechanism skeleton needs to be introduced. In this work, the constructal theory is based on a single principle, i. e. the minimization of energies in connections, which allows us to optimize the topology of this skeleton. In this first stage, it is also possible to determine <b>equivalent</b> <b>inertias</b> for each bar. Then, in a second stage, this paper deals with the stage of shape optimization of the various machine elements. During these two stages, optimization is carried out by genetic algorithms. This paper also shows that the sole objective of minimization of energy is not enough if the constructal theory is to be applied to obtain optimal shapes. It is obvious that this theory needs to be associated with other objectives or constraints of optimization. To summarize, this paper only offers a first feasibility study of the constructal theory for the optimization of mechanical structures...|$|R

30|$|For VSCs without {{constant}} voltage-source supply on the DC side, {{namely the}} PS/CC-VSCs and PS/VC-VSCs, the DC-link has an inherent electromechanical swing dynamic. It can be utilized for SG-imitation, such as Cases 7 and 13 in Table  1. On this occasion, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>inertia</b> coefficient directly {{depends on the}} DC capacitance and the rated voltage of the DC-link. It gives a physical insight of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>inertia.</b> In terms of the VSCs without utilizing the DC-link dynamic directly, such as Cases 6 and 12, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>inertia</b> {{seems to be a}} flexible configuration. However, the constraints of the short-term power supply on the DC side must be considered when selecting inertia parameter as there is no ES. For those VSCs with ES, namely the VS/CC-VSCs and VS/VC-VSCs, the DC-link voltage almost maintains a constant. Their <b>equivalent</b> <b>inertia</b> can be freely configured according to the system requirements. It is obvious that the equivalent synchronizing coefficient of VC-VSCs is completely consistent with that of the traditional SGs, seen from Cases 1 to 7. Nevertheless, as a current-source relying on the synchronization to a stable grid voltage, the equivalent synchronizing coefficient of most CC-VSCs is related to the parameters of the PLL or the reconstructed PLL.|$|E

40|$|Renewable energy based microgrids are {{emerging}} as a potential solution to augment the utility grid energy. However, their inherent dependency on static power electronic inverters lesions utility grid <b>equivalent</b> rotational <b>inertia,</b> which effects the system resiliency during uncertainties. This degrades voltage-quality, frequency-stability, and self-healing capacity of the microgrid. This typical challenge becomes major roadblock for the microgrids' integration with utility grid as per the explicit guidelines given by IEEE 1547. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the design of “Closed Loop Virtual DC Motor and Induction Generator Controlled Inverter (CL-VDCMIG-CI) ” scheme.

For example, some self-tuning methods allow the SG-equivalent VSC to increase and reduce its virtual inertia and virtual damping considering the acceleration/deceleration of the virtual angular velocity in each phase of oscillation [64, 65] in order to achieve better performance of the frequency response than that in conventional SGs.|$|E

30|$|Resembling the Phillips-Heffron {{modeling}} of traditional SG, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>inertia</b> K J denotes the power cost for altering the angular {{frequency of the}} CC-VSC. The synchronizing coefficient K S reflects the performance supporting machine-grid synchronism. As shown in (15), the integral regulator of PLL leads to the synchronizing property, which takes charge of restoring the operation point when it deviates from its steady state. The damping coefficient K D represents the capability for damping the oscillation of angular frequency. It is apparent in (15) that proportional regulator of PLL in CC-VSC generates the effect of damping. If J, k p and k i are all positive, K J, K S and K D will be positive correspondingly under the condition of normal operating point (cosθ 0 > 0). That means the VSC is equipped with certain inertia, damping and synchronizing ability. These parameters are important physical concepts to represent the dynamic characteristics of the SG in the classical stability theory.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of torsional vibrations {{in the running}} gear of reciprocating engine systems is normally carried out by neglecting the variation in inertia torques of the system arising from {{the motion of the}} reciprocating parts. When the variable inertia effect is allowed for the equation of motion taking into account the effect is non-linear. Assuming small displacements, the equation can be linearized to predict important characteristics of the motion. Such an equation when solved by numerical methods using a digital computer predicts the regions of instability {{and the manner in which}} the amplitude and frequency vary with the speed of rotation of the engine. The responses of the system show a modulation of amplitude and frequency at definite rotational speeds. The occurrence of such a modulation in amplitude and frequency is established by use of the process given by Wentzel, Kramers, Brillouin, and Jeffreys generally known as the WKBJ approximation. The method of variation of parameters and the WKBJ approximation are used to determine the time responses of the system as an independent verification of the numerical methods although this method is applicable only in a limited range of the engine speed for the specific ratio of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>inertia</b> of the reciprocating parts to the total <b>equivalent</b> <b>inertia</b> of the system. The first order term in the equation, the forcing term which represents the outer impulse from the reciprocating parts and the variable part of the elastic term are investigated for their effect on the waveforms of the responses of the system. Further investigations of the effect of external excitations on the characteristics of the motion are carried out which explain the cause of failure in some multi-cylinder engines due to secondary resonance. Various other characteristics of the variable inertia system and the complete solutions of the equation of motion including damping are explored in the present work.

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} {{that the purpose}} of the stability analysis based on the two-machine system presented above is providing a basic reference case for the small-signal stability analysis of multiple-machine system. Actually, it can be observed that the amount increasing of the CC-VSCs in the multiple-machine system is <b>equivalent</b> to the <b>inertia</b> decreasing of the master SG which acts as the voltage reference in the basic two-machine system through the similar analysis. The inertia decreasing of the master SG means that the relative inertia of the CC-VSC increases, which may cause the eigenvalues moving to the right half plane and threat to the system stability. It can be easily validated, for example the stability has a tendency to deteriorate when the penetration of DGs increases or the grid gets weaker for application in engineering. Due to the limited space, the detailed discussion about other multiple-machine systems is not presented here, but the relative conclusions can be deduced according to the stability analysis presented above.|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a passive back-to-back test rig have been characterised, {{leading to a}} multi-coordinate approach {{for the analysis of}} arbitrary test configurations. Universal joints have been introduced into a typical pre-loaded back-to-back system in order to produce an oscillating torsional moment in a test specimen. Two different arrangements have been investigated using a frequency-based sub-structuring approach: the receptance method. A numerical model has been developed in accordance with this theory, allowing interconnection of systems with two-coordinates and closed multi-loop schemes. The model calculates the receptance functions and modal and deflected shapes of a general system. Closed form expressions of the following individual elements have been developed: a servomotor, damped continuous shaft and a universal joint. Numerical results for specific cases have been compared with published data in literature and experimental measurements undertaken in the present work. Due to the complexity of the universal joint and its oscillating dynamic effects, a more detailed analysis of this component has been developed. Two models have been presented. The first represents the joint as two inertias connected by a massless cross-piece. The second, derived by the dynamic analysis of a spherical four-link mechanism, considers the contribution of the floating element and its gyroscopic effects. An investigation into non-linear behaviour has led to a time domain model that utilises the Runge-Kutta fourth order method for resolution of the dynamic equations. It has been demonstrated that the torsional receptances of a universal joint, derived using the simple model, result in representation of the joint as an <b>equivalent</b> variable <b>inertia.</b> In order to verify the model, a test rig has been built and experimental validation undertaken. The variable inertia of a universal joint has lead to a novel application of the component as a passive device for the balancing of inertia variations in slider-crank mechanisms...|$|R
