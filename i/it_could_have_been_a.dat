5|$|Enrique {{steadily}} intensified and {{by early}} on July 16, the National Hurricane Center was anticipating {{for the system}} to reach hurricane intensity. Continuing to strengthen, it reached hurricane status On July 17. However, this was {{for a short period}} of time as it developed an eye. Due to uncertainty in the storm's intensity that day, it is possible that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> hurricane earlier than originally estimated. Wind shear associated with a trough and passage over cooler waters caused Enrique to begin weakening and the cyclone center soon became exposed. Enrique was downgraded to a depression on July 19 and the weakening cyclone crossed into the central Pacific on July 20. Enrique dissipated shortly thereafter. Enrique's remnants managed to maintain a very weak center as it passed well to the north of the Hawaiian Islands and then passed near Midway Island. As the storm approached the International Dateline, the system started to redevelop. Shortly after crossing the dateline, Enrique became a tropical storm again on August 1. It lasted for less than 24 hours before it lost its convection and thus the cyclone began to dissipate. No damages or casualties were caused by Enrique.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky.

When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} a timber frame house that was {{originally}} constructed {{on the west side}} of Pine Street, but its original form is not known for sure due the extent of its expansion and remodeling. The NRHP nomination states that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> -story gabled roof cottage with a cross-gable in the center, a style popular during the mid-century in Pawtucket. This original structure retains little of its form except for the Gothic hood moulds on the second floor end windows and the Gothic bargeboards. A two-story hipped roof addition was constructed in two phases, one completed before 1877 and the other between 1895 and 1902. Though the NRHP also states that the original house was enlarged in the late 1860s or 1870s without specification to the work done at the time. The additions include a bay window on the facade and openwork on the porch sides. The later alterations to the building worked to compliment the distinctive bargeboards of the cottage with the work on the eaves and window heads of the addition.|$|E

In December 1471 Pope Sixtus IV ordered the present sculpture to be transferred to the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Hill, and the twins were added some time around then.

25|$|The Romans {{recognized}} their {{weakness in}} naval power and tactics, {{especially after the}} incident of the Lipari Islands.

This device would {{be attached to the}} prow of Roman ships on a rotating axle, so that it could be swung around; and its spiked end could then be dropped onto an enemy ship. In this way the Romans could still make use of their superior soldiers by loading them across the corvus and onto enemy ships.|$|E

25|$|Between June and July 2011, Pakistan Chitral Scouts {{and local}} defence militias {{suffered}} deadly cross border raids. In response the Pakistani military reportedly shelled some Afghan villages in Afghanistan's Nuristan, Kunar, Nangarhar, and Khost provinces {{resulting in a}} number of Afghan civilians being killed. Afghan sources claimed that nearly 800 rounds of missiles were fired from Pakistan, hitting civilian targets inside Afghanistan. The reports claimed that attacks by Pakistan resulted in the deaths of 42 Afghan civilians, including children, wounded many others and destroyed 120 homes. Although Pakistan claims it was an accident and just routine anti Taliban operations, some analysts believe that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> show of strength by Islamabad.

25|$|One of the {{essential}} sources Philostratus claimed to know are the “memoirs” (or “diary”) of Damis, an acolyte and companion of Apollonius. Some scholars claim that the notebooks of Damis were an invention of Philostratus, while others think <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> real book forged by someone else and naively used by Philostratus. Philostratus describes Apollonius as a wandering teacher of philosophy and miracle-worker who was mainly active in Greece and Asia Minor but also traveled to Italy, Spain, and North Africa, and even to Mesopotamia, India, and Ethiopia. In particular, he tells lengthy stories of Apollonius entering the city of Rome in disregard of emperor Nero’s ban on philosophers, and later on being summoned, as a defendant, {{to the court of}} Domitian, where he defied the emperor in blunt terms. He had allegedly been accused of conspiring against the emperor, performing human sacrifice, and predicting a plague by means of magic. Philostratus implies that upon his death, Apollonius of Tyana underwent heavenly assumption.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, ichthyosaurs {{were seen}} as {{decreasing}} in diversity even further with the Cretaceous, {{even though they had}} a worldwide distribution. All fossils from this period were referred to a single genus: Platypterygius. This last ichthyosaur genus was thought to have become extinct early in the late Cretaceous, during the Cenomanian about 95 million years ago. The ichthyosaurs would thus have disappeared much earlier than other large Mesozoic reptile groups that generally survived {{until the end of the}} Cretaceous. Two major explanations were given for this. Firstly, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> matter of chance. The second explanation had the extinction as caused by competition. Less hydrodynamically efficient animals, like the Mosasauridae and long-necked plesiosaurs, flourished. It could be that the ichthyosaurian overspecialisation was a contributing factor to their extinction, possibly being unable to 'keep up' with the fast-swimming and highly evasive new teleost fish, which had become dominant at this time, against which the sit-and-wait ambush strategies of the mosasaurids proved superior. This model thus emphasised evolutionary stagnation, the only innovation shown by Platypterygius being its ten fingers.|$|E
25|$|Close to Kirkmuir (previously Laigh Kirkmuir), a farm {{occupied}} by William Mure in 1692, is the Freezeland plantation (previously Fold Park) on the turnpike as {{marked on the}} 1858 OS. Nowadays it is a smallholding without a dwelling house. The origin of the name is unclear, although 'furz' or furs' is old Scots for gorse or whin, however {{the existence of this}} small patch of fenced off land may be linked to the reference in Thomson's 1832 map to a fold, either for sheep or cattle. In 1799 the surrounding field is known as Fold Park. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> pen for strayed stock or be connected with the tolls on the turnpike in some way or a 'stell', the Scot's word for a partial enclosure made by a wall or trees, to serve as a shelter for sheep or cattle. A building may have existed here. Kirkmuir was farmed by John Brown (died 21 August 1880, aged 54) and his wife Catherine Anderson (died 27 August 1895, aged 72). James Walker (died 11 December 1926, aged 86) and his wife Mary Woodburn (died 27 April 1899, aged 57) also farmed Kirkmuir. They were all buried in the Laigh Kirk graveyard.|$|E
