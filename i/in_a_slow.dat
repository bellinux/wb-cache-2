5|$|By the 1330s, Southampton's {{prosperity}} was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> decline. In 1338 {{there was}} a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged. The house {{may have been one}} of those damaged in the raid, as the south-western corner of the building collapsed around that time and had to be quickly rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and never fully recovered. The character of FrenchStreet began to change, as many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendent of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built.|$|E

5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E
5|$|Brown made 17 in {{his only}} innings as Australia won by eight wickets. Between Tests, Brown scored 113 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> innings against Yorkshire to retain his middle-order {{position}} for the Second Test at Lord's. He was unable to replicate the Test centuries he made in the preceding tours, scoring 24 and 32. It was to be his last Test, as Sam Loxton top-scored with 159 not out against Gloucestershire in the match before the Third Test, ousting Brown from his middle-order position. Barnes was injured in the Third Test, but Brown was not recalled for the Fourth Test; instead, Lindsay Hassett was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order and struck 112. Brown then scored 140 against Derbyshire immediately after the Fourth Test, in a dour display that displeased spectators, and then scored consecutive centuries against Kent and the Gentlemen of England after the Tests. He ended with eight centuries {{and a total of}} 1,448 runs on the tour at an average of 57.92, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris, with the 200 against Cambridge University his highest score. Brown took 4/16 against the South of England in his only bowling assignment of the tour. It was his best career bowling figures, having amassed only six wickets in his first-class career. In three visits to England, Brown scored 18 centuries.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost all}} amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is a herbivore. Its diet {{consists}} of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar {{obtained from the}} forest's canopy. The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different materials, although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger range. Among the items it consumes are the pericarp of the seeds of sierra palm (Prestoea montana), tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), and negra lora (Matayba domingensis); the fruits of bejuco de rana (Marcgravia sintenisii), camasey (Miconia sintenisii), cupey de altura (Clusia gundlachii), and palo de cruz (Rheedia portoricensis); the flowers of bejuco de rana, achiotillo (Alchornea latifolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the leaves and twigs of cupeillo (Clusia grisebachiana), laurel sabino (Magnolia splendens), caimitillo verde (Micropholis garciniaefolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the bark of bejuco de rana, cupeillo, and cachimbo cumun (Psychotria berteriana); and the buds of cuaba (Inga vera).

5|$|Nevertheless, Brown was {{successful}} in the tour matches when he played as an opener. He ended the tour with eight centuries {{and a total of}} 1,448 first-class runs at an average of 57.92, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris in the runs and averages, with a highest score of 200 against Cambridge University. Brown's tally of eight centuries was second only to Bradman, and took his tally on English soil to 18 first-class tons. Excluding the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests, in which Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 batting in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, Brown scored 1,324 runs at 66.20 while opening in the other matches, which would have put him in a clear fourth place on the batting averages. Following his omission from the Test team midway through the tour, Brown batted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> and conservative manner in order to score more runs and regain his position, much to the chagrin of the crowds.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{hurricane}} {{can be traced to}} a compact and slow-moving low-pressure area in the open Atlantic Ocean in late August1940. As the system progressed in a west-northwest direction, its center of circulation became more organized. As a result, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda at 1200UTC on August26. Operationally, the storm was analyzed to have undergone tropical cyclogenesis on August30. However, a reanalysis of the storm conducted in 2012 found that the system was already organized prior. In its initial stages, the depression remained weak, with few ships reporting abnormally strong winds in association with the storm. Continuing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> west-northwest movement, the disturbance gradually intensified, and was analyzed to have attained tropical storm intensity by 1800UTC on August28. At 0600UTC on August30, the tropical storm strengthened further into the equivalent of a modern-day Category1hurricane, roughly 225mi (360km) east of the Florida peninsula. At the same time, the hurricane began to intensify and move quicker than it had previously. Later that day, a ship within the periphery of the storm reported winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a barometric pressure of 979mbar (hPa; 28.90inHg).|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Bingiza {{was located in}} an area of weak steering currents, which resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow,</b> meandering motion toward the southwest. Its motion turned to the south on February10, with conditions only marginally favorable for further intensification. After two days of meandering without strengthening, Bingiza turned to the southwest on due to a building ridge to its southwest toward Madagascar. Around the same time, upper-level conditions began improving, which allowed the convection to increase in coverage. Based on the improved appearance, MF upgraded Bingiza to a severe tropical storm at 0600UTC on February12 about 335km (210mi) east of the coast of Madagascar. Later that day an eye became apparent on satellite imagery, signaling the beginning of a rapid deepening trend. Late on February12, MF upgraded Bingiza to tropical cyclone intensity, which is the equivalent of a hurricane or typhoon. With minimal wind shear and warm waters, the agency forecast the cyclone to intensify further to peak 10sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph). Continuing to strengthen, Bingiza attained 10minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph) early on February13. Similarly, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph), noting a contracting eye 37km (23mi) in diameter in the process of an eyewall replacement cycle.|$|E

5|$|Diver Rodney Joyce from Scarborough, Ontario, aged 18, drowned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> {{whirlpool}} {{effect in}} the pond below the waterfall on Victoria Day weekend in 1988. Joyce had been swimming for ten minutes, when he went closer to the falls to retrieve a frisbee. His brother Gregory, aged 20, rushed to help him, but was pulled under several times. Resuscitation efforts by security staff failed. In an inquest, Wonderland's director of engineering denied {{the existence of an}} undertow. A nearby life ring had been tied to a tree using three knots and was only equipped with 6 metres (20feet) of rope, not enough to reach the middle of the pool. One high diver, who had worked at the park for seven years, claims to have told his supervisor of the undertow during the previous season. That diver was concerned about landing someone, as he claimed unauthorized swimmers were a frequent occurrence at that time. The area was listed as barricaded in an early report, but later reports contradicted that. The witness claimed that there were 30 to 40 bathers at one time. The park's director of safety and security said he was never informed of the undertow, and only saw bathers in the pool on one occasion. Not only was there no statement about pool dangers on record, but the supervisor for the previous three years denied that anyone in their department had expressed concern. Security and extra signs were posted after the incident. Spokespeople pointed out that Joyce shouldn't have been throwing frisbees in the area and suggested that the witness shouldn't have continued to work for the park in the previous season if they had an unaddressed concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} that Ganteaume gleaned from his captive was largely false. A large expeditionary force and fleet under Lord Keith {{was in the}} Mediterranean but would not arrive in Egypt {{for more than two}} weeks, British landings eventually going ahead on 8 March. At the time Ganteaume questioned Peard, the force was anchored at Karamania on the southern coast of Anatolia, struggling with reluctant Ottoman allies and bad weather. In addition, there was little active pursuit of his squadron during February: when Concorde reached Plymouth on 3 February, urgent messages were sent to Earl St Vincent at the Admiralty who ordered the despatch of a fast squadron of six ships of the line, two frigates and a brig in search of Ganteaume's ships. However, attached to command this force was Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder, who traveled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> second rate ship of the line that significantly delayed the passage of his squadron. In any case, a miscalculation of Ganteaume's intentions at the Admiralty resulted in orders for Calder's squadron to sail to the West Indies, and they played no further part in the campaign. Warren, whose squadron was based off Cádiz, had learned of Ganteaume's passage on 8 February and sailed to Gibraltar in pursuit before continuing to Menorca on 13 February, arriving on 20 February without seeing any sign of the French and subsequently sailing for Sicily in March after hearing news of the impending Treaty of Florence between France and the Kingdom of Naples. Despite the lack of genuine pursuit, Ganteaume was unnerved by the information gleaned from Peard, and ordered the squadron to sail for Toulon, arriving on 19 February without any further contact with the Royal Navy.|$|E
