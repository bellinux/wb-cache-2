50|$|The {{practice}} of bonsai is sometimes confused with dwarfing, but dwarfing generally refers to research, <b>discovery,</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation</b> of plant cultivars that are permanent, genetic miniatures of existing species. Bonsai {{does not require}} genetically dwarfed trees, but rather depends on growing small trees from regular stock and seeds. Bonsai uses cultivation techniques like pruning, root reduction, potting, defoliation, and grafting to produce small trees that mimic the shape and style of mature, full-size trees.|$|R

Similar debates have animated marketing scholars for decades in terms of existing and latent needs (see, e.g., Slater and Narver 1998). Since we are mainly interested in opportunity emergence and how habitual entrepreneurs act upon them, and since this is an unexplored area, an a priori restriction to one perspective appears not to be practical.|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{entrepreneurship}} has, for {{a number}} of decades, been viewed as one approach for generating growth through new product, process, market, or strategy innovation. More recently, and largely in response to rising costs and stakeholder concerns, managers have begun to pay increasing attention to issues of sustainability and corporate social responsibility. This paper demonstrates how sustainability can be embedded into a corporate entrepreneurship framework. In addition, managers who embrace sustainability principles are providing a stimulus for corporate entrepreneurship that may result in the <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation,</b> assessment, and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities, an enhanced reputation, and, ultimately, a competitive advantage...|$|R
40|$|Do {{entrepreneurial}} opportunities exist, {{independent of}} the perceptions of entrepreneurs, {{just waiting to be}} discov-ered? Or, are these opportunities created by the actions of entrepreneurs? Two internally consistent theories of how entrepreneurial opportunities are formed—discovery theory and creation theory—are described. While it will always be possible to describe the formation of a particular opportunity {{as an example of a}} <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation</b> proc-ess, these two theories do have important implications for the effectiveness of a wide variety of entrepreneurial ac-tions in different contexts. The implications of these theo-ries for seven of these actions are described, along with a discussion of some of the broader theoretical implications of these two theories for the fields of entrepreneurship and strategic managemen...|$|R

According to one account, when the Spaniards made a reconnaissance of Manila's environs, they came upon the San Mateo flood plains and became enamored by the natural beauty of the place. They decided to establish a community in the place and one day, a Spanish scribe happened to stand on a mound with a book on one hand and a pen on the other. His statue-like pose prompted a companion to laugh and comment, [...] "Muy" [...] friend, the way you are now makes you look like Saint Matthew, referring of course to the usual way the evangelist saint is depicted in his statues. In the midst of their banter and merriment, they decided to call the place they discovered ‘San Mateo’.|$|R
40|$|International audienceEntrepreneurial {{activities}} are intricately {{linked to the}} <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation</b> of opportunities, in the innovation context. Many researches focus on {{the debate over the}} nature of opportunities (discovered or created) and more recently on the processes that form entrepreneurial opportunities. However little research investigates the innovation context as one of the attributes that would explain the type and the way opportunities are formed. As the success of entrepreneurial activities also depends on larger socio-cultural contexts, our particular interest in this paper is to explore the influence of specific localised innovation contexts on the opportunity formation process. We look at how an innovation context can become or fail to become an ecosystem forming or enhancing the opportunities (i. e. by providing the relevant technical and market knowledge), resulting in entrepreneurial activities. The study of two specific cases in this paper found two patterns of entrepreneurial process, as the result of two different contexts in which opportunities are in one case discovered or created in the other case...|$|R
40|$|There have lately been {{a variety}} of {{attempts}} to connect, or even explain, if not in fact, reduce human consciousness to quantum mechanical processes. Such attempts tend to draw a sharp and fundamental distinction between the role of consciousness in classical mechanics, {{and on the other}} hand, in quantum mechanics, with an insistence on the assumed exceptional character of the latter. What is strangely missed, however, is the role of human consciousness as such in the very <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation</b> of both of these physical theories. And this a priori role is far more important than all the possible a posteriori interplays between consciousness and the mentioned two theories of physics, interplays which may happen during one or another specific experiment, measurement, and so on. In this regard it is suggested that the specific features human consciousness may exhibit during interactions with quantum mechanical systems may as well have other explanations which {{do not appear to be}} less plausible, or less well founded. 1...|$|R
40|$|When a new {{discipline}} emerges {{it usually}} takes some time and lots of academic discussion before concepts and terms get standardised. Such a new discipline is text mining. In a groundbreaking paper, Untangling text data mining, Hearst [1999] tackled the problem of clarifying text-mining concepts and terminology. This essay aims to build on Hearst’s ideas by pointing out some inconsistencies and suggesting an improved and extended categorisation of data- and text-mining techniques. The essay is a conceptual study. A short overview of the problems regarding text-mining concepts is given. This {{is followed by a}} summary and critical discussion of Hearst’s attempt to clarify the terminology. The essence of text mining is found to be the <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation</b> of new knowledge from a collection of documents. The parameters of non-novel, semi-novel and novel investigation are used to differentiate between full-text information retrieval, standard text mining and intelligent text mining.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{asserted}} that, despite recent movements in continental translation theory (see Wilss 1982 : 59, for an admirable {{summary of the}} situation), the essential orientation of translation theory, in the English-speaking world in particular, is still towards the evaluation of translation as product (i. e. as the translated text) and, by means of such evaluation, towards the <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation</b> {{of a set of}} normative maxims for the production of the ideal translation. What is proposed is a shift of focus away from the translation as an artifact - a product - towards translating as process i. e. an investigation of the psycholinguistic mechanisms of decoding and encoding in the context of bi- rather than monolingual information exchange. The paper concludes with some tentative hints at parts of the decoding elements of a model of translating which, it is hoped, will help to orient translators and teachers towards the means by which texts are transferred from language to language and from speech community to speech community; a process which is universally recognized as a sine qua non for the improvement of international relations in a sadly divided world...|$|R
40|$|The <b>discovery</b> (<b>or</b> <b>creation)</b> of {{entrepreneurial}} opportunities is {{a crucial}} starting point of the entrepreneurial process, yet, the process remains casual and sloppy. There are many similarities between the front-end of the new product development process and the front-end of the entrepreneurial process. Although many authors acknowledge creativity as {{an important factor in}} the generation of entrepreneurial opportunities, none of them acknowledges any contribution from design. When creative capabilities are used at the front-end of innovation, aspiring entrepreneurs can be more productive because design approaches enable entrepreneurs to be pro-active, consistent and reliable, rather than just exploratory and reactive. Design, especially service design, possesses instruments that allow for the framing, development, co-designing and prototyping of complex intangible projects thus potentially being a powerful ally to entrepreneurs. The {{purpose of this article is}} to postulate the use of a set of service design tools as creative capabilities for empowering aspiring entrepreneurs in the front-end of the entrepreneurial process to frame, create, develop and assess business ideas, potentially turning them into entrepreneurial opportunities and posit the use of design strategies and instruments in the front-end of the entrepreneurial process...|$|R
40|$|This project {{defends the}} thesis that the {{tradition}} of Deep Ecology offers a practice of education which would foster ecologically sustainable communities. This thesis addresses the problem that nearly all current forms of educational theory and practice, because they are rooted firmly within epistemologies which are infected by the anthropocentric error, foster the destruction of Creation. However, the goal of creating an education system which would foster a more ecologically sustainable relationship between human and non-human aspects of creation cannot simply involve the <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation</b> of a new foundational philosophy. Rather, this quest must be a hermeneutical task which would allow a simultaneous transformation of cultures. While Deep Ecology offers valuable insights into our current ecological crisis through its critique of anthropocentrism, Deep Ecology is not currently understood in a fashion which makes the hermeneutical task of transformation possible. Therefore, I argue that Deep Ecology should {{be understood as a}} MacIntyrian tradition complete with practices, specific types of virtue, and narrative genres. This new understanding of Deep Ecology allows the educational researcher to discern theories and practices of education which would foster ecologically sustainable communities. I conclude this project with an investigation of two extant educational programs, Rediscovery and David Orr's Ecological Literacy, which suggests that both are versions of Deep Ecological education...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} a rhetoric of science argues that {{scientific}} writing is not unproblematically neutral and objective, but rather laden with both theory and value and necessarily persuasive. The nature of persuasion within the profession of medicine is studied here through an analysis of rhetorical strategies at work in medical journal articles. (All articles are {{on the subject of}} functional headache and appear after 1982 in such journals as the Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine and Headache.) The analysis is organized using the Aristotelian categories of invention (the <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation</b> of arguments), arrangement (their organization in the most persuasive order) and style (including such matters as the use of the passive voice and the avoidance of figurative language). The result of the analysis is a comprehensive inventory of strategies medical authors use in order to influence their peers. The inventory provides a vocabulary and a procedure for analysis of medical rhetoric in general; that is, it goes some way to enabling a medical metadiscourse. The analysis further suggests that rhetorical studies, as a discipline, has much to contribute to medicine's project of examining its own assumptions and scrutinizing its own dominant paradigm. Identifying rhetorical strategies at work in medical journals is one way to articulate medical values and to understand them as instruments of action within the profession. rhetoric medicine criticism values...|$|R

It required a learning model that can meet the new paradigm and leads to a <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation</b> of a product, namely the inquiry learning model oriented life skills through the application of Simple Scientific Method Skill (S 2 MS). This type of research is the development of research using a model of Dick and Carrey performed on the stage of development and dissemination.

Data collection methods include validation of inquiry learning model (syllabus, lesson plans, teaching materials, worksheets, and assessment), observation, test evaluation of learning outcomes, student questionnaire responses. Data was analyzed using descriptive methods. The results showed that the group inquiry learning model oriented life skills through the simple scientific method skill (S 2 MS) proved effective in improving achievement in learning and creativity of students in learning science at vocational students in Ngawi East Java Indonesia. This is seen in the average value of science in the experimental class group was higher (80. 25) than in group control class (70. 20).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the factors of {{deterioration of the}} archaeological sites in Cyrene. Cyrene {{is one of the}} most important archaeological sites in the world, and since 1982 has been on the list of World Heritage Sites, meeting criteria (ii), (iii) and (vi) of the World Heritage List (WHL), relating to human civilization values, aesthetic importance, and developments in architecture or technology. But unfortunately, the site has come under a wide range of threats, duly noted and followed up by The World Heritage Committee. As a result, the Department of Antiquities (DoA) has been asked on more than one occasion to work to find appropriate solutions to protect, save and secure Cyrene. Despite the realization and understanding of these risks and threats by both the Department of Antiquities (DoA) and The World Heritage Committee (WHC), solutions have remained elusive, but new evidence identified by this study has confirmed that there is a very close relationship between good knowledge, the clear classification of deterioration factors and the <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> <b>creation</b> of solutions for the problem, because clear understanding of these factors is the most important step in finding the right solutions. This thesis is divided into four chapters. The first chapter provides the geographic and historic introduction, and also describes the archaeology and landscape of the wider site. Moreover, it discusses also the role of travellers and explorers and their work, and the very beginnings of the founding of the Department of Antiquities. The second chapter is about physical deterioration factors and their impact on the monuments. The third chapter has been devoted to discussing the role of human activity in the deterioration of heritage and archaeology in Cyrene. Finally, Chapter IV assesses all the factors of deterioration, and makes proposals to reduce these threats and dangers. Libyan Embass...|$|R

40|$|Opportunity {{recognition}} {{characterizes the}} development process from initial business idea, which derives from either <b>discovery</b> <b>or</b> social <b>creation,</b> to a viable business model. Previous research has investigated opportunity recognition largely in either cognitive-individualist or in social-constructionist dimensions with input-output approaches, leading to inconsistent results through differing assumptions. Therefore, this study aims at examining opportunity recognition as a process in the lens of Structuration Theory, enabling an interdisciplinary analysis between cognitive realms of agency and {{the social construction of}} opportunities. The study is designed as an abductive, multi-case study based on a proposed Structurationist Model of Opportunity Recognition (SMOR). The results show that entrepreneurial teams recognize discoveries in separate business and product development streams and socially created opportunities in interdisciplinary teams. Entrepreneurial teams recognizing discoveries are ineffective in reconciling product and business development to create product-market fits, but more effective in innovating. In contrast, entrepreneurial teams creating opportunities socially are ineffective in innovating, but effective in reconciling product and business development. Furthermore, the study finds that (i) prior knowledge supports the opportunity recognition process but only when the entrepreneurial team is aware of its knowledge-related assumptions, (ii) that the team members shall unify empathetic, hard-working, extroverted, and cooperative personalities, and (iii) that the engagement with the opportunity-related external environment, interdisciplinary collaborations, and in-depth projects foster the effectiveness of opportunity recognition process.
