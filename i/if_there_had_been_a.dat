Freiberger was very budget-conscious and, despite press releases to the contrary, the production team was working with less money this series. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> budget increase, the 'stagflation' economy of the seventies would have cancelled it out. When interviewed, many of the actors state they were asked to accept less money, including Landau and Bain (who were the only ones with enough clout to be able to refuse).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Federal {{legislation}} yields to state-regulated standard times in many diverse situations. For example, it yields {{in setting the}} normal working times of Federal employees, the recognition of public holidays, etc. The Federal government also relies on local times for Federal elections, so that the polls in Western Australia close {{two or three hours}} after those in the eastern states. Also, documents to be filed in a Federal Court may be filed based on the local time. The effect of this is that <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> failure to file a legal document on time in an eastern State, that document can sometimes still be filed (within two hours) in Western Australia.|$|E

Under the rules, the Director of the Mint called the assay commissioners to order, then introduced the federal judge who was an ex officio member, {{who presided over the}} meetings; if the judge was absent, the members elected a chairman. [...] The chairman divided the members into the committees. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> change of officers at a mint, commissioners examined coins from before and after.

500|$|Before {{discovering}} Larkin, Disney {{had been}} insisting on auditioning exclusively performers who {{were capable of}} singing {{as well as they}} could act. However, after Williams' recruitment, the studio relented in favor of casting [...] "strong actors" [...] instead. When Larkin first auditioned for the role, [...] "A Whole New World", Jasmine's only surviving song, had not yet been written; she admitted, [...] "there's no way I would have even auditioned... <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> song from the beginning." [...] After writing Jasmine's first song, the filmmakers asked Larkin if she would be interested in recording it and providing the character's singing voice. Larkin immediately declined, joking, [...] "I do ... but not like a princess!" [...] Thus, Disney decided to recruit a singer who could mimic Larkin's speaking voice instead, despite the actress' fear that the studio would completely replace her with a professional singer altogether.|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed {{heavily on}} his mind while he awaited trial.

[...] Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> plane crash". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as [...] "a nightmare which... plagued" [...] him for seven months. According to Redding, [...] "the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him" [...] and that he was in [...] "agonised suspense" [...] from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: [...] "The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination." [...] Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as [...] "Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind".|$|E

He also wrote that he had decided to kill both his mother and wife. Expressing uncertainty about his reasons, he nonetheless stated he did not believe his mother had [...] "ever enjoyed life as she is entitled to", and that his wife had [...] "been as fine a wife to me as any man could ever hope to have." [...] Whitman further explained that he wanted to relieve both his wife and mother of the suffering of this world, and to save them the embarrassment of his actions.

Marijuan, however, thought it should be incorporated into the existing case. His appeal was received by the Federal Chamber and upheld by judges Horacio Cattani, Martín Irurzun and Eduardo Farah. Casanello ordered [...] a search of Baez's house, including his safes. The investigation, 15 days after the accusation, was fruitless. Casanello also ordered a search of the walls, to determine <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> vault. The judge closed the cause after concluding that there never existed at Lázaro Báez's farm house the vaults that Lanata's TV report denounced as the storage of money related to its own accusations.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1953, Asimov was {{thumbing through}} {{a copy of}} the March 28, 1932 issue of Time and noticed what looked, at first glance, like a drawing of the {{mushroom}} cloud of a nuclear explosion. A closer look showed him that the drawing was actually a geyser, the Old Faithful. However, he began pondering the question of what the implications would be <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> drawing of a mushroom cloud in a magazine from 1932, and he eventually came up with the plot of a time travel story. He began the story, [...] "The End of Eternity," [...] on December 7, 1953, and he finished it on February 6, 1954, when it was 25,000 words long. Asimov submitted the story to Galaxy Science Fiction, and within days, he received a call from Galaxy editor Horace L. Gold that rejected the story. Asimov decided to turn the story into a novel, and on March 17, he left it with Walter I. Bradbury, the science fiction editor at Doubleday, to get his opinion. Bradbury was receptive, and by April 7, Asimov was informed that a contract for the novel was in the works. Asimov began expanding the story, eventually delivering the novel version to Bradbury on December 13. Doubleday accepted the novel, which was published in August 1955.|$|E
2500|$|Nor was Moniz {{the only}} medical {{practitioner}} in the 1930s to have contemplated procedures directly targeting the frontal lobes. Although ultimately discounting brain surgery as carrying too much risk, physicians and neurologists such as William Mayo, Thierry de Martel, Richard Brickner, and Leo Davidoff had, prior to 1935, entertained the proposition. Inspired by Julius Wagner-Jauregg's development of malarial therapy {{for the treatment}} of general paresis of the insane, the French physician Maurice Ducosté reported in 1932 that he had injected 5ml of malarial blood directly into the frontal lobes of over 100 paretic patients through holes drilled into the skull. He claimed that the injected paretics showed signs of [...] "uncontestable mental and physical amelioration" [...] and that the results for psychotic patients undergoing the procedure was also [...] "encouraging". The experimental injection of fever inducing malarial blood into the frontal lobes was also replicated during the 1930s in the work of Ettore Mariotti and M. Sciutti in Italy and Ferdière Coulloudon in France. In Switzerland, almost simultaneously with the commencement of Moniz's leucotomy programme, the neurosurgeon François Ody had removed the entire right frontal lobe of a catatonic schizophrenic patient. In Romania, Ody's procedure was adopted by Dimitri Bagdasar and Constantinesco working out of the Central Hospital in Bucharest. Ody, who delayed publishing his own results for several years, later rebuked Moniz for claiming to have cured patients through leucotomy without waiting to determine <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> [...] "lasting remission".|$|E
