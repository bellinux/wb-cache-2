40|$|So {{that the}} {{analysis}} of the large amount of information yielded by an echogram of the impulse response may be restricted by comparing different points of the room, investigations have been performed with the object of determining the absolute perceptibility thresholds for audibility of: (1) Discontinuities in reverberant decays, (2) deviations from regularity of a <b>flutter</b> <b>echo,</b> (3) later echos (delayed >or= 70 ms after the direct sound). For investigation 1, the decay of a large room (broadcasting studio, church) stimulated by the report of a starting pistol and recorded on magnetic tape was used. For investigations 2 and 3 the reverberation-free report was used for the electroacoustic synthesis of an impulse response. Very small thresholds occur for deviations from regularity of a <b>flutter</b> <b>echo</b> and for late echos whilst discontinuities in a reverberant decay are very hard to perceive...|$|E
40|$|Like {{in other}} Italian opera houses, “Teatro Nuovo ” in Spoleto (Italy) has horse-shoe shaped stalls and {{boxes in the}} balconies; however, {{the ceiling of the}} hall {{presents}} a strongly concave shape, and the orchestra pit is extraordinary extensive in consequence of some reconstruction works in the past. These geometrical characteristics influence the acoustical field for performance, and we have explored it with a measurement campaign moving the source positions in the performance areas (20 sound source positions either in the stage or in the pit). From the results, it comes out that the values of acoustical parameters calculated from 20 binaural impulse responses (BIRs) are too various to represent only one mean source position like usual measurements putting many receiver positions in the audience spaces. Moreover, in Teatro Nuovo, the concaved ceiling modifies the strength of reflections from it according to the source positions, and the large but low orchestra pit (floor; 12. 15 × 12. 84 m 2 and height; 2. 22 m) induces some resonance effects especially in the pit source positions covered by the forestage. The peculiar resonance can be visualized by introducing autocorrelation analysis of BIR after passing through the low-pass filtering (< 500 Hz). The acoustical parameters from the normalized ACF (Autocorrelation Function) of BIR would be useful to explain features of sound fields or to detect an acoustical problem like a <b>flutter</b> <b>echo...</b>|$|E
40|$|Étude d’un prélude II- <b>Flutter</b> <b>echoes</b> for {{string quartet}} {{is one of}} the first works to be based on the transcription, into {{standard}} notation, of millisecond-faithful micro-temporal data; the work was composed in 2009, premièred in 2010 and recorded in 2011. This article provides a first-hand account of its inception by the composer, Richard Beaudoin, and one of its first performers, Neil Heyde, cellist of the Kreuter Quartet. The micro-temporal data was collected using the Lucerne Audio Recording Analyzer [LARA], a powerful software developed by the acoustic researchers Dr Olivier Senn and Lorenz Kilchenmann of the Hochschule Lucerne, Switzerland. The object of their analysis, and the source work behind <b>Flutter</b> <b>echoes,</b> is Martha Argerich’s 1975 Deutsche Grammophon recording of Chopin’s Prelude in E minor, Op. 28, no. 4. [Audio excerpt from Flutter echoes] The first half of this paper provides insight into the work and the process of its composition, while the performer’s commentary presents an account of the practical and interpretative challenges presented by this compositional approach which, owing to its unique relationship to time, has been called ‘temporalism’...|$|R
40|$|The {{auditorium}} of the Bucharest National Theater {{has been}} equipped with devices permitting {{it to be}} transformed into three functional types of rooms for different types of productions. In view {{of the purpose of}} the room (spoken theater) and the volume of the room (3, 000 - 3, 600 cu m 3) the optimum reverberation time is 0. 95 sec at a frequency of 1, 000 Hz. By applying the different types of acoustic treatment, a reverberation time ranging from 0. 96 to 1. 06 sec was obtained. The problem of <b>flutter</b> <b>echoes</b> in the arena was solved by applying semispherical bodies to the fixed ceiling.

40|$|Auralizations {{generated}} by room acoustic computer modeling programs {{may be used}} as a tool for evaluation of acoustic qualities and defects, some of which are not easily detected by objective measures. Examples include reverberance, <b>flutter</b> <b>echoes,</b> perceived room size and distance, apparent source width, listener envelopment, and sound propagation in coupled rooms. In order to reach a sufficiently high level of realism in auralizations for such room acoustic applications it is necessary that all parts of the simulation chain are modeled with sufficient accuracy. In particular it is found that the modeling of source directivity and the late room reflections (the reverberation tail) need careful consideration in order to achieve reliable and realistic sounding results. However, when implemented in the software the application for practical use can be simple and quick...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{architects and}} {{designers}} build new churches primarily considering the architectural shape {{to emphasize the}} iconographic message without sufficiently investigating the acoustic climate. In many cases, designers propose elliptical or irregular geometries for the shapes of these buildings and, in addition, the furniture of indoor surfaces have unsuitable absorption and diffusivity coefficients. Thereby, it can be observed the arise of serious acoustical problems such as standing waves, <b>flutter</b> <b>echo,</b> sound focusing and intensive late reflections (greater than 100 ms) which seriously decrease speech intelligibility and diminish {{the effectiveness of the}} early sound energy. This paper presents the results of an acoustic survey on the Catholic Church “Invaluable Blood of Jesus”, situated in Ragusa (Italy), which is characterized by many problems mentioned above. During last years, some refurbishment interventions have attempted to reduce the acoustic discomfort, but an uncorrected approach has completely compromised the speech intelligibility, especially during liturgical functions. Recently, the authors have been involved to propose suitable interventions for improving the acoustic quality of this environment. Preliminarily, a measurement survey was conducted to evaluate the main acoustic indices (RT 60, STI, EDT, C 80, D 50) and portray the current acoustic climate. After that, it was developed an acoustic computer simulation on a 3 D model of the church, in order to calibrate the model comparing measured and simulated data. This procedure allowed testing the reliability and accuracy of the model. Finally, We propose two different interventions of acoustic correction. Globally it is possible to obtain an improvement of RT 60 from 7. 3 to 2. 5 s at 1 kHz and STI increases from 33 % to 40 %, at 1000 Hz...|$|E
40|$|Submitted {{thesis is}} a result of searching for {{relationships}} between music and space, between musical parameters and acoustical features of halls and objects for musical production. Throughout the history of music present a number of works have been composed which reflect a character of a particular space. The space is directly reflected in their tectonic structure or instrumentation. Twentieth century brought about an important change in perception of influences of the space on the listener. Within this context emerged collaborations between composers and architectures such as the cooperation on the Philips pavilion in Brussels between composer Edgard Var?se and architect Le Corbusier. Iannis Xenakis composer and architect in one person projects later the building Polyptops in Montréal. An important role in this change of perception has played the interest in the electro acoustical music from the fifties of the twentieth century onwards. The acoustic properties of architecture and acoustic phenomena within electro acoustic music form the basis of this thesis. It surveys the use of the principles of echo, reverberation, clarity, as well as <b>flutter</b> <b>echo</b> or ?reverse? of reverberation within these compositions. The analyses of these primary and derived acoustic phenomena in musical piece form the focus of this thesis. Whole thesis is divided into two main parts: First part describes acoustic properties of halls utilized in music and the principles of creating of a space with particular acoustic properties as described in a theory of building. Several conceptual types of space are distinguished here. Second part analyses selected compositions {{from the point of view}} of incorporating the space or spatial principles within its musical tectonics. Historical compositions from Lasso, Gabrieli, Tallis, Vivaldi?, but above all twentieth century compositions of Ives, Martinů, Kopelent or Nono are analyzed. Analyses are chosen that way to have such spectrum of pieces which are different in ways of working with space but which can simultaneously be complementary one to the other. This part also summarizes findings from analyzed compositions which are sorted by given phenomena...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn large rooms, {{where many}} people gather such as atria, food courts or restaurants, {{relatively}} high noise levels can occur, due to so called “Lombard effect”. The “Lombard effect” is a reflex of vocal chords {{that relates to}} changes of the voice characteristics in noisy background. Typically an increase of the vocal intensity, the fundamental voice frequency, and the word duration will occur. Noise levels in an enclosed place are influenced {{not only by the}} amount and character of sound sources present, but also by the overall reverberation of sound in the space. This article deals with the investigation of the acoustic conditions in three large gathering places covered by glass and foils. We focus on the investigation of the influence of the amount and position of sound absorption in atria on their reverberation time and on the occurrence of various sound phenomena, such as <b>flutter</b> <b>echoes,</b> focusing of sound etc. Results of the measurements are used for calibration of acoustical models. Different architectural solutions simulated in ray-based software are compared...|$|R

Three signs are described. (I) Non-coaptation of the leaflets (55 %). (2) Systolic <b>fluttering</b> <b>echo</b> {{in the left}} atrium originating from the mitral valve (20 %). (3) A previously not described small diastolic chaotically moving echo in the short axis section of the left ventricle {{at the level of}} the papillary muscles (65 %). The combined sensitivity of these three signs was 85 %. The specificity of the three signs when compared with those of J 07 {{patients with}} mitral regurgitation of different aetiologies studied by cross-sectional echocardiography was 99 %, 100 % and 99 %, respectively. Six patients were studied after mitral valve repair; restriction of the surgical treated leaflet and reduction of its valve area was seen in all of them, and the disappearance of the valvar signs of ruptured chordae noted.

5000|$|The Boettcher Concert Hall is the nation’s first symphony hall in-the-round, {{designed}} {{to place the}} audience close to the stage in a unique environment - 80% of the seats are within 65 feet of the stage, There are no true vertical or horizontal surfaces inside Boettcher Concert Hall; the walls are canted at a slight angle to disperse sound and prevent <b>flutter</b> <b>echoes.</b> On each curved surface of the hall is a wave-like band, approximately four feet high, technically called an undulating acoustical facia. These facias diffuse, reflect and channel sound throughout the venue. The seats in Boettcher are custom-designed, made from steam-bent wood with their backs varying in height from 42 inches to 48 inches.The acoustical moat, located underneath the stage is essential in the surround design, it acts as a reverberate chamber for low frequency sound. The Canopy features 108 circular discs which is the primary device for distribution of sound to the musicians {{as well as the}} audience. These discs effect certain lighting positions on the catwalks and ring hangers." [...] In 1993, the theater underwent a major acoustical renovation. The height of the seat backs was adjusted, additional acoustic reflectors were added, and acoustic curtains were installed which allow the theater to be tuned for specific performances—even during a performance.|$|R
40|$|Courtyards {{surrounded}} by buildings often have acoustic defects such as strong <b>flutter</b> <b>echoes</b> and long reverberation time (RT) that can increase noise annoyance. Therefore, {{it is important}} to absorb and diffuse sound energy propagating such places. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate how applicable landscape designs can contribute to controlling sound fields in a courtyard, with particular attention to the acoustic effects of vegetation. Through a case study, differences between courtyard sound fields were examined by in situ measurements before and after applying a practical landscape design using vegetation, wood decking and street furniture. In addition, computer simulations were carried out to explore the acoustic effects of applicable landscape designs using vegetation including climbing Ivy, green wall, grass and bedding plants. The results for the in situ measurements showed reductions in sound levels and RT 20 at 500 Hz of 3. 1 dB and 40 % (1. 0 s), respectively. The results for the computer simulation showed that the green wall on the façade can reduce speech levels and RT 20 at 500 Hz by 9. 3 dBA and 81 % (2. 1 s), respectively. The bedding plants on the ground decreased the speech level by 2. 2 dBA and increased RT at 500 Hz by 12 % (0. 3 s). At different floor levels in the accommodation building, the speech level and RT 20 at 500 Hz were decreased by the vegetation by up to 5. 5 dBA and 66 % (1. 1 s), respectively...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{moveable}} loudspeaker and an implanted microphone, {{we studied}} the sound pressure {{transformation of the}} external ears of 47 species of bats from 13 families. We compared pinna gain, directionality of hearing and interaural intensity differences (IID) in echolocating and non-echolocating bats, in species using different echolocation strategies and in species that depend upon prey-generated sounds to locate their targets. In the Pteropodidae, two echolocating species had slightly higher directionality than a non-echolocating species. The ears of phyllostomid and vespertilionid species showed moderate directionality. In the Mormoopidae, the ear directionality of P erono us parnelliiclearly matched the dominant spectral component of its echolocation calls, unlike the situation in three other species. Species in the Emballonuridae, Molossidae, Rhinopomatidae and two vespertilionids that use narrow-band search-phase echolocation calls showed increasingly sharp tuning of the pinna to the main frequency of their signals. Similar tuning was most evident in Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae, species specialized for <b>flutter</b> detection viaDoppler-shifted <b>echoes</b> of high-duty-cycle narrow-band signals. The large pinnae of bats that use prey-generated sounds to find their targets supply high sound pressure gain at lower frequencies. Increasing domination of a narrow spectral band in echolocation {{is reflected in the}} passive acoustic properties of the external ears (sharper directionality). The importance of IIDs for lateralization and horizontal localization is discussed by comparing the behavioural directional performance of bats with their bioacoustical features...|$|R
