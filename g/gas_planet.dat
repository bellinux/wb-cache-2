5000|$|The {{planet is}} {{estimated}} to be about five times Earth's mass (5.5 [...] ). Some astronomers have speculated that it may have a rocky core like Earth, with a thin atmosphere. Its distance from the star, and the star's relatively low temperature, means that the planet's likely surface temperature is around 50 K, {{making it one of the}} coldest known. If it is a rocky world, this temperature would make it likely that the surface would be made of frozen volatiles, substances which would be liquids or gases on Earth: water, ammonia, methane and nitrogen would all be frozen solid. If it is not a rocky planet, it would more closely resemble an icy <b>gas</b> <b>planet</b> like Uranus, although much smaller.|$|E
5000|$|Several exoplanets {{have been}} {{discovered}} that are possibly gas dwarfs, based on known masses and densities.

[...] The even smaller Kepler-138d, having only roughly Earth's mass, is also suspected to be a <b>gas</b> <b>planet</b> due to its relatively large diameter (~20,500 km) and therefore low density. Such planets are not found orbiting too close to their parent stars, where their thick atmospheres would be evaporated by heat or blown away by stellar winds.

50|$|Gaseous planets {{that are}} hot {{is because they}} are close to their star, or because they are still hot from their {{formation}} and are expanded by the heat.

40|$|Core Accretion (CA), the de-facto {{accepted}} {{theory of}} planet formation, requires formation of massive solid cores {{as a prerequisite}} for assembly of <b>gas</b> giant <b>planets.</b> The observed metallicity correlations of exoplanets are puzzling {{in the context of}} CA. While <b>gas</b> giant <b>planets</b> are found preferentially around metal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts {{with a wide range of}} metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these observations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation hypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD). We perform population synthesis calculations based on TD, and find that the connection between the populations of the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear and not even monotonic. While <b>gas</b> giant <b>planets</b> formed in the simulations in the inner few AU region follow a strong positive correlation with the host star metallicity, the smaller planets do not. The simulated population of these smaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around the Solar metallicity. This result is driven by the fact that at low metallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals, whereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores grow contract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. Finally, simulated giant <b>gas</b> <b>planets</b> do not show a strong host star metallicity preference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best known directly imaged <b>gas</b> giant <b>planet</b> systems, HR 8799, is metal poor.
