50|$|Agriculture {{and urban}} {{expansion}} are encroaching upon remaining habitats in the California Floristic Province. Commercial farming {{in the region}} generates half of all agricultural products consumed by the United States population. The large farms that grow from this demand cause the greater loss of the biodiversity hotspot’s natural un-renewable resources. California {{has one of the}} highest human populations rendering it one of the four most ecologically degraded expanses in the United States. Other threats include invasive species colonisation, strip mining, oil <b>extraction,</b> <b>air</b> pollution, soil contamination, livestock grazing, wildfires (excessive heat or frequency types), and construction of building developments and roads. Global warming presents future threats. Research done by United States Ecologist, Dr. Erik Beever, suggests that global warming may have had a hand in the local extinction of the pika populations in the Great Basin area east of the Sierra Nevada. More research proposes that as the temperature keeps rising, alpine species will begin to migrate north looking for cooler climates that can support more of a sustainable habitat. Reducing emissions from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas is the first step in the fight against global warming.|$|E

40|$|The {{permeability}} of soil to {{fluid flow}} defines {{the magnitude of}} soil gas and groundwater flow under imposed pressure gradients. Pressure gradients exist due to natural effects such as hydraulic gradients (in the case of groundwater) and barometrically imposed gradients (in the case of soil gas).

40|$|The energy {{performance}} of buildings with considerable annual heat load {{is dependent on}} the ventilation air change rates (ACH). Buildings utilized for commercial use often have high ACH and therefore high annual heat load.

Annual modeling shows that by retrofitting a well-designed 3 stage heat pump to the system the annual heat recovery rate for the Stockholm Case can be increased from 47 % to 65 %. For the retrofitted variable capacity heat pump the numbers for the Stockholm Case is an improvement of annual heat recovery from 47 % to 66 %.

40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} {{results from the}} patent search and review of domestic and foreign publications in variable cycle engines (VCE) was created a classification of the possible schematic diagrams of VCE realizing three-stream engine technologies (the adaptive low pressure compressor (LPC) with air extraction behind stages, FLADE compressor, various feeding types of <b>extraction</b> <b>air</b> to the flowing path of the engine, etc.). To estimate a three-stream engine application {{as a part of}} the power-plant (PP) efficiency, was chosen an adaptive LPC technology scheme with the third contour air bypass beyond the critical section of a basic jet nozzle for which a mathematical model (MM) of the PP has been created on the basis of one-dimensional MM of the engine. The MM of the PP included 3 D modeling results of the air inlet, the LPC with various air extractions to the third contour, and the jet nozzle taking into account the interaction between the basic stream and the third contour stream. The predicted performance of an air inlet have been used to estimate the changes in a total pressure restoration coefficient and an additional resistance coefficient along «a fluid contour» when air extraction is included in the third contour in several cruiser modes of flight. An integrated characteristic of the LPC has been received at various points and levels of air extraction to the third contour, and parameters of extracted air (depending on the point and amount of air extraction, and also on the fan operating mode) have been calculated. When analyzing the obtained calculation results, the effect of pressure lines displacement to the right (towards the large reduced rates), growth of efficiency values, and also position displacement of its maximum value to the left (towards the descent reduced rates) has been found. To estimate how air extraction of the third contour between the plates of an adjustable supersonic nozzle impacts on its aft deck resistance various parameters of the flowing out air in subsonic cruiser mode of flight have been calculated. As a result of calculations according to the PP MM, under near-the-earth conditions of the subsonic cruiser flight, the effective specific fuel consumption has been reduced by 12, 5 %. The results reached allow us to expect significant subsonic effective fuel conservation of the three-stream engine. To prove the calculated results it is further necessary to achieve them under full-scale conditions using the engine-demonstrator. </p...|$|E

All of these processes produce a VOC-laden air stream from which the VOC must be removed before the air can be discharged or recycled to the generating process. Treatment of these off-gases is often {{a major portion of}} the cost of the remediation project. Currently, carbon adsorption and catalytic incineration are the most common methods of treating these gas streams. Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. (MTR) proposed an alternative treatment technology based on selective membranes that separate the organic components from the gas stream, producing a VOC-free air stream. This technology can be applied to off-gases produced by various remediation activities and the systems can be skid-mounted and automated for easy transportation and unattended operation. The target performance for the membrane systems is to produce clean air (less than 10 ppmv VOC) for discharge or recycle, dischargeable water (less than 1 ppmw VOC), and a concentrated liquid VOC phase. This report contains the results obtained during Phase II of a two-phase project. In Phase I, laboratory experiments were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. In the subsequent Phase II project, a demonstration system was built and operated at the McClellan Air Force Base near Sacramento, California. The membrane system was fed with off-gas from a Soil Vacuum Extraction (SVE) system. The work performed in Phase II demonstrated that the membrane system can reduce the VOC concentration in remediation off-gas to 10 ppmv, while producing a concentrated VOC phase and dischargeable water containing less than 1 ppmw VOC. However, the tests showed that the presence of 1 to 3 % carbon dioxide in the SVE off-gas reduced the treatment capacity of the system by a factor of three to four. In an economic analysis, treatment costs of the membrane system were compared with those of catalytic oxidation and carbon adsorption. This analysis showed that the treatment costs of the membrane system are higher than those of the competing technologies in the VOC concentration range up to 1 %. Catalytic oxidation is the most economical treatment technology for off-gases containing VOCs in the range 50 ppmv to 1 %, whereas carbon adsorption (off-site regeneration) is the most economical for VOC concentrations less than 50 ppmv. Because the VOC concentration in the vast majority of remediation off-gases is below 1 %, we conclude that the usefulness of membrane VOC-separation systems for remediation applications will be very limited...|$|E

40|$|In a world {{increasingly}} concerned with fuel prices, sustainability and the environment, energy efficiency improvements are indispensable. In this framework, Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion technology {{can play a}} significant role in the mitigation of combustion-generated pollutants and greenhouse gases, whilst meeting thermal efficiency needs. Under MILD conditions, reactants are highly diluted with combustion products causing reactions to occur in a distributed reaction zone with a reduced peak temperature. As a consequence, the temperature distribution is nearly uniform, and pollutant emissions, nitrogen oxides (NOx) in particular, are lower than from conventional flames. Over the past few decades, MILD combustion technology has been implemented at full scale in various industrial sectors and tested at pilot scale in other applications. Nevertheless, despite considerable industrial success, many important issues of MILD combustion remain unresolved. The current research seeks to characterise the MILD regime in a furnace environment burning gaseous fuels through a combined experimental and numerical modelling approach. This study describes the performance and stability characteristics of a parallel jet MILD combustion burner system in a laboratory-scale furnace, in which the reactants and exhaust ports are all mounted on the same wall. In-furnace temperatures and global emissions are measured, respectively with fine-wire thermocouples and a gas analyser, for a wide range of operating conditions. In addition, velocities for selected cases are measured using laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). The detailed experimental data set is then used to validate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. In combination, the experimental and numerical data reveal details of the passive and reactive scalar fields, and enable not only the investigation of the parameters that influence their structure and pollutant formation, but also insight into the contribution of flue gas recirculation to flame stability under MILD conditions. The present furnace/burner configuration proved to operate without the need for external air preheating, and achieved a high degree of temperature uniformity. The analysis of the furnace aerodynamics and qualitative observations of the burner exit region revealed that effective mixing is essential in order to increase dilution before reaction to ensure stability of this multiple jet system. Unlike in previous investigations, the fuel jet momentum is found to control the stability of this multiple jet system. The CO formation is found to be related to the mixing patterns and furnace temperature rather than reaction quenching by the heat exchanger. It is found that, although heat <b>extraction,</b> <b>air</b> preheat, excess air, firing rate, dilution, and fuel type all affect NOx emissions, they do not control NOx scaling. The combined effects of these global parameters can be ultimately characterized by a furnace temperature and a global residence time. The quantitative analysis of NOx emissions demonstrated the nondominant role of the thermal-NO pathway in the present MILD combustion conditions. It has been revealed that the N 2 O-intermediate pathway is the dominant NOx formation mechanism, while the prompt-NO mechanism is negligible. There is potential for NO reburning for this parallel jet burner configuration. Despite the complexity of the recirculating flow inside the furnace, the CFD model agrees reasonably well with the experimental data. It is noted from the CFD analysis that finite-rate chemistry must be included for accurate predictions of MILD combustion conditions. The fundamental aspects revealed by this study provide unique advancements in the understanding of MILD combustion that will assist in the effort to extend this technology to other heat and power systems.
