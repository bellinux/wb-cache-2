40|$|Continuing the {{investigation}} on the electronic {{properties of the}} thiosemicarbazide based compounds [1] we have collected the high resolution low temperature diffraction data for 4 -methyl- 3 -thiosemicarbazide. Here we present the crystal structure of this compound based on the high resolution data set. This preliminary analysis should serve {{as an indicator of}} the quality of the data for the following charge density study. The single crystal X-ray analysis revealed that an asymmetric unit in the crystal structure of the analyzed compound contains two crystallographically independent molecules. The molecules show only small differences in bond distances and angles, but they have <b>dissimilar</b> <b>network</b> of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Both molecules form numerous interactions of N−H···S, N−H···N and C−H···N type. The molecules B form dimers through N 3 b−H 3 b···N 1 b interactions and further via intermolecular N 1 b−H 11 b···S 1 b interactions form a chain of dimers. Preliminary electron density maps, which can serve as pointer of quality of the data, were determined for both independent molecules. These maps clearly indicate that the maxima of charge density are localized in the region of C−N, N−N and C−S bonds. Also, maxima exist in the vicinity of the N 1, N 2 and S 1 atoms corresponding to their free electron pairs. The X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100. 0 (1) K on a Bruker-SMART three axis diffractometer equipped with a SMART 1000 CCD area detector using monochromated Mo Kα radiation (wavelength λ = 0. 71073 Å) in the range 0 3 σ(I) and 165 refined parameters.

40|$|Real time {{communications}} have, in {{the last}} decade, become a highly relevant component of Internet applications and services, with both interactive communications and streamed content being used in developed and developing countries alike. Due to the proliferation of mobile devices, wireless media is becoming the means of transmitting {{a large part of}} this increasingly important real time communications traffic. Wireless has also become an important technology in developing countries, with satellite communications being increasingly deployed for traffic backhaul and ubiquitous connection to the Internet. A number of issues need to be addressed in order to have an acceptable service quality for real time communications in wireless environments. In addition to this, the availability of multiple wireless interfaces on mobile devices presents an opportunity to improve and further exacerbates the issues already present on single wireless links. Therefore in this thesis, we consider improvements to transport protocols for real time communications and streaming services to address these problems and we provide the following contributions. To deal with wireless link issues of errors and delay, we propose two enhancements. First, an improvement technique for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol CCID 4 for long delay wireless (e. g. satellite) links, demonstrating significant performance improvements for Voice over IP applications. To deal with link errors, we have proposed, implemented and evaluated an erasure coding based packet error correction approach for Concurrent Multipath Transfer extension of Stream Control Transport Protocol data transport over multiple wireless paths. We have identified packet reordering as a major cause of performance degradation in both single and multi-path transport protocols for real time communications and media streaming. We have proposed a dynamically resizable buffer based solution to mitigate this problem within the DCCP protocol. For improving the performance of multi-path transport protocols over <b>dissimilar</b> <b>network</b> paths, we have proposed a delay aware packet scheduling scheme, which significantly improves the performance of multimedia and bulk data transfer with CMT-SCTP in heterogeneous multi-path network scenarios.

In each complex the ligand is deprotonated giving neutral species with 1 ? 1 stoichiometry that form three-dimensional coordination polymers. Supramolecular isomerism (polymorphism) in 1 and 2 {{arises from the}} different ligand connectivity around the octahedral Co(II) centres. The two coordinated water molecules in 1 occupy cis positions, which are trans to the chelating bipyridine nitrogen atoms, leaving the carboxylate oxygen atoms in axial trans positions. In 2 all like donors occupy cis positions. Different modes of carboxylate coordination in 1 and 2 give <b>dissimilar</b> <b>network</b> topologies. A rare example of two interpenetrating 6482 -b (quartz-like) chiral networks in 1 results from both dcbp carboxylate groups coordinating in a monodentate fashion to adjacent Co(II) centres, whereas in 2 only one carboxylate group bridges between adjacent Co(II) centres giving rise to a single chiral (10, 3) -a net. In 1 and 2 the coordinated water molecules hydrogen bond to the non-coordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms. These interactions give rise to water–carboxylate double helices in 1, and support the coordination network in 2. Strikingly {{for a pair of}} dimorphs the crystal densities of 1 and 2 differ by ca. 0. 3 g cm? 3 (1. 654 vs. 1. 940 g cm? 3, respectively). Compound 3 is isomorphous with 1 and likewise features two chiral interpenetrating nets of quartz topology. In 4, chelating bipyridine nitrogen atoms and four carboxylate oxygen atoms from a total of five adjacent dcbp ligands provide distorted octahedral geometry around Mn(II). The carboxylate groups bridge adjacent Mn(II) centres to produce bis-carboxylato chains which cross-link and generate a 3 D network that is perforated with channels. The channels are occupied with disordered DEF molecules. The network topology in 4 is quite different to 1 – 3 and has a (4. 62) (42. 6) (43. 66. 86) Schläfli notation.

This research discusses the need to trigger a vertical handoff based on changes in the mobile environment independent of geographic changes of a user.

40|$|Species {{living in}} highly {{fragmented}} landscapes typically occur as metapopulations with frequent turnover of local populations. The turnover rate depends on population sizes and connectivities, {{but it may}} also depend on the phenotypic and genotypic composition of populations. The Glanville fritillary butterfly ("Melitaea cinxia") in Finland uses two host plant species, which show variation in their relative abundances at two spatial scales: locally among individual habitat patches and regionally among networks of patches. Female butterflies in turn exhibit spatial variation in genetically-determined host plant preference within and among patch networks. Emigration, immigration and establishment of new populations have all been shown to be strongly influenced by the match between the host plant composition of otherwise suitable habitat patches and the host plant preference of migrating butterflies. The evolutionary consequences of such biased migration and colonization with respect to butterfly phenotypes might differ depending on spatial configuration and plant species composition of the patches in heterogenous patch networks. Using a spatially realistic individual-based model we show that the model-predicted evolution of host plant preference due to biased migration explains a significant amount of the observed variation in host plant use among metapopulations living in <b>dissimilar</b> <b>networks.</b> This example illustrates how the ecological extinction-colonization dynamics may be linked with the evolutionary dynamics of life history traits in metapopulations...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a vertical handover decision (VHD) scheme for optimizing {{the efficiency of}} vertical handover processes in the Fourth Generation (4 G) heterogeneous wireless networks. The scheme consists of three closely integrated modules: Handover necessity estimation, handover target selection, and handover triggering condition estimation. Handover necessity estimation module determines whether a handover is necessary to an available network. Handover target selection module chooses the ``best'' network among the available candidates based {{on a set of}} criteria. Finally, handover triggering condition estimation module determines the right moment to initiate a handover out of the currently connected network. 4 G wireless networks are expected to support mechanisms for tight integration and cooperation of divergent access network technologies. In such networks of heterogeneous nature, roaming users will experience frequent handovers across network boundaries.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.) The buzzword of {{this decade}} has been {{convergence}}: the convergence of telecommunications, Internet, entertainment, and information technologies for the seamless provisioning of multimedia services across different network types. Thus the future Next Generation Mobile Network (NGMN) can be envisioned {{as a group of}} co-existing heterogeneous mobile data networking technologies sharing a common Internet Protocol (IP) based backbone. In such all-IP based heterogeneous networking environments, ongoing sessions from roaming users are subjected to frequent vertical handoffs across network boundaries. Therefore, ensuring uninterrupted service continuity during session handoffs requires successful mobility and session management mechanisms to be implemented in these participating access networks. Therefore, it is essential for a common interworking framework to be in place for ensuring seamless service continuity over <b>dissimilar</b> <b>networks</b> to enable a potential user to freely roam from one network to another. For the best of our knowledge, the need for a suitable unified mobility and session management framework for the NGMN has not been successfully addressed as yet. This {{can be seen as the}} primary motivation of this research. Therefore, the key objectives of this thesis can be stated as: 	To propose a mobility-aware novel architecture for interworking between heterogeneous mobile data networks 	To propose a framework for facilitating unified real-time session management (inclusive of session establishment and seamless session handoff) across these different networks. In order to achieve the above goals, an interworking architecture is designed by incorporating the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as the coupling mediator between dissipate mobile data networking technologies. Subsequently, two different mobility management frameworks are proposed and implemented over the initial interworking architectural design. The first mobility management framework is fully handled by the IMS at the Application Layer. This framework is primarily dependant on the IMS’s default session management protocol, which is the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The second framework is a combined method based on SIP and the Mobile IP (MIP) protocols, which is essentially operated at the Network Layer. An analytical model is derived for evaluating the proposed scheme for analyzing the network Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and measures involved in session mobility management for the proposed mobility management frameworks. More precisely, these analyzed QoS metrics include vertical handoff delay, transient packet loss, jitter, and signaling overhead/cost. The results of the QoS analysis indicates that a MIP-SIP based mobility management framework performs better than its predecessor, the Pure-SIP based mobility management method. Also, the analysis results indicate that the QoS performances for the investigated parameters are within acceptable levels for real-time VoIP conversations. An OPNET based simulation platform is also used for modeling the proposed mobility management frameworks. All simulated scenarios prove to be capable of performing successful VoIP session handoffs between <b>dissimilar</b> <b>networks</b> whilst maintaining acceptable QoS levels. Lastly, based on the findings, the contributions made by this thesis can be summarized as: 	The development of a novel framework for interworked heterogeneous mobile data networks in a NGMN environment. 	The final design conveniently enables 3 G cellular technologies (such as the Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS) or Code Division Multiple Access 2000 (CDMA 2000) type systems), Wireless Local Area Networking (WLAN) technologies, and Wireless Metropolitan Area Networking (WMAN) technologies (e. g., Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) systems such as WiMAX) to interwork under a common signaling platform. 	The introduction of a novel unified/centralized mobility and session management platform by exploiting the IMS as a universal coupling mediator for real-time session negotiation and management. 	This enables a roaming user to seamlessly handoff sessions between different heterogeneous networks. 	As secondary outcomes of this thesis, an analytical framework and an OPNET simulation framework are developed for analyzing vertical handoff performance. This OPNET simulation platform is suitable for commercial use...|$|R

40|$|By {{allowing}} end hosts to make routing decisions at {{the application}} level, different overlay networks may unintentionally interfere with each other. This paper describes how multiple similar or <b>dissimilar</b> overlay <b>networks</b> making independent routing decisions could experience race conditions, resulting in oscillations in both route selection and network load. We pinpoint the causes for synchronization {{in terms of}} partially overlapping routes and periodic path probing processes and derive an analytic formulation for the synchronization probability of two overlays. Our model indicates that the probability of synchronization is non-negligible across {{a wide range of}} parameter settings, thus implying that the ill-effects of synchronization should not be ignored. Using the analytical model, we find an upper bound on the duration of traffic oscillations. We validate our model through simulations that are designed to capture the transient routing behavior of both the IP- and overlaylayers. We use our model to study the effects of factors such as path diversity (measured in round trip times) and probing aggressiveness on these race conditions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our study on the design of overlay networks and the choice of their path probing parameters. ...|$|R
