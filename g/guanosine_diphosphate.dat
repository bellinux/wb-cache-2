G-protein is a trimeric protein. The 3 subunits are called α、β and γ. The α subunit can bind with <b>guanosine</b> <b>diphosphate,</b> GDP. This causes phosphorylation of the GDP to guanosine triphosphate, GTP, and activates the α subunit to then dissociate from the β and γ subunits.

25|$|A {{catabolic pathway}} {{is a series}} of {{reactions}} that bring about a net release of energy {{in the form of a}} high energy phosphate bond formed with the energy carriers Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and <b>Guanosine</b> <b>Diphosphate</b> (GDP) to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), respectively. The net reaction is, therefore, thermodynamically favorable, for it results in a lower free energy for the final products. A catabolic pathway is an exergonic system that produces chemical energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, etc. from energy containing sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The end products are often carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Coupled with an endergonic reaction of anabolism, the cell can synthesize new macromolecules using the original precursors of the anabolic pathway. An example of a coupled reaction is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to form the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phsophofructokinase accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP in the pathway of glycolysis. The resulting chemical reaction within the metabolic pathway is highly thermodynamically favorable and, as a result, irreversible in the cell.|$|E

Con-ditions for both stimulation and inhibition of adenylate cyclase by guanine nucleotides in membranes are reported. Stimulation and inhbition were induced by GTP and non-hydrolysable guanosine triphosphates. GDP and non-hydrolysable <b>guanosine</b> <b>diphosphates</b> were antagonists. Stimulation was maximally twofold, required a cytosolic factor and was observed only at temperatures below 10 “C. An agonist of the CAMP-receptor-activated basal and GTP-stimulated adenylate cyclase 1. 3 -fold. Adenylate cyclase in mutant N 7 {{could not be}} activated by cAMP in vivo; in vitro adenylate cyclase was activated by guanine nucleotides {{in the presence of}} the cytosolic factor of wild-type but of not mutant cells. Preincubation of membranes under phosphorylation conditions has been shown to alter the interaction between cAMP receptor and G protein [Van Haastert (1986) J. Biof. Chem. in the press]. These phosphorylation conditions converted stimulation to inhibition of adenylate cyclase by guanine nucleotides. Inhibition was maximally 30 % and was not affected by the cytosolic factor involved in stimulation. In membranes obtained from cells that were treated with pertussis toxin, adenylate cyclase stimulation by guanine nucleotides was as in control cells, whereas inhibition by guanine nucleotides was lost.

500|$|The {{entry and}} exit of large {{molecules}} from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit. [...] "Cargo" [...] proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases, enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran, which can bind either GTP or GDP (<b>guanosine</b> <b>diphosphate),</b> depending on whether it {{is located in the}} nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.|$|E
2500|$|GTPases are {{enzymes that}} bind to a {{molecule}} called guanosine triphosphate (GTP) which they then hydrolyze to create <b>guanosine</b> <b>diphosphate</b> (GDP) and release energy. [...] Ran is {{in a different}} conformation depending on whether it is bound to GTP or GDP. In its GDP bound state, Ran is capable of binding karyopherins (importins and exportins). [...] Importins release cargo upon binding to RanGTP, while exportins must bind RanGTP to form a ternary complex with their export cargo. The dominant nucleotide binding state of Ran depends on whether it {{is located in the}} nucleus (RanGTP) or the cytoplasm (RanGDP).|$|E
2500|$|Ras is a G protein, or a guanosine-nucleotide-binding protein. Specifically, it is a single-subunit small GTPase, {{which is}} related in {{structure}} to the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (large GTPases). G proteins function as binary signaling switches with [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] states. In the [...] "off" [...] state it {{is bound to}} the nucleotide <b>guanosine</b> <b>diphosphate</b> (GDP), while in the [...] "on" [...] state, Ras is bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which has an extra phosphate group as compared to GDP. This extra phosphate holds the two switch regions in a [...] "loaded-spring" [...] configuration (specifically the Thr-35 and Gly-60). When released, the switch regions relax which causes a conformational change into the inactive state. Hence, activation and deactivation of Ras and other small G proteins are controlled by cycling between the active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms.|$|E
40|$|Autophagy is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved {{process that}} enables catabolic and degradative pathways. These pathways commonly depend on vesicular transport controlled by Rabs, small GTPases inactivated by TBC/RabGAPs. The Rac 1 effector TBC/RabGAP Armus (TBC 1 D 2 A) {{is known to}} inhibit Rab 7, a key regulator of lysosomal function. However, the precise coordination of signaling and intracellular trafficking that regulates autophagy is poorly understood. We find that overexpression of Armus induces the accumulation of enlarged autophagosomes, while Armus depletion significantly delays autophagic flux. Upon starvation-induced autophagy, Rab 7 is transiently activated. This spatiotemporal regulation of Rab 7 <b>guanosine</b> triphosphate/guanosine <b>diphosphate</b> cycling occurs by Armus recruitment to autophagosomes via interaction with LC 3, a core autophagy regulator. Interestingly, autophagy potently inactivates Rac 1. Active Rac 1 competes with LC 3 for interaction with Armus and thus prevents its appropriate recruitment to autophagosomes. The precise coordination between Rac 1 and Rab 7 activities during starvation suggests that Armus integrates autophagy with signaling and endocytic trafficking...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain insight into the {{molecular}} mechanisms involved in interleukin- 9 (IL- 9) activities, representational difference analysis (RDA) was used to identify messages that are induced by IL- 9 in a murine T-helper-cell clone. One of the isolated genes encodes for the newly described M-Ras or R-Ras 3, {{which is part of}} the Pas gene superfamily. M-Ras expression was found to be induced by IL- 9 but not IL- 2 or IL- 4 in various murine T-helper-cell clones, and this induction seems to be dependent on the JAK/STAT pathway. Contrasting with the potent upregulation of M-Ras expression, M-Ras was not activated by IL- 9 at the level of <b>guanosine</b> triphosphate/guanosine <b>diphosphate</b> (GTP/GDP) binding. However, IL- 3 increased GTP binding to M-Ras, suggesting that M-Ras induction might represent a new mechanism of cooperativity between cytokines such as IL- 3 and IL- 9, Constitutively activated M-Ras mutants induced activation of Elk transcription factor by triggering the MAP kinase pathway and allowed for IL- 3 -independent proliferation of BaF 3 cells. Taken together, these results show that cytokines such as IL- 9 can regulate the expression of a member of the RAS family possibly involved in growth-factor signal transduction.

40|$|We have {{characterized}} a magnesium-dependent {{guanylate cyclase}} in homogenates of Dictyostelium discoideum cells. 1) The enzyme shows an up to 4 -fold higher cGMP synthesis {{in the presence}} of GTP analogues with half-maximal activation at about 1 µM guanosine 5 ’-O-(3 -thio) triphosphate (GTPγS) or 100 µM guanosine 5 ’-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate; little or no stimulation was observed with GTP, <b>guanosine</b> mono- and <b>diphosphates</b> or with adenine nucleotides, {{with the exception of the}} ATP analogue adenosine 5 ’-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate. 2) Both basal and GTPγS-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity were rapidly lost from homogenates as was the ability of GTPγS to stimulate the enzyme after cell lysis. 3) Inclusion of 25 µM GTPγS during cell lysis reduced the KM for GTP from 340 to 85 µM and increased the Vmax from 120 to 255 pmol/min∙mg protein, as assayed in homogenates 90 s after cell lysis. 4) Besides acting as an activator, GTPγS was also a substrate for the enzyme with a KM = 120 µM and a Vmax = 115 pmol/min∙mg protein. 5) GTPγS-stimulated, Mg 2 +-dependent guanylate cyclase was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of Ca 2 + ions, and by inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate in the absence of Ca 2 + chelators. 6) Guanylate cyclase activity was detected in both supernatant and pellet fractions after 1 min centrifugation at 10, 000 × g; however, only sedimentable enzyme was stimulated by GTPγS. We suggest that the Mg 2 +-dependent guanylate cyclase identified represents the enzyme that in intact cells is regulated via cell surface receptors, and we propose that guanine nucleotides are allosteric activators of this enzyme and that Ca 2 + ions play a role in the maintenance of the enzyme in its basal state. ...|$|R
2500|$|When the {{receptor}} is inactive, the GEF domain may {{be bound}} to an also inactive α-subunit of a heterotrimeric G-protein. These [...] "G-proteins" [...] are a trimer of α, β, and γ subunits (known as Gα, Gβ, and Gγ, respectively) that is rendered inactive when reversibly bound to <b>Guanosine</b> <b>diphosphate</b> (GDP) (or, alternatively, no guanine nucleotide) but active when bound to Guanosine triphosphate (GTP).
