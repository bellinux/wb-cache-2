25|$|Yield {{strength}} {{is the critical}} material property exploited by many fundamental techniques of material-working: to reshape material with pressure (such as forging, rolling, pressing, or <b>hydroforming),</b> to separate material by cutting (such as machining) or shearing, and to join components rigidly with fasteners. Yield load can be taken as the load applied to the centre of a carriage spring to straighten its leaves.|$|E
25|$|The 21st {{century has}} seen a {{continued}} application of technology to bicycles: in designing them, building them, and using them. Bicycle frames and components continue to get lighter and more aerodynamic without sacrificing strength largely {{through the use of}} computer aided design, finite element analysis, and computational fluid dynamics. Recent discoveries about bicycle stability have been facilitated by computer simulations. Once designed, new technology is applied to manufacturing such as <b>hydroforming</b> and automated carbon fiber layup. Finally, electronic gadgetry has expanded from just cyclocomputers to now include cycling power meters and electronic gear-shifting systems.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{a concept}} Bel Air {{convertible}} was {{shown at the}} North American International Auto Show. It features a few styling and design cues from the best remembered tri-five (1955–57) models, such as the chrome windshield frame, traffic light viewfinder, and a gas filler cap behind the tail light, similar to 1956–1957 Chevy's gas cap behind the chrome trim {{on the back of}} the tail fin, but more reminiscent of the 1948–1958 Cadillac gas cap tail light. It also features the same body on frame <b>hydroforming</b> technology (used in the frame rails of the Corvette and GM’s midsize sport-utility vehicles) and a sheet metal body, on a [...] wheelbase, and a [...] track. Suspension is short long arm up front and Hotchkiss drive in the rear. It rides on five-spoke aluminum wheels with [...] red line tires and anti lock discs all-round. The elegant, yet simple interior features a twin-element instrument panel, column-mounted gearshift and bench seats covered in soft high-tech fabrics colored red to match the exterior that are cleverly designed to slide forward for easier backseat entry. It also served as a showcase for their new turbocharged inline five-cylinder concept engine based on the L52 (Vortec 3500), straight-5 truck engine. According to a September 2002 GM press release, the all-aluminum 3.5L (211 cu in) 20-valve DOHC engine, with a bore of 93.0mm (3.7in), and a stroke of 102.0mm (4in), that delivers up to 315 horsepower and [...] of torque, mated to a Hydra-Matic 4L60-E electronically controlled four-speed automatic. A virtual [...] "turbo boost" [...] button on the steering wheel activates the powertrain control module to trigger a more aggressive spark and fueling calibration for maximum horsepower. It also led the 13th Annual Stater Brothers Route 66 Rendezvous as the official vehicle in September 2002. General Motors has shown no interest in producing the car.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hydroforming</b> is a {{cost-effective}} way of shaping ductile metals such as aluminium, brass, low alloy steel, {{and stainless steel}} into lightweight, structurally stiff and strong pieces. One of the largest applications of <b>hydroforming</b> is the automotive industry, which makes use of the complex shapes made possible by <b>hydroforming</b> to produce stronger, lighter, and more rigid unibody structures for vehicles. This technique is particularly popular with the high-end sports car industry and is also frequently employed in the shaping of aluminium tubes for bicycle frames.|$|E

50|$|Welded bellows (also called edge-welded, or {{diaphragm}} bellows) {{are manufactured}} by welding {{a number of}} individually formed diaphragms to each other. The comparison between the two bellows types generally centers on cost and performance. <b>Hydroformed</b> bellows generally have a high tooling cost, but, when mass-produced, may have a lower piece price. However, <b>hydroformed</b> bellows have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness. Welded metal bellows are produced with a lower initial tooling cost and maintain higher performance characteristics. The drawback of welded bellows is the reduced metal strength at weld joints, caused by the high temperature of welding.|$|R
50|$|Changes include {{improved}} chassis, {{which features}} <b>hydroformed</b> top tub, larger swing arms, thru-axle rear hub, shot-peened and anodized frame, organic frame gusseting, new number plate. As a result, it was 6 lb heavier (now 151 lb) than 2008 model.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Hydroforming</b> {{is capable}} of {{producing}} parts within tight tolerances including aircraft tolerances where a common tolerance for sheet metal parts is within 0.76 mm (1/30th of an inch). Metal <b>hydroforming</b> also allows for a smoother finish as draw marks produced by the traditional method of pressing a male and female die together are eliminated.|$|E
50|$|Deep drawing {{has been}} {{classified}} into conventional and unconventional deep drawing. The main aim of any unconventional {{deep drawing process}} is to extend the formability limits of the process. Some of the unconventional processes include hydromechanical deep drawing, <b>Hydroform</b> process, Aquadraw process, Guerin process, Marform process and the hydraulic deep drawing process to name a few.|$|R
50|$|The {{titanium}} {{exhaust system}} {{was designed and}} built by MHG-Fahrzeugtechnik. <b>Hydroformed</b> joints were developed to reduce back pressure and ensure a free flow exhaust. Titanium reduces {{the weight of the}} exhaust system while the Inconel silencers improve reliability in the most exposed parts of the exhaust at high temperatures. The entire system weighs less than 10 kg.|$|R
50|$|Various {{vehicle bodies}} and body components, the {{earliest}} mass-produced one being the 1997 Chevrolet Corvette. A selection from many examples are the current {{versions of the}} three major United States pickup trucks—the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, and Ram—which all have <b>hydroformed</b> frame rails, 2006 Pontiac Solstice and the steel frame inside the John Deere HPX Gator Utility Vehicle.|$|R

Payload capacity was increased up to 1,614 lbs (732 kg). Expedition also gained a <b>hydroformed</b> fully boxed frame providing a 70 percent improvement in torsional stiffness.|$|R
5000|$|Output has {{increased}} to [...] at 7500 rpm and 710 Nm of torque. A lightweight carbon fibre high performance intake system, racing multiple disc centered clutch and Formula One-style exhaust system, <b>hydroformed</b> in Inconel 625 and ceramic coated for optimal heat dissipation, have been added. The AMG-built engine is mated to a 6-speed longitudinally-mounted manual sequential synchronized gearbox.|$|R
50|$|Another area of {{comparison}} is in metals of construction. <b>Hydroformed</b> and rolled bellows {{are limited to}} metals with high plastic elongation characteristics, whereas welded bellows may be fabricated from {{a wider variety of}} standard and exotic alloys, such as stainless steel and titanium, as well as other high-strength, corrosion-resistant materials. Electroformed bellows can be produced of nickel, its high-strength alloys, and copper.|$|R
50|$|Complex tubes can be {{made from}} {{multiple}} sheet components formed and welded together, but this adds unnecessary cost and creates quality concerns at the joints. <b>Hydroforming</b> uses liquid under extreme pressures to form metal tubes. It was developed for the plumbing industry and by 1990 achieved production efficiencies suited for high volume autos. Typically <b>hydroforming</b> is done at ambient temperatures, and limits the forming elongation of metals to 8‐12% diameter increase for aluminum, and 25‐40% for steel. This limits the part shape complexity that can be produced. In addition, the workcenters and tooling can be large and expensive because of the internal fluid pressures required to form ambient tubes. HMGF is able to form tubes with larger shape complexity in only one forming step and generally at a lower internal pressure than in conventional tube <b>hydroforming.</b>|$|E
50|$|HMGF is an {{evolution}} that further improves upon the cost effectiveness and applicability of several existing commercial processes: superplastic forming, hot blow forming, and <b>hydroforming.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroforming</b> is {{a process}} that is {{analogous}} to deep drawing, in that the part is formed by stretching the blank over a stationary die. The force required to do so is generated by the direct application of extremely high hydrostatic pressure to the workpiece or to a bladder that is in contact with the workpiece, rather than by the movable part of a die in a mechanical or hydraulic press. Unlike deep drawing, <b>hydroforming</b> usually does not involve draw reductions—the piece is formed in a single step.|$|E

He turned to road racing a year later, and in 1995 he came 4th in the South African 125cc championship aboard a Yamaha YZ125 road bike. The Yamaha YZ125 road bike featured a <b>hydroformed</b> exhaust manufactured by Hylton Spencer. Four years of 250cc racing followed.|$|R

It ranks among the more progressive methods {{and can be used}} among other aplications used for hydromechanical drawing, Pillow forming, <b>Hydroform,</b> Wheelon, ASEA, Flexform, new method Triform, explosion and electrohydraulic forming.

40|$|Several closely-space dished {{accelerator}} grid systems were fabricated and tested on a 30 -cm diameter mercury bombardment thruster and {{they appear to}} be a solution to the stringent requirements imposed by the near-term, high-thrust, low specific impulse electric propulsion missions. The grids were simultaneously <b>hydroformed</b> and then simultaneously stress relieved. The ion extraction capability and discharge chamber performance were studied as the total accelerating voltage, the ratio of net-to-total voltage, grid spacing, and dish direction were varied...|$|R
50|$|Liquid impact forming {{uses the}} {{principles}} of <b>hydroforming</b> process with conventional stamping equipment. Even though <b>hydroforming</b> offers great advantages over conventional tube stamping through the reduction of manufacturing steps and the reduction of variation in workpieces, it still requires expensive mechanical equipment such as dies to withstand extreme pressures and pressurizing equipment such as pumps and intensifiers. As an alternative to this, the liquid impact forming utilizes {{the increase in the}} internal pressure of the liquid inside of a tube during the stamping process, eliminating the need for the use of above mentioned equipment.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of <b>hydroforming</b> is that complex shapes {{can be made}} in one step. In sheet <b>hydroforming</b> (SHF) with the bladder acting as the male die almost limitless geometries can be produced. However, the process is limited by the very high closing force required in order to seal the dies, especially for large panels and thick hard materials. Small concave corner radii are difficult to be completely calibrated, i.e. filled, because too large a pressure would be required. in fact, the die closing force can be very high, both in tube and sheet <b>hydroforming</b> and may easily overcome the maximum tonnage of the forming press. In order to keep the die closing force under prescribed limits, the maximum internal fluid pressure must be limited. This reduces the calibration abilities of the process, i.e. it reduces the possibility of forming parts with small concave radii.Limits of the SHF process are due to risks of excessive thinning, fracture, wrinkling and are strictly related to the material formability and to a proper selection of process parameters (e.g. hydraulic pressure vs. time curve). Tube <b>hydroforming</b> (THF) can produce many geometric options as well, reducing the need for tube welding operations. Similar limitations and risks can be listed as in SHF; however, the maximum closing force is seldom a limiting factor in THF.|$|E
50|$|Formed bellows are {{produced}} by reworking tubes, normally produced by deep drawing, {{with a variety of}} processes, including cold forming (rolling), and <b>hydroforming.</b> They are also called convoluted bellows or sylphons.|$|E
50|$|The GMT 360 {{debuted in}} 2002 with the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, and Oldsmobile Bravada, {{as the next}} {{generation}} S/T mid-size SUVs. While it replaced the GMT 330, it shared nothing with the older platform. It used <b>hydroformed</b> frame rails like the larger GMT 800, and was built for GM's Atlas inline engines. The GMT 360 (and the long-wheelbase GMT 370) went on {{to be one of}} the most rebadged GM products with six different marques represented.|$|R
50|$|The GMT800 {{introduced}} a three section frame system, {{which could be}} mixed and matched depending on the wheelbase, GVWR, and body type fitted to the platform, rather than a single piece long frame. The front section was <b>hydroformed.</b> The middle and rear sections were roll formed or stamped, depending on application. This gives greater flexibility to the platform. A total of four front modules, seven midsections, and four rear sections were created to mix and match for nearly 40 different truck configurations.|$|R
50|$|PVO {{engineers}} {{modified the}} Ram Heavy Duty's {{rack and pinion}} steering and independent front suspension for use in the Ram SRT-10. A fully <b>hydroformed</b> Dodge Ram frame was used in conjunction with a custom-tuned suspension, lowering the Ram SRT-10's ride height one inch in the front and 2.5 inches in the rear. Bilstein shock absorbers, performance-tuned springs and unique aerodynamic aids were used to enhance the Ram SRT-10's higher-speed performance.An additional 5th shock was used on the rear axle to prevent wheel hop during wheel-spin.|$|R
