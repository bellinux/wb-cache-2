40|$|This paper gains {{insight into}} the role of gender in {{interpersonal}} networks, which is largely neglected in research on networking. We do so by exploring the concept of ‘practising gender’, the spatial-temporal accomplishment of <b>gender</b> <b>practices,</b> when people build, maintain and exit social networks. The paper is based on a study of male-dominated technological collaboration projects between universities and industry. Our analysis of observations of project meetings and interviews with project participants demonstrates how people in real time and space draw from culturally available <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> in their networking with each other. This practising of gender was found to be done largely unreflexively, sometimes through humour, within allegedly trivial activities such as pouring coffee and socializing as well as in critical activities such as composing the network. The exploration of the practising of gender in relation to culturally available <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> enabled us to examine how those <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> are reproduced, stretched or challenged when people network. We show how focussing on the dynamic side of gender allows us to get better insight into how gender inequalities in networks are reproduced or countered on the micro-interactional level...|$|R

Gender inequality resembles an unbeatable seven-headed dragon that has a multitude of faces in different social contexts. Based on an empirical study on the recruitment and selection of full professors in three academic fields in The Netherlands we discuss practices that should bring about gender equality and show how these interact with <b>gender</b> inequality <b>practices.</b> We argue that the multitude of <b>gender</b> inequality <b>practices</b> are ineffectively countered by <b>gender</b> equality <b>practices</b> because the latter lack teeth, especially in traditional masculine academic environments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} as well as being {{sensitive}} to wider discourses of gender relations, social workers need to consider the ways in which gender is localised. It is argued that to some extent <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> vary according to local culture, that gendered identities are often localised and that social workers tend to construct their clients according to images of local men and women. These images tend to be stereotypical but some do also reflect dominant local <b>gendered</b> <b>practices.</b> The paper draws on data from qualitative interviews with social workers and probation officers, as well as the experience of teaching social work students, to illustrate these arguments. Whilst it is argued that the localising of gender is of general relevance, the data come from Wales alone. The author's conclusion is that (amongst other things) anti‐oppressive practice involves recognising the important influence of local stereotypes and challenging them, whilst also acknowledging that <b>gendered</b> <b>practices</b> do vary from place to place...|$|R

40|$|Women have {{conquered the}} {{universities}} but {{their way into}} top positions is still stopped by a glass ceiling. Focusing appointment procedures for full professors the chapter examines why policies aiming at <b>gendered</b> <b>practices</b> have only shown moderate success. The analysis follows a praxeological approach drawing on material derived from case studies covering all 22 universities in Austria. The aim of these case studies was to analyze {{the implementation of a}} new legal framework for appointment procedures at Austrian universities. The effects of specific measures to tackle gender bias in appointment procedures for full professors in the Austrian context are analyzed. Despite gender awareness and a comprehensive set of regulations, traditional practices remain stable and unreflected with regard to an inherent gender bias. The analysis presented thus reveals the limitations of existing equality policies. Reflexivity, a precondition for a change of unreflected practices, does not form a part of existing policies. Policies aimed at changing <b>gendered</b> <b>practices</b> have to build gender awareness as well as gender competence and encourage reflexivity as well as agency among all stakeholders involved in a practice. Although there are cases where reflexivity arises from an individual conviction with regard to equality, most stakeholders have to be convinced – or even forced – by a superior authority to change their practices. Such a change can be forced by legal obligation or set down as a clear requirement by university management. It becomes evident that any guideline or regulation addressing <b>gendered</b> <b>practices</b> have to be accompanied by features that create room for reflection and reflexivity...|$|R

This paper provides insight into the multiple ways in which the notions of transparency and accountability are put into practice in academic recruitment and selection, and how this has enhanced — or hindered — gender equality. The methods employed consist of a qualitative content analysis of seven recruitment and selection protocols, interviews with 64 committee members, and an analysis of 971 appointment reports of full professors in the Netherlands. Our analysis contributes to the study of organizations in three respects. First, it shows that recruitment and selection processes are characterized by bounded transparency and limited accountability at best. Second, it explains that the protocols that should ensure transparency and accountability remain paper tigresses, because of the micropolitics and <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> that are part and parcel of recruitment and selection. Third, it contributes to gender equality theory in organization theory by showing how a myriad of <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> simultaneously increases and counteracts gender equality measures in academia...|$|R

Drawing on empirical research in two South Australian primary schools with students aged 6 – 7 and 11 – 13, this article examines the complex ways in which boys engaged in plural <b>gender</b> <b>practices.</b> Practices differing from a discourse of (local) hegemonic masculinity related to three key themes: displaying ‘intelligence’ and being studious; involvement in traditionally ‘feminine’ activities; and being caring, loving family and friends, and engaging in cross-gender friendships. This article utilises these themes to argue that practices could work alongside or present challenges to practices relating to a discourse of hegemonic masculinity. An examination of how age and masculinities interweave suggests that a divide between hegemonic and other masculinities and practices is not as distinct as has often been theorised.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to discuss the}} causes of violence against women in India {{in relation to their}} body-revealing dress and conditional consent to sexual relations. Historically, women in Indian society have been victims of <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> under the typical patriarchy. Culturally, women are treated as sex objects and their status is bounded within the periphery of feminine role-relations as housekeepers and pro-creators of generation. Women's education and participation in the workforce are not bringing with them the expected changes in gender stereotyped-ness. Even the work done on gender justice and women's human rights has failed to establish their status as anything more than sex objects. The rampant sexual violence against women is a reminder that the problem is deeply rooted in Indian society. In such a situation {{we may not be able}} to avoid considering the responsibility of women. Their body-revealing clothing and conditional consent to sexual relation are significant in provoking men into treating them as sex objects. So we should think about how to bring about a change in <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> and this should start in each and every family. The family as a correctional institution should teach its offspring about gender equality and their behavior and attitude towards gender should regard the physical and physiological differences between the sexes as minor. This might perhaps be a step towards reducing violence against women...|$|R

40|$|Spanning a 1, 123 {{year period}} between Late Antiquity and the Italian Renaissance, the Byzantine Empire was the {{legitimate}} {{continuation of the}} imperium Romanum. Although the main defender of Christianity against the encroachments of Islam in the 8 th - and 9 th -centuries and the bulwark of Western Europe until 1204, knowledge of Byzantine civilization among the general educated public remains vague, prompting the historian John Julius Norwich {{to refer to a}} "conspiracy of silence" regarding the teaching of Byzantine history in university curricula. The reasons why the memory of Byzantine civilization has not remained prominent in the popular imagination are complex involving historical, cultural and religious factors. Hellenistic culture, and Roman legal and bureaucratic traditions within the framework of Christianity formed the unique character of Eastern Roman society. One peculiar aspect of the Byzantine religious, mystical world conceptualization which has confounded commentators since the Middle Ages is here termed as non-standard <b>gender</b> <b>practices.</b> Without an understanding of how integral these practices were to the order and functioning of the society, it is impossible to approximate an accurate rendering of Byzantine civilization. In Byzantium, these non-standard <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> refer specifically to the influence of castrated males or eunuchs, and high-status women in governance and public life. Since Antiquity female presence in society was believed to exert an enervating effect on masculine vigor. With Christianity certain gendered states, sexual behaviors and practices came to be viewed as vitiated with a female anima, and this anima was cast by non-Byzantine chroniclers onto the whole of Byzantine civilization. Much of our current understanding of Byzantine civilization comes from works researched since the late 18 th -century European Enlightenment. Enlightenment intellectuals carried largely antithetical of views of clericalism and held the religiosity of the Byzantines in low regard. With the development of historiography as an academic discipline in the 19 th - and 20 th -centuries, historians have developed a more thorough understanding of Byzantine religious mysticism. This study finds that while the centrality of religion in Byzantine society is now better understood, the subject of non-standard <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> remains problematic for scholars and colors the perception of Byzantium in the modern popular imagination...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{of female}} migrants’ outward {{migration}} have shown to influence their social relations {{and are therefore}} worthy of further investigation. The aim of this thesis is to examine in what way the migration experience changes the female return migrants’ social relations, and how it effects the women’s own interpretation of <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> in Nepal. In examining these questions {{it is necessary to}} take point of departure in a local perspective and to apply a qualitative method. Consequently the methodological approach applied in this thesis is based on social constructivism, and the assumption that subjective narratives and experiences lead to knowledge about the subject matter. The research, on which this thesis is based, relies on a field study in Nepal in 2012, where I conducted nineteen semi-structured interviews. To understand the context of women’s migration in Nepal, I conducted four expert interviews with a UN Program Officer, representatives from two local NGO’s and a researcher. Subsequently I interviewed fifteen female return migrants. These latter interviews represent the primary source of information for the analysis presented in this thesis. This analysis seeks to understand the changes in the women’s lives, in their social relations and in their understanding of <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> upon their return. The theoretical framework for the analysis is based on two different approaches: Migration theory and Ernesto Laclau & Chantal Mouffe’s discourse theory. The study consists of three parts. In the first part the patriarchal structures in Nepal are deconstructed {{in order to understand the}} contextual making of gender roles. The second part investigates the female return migrants, their diversity as well as the women’s migration experiences. The third and principal part is the analysis, in which the following themes are studied: 1) Local communities and (extended) families, 2) the female return migrants and their children, and 3) marital relations, the women’s self-esteem and <b>gender</b> <b>practices.</b> Throughout the analysis existing literature on Asian female migrants will be discussed, contributing with additional perspectives to my own empirical data. The research presented in this thesis indicates that the majority of the return migrants (interviewed) experienced a degree of upward economic mobility as a result of their migration. At the same time, the research shows that the same migrants encountered downward social mobility as they experienced being stigmatised as migrants and because of their gender. This analysis suggest that this stigmatising is due to two factors: 1) The patriarchal society in Nepal which promotes <b>gender</b> <b>practices</b> in which a woman’s role is to be a housewife, and 2) a flourishing “trafficking discourse” (O´Neill 2007) in Nepal which stigmatises female migrants as ‘impure women’. The interviews conducted in the present research show that all the interviewed women were stigmatised regardless of their background, caste and migration experience. The findings of this thesis reveal changes in the women’s relations to their children. This makes them change the discourses of the mothering role, so that a good mother can be equal to an absent mother. The findings also reveal that the women’s social relations are shifting as a consequence of their ability to gain remittances and to support their family. The women with successful migration experiences discovered that they could work and take care of their families, which lead to empowerment, self-awareness, and for a few women financial independence. For the remaining women whose migration experience was less successful, their future strategy is to remarry or to migrate anew. The analysis presented in this thesis concludes that changes are prompted by the (interviewed) women’s migration experiences both in terms of the women’s social relations and <b>gender</b> <b>practices.</b> These changes do not, however, reform the women’s internal family patterns or gender related power relations in the short term. Due to the Nepalese patriarchal society continuing to dominate and thereby limit the potential for such changes...|$|R

40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{the characterization of}} Roman artifacts {{so that they can}} play a greater role in gendered approaches to Roman sites—sites that constitute lived spaces but lack actual references to sexed bodies. It commences with a brief discussion on gendered approaches in the two main strands of Roman archaeology—classical and provincial. Within the differing frameworks of the wider disciplines of classics and archaeology, both strands focus on contexts with sexed bodies—burials, figurative representation, and inscriptions. The discussion serves as a background for more integrated and more interrogative approaches to relationships between Roman artifacts and <b>gendered</b> <b>practices,</b> approaches that aim to develop interpretative tools for investigating social practice in contexts where no representational or biologically sexed bodies are evident. Three types of artifacts—brooches, glass bottles, and needles—are used to demonstrate how differing degrees of gender associations of artifacts and artifact assemblages can provide insights into gender relationships in settlement contexts. These insights in turn contribute to better understandings of <b>gendered</b> sociospatial <b>practices</b> across the Roman world. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R
