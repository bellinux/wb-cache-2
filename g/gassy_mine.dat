After the injecting, the concentration of oxygen in the fire area reduced and the gas was asphyxial, which eliminated the danger of gas explosion and avoided expanding the accident.

40|$|Four bit designs, two conical and two radial, {{were tested}} in coal against a 6020 conical {{reference}} bit to obtain data on orthogonal cutting forces and primary respirable dust generation. One conical and one radial design were modified by the Bureau of Mines for these tests. Results were mixed: One radial bit used substantially lower overall cutting forces and specific energy than the other bits and was the only cutter lower on energy and most forces than the standard 6020 bit. How-ever, it generated more specific and total dust than any other bit. The four bits were also tested for incendivity, with a 9020 plumb-bob bit as the reference. The frictional ignition tests were designed to simulate both trimming top rock and cutting such rock during advance on-sump. Results of these tests were also mixed. The radial bits were substantially less incendive than the reference bit and caused no ignitions in either top trimming or sump modes. Only the modified mushroom-tipped conical bit caused ignitions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the past}} the process for sealing {{longwall}} goafs at Mandalong has been to simply seal access points to the goaf and monitor the goaf as it self inertised. Due to changes in legislative requirements an improved method was required. A number of different methods utilising N 2 or CO 2 have been utilised at other mine sites. However, at Mandalong {{it was decided to}} use methane from the in-seam gas drainage system to purge and inertise the goaf. According to our knowledge {{this is the first time}} this method of utilising methane for goaf inertisation and sealing has been implemented. The aim of the sealing process is to seal the goaf in a safe manner without disruption to other parts of the mine. This is achieved by controlling the inertisation process through the introduction of methane from the gas drainage system with the intent of purging the critical zone of the unsealed goaf of any oxygen. Methane from the mine’s gas drainage system and existing pipe arrangement is re-directed to the seals behind the longwall take-off face and injected into the goaf fringe under seam pressure. The goaf atmosphere is monitored via a tube bundle system and is allowed to enter and exit the explosive range under controlled conditions. When the tube bundle monitoring shows the goaf atmosphere is inert, final sealing of the goaf is carried out. The principal hazard associated with the sealing of a goaf area in a <b>gassy</b> <b>mine</b> is the ignition of a...|$|E

40|$|This machine cuts coal along a {{longwall}} face extending up to 500 feet by a rotating auger with bits. The machine also transports the coal that is cut acting as screw conveyor. By virtue of an integral shroud comprising {{part of the}} conveyor the machine is also amenable to a separation of the zones where men work from air being contaminated by dust and methane gas by the cutting action. Beginning as single intake air courses, the air separates at the working section where one split provides fresh air to the Occupied Zone (OZ) for human needs and the other split purges and carries away dust and methane from face fragmentation in the Cutting Zone (CZ). The attractiveness of the Variable Wall Mining Machine is that it addresses the limitations of current longwall mining equipment: it can consistently out-produce continuous mining machines and most longwall shearing machines. It also is amenable to configuring an environment, the dual-duct system, where the air for human breathing is separated from dust-laden ventilating air with methane mixtures. The objective of the research was to perform a mathematical and experimental study of the interrelationships {{of the components of}} the system so that a computer model could demonstrate the workings of the system in an animation program. The analysis resulted in the compilation of the parameters for three different configurations of a dual aircourse system of ventilating underground mines. In addressing the goal of an inherently safe mining system the dual-duct adaptation to the Variable Wall Mining Machine appears to offer the path to solution.

Longhole directional drilling technology has been widely employed in <b>gassy</b> <b>mines</b> due to its obvious advantages such as the high proportion of in-seam boreholes, high efficiency of gas drainage for gas mitigation and reduced cost associated with production down time. The effects were analysed and evaluated based on the application of introduced directional drilling equipment and techniques in Chinese coal mines. These results indicate that the complicated conditions involving soft broken coal, high in situ stress and the presence of faults and folds, present ongoing difficulties and challenges. Longhole directional drilling technology has been successfully applied in some Chinese coal mines for gas exploitation and coal mine gas emission mitigation. Daning Coal Mine (located in the southern Qinshui coalfields) and Baijigou Coal Mine are respectively extracting a thick coal seam. Both coal mines have deployed underground longhole in-seam directional drilling technology for seam gas extraction prior to mining operations.

40|$|Methane {{emissions}} {{resulting from}} the release of methane trapped in coal beds can {{have a significant impact}} on the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with coal production. These emissions vary dramatically by coal rank, specific seam, and seam depth and thickness. This is particularly true of underground mines, where 50 of the nation’s 600 active underground mines are responsible for 98 % of all methane emissions. Various methods can be utilized to mitigate methane emissions, although at present these technologies have only seen limited deployment domestically due to lack of clear incentives or other barriers such as unclear ownership of rights to the gas, proximity of methane to market or a lack of desire to invest in new processes. Despite these factors, coal mine methane (CMM) recovery and use continues to grow, with over 46 billion cubic feet (Bcf) recovered domestically in 2006 – a 10 % increase from 2003. [1] The U. S. Department of Environmental Protection (EPA) reports that of the 50 mines identified as potential candidates for CMM recovery (CMMR), 14 mines have implemented recovery strategies. [1] It is expected that deployment will increase dramatically for <b>gassy</b> <b>mines</b> in the event that carbon regulation is passed, due to the potential cost associated with emissions: methane emissions would incur a cost 25 times higher than carbon emissions based on their increased global warming potential (GWP).

Department of the Interior, is {{reviewing}} explosion protection methods {{for use in}} <b>gassy</b> coal <b>mines.</b> This performance criteria guideline is an evaluation of three explosion protection methods of machines electrically powered with voltages up to 15, 000 volts ac. A sufficient amount of basic research has been accomplished to verify that the explosion proof and pressurized enclosure methods can provide adequate explosion protection with {{the present state of}} the art up to 15, 000 volts ac. This routine application of the potted enclosure as a stand alone protection method requires further investigation or development in order to clarify performance criteria and verification certification requirements. An extensive literature search, a series of high voltage tests, and a design evaluation of the three explosion protection methods indicate that the explosion proof, pressurized, and potted enclosures can all be used to enclose up to 15, 000 volts ac...|$|R
40|$|Regular {{monitoring}} for {{methane gas}} is required near working faces in <b>gassy</b> underground <b>mines</b> where {{the potential for}} methane ignitions is greatest. However, high concentrations of methane can also accumulate outby the face where methane levels are monitored less frequently. Wearing a personal methane monitor equipped with an alarm could protect persons working in these outby areas from injury or death due to methane ignitions. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has conducted studies to evaluate methanometers {{that could be used}} as person-wearable monitors. For the present study, seven different person-wearable monitors that are not currently approved for underground use were evaluated. This paper describes test procedures used to evaluate performance of methane monitors that could be used underground for continuous personal monitoring of methane. The information in this report provides data that allows the reader to make side-by side comparisons of these instruments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{maintain}} the safety level of electrical equipment and diesel engines used in French coal mines susceptible to firedamp, INERIS and Charbonnages de France (CdF) have developed with the contribution of Houillères du Bassin de Lorraine a certification procedure for the workshops which repair such equipment. Due to the decreasing plan of CdF workers, the inadequacy of some manufacturers and the missing of some others, the use of external workshops for the repairing is more and more frequent. So, it is necessary for safety reasons to ensure that such repairs are conducted in optimal conditions. The aim of Saqr-ATEX certification is to ensure that the quality and the traceability of repaired equipment used in <b>gassy</b> coal <b>mines</b> give an equivalent safety level to the new equipment one. In order to be attractive for workshops, Saqr-ATEX is not only usable for ATEX coal mine equipment but also for ATEX equipment installed in every location where hazardous atmosphere could occur...|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, {{conducted}} a study of past mine explosions to identify the ignition locations and ignition sources responsible for the most severe explosion events resulting in death. Since the Scotia disaster of 1976, many fatalities from underground coal mine explosions {{have been linked to}} nonpermissible electrical equipment ignition sources located in intake air courses. With few exceptions, explosion protected equipment is generally not required in intake air courses of <b>gassy</b> underground coal <b>mines</b> in the US. Cigarette lighters were another prevalent ignition source for fatal explosions ignited in intake air courses. Several mine rescue/ recovery teams have encountered electrical ignition hazards. The study provides evidence that intake air courses of <b>gassy</b> underground coal <b>mines</b> fit the description of certain Hazardous (classified) locations described in the US National Electrical Code 2. Class I Division 2 or Zone 2 explosion protection tech 2 may be used to design intake air equipment so that it does not present an ignition source under normal operation, before mine power is shut down in emergency situations. Nonpermissible circuits in intake air courses that are likely to remain energized during emergencies, e. g. battery powered equipment, should be protected by more stringent Class I Division 1, Zone 1, or Zone 0 techniques, to protect rescue/recovery personnel...|$|R
