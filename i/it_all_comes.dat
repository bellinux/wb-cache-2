5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a Hantavirus outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> down to how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E

In 1972–1973, the group recorded the albums Paul Butterfield's Better Days and <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Comes</b> Back, released by Albert Grossman's Bearsville Records. The albums reflected the influence of the participants and explored more roots- and folk-based styles. [...] Although without an easily defined commercial style, both reached the album chart. The band did not last to record a third studio album, but its album Live at Winterland Ballroom, recorded in 1973, was released in 1999.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} mostly positive {{responses from}} a number of critics. David Fricke of Rolling Stone assigned the track four out of five stars, deeming it [...] "just a bright, strident vocal and crisply strummed guitar. But when Armstrong’s bandmates fall in around him, Green Day sound the way you originally loved ’em, and refreshed: heavier and hardened from their time in the trenches but back in the garage, ready for rapture". Scott Shetler of PopCrush also rated the song four out of five stars and compared it to the song [...] "Jesus of Suburbia" [...] from the album American Idiot, calling it [...] "a much shorter and slightly more accessible version" [...] of that song. He also added, [...] "That’s good news for Green Day fans and for those who miss rock music on Top 40 radio". However, the song did not receive an entirely positive response from NME, who stated, [...] "That crunchy guitar riff, that meandering melody, that by-the-numbers solo– <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> off rather ‘meh’, rather safe, and rather middle-ground to these ears".|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall {{agreed with}} Murray's Lost comparison, writing that {{the ending of}} the episode was [...] "right out of the Lost playbook, a little too on the nose for my liking."

[...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler was more positive about the final sequence, explaining that the [...] "last five minutes of this story changed everything, and made me excited about the series again." [...] While praising the special effects, he also noted his displeasure that Sam Weiss [...] "ends up not being as mystical or magical as previous stories hinted". Isler wished Corrigan had more screen time in the episode, calling it [...] "under-utilization of a great character the writers {{have spent a lot of}} time building up." [...] He rated it 7.5/10, an indication of a [...] "good" [...] episode, but criticized its [...] "slow" [...] pacing.|$|E

500|$|Feige {{announced}} that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He stated that the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon. Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. The Avengers director Joss Whedon, who signed a deal to creatively consult {{on all of the}} films leading up to , was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying [...] "James [...] is what makes me think it will work... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon...

500|$|Though {{considering}} the game [...] "pretty darn tough," [...] IGN praised the game's variety and length.

[...] Despite calling it [...] "an outstanding-looking and great playing game," [...] IGN only gave the game a [...] "decent" [...] review score because of the system problems. Conversely, GameSpot's review noted none of these hardware issues, praising the visuals as [...] "some of the finest... of any action game". The reviewer, however, described the game design as [...] "strong yet slightly flawed... definitely pulls you in, but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there," [...] complaining that [...] "what [...] have presented gets tiresome quickly." [...] The publication summarised the game as [...] "a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans... What it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay".|$|E
500|$|Billboards Michael Paoletta applauded Vespertine for its [...] "positive [...] ", feeling some of {{the tracks}} [...] "have the {{strength}} to bring tears (of joy and pain) to the eyes." [...] Q also praised the album, stating that it [...] "quietly proves that cutting-edge production and human contact aren't mutually exclusive." [...] American music journalist Robert Christgau enjoyed the album's central theme of sex and wrote: [...] "when she gets all soprano on your ass you could accuse her of spirituality". A more lukewarm review came from Pitchforks Ryan Schreiber, who felt that: [...] "while undeniably beautiful, Vespertine fails to give electronic music the forward push it received on Björk's preceding albums". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "her lyrics occasionally dive into the deep end" [...] and [...] "her voice is at times stiff", although he also wrote [...] "when <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> together, [...] Björk and her electronica collaborators create moving interplanetary chorals". Almost Cool wrote: [...] "if there's one question to be raised with the album, it's that it's all simply so lush and nice that on some levels it fails to excite". Various reviews named Vespertine Björk's best album to date, including The A.V. Club, Rolling Stone, About.com, and PopMatters.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E

The first single, [...] "Peek-a-Boo", was seen by critics as a [...] "brave move" [...] with horns and dance elements. Sounds wrote: [...] "The snare gets slapped, Siouxsie's voice meanders all around your head and <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> magically together". [...] "Peek-a-Boo" [...] was their first real breakthrough in the United States.

The other great chess prodigies were Paul Morphy, José Capablanca, and Samuel Reshevsky. However, Kasparov expressed early doubts: [...] "She has fantastic chess talent, but she is, after all, a woman. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> down to the imperfections of the feminine psyche. No woman can sustain a prolonged battle." [...] Later in life, however, after he had lost a rapid game against Polgar himself in 2002, Kasparov revised his opinion: [...] "The Polgars showed that there are no inherent limitations to their aptitude—an idea that many male players refused to accept until they had unceremoniously been crushed by a twelve-year-old with a ponytail." ...|$|E
