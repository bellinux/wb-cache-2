40|$|The {{intention}} of the work described in this thesis was to identify whether extremely high <b>dilutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> can induce changes in dendritic cell maturation and dendritic cell ability to initiate immune responses. Basic research performed trying to address whether such ultra-high, homeopathic, <b>dilutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> have a biological role is limited, while clinical investigations into this matter are inconclusive. Homeopathy is, however, gaining popularity, and is very often at the epicentre of intense scientific and medical debate. We hypothesised that dendritic cells, being an excellent APC, {{might be a good}} candidate cell to investigate this controversial topic. While dendritic cells are excellent APCs, capable of inducing T cell responses 100 times more effectively than other lymphocytes, there is mounting evidence suggesting that they might also be involved in bacterial dissemination during Salmonella infections. We investigated the role of dendritic cells in the development of protective immune responses against Salmonella typhimurium infections. Furthermore, we assessed whether the APC derived cytokine, IL- 23, which shares the common p 40 subunit with IL- 12 p 70, is required for the development of primary, memory as well as protective immune responses against Salmonella typhimurium. While IL- 23 {{has been shown to be}} important for the maintenance of IL- 17 responses by T cells, its role during Salmonella induced pathology remains elusive.

40|$|We {{can draw}} some {{conclusions}} {{as to the}} form <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> antibody reaction from turbidimetorical examinations of precipitin reaction between ovalbumin and antiovalbumin, and diphtheria toxoid and antitoxoid. The nephelometer used in these experiments is constructed by authors. 1. Flocculation of antigen-antibody complexes obeys the theoretical relationships in colloidal solutions. If the concentration of antigen-antibody decreases in 1 / 2, the velocity of turbidity curve diminishes in 1 / 4. Generally the velocity of flocculation is proportional to amounts of reagents. This relationship agreed perfectly with the curves in optimal ratio, excess <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> and excess <b>of</b> antibody zone. 2. The series of two fold diluted antigens {{are added to the}} constant antibodies; in this case the standard curve is optimal ratio, in antigen excess zone 6 curves are observed, and the height of these curves diminished in 1 / 1. 6 proportional to 2 fold <b>dilution</b> <b>of</b> <b>antigen,</b> while in antibody excess zone 1 at most 2 curves are observed. On this basis, antibody seems usually monovalent, or at most divalant. 3. When flocculation times in minutes of different mixture of diphtheria toxoid and antitoxoid are calculated by the nephelometer, a series of determinations of a constant antibody or <b>of</b> a constant <b>antigen</b> gives a system of data, and when this data are plotted inversaly in three dimensions, we recognize a surface which shows the position of optimal ratio as the top line of concurved surface.

An indirect in-house ELISA was standardized to measure IgG antibody against Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) in sera from different groups of individuals. In the process of optimization of in-house ELISA, optimal <b>dilutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>antigen,</b> serum, conjugate and monoclonal IgG antibody along with selection of efficient blocking buffer and washing steps of microtitre plates were studied by the help of checkerboarding.

This inhibitor eliminates Clq interference without affecting the attachment of rheumatoid factor to the Fc pari of IgG, thus permitting fÃ¼ll automation of the assay. After studying the reactivity of different heat-aggregated IgG preparations, we optimized the procedure for preparing the antigen in order to attain maximal reactivity: IgG was heated at 63 Â°C until the absorbance at 340 nm of a 1 / 10 <b>dilution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>antigen</b> lay between 0. 65 and 0. 95 absorbance units.

We now report that the virus agglutinates red cells of primate origin, though with plasma-derived virus this activity is masked by the presence of an IgM-like inhibitor. This observation is consistent with the presence on the erythroid precursor target cell of a specific receptor for parvovirus B 19. Parvovirus B 19, the causative agent of erythema infectiosum and viral aplastic crisis, was first described by Cossart et al. in 1975. It was subsequently shown to be a member of the autonomous parvoviridae but in contrast o other members of the genus has not been shown previously to agglutinate red blood cells (Cossart et al., 1975). It is also known that the target cell of B 19 virus in vivo is an early erythrocyte precursor (Mortimer et al., 1983). We now report that the virus agglutinates red cells of primate origin, though with plasma-derived virus this activity is masked. Haemagglutination (HA) was carried out using a microtitre method in V-bottomed plates. Serial twofold <b>dilutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> were prepared in dextrose gelatin albumin buffer (DGA; 5 g/ 1 dextrose, 0. 3 g/l gelatin, 0 - 2 ~ bovine plasma albumin, in 0 - 05 M-PBS pH 6 - 3).

Seventy serum samples including 30 from hydatidosis patients (surgically confirmed), healthy control individuals not infected with any parasitic diseases (n=/ 20) and from others with different parasitic infections including, toxocariosis (n= 5), fasciolosis (n= 5), trichostrongylosis (n= 5), and strongyloidosis (n= 5) were analysed for anti-hydatid IgG antibodies using sheep hydatid cyst fluid antigen. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as {{validity of the test}} were found as 96. 7 %, 95. 2 %, 93. 7 %, 97. 5 % and 96 % for conventional ELISA, while these paramters for fast-ELISA were respectively as follows: 100 %, 97. 5 %, 96. 7 %, 100 % and 98. 8 %. Regarding standard-ELISA 3 Âµg/ml <b>of</b> <b>antigen,</b> serum <b>dilution</b> <b>of</b> 1 : 500, conjugate <b>dilution</b> <b>of</b> 1 : 3000 and 30 min incubation were found optimal, while for fast-ELISA 3 Âµg/ml <b>of</b> <b>antigen,</b> serum <b>dilution</b> <b>of</b> 1 : 125, conjugate <b>dilution</b> <b>of</b> 1 : 1000 and 5 min incubation were utilized. The present study indicates that fast ELISA can easily be performed in place of the standard ELISA for the serodiagnosis of human hydatidosis with the advantage of minimising consumed time and manpower hours. Moreover, this test can be utilized in screening tests to diagnos human hydatidosis...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityVi antigen vms first {{discovered}} {{as a component}} of the typhoid bacillus in 1934. Since that time, serologically identical or very closely related Vi antigens have been found to occur in almost all freshly isolated strains of Salmonella tyohosa, in some strains of Salmonella paratyphi C and in one strain each of Paracolobactrum ballerup and Escherichia coli. The purpose of the present investigation was to immununologically characterize Vi antigens which were purified by the method of Baker (Baker, E. E., To be published). Serologic properties <b>of</b> Vi <b>antigens</b> were studied by the agar diffusion technique. It was found that zones of specific precipitate could be identified in the agar which were due to Vi antigen and its antibody. Vi antigens prepared from P. ballerup, E. coli, S. typhosa, strain Ty 2 and S. typhosa, strain 61 were serologically identical by this method. This precipitin technique presented itself as a highly sensitive method for detection of small amounts <b>of</b> <b>antigens</b> and as little as 1. 0 microgram <b>of</b> purified Vi <b>antigen</b> per milliliter <b>of</b> 0. 15 M sodium chloride solution formed a visible zone of precipitation. In order to be certain that the properties <b>of</b> Vi <b>antigen</b> under consideration were attributed solely to Vi antigen, this sensitive agar diffusion technique was applied to determine purity <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> preparations. It was noted that Vi antigens derived from P. ballerup and S. typhosa, strain 61 were serologically pure substances. However, Vi antigen preparations were isolated from E. coli and S. typhosa, strain Ty 2 which contained a very small amount of another substance. A serologic study <b>of</b> Vi <b>antigen</b> was made in which several concentrations <b>of</b> Vi <b>antigens</b> were reacted in agar diffusion precipitin tests with different <b>dilutions</b> <b>of</b> antisera. The antisera were prepared by immunizing rabbits with acetone killed and dried organisms containing Vi antigen. It was observed that at a certain ratio <b>of</b> Vi <b>antigen</b> to antibody, two precipitate zones were visible. Since the position of the precipitate zone in the agar was determined by the concentration of reactants when other factors remained constant, one antibody concentration was reacted with decreasing concentrations <b>of</b> Vi <b>antigen.</b> The two zones of specific precipitate became superimposed and further <b>dilution</b> <b>of</b> Vi <b>antigen</b> did not result in separation of the two zones. It may be that acetylated and a small amount <b>of</b> deacetylated Vi <b>antigen</b> were present in the purified preparations. Like the capsular polysaccharide of Pneumococens Type I, acetylated Vi antigen may be capable of absorbing all the specific antibody while the deacetylated antigen may have been capable of absorbing only antibody reactive with the deacetylated antigen leaving the antibody titer for the acetylated antigen unchanged. This hypothesis was strengthened by agar diffusion precipitin studies using Vi antigen which was deacetylated by hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide. Vi antigens were characterized further biologically. Acetone killed and dried Vi containing organisms were excellent immunizing agents in the rabbit. However, purified Vi antigens from these organisms were very poor immunizing agents in rabbits. Rabbits were apparently very sensitive to intoxication by the Vi containing organisms under study. Therefore, purified Vi antigens were tested for toxic effects in these animals. It was found that the pure Vi antigens were relatively non-toxic even when administered in large doses. Purified Vi antigens were employed as preparatory injections in an effort to demonstrate the Shwartzman phenomenon of local skin reactivity. It has been shovm that pure Vi <b>antigens</b> were incapable <b>of</b> preparing rabbit skin for the local Shwartzman reaction. The agar diffusion technique was employed in comparative studies <b>of</b> <b>antigens</b> from several strains of S. typhosa. Antigenic analyses of the various strains of S. typhosa are still under investigation. A technique of absorption directly in the agar diffusion plate was proposed and is presently under study...|$|R
40|$|Six bovines were {{infested with}} 60 first instar larvae of Dermatobia hominis. The animals were bleed weekly, and their {{antibodies}} levels to D. hominis L 1, L 2 and L 3 instars measured during the time, following the infestation course. The antisera were {{submitted to a}} titration against optimal <b>dilutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>antigen</b> coated wells <b>of</b> microplates, previously sensitized with L 1, L 2 and L 3 preparations, respectively. The ELISA assay {{was used to test}} single <b>dilutions</b> <b>of</b> antisera, which results were comparatively analyzed with a control of not infested animals. Antibodies against L 1 were detected between the first and 21 st day post-infestation (DPI) and, from the 42 nd DPI on. Anti-L 2 antibodies, could be detected on the 21 st DPI and from the 35 th DPI until approximately the 49 th DPI, when it was observed a decreasing of antibodies titration equivalent to the control group. No antibodies were detected against the L 3 instar-antigens. Antibodies levels against L 1 showed absorbance higher than 1. 500 O. D. at 492 nm in the ELISA assay, when compared to the 0. 096 O. D. observed to the negative animals. High anti-L 2 antibodies were also detected on the 21 st DPI, where two animals showed O. D. of 0. 450 and 0. 900 at 492 nm, with a cut-off estimated on 0. 110 O. D. It was also demonstrated a rising of anti-L 2 antibodies in the same four animals, which presented antibodies response against L 1 instar. The obtained results, with an estimated prevalence of 50 %, were comparatively evaluated, taking the double diffusion immunoassay precipitation test as a standard, and showed a concordance of 98 %. The association between infestation and presence of specific antibodies was also discussed. Foram estudadas as alteraÃ§Ãµes imunolÃ³gicas em um grupo de seis bovinos infestados, experimentalmente, com 60 larvas de primeiro Ã­nstar (L 1) de Dermatobia hominis por animal, enquanto que outro grupo de seis animais foi utilizado como controle. Amostras de sangue tomadas, semanalmente, durante a infestaÃ§Ã£o experimental, foram analisadas para se detectar anticorpos anti-L 1, anti-L 2 e anti-L 3 de D. hominis, utilizando-se a tÃ©cnica de ELISA, na qual utilizou microplacas contendo amostras de soro dos animais e preparaÃ§Ãµes antigÃªnicas de L 1, L 2 e L 3. Observou-se nos animais infestados, o aparecimento de anticorpos anti-L 1 desde o primeiro atÃ© o 21 Âº dia pÃ³s-infestaÃ§Ã£o (DPI) e apÃ³s o 42 Âº DPI, enquanto que os anticorpos anti-L 2 foram detectados no 21 Âº DPI, e no perÃ­odo do 35 Âº ao 49 Âº DPI, seguido de declÃ­nio atÃ© atingirem valores semelhantes aos animais controles. NÃ£o se detectaram nÃ­veis expressivos de anticorpos para antÃ­genos de L 3. Os nÃ­veis de anticorpos anti-L 1 dos animais infestados revelaram absorbÃ¢ncia (D.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} a dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) using excretory-secretory antigens from the larval stages of Toxocara canis for the diagnosis of toxocariasis. A secondary aim was to establish the optimal conditions for its use in an area with a high prevalence of human T. canis infection. The dot-ELISA test was standardised using different concentrations <b>of</b> the <b>antigen</b> fixed on nitrocellulose paper strips and increasing <b>dilutions</b> <b>of</b> the serum and conjugate. Both the dot-ELISA and standard ELISA methods were tested in parallel with the same batch of sera from controls and from individuals living in the problem area. The best results were obtained with 1. 33 Âµg/mL <b>of</b> <b>antigen,</b> <b>dilutions</b> <b>of</b> 1 / 80 for the samples and controls and a <b>dilution</b> <b>of</b> 1 / 5, 000 for the anti-human IgG-peroxidase conjugate. All steps of the procedure were performed at room temperature. The coincidence between ELISA and dot-ELISA was 85 % and the kappa index was 0. 72. The dot-ELISA test described here is rapid, easy to perform and does not require expensive equipment. Thus, this test is suitable for the serological diagnosis of human T. canis infection in field surveys and in the primary health care centres of endemic regions...|$|R
