5|$|Gilly and Steph {{take a walk}} {{round the}} village on bonfire night where she finally admits she's scared of dying, they have a heart to heart {{conversation}} where she realises she's it <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> {{is going to die}} that scares her. When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they blame him for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max would have done anything to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry. He starts drinking heavily, causing trouble on many occasions.|$|E
25|$|According to Eleanor Womer, Dugal Campbell (Mary's brother) {{accompanied}} Colonel Bouquet to the Muskingum. He {{stood on}} a log and yelled out Mary Campbell's name, and saw that a Native woman clapped her hand over a girl's mouth in response. The girl was Mary Campbell, and that <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> was recovered. While this is uncertain, {{it is known that}} relatives of a number of known captives traveled with Bouquet in October 1764.|$|E
25|$|Kate {{was born}} at Loughaun, a {{crossroads}} {{near the village of}} Dunkerrin and the town of Moneygall, in County Offaly, Ireland. Dunkerrin Catholic Church records show that her parents, Michael and Margaret Shelley, married on February 24, 1863, and she was baptized on December 12, 1863. Her grave marker says she was born on September 25, 1865 and died January 21, 1912. The family name was originally spelled Shelly, which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> wrote her name, but the spelling Shelley was later adopted.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was wondering," [...] cried Mary Phillips, [...] "what {{had become}} of you; I thought perhaps you had gone down to breakfast." [...] In answer I called to her to tell me where Miss Nugent <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> came to <b>be</b> in this {{surprising}} situation, {{and how many people}} there were on board the steamer.|$|R
50|$|While {{a student}} at Vassar College, she helped found the National Student Federation of America, which <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> made an {{acquaintance}} with Edward R. Murrow.|$|R

25|$|During {{a meeting}} with Chantrey, Ellen-Jane {{expressed}} to him {{a clear idea of}} what she wanted. She told Chantrey of how in the past she had watched as her daughters fell asleep in each other's arms and this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> wanted them represented. She had also taken inspiration from Thomas Banks’ Boothby Monument in St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne. The statue depicts the daughter of Sir Brooke Boothby who had died during childhood. Chantrey visited this monument and then returned to his home to make a model of his proposed sculpture.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the mysteries}} of Baret's life <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> {{obtained}} at least the rudiments of an education, as her signature on later legal documents provides evidence {{that she was not}} illiterate. One of her biographers, Glynis Ridley, suggests that her mother may have been of Huguenot extraction, a group that had a higher tradition of literacy than was otherwise typical of the peasant classes of the time. Another biographer, John Dunmore, suggests that she may have been taught by the parish priest or taken on as a charity case {{by a member of the}} local gentry.|$|E
25|$|Atia Balba Caesonia (born 85 BC) was {{the second}} {{daughter}} of Julius Caesar's younger sister, Julia Minor and Marcus Atius Balbus, son of a Senator from Aricia. Atia herself had two sisters, {{not mentioned in the}} series, and was a cousin to general Pompey through her father. The real Atia would also have been considered plebeian, not patrician; however, like Caesar's mother Aurelia, this was of little importance during the late Republic when patricians were rather thin on the ground. Octavia and Octavian were both plebeian as well, but like Mark Antony, drew their status from their familial and political ties with Caesar. Officially, as an Atia Balba, Atia would have been considered a member of the Atii Balbi rather than a 'woman of the Julii', which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> identifies during the series. As the niece of Caesar, however, she would have been considered a Caesarian politically, and would have owed much of her status to her position in Caesar's extended family.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and Julia and Ermine {{had come}} {{every day to}} learn lessons with her daughters. I was too young; {{but as long as}} she lived we were all like one family. <b>How</b> kind <b>she</b> <b>was!</b> <b>How</b> <b>she</b> helped us through those frightful weeks!" ...|$|R
60|$|When Osborne {{heard that}} his friend had found her, he made hot and anxious {{inquiries}} regarding the poor child. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she?</b> <b>How</b> did <b>she</b> look? What did she say? His comrade took his hand, and {{looked him in}} the face.|$|R
50|$|This book explores women's role in {{the church}} today by {{examining}} {{what it was like}} for woman in the world into which Jesus was born. The authors show <b>how</b> woman <b>was</b> perceived, <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> treated, and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> saw herself.|$|R
25|$|Olivia King (Mag Ruffman): Hetty's {{youngest}} sibling, Olivia is more affectionate to Sara, {{and more}} sensitive and social. Most of her experiences throughout the series involve her social dealings with other Avonlea citizens. She eventually marries Jasper Dale and leaves Rose Cottage, but before this she {{works as a}} reporter for the local paper, which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> becomes acquainted with Jasper, who does the photography for her stories. When they marry, Jasper and Olivia have a son, Montgomery, and later adopt a baby girl, Alicia, from one of their employees at the cannery. Olivia is the doppelganger of Alice Lawson (also played by Mag Ruffman), the daughter of Mr. Lawson of Lawson's General Store. In the reunion movie, Jasper misses the ship to Avonlea and Olivia begins to question their marriage and considers leaving him and staying in Avonlea. When Jasper sends her a music box for Christmas, she realizes she still does love him and decides to go home to London.|$|E
25|$|Kat and Alfie {{holiday in}} Spain, and bring Shenice back with them. Upon their return, Kat gets {{pregnant}} again. Alfie {{believes that he}} cannot have children and assumes Kat has cheated on him, despite her insistence to the contrary. Alfie learns that he is wrong, but Kat is hurt by his accusation and will not let him near her, even after suffering a miscarriage. Kat has a one-night stand with Mark Garland (Chris Simmons), which she instantly regrets. She eventually confesses to Alfie, and tells him that her behaviour <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> is and always will be. Alfie tells Kat he would rather have her cheat on him than not have her in his life. The couple attempt to mend relations with each other over Christmas, but Alfie overhears Kat saying that she thinks he no longer loves her. Alfie books a session with a marriage counsellor, which Kat initially refuses to attend. She turns up late, and Alfie tells her the counsellor never arrived. Alfie pays his friend Gerry (Paul Reynolds) {{to pretend to be}} a marriage counsellor, who comes to their home. Kat tells Gerry that she believes Alfie does not love her any more and so she wants to end their marriage.|$|E
500|$|Destiny's Child {{has been}} {{credited}} as a musical influence or inspiration by several artists including Rihanna, Meghan Trainor, Fifth Harmony, Little Mix, Girls Aloud, Haim, Jess Glynne, Katy B, and RichGirl. Ciara {{was inspired to}} pursue a career in music after seeing Destiny's Child perform on television. Ariana Grande cited Destiny's Child as one of her vocal inspirations, saying that listening to the group's music <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> discovered her range and [...] "learned about harmonies and runs and ad-libs." [...] Meghan Trainor stated that her single [...] "No" [...] (2016) was inspired by the late 1990s and early 2000s sounds of Destiny's Child, NSYNC, and Britney Spears. Fifth Harmony cited Destiny's Child as their biggest inspiration, and even paid tribute to the group by performing a medley of [...] "Say My Name", [...] "Independent Women", [...] "Bootylicious" [...] and [...] "Survivor" [...] on the television show Greatest Hits. Fifth Harmony also incorporated elements of the intro from [...] "Bootylicious" [...] for the intro to their own song [...] "Brave, Honest, Beautiful" [...] (2015).|$|E
5000|$|The {{scene where}} Cleopatra is smuggled into Alexandria {{rolled up in}} a carpet is, likewise, based on a story that that <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> first met Caesar, {{while he was in}} the royal palace, {{surrounded}} by Ptolemy's guards.|$|R
5000|$|Paliwal was {{the first}} woman in India to ride a Harley {{frequently}} over 180 km/hr and other super bikes over 250 km/hr. That <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> got the name [...] "HOG Rani (Queen) or [...] "SPEED Rani (Queen)".|$|R
6000|$|But {{she could}} not marry him. And it was expected, nay, almost {{necessary}} that she should marry someone. To that someone, <b>how</b> good <b>she</b> would <b>be!</b> <b>How</b> <b>she</b> would strive by duty and attention, and if possible by affection, {{to make up for}} that misfortune of her early love! ...|$|R
500|$|Also noted was the [...] "completely erratic and {{borderline}} insane" [...] {{behavior of}} Ellis at {{the realization that}} her daughter is focusing more on her love life than on her career, learning that the specialty, which she considers to be defining for a surgeon, is not a concern of Meredith's: [...] "If this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> was treating Meredith during her childhood and adolescence, it completely explains why Meredith is so dark and twisty." [...] In addition, West noted the realism in Ellis' troubled personality, when she considers refusing the heart surgery, due to not being sure of wanting to continue her life {{in a state of}} forgetfulness and confusion. The scene which depicts Ellis interacting with Webber was negatively received by West, which regarded the whole conversation to have been based on his convincing lies, determined to give her peace. In response to Miranda Bailey's storyline in the episode, involving the sexually active teenager, West noted how the character was [...] "direct, somewhat stern, but not unkind about the subject as she educates and consoles the girl".|$|E
500|$|The truth finally emerges that Manju {{was merely}} baiting Thyagu {{to teach him}} a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he {{attempts}} {{to take advantage of}} her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl (Saritha). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, [...] "What do you think of women's liberation?". Arun's wife replies, [...] "I don't know". Manju replies with a cynical, [...] "that is why you are happy". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, [...] "She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> is".|$|E
2500|$|Thimmakka is {{a native}} of Hulikal village in the Magadi taluk of Ramanagar {{district}} in Karnataka. She received no formal education and worked as a casual labourer in a nearby quarry. She was married to Chikkaiah who was a labourer but they unfortunately could have no children. [...] It is said that Thimmakka started to plant banyan trees in lieu of children. The name word Saalumarada (row of trees in the Kannada language) <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> was referred to because of her work.|$|E
60|$|There he was, Frank Gresham himself {{standing}} there in her immediate presence, beautiful as Apollo. Her next thought <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> might escape from out of his arms. How it happened that she had fallen into them, she never knew.|$|R
5|$|When Josepha Petrick began {{painting}} for Mbantua Gallery in central Australia, she indicated {{that her name}} was Josepha rather than Josie, and that this <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> henceforth wished to be known; however Mbantua's biography is the only source that has used that version of her name.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{she ought}} to have obeyed her mother--a good mother as <b>she</b> <b>was!</b> <b>How</b> <b>she</b> had set her heart upon the wedding, poor soul; and we couldn't help her knowing what had happened! O how ungrateful young folk be! That girl will rue this morning's work!' ...|$|R
2500|$|Tilley's {{popularity}} continued {{during the}} First World War, {{when she and}} her husband ran a military recruitment drive, as did a number of other music hall stars. In the guise of characters like 'Tommy in the Trench' and 'Jack Tar Home from Sea', Tilley performed songs like [...] "The Army of Today's All Right" [...] and 'Jolly Good Luck to the Girl who Loves a Soldier'. This <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> got the nickname 'Britain's best recruiting sergeant'– young men were sometimes asked to join the army on stage during her show.|$|E
2500|$|Lexa {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics and fans, [...] who consider her {{to be one of}} the show's more interesting and complex characters. She has been a source of frequent debate; one topic <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> was written off the series. Her relationship with Clarke, which was viewed as compelling, significantly impacted the LGBT community, and many viewers embraced it as a positive or tempestuous depiction of friendship, love, and betrayal. The relationship was, however, criticized for being unnecessarily tragic, leading the [...] "bury your gays" [...] trope to rise to a national debate.|$|E
2500|$|Ella, {{the leader}} of her group, is {{resourceful}} and strong but cold and withdrawn emotionally. Her Change Talent {{is the ability to}} summon or [...] "conjure" [...] inanimate objects of limited mass at will, usually weapons. This <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> escaped the Overlords' dormitories, conjuring a razor blade to cut a tracking device out of her wrist. She seems closest to Drum, and there is evidence of a romantic attachment to him, but his permanent emasculation by steroids prevents any sexual relationship. Ninde once remarks sarcastically, [...] "Sure! And Ella will care about someone other than Drum!" ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} fixed upon the gold-rimmed ramparts of the distant wall in the west. Plain it <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> loved that wild upland. And {{there seemed to be}} some {{haunting}} memory of the past in her gaze--some happy part of life, agonizing to think of now.|$|R
6000|$|When {{they were}} {{together}} again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown her his review of Browning's poems. That <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> had found out the secret: but she liked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly: ...|$|R
50|$|At a {{young age}} Gormley {{appeared}} in youth community theatre with a vivid memory of her first play, which was Oliver. Gormley's attraction to theatre {{is that she is}} an only child and was really excited to have people around her. Community theatre <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> fell in love with acting.|$|R
2500|$|I {{had written}} long-form before {{but it is}} pure story-telling in script writing and that goes {{back as far as}} I can {{remember}} for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and I would tell her stories every night—that <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> would get to sleep. She would say [...] "tell me a story" [...] so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.|$|E
2500|$|Joy Lass (Cynthia Stevenson): George's mother. She is a Virgo {{who has a}} {{pathological}} fear of balloons and who hates the word moist because she thinks [...] "it sounds pornographic". She likes to have order, rules, and control in her life. [...] Other characters in the show, such as Joy's own mother, believe that her obsession with control <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> copes with denial of her own out-of-control life, her daughter George's death, her younger daughter's rather unconventional style of grieving over George's death, and her divorce from her husband. In the episode where her mother comes to visit, however, {{it becomes clear that}} Joy's problems stem more from the chaotic lifestyle and abandonment issues of her own childhood.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving in London {{with very}} little money, they lived as squatters in Lillieshall Road, London. Future Thompson Twins member Alannah Currie (born 20 September 1957, Auckland, New Zealand) lived in another squat in the same street — which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> met Bailey. It was in this {{ramshackle}} and run-down house that they found an illegal way of [...] "borrowing" [...] electricity from the house next door. Bailey described themselves (laughingly) as spongers back then, as they were living on very little and scavenging everything they could lay their hands on. He even said that the only instruments they had were bought, or had been stolen or borrowed. Dodd {{managed to get a}} council flat not far away. Their roadie at that time was John Hade, who lived in the same house, and who later became their manager.|$|E
50|$|After {{the monstrous}} Jeff {{had been shot}} by his son, David, for raping his stepdaughter, and died, Meg {{remained}} single and managed her fortune, which <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> ended things when the show ended. She {{was one of the}} richest people in Rosehill. Despite being evil, she was an adept businesswoman.|$|R
60|$|In another {{corner of}} the room were Mrs. Kearney and her husband, Mr. Bell, Miss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the {{patriotic}} piece. Mrs. Kearney said that the Committee had treated her scandalously. She had spared neither trouble nor expense and this <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> repaid.|$|R
60|$|This man, meanwhile, {{went home}} musing to bed, thinking, with a dainty pleasure, how {{imperious}} her passion <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> had sat before {{him in her}} beauty, with the dark eyes that had never turned away but once; how the white down had fluttered; how the bird's feathers had been strewn upon the ground.|$|R
