500|$|In New Guinea, {{the main}} {{role of the}} fighters was escort—something not {{foreseen}} before the war. Early losses of bombers made fighter protection the rule rather than the exception, and if fighter cover was not available, the bombers flew by night. During {{the last half of}} 1943, V Fighter Command flew 6,607 sorties in support of bombers and 10,215 to protect transports, out of 24,397 sorties for the period in total. These missions often depended upon securing forward fighter fields, particularly for long missions. Wurtsmith made what he claimed was the [...] "shortest landing ever made in a P-40" [...] at Marilinan in order to see if it could serve as a forward fighter strip. He proved that it could, although a better site was subsequently located at nearby Tsili Tsili. This base allowed Wurtsmith's fighters to support the bombing of Wewak and the landing at Nadzab. The range of the fighters was increased by the addition of external 200-gallon fuel tanks. Then, in July 1944, Charles Lindbergh, who was visiting the South West Pacific area as civilian observer, taught Wurtsmith's pilots how to obtain additional range by economical operation of their engines. The new technique increased the combat radius of the P-38s to , a gain of some 30 percent. Combining three external <b>droppable</b> <b>tanks</b> with new techniques increased the range of the P-40s to [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{company began}} {{providing}} electric refrigerators to Eureka-Williams Company in Bloomington, IL in early 1935. Later that year, the company moved to Galesburg, IL, completing the move in 1936 and changing {{its name to}} Midwest Manufacturing Company. During World War II, the company shifted from consumer goods to products such as mines, <b>droppable</b> gas <b>tanks,</b> powder cans and Navy floats. After the war, production of consumer refrigerators resumed and the company introduced Kitchen-Kraft steel kitchen cabinets, and the firm's all-steel kitchens enjoyed a degree of popularity in the “Atomic Age.” Midwest sold a franchise to manufacture and distribute the cabinets on the West Coast to Parker Manufacturing Company in Santa Monica, CA. Kitchen-Kraft steel cabinets were installed {{in the homes of}} various Hollywood movie stars/directors, such as Alan Ladd.|$|R
50|$|Using {{experience}} gained building license-built FG-1 series Corsairs, in early 1944 Goodyear extensively modified a standard FG-1 airframe, designated the XF2G-1, {{to take advantage}} of the 50% increase in take-off power provided by the R-4360 engine. In addition, an all-round vision bubble-type canopy was installed. In March 1944, Goodyear was awarded a contract to deliver 418 F2G-1 and 10 F2G-2 aircraft. The F2G-1 was a land-based version with manually folding wings, and the F2G-2, a carrier version with hydraulically folding wings and arrestor hook.Armament provisions included alternative wing-mounted installations for four or six 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) machine guns and eight 5-inch (127 mm) rockets or two 1,000 or 1,600 lb (450 or 725 kg) bombs. The internal fuel capacity was increased greatly over that of the FG-1, and provisions were provided to carry two <b>droppable</b> external <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{to put this}} theory to the test was the RB-36D specialized photographic-reconnaissance version of the B-36D. It was outwardly identical to the standard B-36D, but carried a crew of 22 rather than 15, the additional crew members being needed to operate and maintain the photographic reconnaissance equipment that was carried. The forward bomb bay in the bomber {{was replaced by a}} pressurized manned compartment that was filled with fourteen cameras. This compartment included a small darkroom where a photo technician could develop the film. The second bomb bay contained up to 80 T-86 photoflash bombs, while the third bay could carry an extra [...] <b>droppable</b> fuel <b>tank.</b> The fourth bomb bay carried electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment. The defensive armament of 16 M-24A-1 20mm cannons was retained. The extra fuel tanks increased the flight endurance to up to 50 hours. [...] It had an operational ceiling of [...] Later, a lightweight version of this aircraft, the RB-36-III, could even reach [...] RB-36s were distinguished by the bright aluminium finish of the camera compartment (contrasting with the dull magnesium {{of the rest of the}} fuselage) and by a series of radar domes under the aft fuselage, varying in number and placement. [...] When developed, it was the only American aircraft having enough range to fly over the Eurasian land mass from bases in the United States, and size enough to carry the bulky high resolution cameras of the day.|$|R
