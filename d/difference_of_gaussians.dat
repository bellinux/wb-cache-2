50|$|In imaging science, <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> is {{a feature}} {{enhancement}} algorithm {{that involves the}} subtraction of one blurred version of an original image from another, less blurred version of the original. In the simple case of grayscale images, the blurred images are obtained by convolving the original grayscale images with Gaussian kernels having differing standard deviations. Blurring an image using a Gaussian kernel suppresses only high-frequency spatial information. Subtracting one image from the other preserves spatial information that lies between the range of frequencies that are preserved in the two blurred images. Thus, the <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> is a band-pass filter that discards {{all but a handful}} of spatial frequencies that are present in the original grayscale image.|$|E
50|$|The Feature-based Morphometry (FBM) {{technique}} uses extrema in a <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussian</b> scale-space {{to analyze}} and classify 3D magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the human brain. FBM models the image probabilistically as a collage of independent features, conditional on image geometry and group labels, e.g. healthy subjects and subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Features are first extracted in individual images from a 4D <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussian</b> scale-space, then modeled {{in terms of their}} appearance, geometry and group co-occurrence statistics across a set of images. FBM was validated in the analysis of AD using a set of ~200 volumetric MRIs of the human brain, automatically identifying established indicators of AD in the brain and classifying mild AD in new images with a rate of 80%.|$|R

50|$|As {{a feature}} {{enhancement}} algorithm, the <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> can be utilized {{to increase the}} visibility of edges and other detail present in a digital image. A wide variety of alternative edge sharpening filters operate by enhancing high frequency detail, but because random noise also has a high spatial frequency, many of these sharpening filters tend to enhance noise, which can be an undesirable artifact. The <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> algorithm removes high frequency detail that often includes random noise, rendering this approach {{one of the most}} suitable for processing images {{with a high degree of}} noise. A major drawback to application of the algorithm is an inherent reduction in overall image contrast produced by the operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — One of {{the basic}} {{requirements}} in images representation was the feature extraction and its proper description and has many applications in the image processing and the machine vision. Many of the local feature descriptors of image use the <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussian</b> feature detector. This detector is too much invariant against the scale changes. In this paper, a procedure is presented to select a proper threshold for the standard deviation in Gaussian filter to improve the performance <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussian</b> detector. In this paper's method, based on the properties of co-occurrence matrixes, the spatial dependences between available points in the image are divided into three general classes: sharp points, middle points and unsharp points, and then, {{on the basis of}} this division, the appropriate position is determined for stopping the development of standard deviation in Gaussian filter in some way that it is prevented to destroy the sharp points in the image and also to select the noise points as the key points of image...|$|R
5000|$|We {{begin by}} {{detecting}} points of interest, which are termed keypoints in the SIFT framework. The image is convolved with Gaussian filters at different scales, {{and then the}} difference of successive Gaussian-blurred images are taken. Keypoints are then taken as maxima/minima of the <b>Difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> (DoG) that occur at multiple scales. Specifically, a DoG image [...] is given by ...|$|E
5000|$|LoG is {{an acronym}} {{standing}} for Laplacian of Gaussian, DoG is an acronym standing for <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> (DoG is an approximation of LoG), and DoH is an acronym standing for determinant of the Hessian. These scale-invariant interest points are all extracted by detecting scale-space extrema of scale-normalized differential expressions, i.e., points in scale-space where the corresponding scale-normalized differential expressions assume local extrema {{with respect to}} both space and scalewhere [...] denotes the appropriate scale-normalized differential entity (defined below).|$|E
50|$|The Ricker wavelet, {{commonly}} called the mexican hat wavelet is {{another type of}} filter {{that is used to}} model data. In multiple dimensions this becomes the Laplacian of a Gaussian function. For reasons of computational complexity, the Laplacian of a Gaussian function is often simplified as a <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians.</b> This difference of Gaussian function has found use in several computer vision applications such as keypoint detection. The disadvantage of the Mexican hat wavelet is that it exhibits some aliasing and does not represent oblique orientations well.|$|E

30|$|<b>Difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussian</b> and Laplacian {{training}} {{features are}} “blob” detection filters, which measure {{the size of}} relatively small objects. This is useful not only for classifying objects based on their size (for instance, crystal or cell growth stages), but also for rejecting errant bright or dark spots in the image which {{are too small to}} be physical, but which would still trigger the intensity or edge detection features.|$|R
30|$|During SIFT {{descriptor}} extraction, the <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussian</b> (DoG) space <b>of</b> {{the image}} is calculated first. Then, the keypoints are detected by finding those invariant to different scales in the DoG space. Based on the local region surrounding the detected keypoints, the orientation histogram is computed as the local descriptor. SIFT descriptors are relatively robust to image noises, illumination changes, as well as limited changes in viewing angles of the object.|$|R
50|$|In the {{computer}} vision literature, {{this approach is}} referred to as the <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> (DoG) approach. Besides minor technicalities, however, this operator is in essence similar to the Laplacian and can be seen as an approximation of the Laplacian operator. In a similar fashion as for the Laplacian blob detector, blobs can be detected from scale-space extrema of differences of Gaussians—see (Lindeberg 2012, 2015) for the explicit relation between the difference-of-Gaussian operator and the scale-normalized Laplacian operator. This approach is for instance used in the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm—see Lowe (2004).|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} vision, the Marr-Hildreth {{algorithm is}} a method of detecting edges in digital images, that is, continuous curves where there are strong and rapid variations in image brightness. The Marr-Hildreth edge detection method is simple and operates by convolving the image with the Laplacian of the Gaussian function, or, as a fast approximation by <b>Difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians.</b> Then, zero crossings are detected in the filtered result to obtain the edges. The Laplacian-of-Gaussian image operator is sometimes {{also referred to as}} the Mexican hat wavelet due to its visual shape when turned upside-down. David Marr and Ellen C.

5000|$|The multidimensional {{generalization}} of this wavelet {{is called the}} Laplacian of Gaussian function. In practice, this wavelet is sometimes approximated by the <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> function, because the DoG is separable and can therefore save considerable computation time in two or more dimensions. The scale normalised Laplacian (in -norm) is frequently used as a blob detector and for automatic scale selection in computer vision applications; see Laplacian of Gaussian and scale space. The relation between this Laplacian of the Gaussian operator and the difference-of-Gaussians operator is explained in appendix A in Lindeberg (2015). The Mexican hat wavelet can also be approximated by derivatives of Cardinal B-Splines ...|$|E

50|$|This keypoint {{detection}} step is {{a variation}} {{of one of the}} blob detection methods developedby Lindeberg by detecting scale-space extrema of the scale normalized Laplacian, that is detecting points that are local extrema with respect to both space and scale, in the discrete case by comparisons with the nearest 26 neighbours in a discretized scale-space volume. The <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> operator can be seen as an approximation to the Laplacian, with the implicit normalization in the pyramid also constituting a discrete approximation of the scale-normalized Laplacian.Another real-time implementation of scale-space extrema of the Laplacian operator has been presented by Lindeberg and Bretzner based on a hybrid pyramid representation, which was used for human-computer interaction by real-time gesture recognition in Bretzner et al. (2002).|$|E
50|$|Features from {{accelerated}} segment test (FAST) is {{a corner}} detection method, {{which could be}} used to extract feature points and later used to track and map objects in many computer vision tasks. FAST corner detector was originally developed by Edward Rosten and Tom Drummond, and published in 2006. The most promising advantage of the FAST corner detector is its computational efficiency. Referring to its name, it is fast and indeed it is faster than many other well-known feature extraction methods, such as <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> (DoG) used by the SIFT, SUSAN and Harris detectors. Moreover, when machine learning techniques are applied, superior performance in terms of computation time and resources can be realised. The FAST corner detector is very suitable for real-time video processing application because of this high-speed performance.|$|E
50|$|When {{utilized}} for image enhancement, the <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gaussians</b> algorithm is typically applied when the size ratio of kernel (2) to kernel (1) is 4:1 or 5:1. In the example images to the right, {{the sizes of}} the Gaussian kernels employed to smooth the sample image were 10 pixels and 5 pixels. The algorithm {{can also be used}} to obtain an approximation of the Laplacian of Gaussian when the ratio of size 2 to size 1 is roughly equal to 1.6. The Laplacian of Gaussian is useful for detecting edges that appear at various image scales or degrees of image focus. The exact values of sizes of the two kernels that are used to approximate the Laplacian of Gaussian will determine the scale of the difference image, which may appear blurry as a result.|$|E
30|$|The feature {{detection}} method in SIFT involves two steps [8].

This step is to detect all possible keypoints that bear blob-like patterns. The second step is to calculate the Hessian matrix at each keypoint location from step one and reject those keypoints if their Hessian matrices have two significantly different eigenvalues. Essentially this operation excludes the keypoints detected on edges.|$|R
