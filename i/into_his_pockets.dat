5|$|Diệm's {{advertising}} {{included the}} parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại {{through the streets}} of Saigon, depicted with bags of money on his shoulders, a deck of cards in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of cognac in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising. In particular, the blonde hair referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> thereby questioning his nationalist credentials. Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated, while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting songs about Bảo Đại.|$|E
25|$|During the Korean War, Novak {{served in}} the U.S. Army, and he reached the rank of lieutenant. He later stated that he had fully {{expected}} {{to die in the}} service. After serving from 1952 to 1954, he joined the Associated Press (AP) and became a political correspondent in Omaha, Nebraska. He was transferred to Lincoln, Nebraska, and then to Indianapolis, Indiana, covering the two state legislatures in his reporting. In 1957, Novak was transferred to Washington, D.C. where he reported on Congress. He left the AP to join the D.C. bureau of The Wall Street Journal in 1958, covering the Senate. He rose to the rank of chief congressional correspondent in 1961. He generally did his work without using a tape recordings or paper notes, relying just on his detailed memory. Novak's colleagues at The Wall Street Journal later said that he absorbed himself in his work so completely that he often forgot to shave, left his shoes untied, and even started accidentally placing burning cigarettes <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{symbolism}} in Winesburg, Ohio plays a {{large role}} in allowing for this reorientation. Beginning with the idea of characters as grotesques whose [...] "...grotesqueness is not merely a shield of deformity; it is also a remnant of misshapen feelings, what Dr. Reefy in the sketch 'Paper Pills' calls 'the sweetness of the twisted apples'". The irony of the sweet, but twisted (meaning, in the sentimental Victorian tradition, internally inferior), apples is that they are compared to Dr. Reefy's own knuckles that make a habit of stuffing crumpled notes bearing his thoughts unread <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> (itself a symbol of the [...] "ineffectuality of human thought"). Wing Biddlebaum, the subject of the story [...] "Hands", likewise was [...] "...forever striving to conceal [...] in his pockets or behind his back". [...] For Wing, his hands were [...] "...the very index of his humanity", with the potential to symbolize a continuum going from a general fear of sexuality to sublimated homosexuality. Wing Biddlebaum and Dr. Reefy are just two examples of how throughout Winesburg, Ohio, Anderson builds myriad themes by adding symbolic significance to gestures, weather conditions and time of day, and events, among other features of the stories.|$|E

2500|$|In men's fashion, {{the long}} {{redingote}} {{of the era}} of Louis-Philippe (the name came from the English term [...] "riding-coat") was gradually replaced by the jacquette, and then the even shorter veston. [...] The shorter jacket allowed a man to put his hands <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> [...] The trousers were wide at the waist, and very narrow at the cuffs. Men wore a neutral-colored vest, usually cut low to show off highly decorated shirts with frills and buttons of paste jewellery. [...] Men had gloves, but carried them in their hands, according to Gaston Jolivet, a prominent fashion observer of the time, in order [...] "to prove to the population {{that they had the}} means to buy a pair of gloves without using them." ...|$|E
