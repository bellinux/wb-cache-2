5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. Some argue that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage <b>forum</b> <b>shopping,</b> while other {{scholars argue that}} variation among circuits allows local courts to experiment with new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E

25|$|A concern often {{raised in}} {{applications}} of the doctrine is <b>forum</b> <b>shopping,</b> or picking a court merely to gain an advantage in the proceeding. This concern is balanced against the public policy of deferring to a plaintiff's choice of venue in claims where {{there may be more}} than one appropriate jurisdiction. The underlying principles, such as basing respect given to foreign courts on reciprocal respect or comity, also apply in civil law systems {{in the form of the}} legal doctrine of lis alibi pendens.|$|E

25|$|Large {{parts of}} the city centre have been redeveloped, {{including}} the area around the main railway station, the main shopping streets, the Entre Deux and Mosae <b>Forum</b> <b>shopping</b> centres, and the Maasboulevard promenade along the Meuse. Also, a new quarter, including the new Bonnefanten Museum, a public library, a theatre and several housing blocks designed by international architects, was built {{on the grounds of the}} former Céramique potteries near the town centre. As a result, Maastricht looks notably smarter. Further large-scale projects, such as the redevelopment of the Sphinx and Belvédère areas, are underway.|$|E
25|$|Equally, {{states have}} an {{interest}} in protecting the normal flow of trade within their borders. If businesses had constantly to verify the nationality or domicile of their customers and their ages, this might slow down business and, potentially, infringe privacy legislation. Hence, conflicts of public policy can emerge which complicate the choice of law decision and invite <b>forum</b> <b>shopping,</b> i.e. traders will always seek to sue infants with whom they have contracts in those states which accord priority to commercial interests, while children will seek the avoidance of liability in the courts which protect their interests. This would be achieved during the characterisation stage by classifying the issue as status and its incidents rather than contract because a party's status and lack of capacity would be in rem.|$|E
25|$|Before the 2006–2007 season, the TD Garden {{underwent}} a major overhaul, installing a new HD entertainment board. For basketball, video advertising panels (installed by the NCAA for the 2006 Women's Final Four) replaced the traditional scrolling panels, {{and added a}} see-through shot clock, joining the FedExForum, Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia), Philips Arena, US Airways Center, United Center, Quicken Loans Arena, and the Time Warner Cable Arena (this was done before the NBA mandate was installed in 2011). In addition, a vintage siren, just as the original Boston Garden had used, was added to replace the end-of-period horn for hockey only, {{a feature of the}} Montreal Canadiens, the Bruins' arch-rivals, at the Montreal Forum (now the Pepsi <b>Forum</b> <b>shopping</b> centre) and the current Centre Bell. In 2009, an LED energy efficient lighting system was added to the exterior of the building. The Boston Globe announced a 70-million-dollar project upgrade to TD Garden's concourses and Legends Club restaurant, along with technology upgrades and the relocation of a retail shop. Construction occurred in two phases, summer 2014 and then summer 2015.|$|E

500|$|Legal {{analysts have}} {{identified}} {{problems associated with}} circuit splits. Jesse M. Boodoo, for example, suggests that circuit splits create a state of confusion and uncertainty for citizens. Because different laws are applied and enforced in different jurisdictions, Daniel J. Meador has argued that Circuit splits may create a judicial [...] "Tower of Babel." [...] Additionally, Wayne A. Logan has argued that if courts speak with a unified voice, this will [...] "secure popular respect for judicial authority." [...] Likewise, Matthew Lund cautions that circuit splits will lead to <b>forum</b> <b>shopping,</b> where litigants flock to jurisdictions with more favorable laws. Judge Kimberly A. Moore also suggests that circuit splits and <b>forum</b> <b>shopping</b> lead to economic inefficiency because outcomes are unpredictable and litigants {{are less likely to}} settle.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} solutions to this problem was proposed by Friedrich Karl von Savigny (1779–1861). He {{argued that it was}} always necessary for the court to find the [...] "natural seat" [...] or [...] "centre of gravity" [...] for the case by identifying the largest cluster of [...] "connecting factors" [...] to a particular legal system. If all courts adopted such an international outlook, he reasoned, that would eliminate <b>forum</b> <b>shopping</b> by producing the same choice of law no matter where the case began. Unfortunately, the theory has not delivered the desired results. <b>Forum</b> <b>shopping</b> remains a problem, and neither legislators nor judges have been able to agree on characterisation issues, producing classifications that extend rather than reduce international divergences.|$|E
2500|$|The {{facts of}} Erie itself were {{an example of}} the kind of clever <b>forum</b> <b>shopping</b> {{practices}} which the Court wished to end. Pennsylvania clearly had personal jurisdiction over the railroad because of its operations there; also, the accident happened there, and Tompkins was a Pennsylvania resident. [...] But Tompkins chose to sue in a New York federal court to take advantage of its favorable rule [...] knowing that he had a much lower probability of obtaining a judgment in his favor under Pennsylvania's rule.|$|E

2500|$|In actual {{cases of}} {{international}} child abduction, {{this lack of}} a specific provision on child abduction in the 1961 treaty resulted in countries regularly interpreting the [...] "habitual residence" [...] concept of the Convention {{in a manner that}} allowed parents to take children to a foreign country and immediately acquire [...] "habitual residence." [...] This allowed judicial <b>forum</b> <b>shopping</b> and created perverse incentives for removing children from their homes to foreign jurisdictions in order to game the family law system and obtain a more favorable custodial outcome than could be gained in the jurisdiction of the child's home.|$|E
2500|$|By 1938, as Justice Brandeis acknowledged, [...] "the mischievous {{results of}} the {{doctrine}} had become apparent." [...] The problem with Swift was that rather than reducing <b>forum</b> <b>shopping,</b> it had only increased it by increasing the opportunities for <b>forum</b> <b>shopping</b> available to litigants. [...] There were two underlying issues behind this. [...] First, as the Erie opinion noted, nothing in the Constitution actually grants jurisdiction to the federal judiciary to conduct plenary review of issues of state common law where no federal issue is present. [...] Second, in accordance with that understanding (although this latter point was not noted in the Erie opinion), Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 only authorized the Supreme Court to review those state supreme court decisions that rejected federal claims. [...] While Congress broadened the scope of Supreme Court review in 1914 to include state supreme court decisions allowing federal claims, Congress never actually authorized the Supreme Court to conduct plenary review of the merits of state law claims (and no one ever sought a constitutional amendment that would authorize Congress to do that). [...] This meant the Supreme Court could not directly dictate uniform rules of state common law to all state courts or reverse their decisions for failing to apply such rules, which stands {{in stark contrast to}} other common law federations like Australia and Canada whose highest courts do possess such powers. [...] Since state courts had no actual obligation to follow the [...] "general law" [...] independently formulated under Swift by federal courts, state judge-made law continued to diverge instead of converge.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Erie was handed down, it had long been settled that when a federal court hears a state cause of action brought in federal district court in diversity, the statutory law of the state would be applied. However, {{in the case of}} Swift v. Tyson, 41 U.S. 1 (1842), [...] the Supreme Court had held that the federal courts need not also apply the court-made common law of the states. This had led to <b>forum</b> <b>shopping,</b> a litigation tactic whereby plaintiffs would seek to sue in federal court instead of state court {{in order to have a}} different substantive law applied. In light of this inequity, the Supreme Court had to determine whether federal courts should apply state common law. [...] However, the Court did not decide whether or not the new ruling applied to equity jurisprudence.|$|E
