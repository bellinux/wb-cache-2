5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish Academy {{chose the}} poet Sully Prudhomme {{for the first}} Nobel Prize in Literature. A group {{including}} 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded. Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet. The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.|$|E
5|$|The country became {{independent}} in 1977. Fédération Djiboutienne de Football {{was founded in}} 1977 and joined FIFA in 1994. Football {{is one of the}} most popular sports in the country. Women's football development in Africa has to deal with several challenges that impact the ability to develop a high level of play, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States. Another issue facing women's football in Africa <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> money for the game does not come from national football federations but instead from FIFA.|$|E

25|$|An {{advantage}} of parabolic antennas <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{structure of the}} antenna (all of it except the feed antenna) is nonresonant, so it can function {{over a wide range}} of frequencies, that is a wide bandwidth. All that is necessary to change the frequency of operation is to replace the feed antenna with one that works at the new frequency. Some parabolic antennas transmit or receive at multiple frequencies by having several feed antennas mounted at the focal point, close together.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reasons the}} Mexican Catholic Church has officially {{condemned}} the worship <b>of</b> Santa Muerte <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> her rites <b>are</b> modeled after Catholic liturgy, {{and some of}} Santa Muerte devotees eventually split from the Catholic Church and began vying for control of church buildings.|$|R

25|$|The next {{crisis was}} {{followed}} by the Berlin Wall construction on 13 August 1961, which had split the Berlin into east and west. The U2 was split into two sections, and for the north-south lines, trains were not allowed to stop for passengers and become Geisterbahnhöfe ("ghost stations"), patrolled by armed East-German border guards. Only at Friedrichstraße, a designated border crossing point, were passengers allowed to disembark. A further consequence over the years <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Berlin S-Bahn passengers boycotted the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and transferred to the U-Bahn with numerous expansion.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} faced by pediatric safety and quality efforts <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work on patient safety to date has focused on adult patients. In addition, there is no standard nomenclature for pediatric patient safety that is widely used. However, a standard framework for classifying pediatric adverse events that offers flexibility has been introduced. Standardization provides consistency between interdisciplinary teams and can facilitate multisite studies. If these large-scale studies are conducted, the findings could generate large-scale intervention studies conducted with a faster life cycle.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean, however, that all {{remaining}} differences between models and observations have been resolved.

The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are also consistent with our scientific {{understanding of how the}} climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the government's assurances that seats will be increased in the institutes so that the general category students don't get affected, another point raised against reservation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seats reserved for SC/ST candidates remain empty and hence any more reservation {{is a waste of}} resources. A major concern among them is also the fact that implementing reservation in institutes of higher education would be difficult unless the quality of faculty in them is diluted. They back this point by the fact that all IITs and IIMs are facing shortage of faculty and hence increasing the seats will lead to deterioration of education. For example, while IIT Kharagpur requires 667 faculties, it currently has only 470. Similarly, IIT Bombay has just 401 faculties as against the required 529.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} Rabbinic view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zohar and {{the parts}} included in it (i.e. those parts mentioned above) were written and compiled by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, but some parts preceded Rashbi {{and he used}} them (such as Sifra deTzni'uta; see above), and some parts were written or arranged in generations after Rashbi's passing (for example, Tannaim after Rashbi's time are occasionally mentioned). However, aside from {{the parts of the}} Zohar mentioned above, in the Zohar are mentioned tens of earlier sources that Rashbi and his Chevraya Kadisha had, and they were apparently the foundation of the Kabbalistic tradition of the Zohar. These include Sefer Raziel, Sifra de'Agad'ta, Sifra de'Adam haRishon, Sifra de'Ashmedai, Sifra Chakhmeta 'Ila'ah diVnei Kedem, Sifra deChinukh, Sifra diShlomoh Malka, Sifra Kadma'i, Tzerufei de'Atvun de'Itmasru le'Adam beGan 'Eden, and more. In the Jewish view this indicates more, that the teaching of the Sod in the book of the Zohar was not invented in the Tannaic period, but rather it is a tradition from ancient times that Rashbi and his Chevraya Kadisha used and upon which they built and founded their Kabbalah, and also that its roots are in the Torah that was given by Hashem to Moshe on Sinai.|$|E
500|$|As with And Then There Were None, Sheldon {{introduced}} a new character to the plot of Murder on the Orient Express, who was not present in Christie's novel, {{in order to fulfill}} the role of a player character and protagonist. The character, Antoinette Marceau, is described by Sheldon as an amalgam of two characters from the novel. These were Poirot's friend who ran the Orient Express, Marcel Bouc, and a young soldier who is present in both the novel and the film version of the story, who shepherds Poirot to Istanbul. Sheldon stated {{that he did not want}} to create entirely new protagonists for the Christie games, but rather preferred to draw from sources in Christie's novels to piece together the games' protagonists. Sheldon also addressed concerns from several early previews of the game, which asked why the player could not actually play as Poirot. He explained the choice of Marceau as the protagonist, saying [...] "the reason for choosing Marceau over Poirot as the protagonist <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fun of Poirot is seeing what he is up to, watching how he acts and solves things. I've always thought the more interesting character was the 'Watson' character rather than the Sherlock Holmes character." ...|$|E
