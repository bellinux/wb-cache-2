60|$|Every house I visited had its <b>individual</b> <b>message</b> of sordid {{struggle}} and half-hidden despair. Agnes had married {{and moved away}} to Dakota, and Bess had taken upon her girlish shoulders the burdens of wifehood and motherhood almost before her girlhood had reached its first period of bloom. In addition {{to the work of}} being cook and scrub-woman, she was now a mother and nurse. As I looked around upon her worn chairs, faded rag carpets, and sagging sofas,--the bare walls of her pitiful little house seemed a prison. I thought of her as she was in the days of her radiant girlhood and my throat filled with rebellious pain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} ongoing work {{in developing}} a compositional trace-based semantics and proof system for a real-time language. The semantics models distributed processes communicating over asynchronous FIFO communication channels. Sending processes can specify time-out periods for <b>individual</b> <b>messages.</b> Messages not received within their time-out period are `lost'. Program behavior is modeled as traces of events, including events (such as asynchronous messages) which occur after termination. The proof system uses specification triples with explicit variables for time and program traces. 1 Introduction This paper describes ongoing work {{in developing a}} compositional trace-based semantics and proof system for a real-time language.

50|$|In {{messaging}} {{systems that}} display threads hierarchically (as opposed to linearly), discussions can easily become fragmented.

50|$|Since 1972, the neo-Pentecostal Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International has {{expressed}} {{a belief in}} prophecy. The church claims this gift is manifested by one person (the prophesier) laying their hands on another person, who receives an <b>individual</b> <b>message</b> said by the prophesier. Prophesiers {{are believed to be}} used by the Holy Ghost as instruments through whom their God expresses his promises, advice and commandments. The church claims people receive messages about their future, in the form of promises given by their God and expected to be fulfilled by divine action.|$|E
50|$|FOX {{offers a}} {{transparent}} bi-directional messaging system. Each widget sends its message {{to a certain}} target. Each message is composed by a selector that identifies its kind and an id that is unique and provided by the widget's enumeration. The advantage is that each widget can call a target widget's method in a transparent manner, even if the method does not exist. Vice versa, {{in the implementation of}} the <b>individual</b> <b>message</b> handler, since the sender is known, the target can also dispatch a message to the sender. This is a particularly important feature in component oriented software, where components may be written by different people, or even different organizations.|$|E
50|$|Decrypting {{enciphered}} messages involves three stages, defined somewhat {{differently in}} that era than in modern cryptography. First, there is {{the identification of the}} system in use, in this case Enigma; second, breaking the system by establishing exactly how encryption takes place, and third, setting, which involves finding the way that the machine was set up for an <b>individual</b> <b>message,</b> i.e. the message key. Today, it is often assumed that an attacker knows how the encipherment process works and breaking specifically refers to finding a way to infer a particular key or message (see Kerckhoffs's principle). Enigma machines, however, had so many potential internal wiring states that reconstructing the machine, independent of particular settings, was a very difficult task.|$|E
40|$|Outdoor air {{pollution}} {{is a serious}} problem in many developing countries today. This study focuses on monitoring the dynamic changes of air quality effectively in large cities by analyzing the spatiotemporal trends in geo-targeted social media messages with comprehensive big data filtering procedures. We introduce a new social media analytic framework to (1) investigate the relationship between {{air pollution}} topics posted in Sina Weibo (Chinese Twitter) and the daily Air Quality Index (AQI) published by China's Ministry of Environmental Protection; and (2) monitor the dynamics of air quality index by using social media messages. Correlation analysis was used to compare the connections between discussion trends in social media messages and the temporal changes in the AQI during 2012. We categorized relevant messages into three types, retweets, mobile app <b>messages,</b> and original <b>individual</b> <b>messages</b> finding that original <b>individual</b> <b>messages</b> had the highest correlation to the Air Quality Index. Based on this correlation analysis, <b>individual</b> <b>messages</b> were used to monitor the AQI in 2013. Our study indicates that the filtered social media messages are strongly correlated to the AQI and can be used to monitor the air quality dynamics to some extent...|$|R

30|$|An {{example of}} such an {{advisory}} system is Connected Cruise Control (CCC; see for example [7, 8]). CCC offers drivers advice on the optimal speed, headway and driving lane in order to optimize the distribution of cars on the motorway and counteract the build-up and propagation of shockwaves. Drivers will receive <b>individual</b> advice <b>messages</b> via an in-car, nomadic device. These <b>individual</b> <b>messages</b> are adjusted to a drivers current lane, headway and speed, the actual speed limit {{as well as the}} desired route.|$|R
5000|$|Evaluation. The {{translated}} decrypt had to {{be evaluated}} for its intelligence content. For example, is the ostensible content of the message meaningful? If it is, for instance, part of a power contest within the Foreign Office or some {{other part of the}} Japanese government, its meaning and implications would be quite different from a simple informational or instructional message to an Embassy. Or, might it be another message in a series whose meaning, taken together, is more than the meaning of any <b>individual</b> <b>message.</b> Thus, the fourteenth message to an Embassy instructing that Embassy to instruct Japanese merchant ships calling at that country to return to home waters before, say, the end of November would be more significant than a single such message meant for a single ship or port. Only after having evaluated a translated decrypt for its intelligence value could anyone decide whether it deserved to be distributed.|$|E
50|$|Windows GUI {{programs}} are event-driven. After starting a process, Windows maintains an <b>individual</b> <b>message</b> queue for it. Windows places messages into that queue whenever mouse activity occurs on that process's window, whenever keyboard activity occurs while that process's window has focus, {{and at other}} times. A process can also add messages to its own queue. To accept user input, and for other reasons, each process must continuously retrieve messages from its queue, and act on them. A programmer makes the process do that by writing a loop that calls GetMessage (which blocks for a message and retrieves it), and then calls DispatchMessage (which dispatches the message), and repeats indefinitely. This is the message loop. It is usually part of the main program, which runs on the main thread. Messages for every window of the process pass through its message queue, and are handled by its message loop. A message loop is one kind of event loop.|$|E

[...] Zach Schonfeld of The A.V.

Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic.com gave the album 3,5 stars out of 5 claiming that: [...] "Young uses his sturdy footing to lash out at what he perceives as destructive forces -- to our dinner tables and social fabric -- and if the <b>individual</b> <b>message</b> may wind up fading like yesterdays newspapers, the music will keep The Monsanto Years burning bright".|$|E
