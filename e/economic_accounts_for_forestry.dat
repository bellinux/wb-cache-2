In this study, the results of two case studies, one in Bonifatu, Corsica (France) and the other in Alcornocales, Andalusia (Spain), show that private environmental services provide the majority share of social total sustainable income in Alcornocales (29 %), whereas public environmental services are the most relevant in Bonifatu (32 %).

These limitations of the standard accounts are addressed by the extended Agroforestry Accounting System, which is being tested at the publicly-owned Dehesa de la Luz agroforestry estate. The extended accounts simulate conservation forestry of holm oak and cork oak for the current as well as successive rotation cycles during which scheduled conservation of the cultural woodland landscape of the Dehesa de la Luz is carried out, improving the natural physical growth of the firewood and cork. The estimated results for 2014 reveal that private ecosystem services make up 50 % of the firewood and grazing products consumed; the private environmental income <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> 13 % of the total private income; and the private environmental asset represents 53 % of the total opening capital. The net value added is more than 2. 3 times the amount estimated using the standard accounts.

40|$|Agriculture {{has been}} always the {{important}} sector of national economy which {{as a part}} of the agri-food complex using the international agrarian market en-sures necessary demands not only in the CR but also abroad through its offer of food raw-material products and foodstuffs. Results of agricultural production, particularly plant production, are heavily affected by changes in weather conditions which markedly influenced results of our agriculture particularly in the recent years. In 2000 to 2003, a relatively unfavourable development was noticed in the sector of agriculture caused particularly by rainy weather and two waves of floods in 2002 and subsequent long-term drought for most of the growing season in 2003. Unfavourable conditions affecting particularly plant production, the continuing decrease in prices of agricultural products and the decrease in the stock of farm animals also negatively influenced animal production and thus also the total production of agricultural products and the sector of agriculture as a whole. The aim of the paper is to study the economic extent and efficiency of the sector of agriculture or agricultural primary production within national economy by the means of a basic methodological tool, i. e. <b>economic</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> agriculture in the reference period 1998 to 2003.

The paper uses data on some important fish stocks in Icelandic waters to give examples of results from using the proposed methods and indicate the degree of uncertainty involved in the estimations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the methodological and conceptual {{aspects of a}} framework, which extends the conventional <b>economic</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> agriculture with environmental issues, valued in monetary terms. This leads to <b>Economic</b> and Environmental <b>Accounts</b> <b>for</b> Agriculture (EEAA). The EEAA {{are based on the}} conventional agricultural accounts and on existing tools for valuing non-market goods and services. The private costs and benefits of the sector are integrated with external “social ” ones, i. e. commodity goods and services with non- commodity ones. Emphasis is put on those external costs and benefits that are already internalised as taxes and subsidies. As both positive and negative externalities are <b>accounted</b> <b>for,</b> the EEAA allow a better monitoring and evaluation of agriculture’s multifunctionality. They enable simulating impacts of policy instruments, such as a subsidy increase, not only on agricultural income, but also on societal welfare. It also becomes possible to appreciate the shares of different stakeholders (producers, public authorities, water agency, consumers, etc.) in the costs or benefits of the environmental goods and services provided by agriculture.

We show how the total income of each single product is distributed amongst the factorial rewards to labor, and environmental and manufactured assets. Private products <b>account</b> <b>for</b> 46 % of the average total income that the Stone pine forest would yield over its rotation, while public services comprise the remaining 54 %. Our results also suggest that the production of public non-market services would offset the government compensation payments to support Stone pine afforestation and management. Finally, the results show that, on average, 7 % of the estimated total income would be captured by the current System of National <b>Accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>forestry</b> if applied to our case study (including only the net value added from timber and pine cone production and from plantation investment) and that 14 % of this income would be dislocated into the government institutional accounts...|$|R

The paper presents two case studies of environmental accounting of forestry resources at regional/national level: {{the first one is}} an economic estimate {{of the role of the}} forestry sector in the Liguria Region (north-west Italy). The proposed satellite system of forest resources account is based on a Geographical Information System (GIS) comprising an extremely diversified set of physical data, associated with economic information collected through the use of various evaluation methods (Travel Cost Method, Contingent Valuation, reconstruction costs, opportunity costs, etc.). Production of wood and non-wood forest products, soil erosion control, landscape protection, carbon fixing, provision of outdoor recreational areas are taken into account in the proposed System of Regional <b>Accounting</b> <b>for</b> the <b>forestry</b> sector. The second case study consists of a tentative estimate of damage costs from forest fires occurring in Italy over the past eleven years. Official statistical data related to financial costs deriving from forest fires are compared with the results of a tentative estimate of some social costs. Results from the two case studies could be used to evaluate the real contribution of forest activities to national economy and to better orientate public funding and defensive expenditures in the forestry sector...|$|R
