40|$|The {{point of}} {{departure}} for this study is the recent work of Burden (2008) on the ?gender gap? in partisanship in the United States. He shows that the preponderance of Democratic identification among women is partly a function of the measurement of party identification. When respondents were asked ?<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are? rather than, more traditionally, ?Do you think of yourself as? a Democrat or Republican, the sex gap narrowed to statistical nonsignificance. Burden's explanation for this result lies in the psychology of partisanship. The traditional ?think of yourself as? (or cognitive) question primes women to consider their partisanship as a social identity, which in turn activates the stereotypical association between women and the Democratic Party. The ?feel that you are? (or affective) question encourages a deeper, more personalized response, rendering social identity less relevant and thereby nullifying the effect of that stereotype...|$|E
40|$|Proefskrif (PhD) [...] PU vir CHO, 1992 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to clarify the precise {{meaning of the term}} "stress" and to formulate criteria for diagnosing stress in Standard six pupils; to identify various stress factors prevalent among Standard six pupils by means of a questionnaire on stress; to determine the influence of stress on the achievement of a group of Standard six pupils; and academic to provide guidelines for combating stress which will promote the optimization of the academic achievement of pupils. The method of research entailed an empirical which 1054 Standard six pupils from five investigation in Afrikaans medium secondary schools were involved. In order to determine the incidence of stress in these pupils and to obtain biographical data and information on stress, each of these pupils had to complete a questionnaire. In addition to biographical data and information on stress, the academic achievement and IQ of each individual pupil were also required. The average academic achievement for the first examination written by Standard six pupils in a new school environment and the IQ scores available at the schools were taken into consideration in this research project. No additional IQ tests were conducted. The questionnaire was completed by the pupils themselves. Their academic achievement and IQ scores were recorded on a class list by their tutor teachers. In order to ensure anonymity and confidentiality, every questionnaire on stress was linked to the appropriate pupil in respect of the marks he/she obtained and his/her IQ score by means of a numerical system (cf. par. 5. 4. 2). Based on the biographical data gathered, it was concluded that the following pupils were more prone to stress: Girls Pupils who had changed schools three or more times Pupils who had older brothers and/or sisters Children from broken homes. From the questionnaire on stress it appeared that the following ten items showed the highest negative correlation with academic achievement: How often do you feel helpless? Is your schoolwork important to you? Are you afraid of the unknown? Are you shy? How often <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a demanding person? Do you easily become tense about an issue? How often do you feel cheerful and playful? Do you find it easy to talk to others and do you talk a lot? Do you often do something with the purpose of annoying or irritating somebody? How often are you restless or overactive? It can, however, never be taken for granted that a child who is not performing well academically is suffering from stress. Many factors within and outside the school situation can be the cause of poor academic achievement. Some of the items mentioned may have a negative influence on a child's academic achievement. These items may be used in a test with the purpose of identifying stress in a child. It is significant that the three items which showed the highest negative correlation with academic achievement, also showed the highest negative correlation with the IQ score. These items are a feeling of helplessness, the child's attitude towards school work and his fear of the unknown. Doctora...|$|E

The purposes of this assignment were to have the students engage in critical analyses of books for children and to employ criteria by which children's books could be reviewed, evaluated, and judged. I chose to do my comparative study of books that received Newbery honors during 1959. The two books selected were The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Speare and The Family Under the Bridge by Natalie Savage Carlson...|$|R

Using the Bureau of Statistics I analyzed how much the average income of average White males was compared to that of a Hispanic male.

I will also use a website titled: National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to evaluate a statement commented on that website that also relates to Hispanics and Whites, ???according to NCES a student???s economic standpoint doesn???t reflect a student???s grades. I beg to differ, however, because the United States no longer lives in a Meritocracy. Meritocracy is a system that is based on how much you work and on how much you have achieved. ???
