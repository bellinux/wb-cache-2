40|$|In this work, we {{mechanically}} perturb a liquid-in-liquid jet {{to manipulate}} the size {{and structure of the}} droplets formed from break-up of the jet. The induced break-up is relatively insensitive to fluctuations in the surrounding fluid flow. When the amplitude of perturbations is large and the interfacial tension of the liquid–liquid system is low, the size of the droplets can be precisely tuned by controlling {{the rate at which the}} liquid exits the tip of the <b>dispensing</b> <b>nozzle</b> through the frequency of perturbation. When applied to microfluidic devices with the appropriate geometry, our perturbation-induced droplet approach offers a strategy to manipulating droplet structures. We demonstrate that by varying the imposed perturbation frequency and phase lag, the structure of the multi-compartmental drops and the configuration of the resultant drops in the same flow condition can be manipulated. Moreover, after careful treatment of the wettability of the devices, we show that the structure of the droplets can be precisely controlled to change from single emulsion to double emulsion within the same device. The perturbation-induced droplet generation represents a new paradigm in the engineering of droplets, enhancing current droplet-based technologies for applications ranging from particle fabrication to confined micro-reactions. postprin...|$|E
40|$|Diesel {{fuel oil}} (DFO) spills at fueling {{platforms}} increase railroad operating costs by decreasing the locomotive miles traveled per gallon of DFO dispensed {{and increasing the}} cost of recovering and treating spilled DFO. Pressure fluctuations in the fuel system can trigger inadvertent <b>dispensing</b> <b>nozzle</b> shut off before a locomotive fuel tank is full. Fuel tanks occasionally overflow after the automatic shut-off mechanism on a nozzle is disabled to prevent subsequent inadvertent nozzle shut off. A hydraulic pressure surge analysis of two fueling yards suggests a correlation between the magnitude of these pressure fluctuations {{and the amount of}} DFO lost from fuel tank overflows. For example, at a fueling yard with a history of high DFO spillage, system pressure fluctuations are predicted to be large enough to trigger inadvertent shut off and potential fuel tank overflow following closure of one nozzle. In contrast, at a fueling yard with a history of low DFO spillage, pressure fluctuations insufficient to cause inadvertent shut off and potential overflow are predicted following the simultaneous closure of up to four (4) nozzles. Appropriately sized, pressurized bladder surge tanks installed on fueling platforms prevent inadvertent nozzle shut off, eliminating the need to monitor the filling process and reducing fuel tank overflows and the subsequent loss of DFO.

40|$|Summary. Improvement of {{the theory}} and methods of {{calculation}} of extrusion equipment is a problem whose solution provides the optimal design of its components {{in order to obtain}} the desired product quality. As the quality of the extrudate, extrusion machine performance is largely determined by the mode of pre matrix zone worm, article considers the mathematical model of the extrusion process for this particular zone of the extruder. Using co-extrusion will greatly expand the range of multicomponent products, balanced chemical composition and with programmable features. In their manufacture the inner layer is formed from fatvitamin fillings and an outer shell - of the extrusion obtained cereal-based. To ensure the stability of the co-extrusion process forming head channels must be designed so that the pressure generated therein is sufficient to distribute the material and the residence time therein of the extrudate is minimized. Solution of this problem requires an accurate description of the flow of materials in the form of channels.

In order to build 3 D complex scaffolds with multi-biomaterials for clinical application, a new 3 D multi-nozzle system with dual-mode drives, i. e. ejection and extrusion was developed.

Because {{of a lack of}} studies on hot-drinks related illnesses, the aim of the study is to identify the presence and load of bacterial species, potentially harmful for consumers, within hot-drinks {{vending machines}}. Methods This preliminary cross sectional study was carried out in April 2015 at the University of Siena, Italy. 12 samples from 4 hotdrinks vending machines(VM) were taken using a sterile swab; samples were taken from: i) <b>Dispense</b> Area, ii) <b>Nozzle,</b> iii) Glass- Holder. The samples were analyzed in the laboratory and sown on selective terrains. Results were expressed both in terms of average CFU/swab between the samples of the 4 VM, and in terms of CFU/cm 2, relying on guidelines of surfaces sanitation, which fix the limit in 50 CFU/cm 2. Total Microbial Load(TML) at 36 C and 22 C was assessed for mesophilic and psychrophilic contamination. Descriptive analysis were performed. Results All the analyzed surfaces exceeded the fixed limit. Nozzles were the mostly contaminated, showing a bacterial load of 82500 CFU/swab (SD: 41662), correspondent to 2063 CFU/cm 2. Dispense Area showed an high presence of bacteria (TML from 28125 CFU/swab to Uncountable Microbial Colonies (UMC) both at 36 C, and at 22 C). The TML of the Glass- Holder went from 1380 CFU/swab to UMC at 36 C, and from 1050 CFU/swab to UMC at 22 C. In particular the nozzle showed a mean of 22770 CFU/swab(SD: 27444), correspondent to 569 CFU/cm 2 of Staphylococcus spp, and 25399 CFU/swab (SD: 35252), correspondent to 635 CFU/cm 2 of Enterococcus spp. Conclusions Given the high number of CFU/swab and the presence of harmful species that we identified so far, VM may constitute a potential threat for consumer, reason for which further studies are recommendable.

30|$|The {{deposition}} {{process of the}} anode and the electrolyte on selected porous supports was done by DCIJP. The printer developed for the experiment consisted of an electromagnetically driven print head with 100 -µm ruby nozzle orifice and x–y planar positioning system. An electromagnetic technology was chosen because it offers simplicity and reliability of use, as well as wider range of ink/suspension compatibility. This is an important advantage in comparison to piezoelectric inkjet heads which have either stringent requirements towards ink rheology or have to be designed specifically for {{a certain type of}} ink. The printer works on a magnetic piston/solenoid mechanism where the suspension ink is loaded into the reservoir and a pressure is applied onto it. The substrate is placed ~ 5  mm below the nozzle orifice. As an electrical pulse controlled by the computer interface passes through the solenoid, the electromagnetic field lifts the piston off the surface of the nozzle for a certain amount of time—“open time” parameter. The pressure exerted onto the reservoir then forces a set amount of suspension ink through the <b>nozzle</b> <b>dispensing</b> a drop. The preparation of stable suspension inks is of critical importance for achieving repeatable jetting. The commercial NiO (Sigma Aldrich) and Gd:CeO 2 -GDC (Fuel Cell Materials) powders were mixed with alpha-Terpineol and binders, and ball milled with 3 YSZ beads in 3 YSZ bowls in a planetary mill (Pulverisette, Fritsch, Germany). The mass load of the ceramic powders and the type of the ink carrier were limited by the rheological working window of the nozzle, which defined the regime of stable repeatable jetting. Hence, the viscosity of the suspension inks had to be adjusted to suitable levels by adding lower viscosity solvents–methanol (MeOH) or 1 -Propanol (PrOH). The suspension inks developed were sufficiently stable to permit printing without mechanical agitation within 24  h of preparation. In order to minimize the risk of clogging of the nozzle care was taken to limit the particle size to below the empirically established level of 3  μm. The inks were filtered through 3 -μm glass microfibre filters before being loaded into the nozzle compartments. The nozzles were observed to execute reproducible DOD tasks without clogging the internal fluidic pathways of the assembly.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study concerning the rise height and morphology of a negatively buoyant fluid projectile, produced when a finite volume of saline solution is forced vertically upwards into a quiescent and uniform fresh water environment, is presented. Unlike the much studied continuous injection of high Reynolds number negatively buoyant fluid {{giving rise to}} a turbulent fountain, the behaviour of a finite volume negatively buoyant release remains, until now, unstudied. The work presented herein {{is based on the}} development of an experimental set up and methodology specifically tailored {{to the study of the}} negatively buoyant projectile. We commence by identifying the two source parameters governing the behaviour of the negatively buoyant projectile; namely the source Froude number FrD, expressing the ratio of source momentum to source buoyancy, and the aspect ratio of release L/D. relating the length L of the column of saline solution <b>dispensed</b> to the <b>nozzle</b> diameter D. In doing so, we note the link to turbulent fountains (continuous negatively buoyant releases) whose behaviour is governed solely by FrD and to vortex rings (finite volume neutrally buoyant releases), whose behaviour is governed solely by L/D. Based on its differing rise height behaviour and morphology of release (for varying FrD and L/D), we classified the negatively buoyant projectile into one of three regimes: the weak-fountain regime, where the rise height behaviour of the negatively buoyant projectile adhered to very weak fountain predictions; the vorticity-development regime, where the development of an internal vortical structure within the head of the negatively buoyant projectile inhibited its vertical propagation; and the forced-release regime, where the rise height behaviour of the negatively buoyant release adhered, under certain source conditions, to forced fountain predictions. This adherence of the rise height behaviour of negatively buoyant projectiles to fountain rise height predictions led to a study of the source conditions (in terms of FrD and L/D), separating finite volume behaviour (negatively buoyant projectile) from continuous behaviour (fountain), at least in terms of initial fountain rise heights. This study led to a classification of the FrD and L/D vales marking the transition from finite volume behaviour to continuous behaviour for negatively buoyant releases, linking our work on the negatively buoyant projectile to existing fountain literature. Finally, we studied the time dependent volume of the head of the negatively buoyant projectile as it propagated, and identified two stages: a growth stage and a decay stage. We established that the volume of the head of the negatively buoyant projectile is subject to an absolute limit. This finding compares favourably with the absolute limit on the volume of fluid contained within a neutrally buoyant vortex ring (the formation number), as detailed in vortex ring literature. On comparing our findings on the negatively buoyant projectile to those on vortex rings, we developed a new method for estimating the formation number of negatively buoyant projectiles (possibly also for vortex rings), determined the dependence of the formation number on FrD, and linked our work on the negatively buoyant projectile to the existing literature on vortex rings.

40|$|One of the {{possible}} reasons for post-contamination of extended shelf life (ESL) milk could be attachment and formation of biofilms on stainless steel pipe surfaces. In South Africa, ESL milk processors are still facing challenges extending the shelf life beyond 14 days. It is hypothesized that post-contamination along the milk processing line is responsible of reducing the shelf life of ESL milk. This assumption was investigated by assessing the microorganisms associated with the nozzles of aseptic filling machines post CIP process and {{this study was designed}} and divided into two phases. Phase one involved isolation and characterisation of the bacteria associated with the nozzles of aseptic filling machines after CIP process with the aim of determining the diversity of microorganisms attached to the nozzles of aseptic filling machines. Swab samples were collected from a plant processing ESL milk. Twenty swabs were taken from ten different nozzles of aseptic filling machines during 4 visits (n= 80). The swab samples were plated on the day of sampling. A total bacterial count ranging from 1. 75 - 1. 95 log CFU/cm 3 with an average of 1. 81 log CFU/cm 3 (n= 80). MALDI-TOF revealed a high percentage of Gram-positive rods (69 %), followed by Gram-positive cocci (20 %) and then Gram-negative rods (7 %). The Gram-positive rods belonging to genus Bacillus were identified as Bacillus cereus, followed by B. pumilus, B. subtilis and Paenibacillus spp. The Gram-positive cocci included S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus and Anaerococcus spp. The Gram-negative rods were identified as Acinetobacter junii. The prevalence of Bacillus spp. noted in the nozzles of ESL aseptic filling machines is attributed to their ability to resist heat treatment during CIP process and their ability to attach to stainless steel surfaces. There was a degree of similarity in terms of MALDI-TOF MS profiles for the strains of B. cereus, Staphylococcus spp. and Paenibacillus spp. originating from the nozzles of aseptic filling machines and the packaged ESL milk product. Furthermore, these isolates show close relatedness. These bacteria are likely to originate from the <b>nozzles,</b> <b>dispensed</b> into the final ESL milk during filling process. Phase two aimed at determining cell surface hydrophobicity of the isolates originating from the nozzles of aseptic filling machines. Co-currently the study further determined the ability of B. cereus, S. epidermidis, M. luteus and Paenibacillus spp. to attach and form biofilms on stainless surfaces. The bacterial strains were isolated from the nozzles of aseptic filling machines. The degree of hydrophobicity of the spore formers ranged from 8 - 91 % while non-spore formers ranged from 6 - 67 %. Hydrophobicity of S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Acinetobacter junii and Arthrobacter castelli differed significantly (p? 0. 05). Hydrophobicity of B. pumilus, Paenibacillus spp. and B. cereus (p? 0. 05) differed significantly. Spore formers showed the highest hydrophobicity to solvents, this can be contributed to their hydrophobic nature and their ability to attach to stainless surfaces. A continuous flow reactor system was used to grow biofilm of the isolates in skim milk. The skim milk was inoculated with spore suspension of B. cereus, Paenibacillus spp. and bacterial suspension of M. luteus and S. epidermidis. The bacterial suspensions were run separately over a period of 20 h at 37 °C. Stainless steel strips were submitted to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) after 22 h. The results suggested that spores of B. cereus and Paenibacillus spp. can only attach whilst M. luteus and S. epidermidis can attach and form biofilms on stainless steel. The ability of these isolates to form biofilms on stainless steel strips could be the main cause of contamination of ESL milk. Strains of Bacillus spp. can form biofilm on stainless steel and limit the shelf life of milk and milk products. However, toxins produced by some of these strains of B. cereus might be contagious to humans. The results confirmed {{that one of the reasons}} of contamination of ESL milk could be the ability of B. cereus to attach to stainless surfaces and M. luteus to form biofilms. Over and above the fact that the spores of B. cereus can lead to spoilage of milk and milk products, a concern is that the toxins produced by some of the strains of B. cereus are detrimental to human health.
