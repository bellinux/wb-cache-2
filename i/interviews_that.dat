5|$|Guerdon Trueblood is {{credited}} for the story; a reviewer for the website SciFilm {{says that the}} screenplay was based upon Trueblood's story about a white shark swimming upstream and becoming trapped in a lake. Carl Gottlieb, who had also revised the screenplays {{for the first two}} Jaws films, was credited for the script alongside Richard Matheson. Matheson has reported in <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> the screenplay was revised by script doctors.|$|E
5|$|Police {{investigators}} under Captain Michael Schaack had a lead fragment {{removed from}} a policeman's wounds chemically analyzed. They reported that the lead used in the casing matched the casings of bombs found in Lingg's home. A metal nut and fragments of the casing taken from the wound also roughly matched bombs made by Lingg. Schaack concluded, {{on the basis of}} <b>interviews,</b> <b>that</b> the anarchists had been experimenting for years with dynamite and other explosives, refining the design of their bombs before coming up with the effective one used at the Haymarket.|$|E

5|$|Scorsese {{has stated}} in <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> {{among the most}} {{difficult}} aspects of the film to represent were the spiritual themes presented in Endo's original book used for the film. The first version of the script he attempted to write with his co-writer Jay Cocks only managed to get midway through the material, before being set aside as insufficiently sensitive to the spiritual aspects of the book. It took Scorsese many years to envision a way to approach an accurate and informed filming of the scenes, involving spiritual transitions among the actors in the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{stains on}} Van der Sloot's clothes matched Flores' blood type. Blood {{was also found}} on the floor, hallway, and {{mattress}} in the hotel room. Police stated that DNA tests would be conducted on the clothes, skin found under the victim's fingernails, and the previously recovered tennis racquet. Ricardo Flores stated in <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> his daughter's body needed to be exhumed to gather the fingernail DNA evidence, and that her body had not been cremated for this reason.|$|E
5|$|While {{proud to}} be the first French World Champion, Prost, annoyed that French journalists were proclaiming it as a win for France, pointed out in <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> other than himself, nothing about the car (the MP4/2B) had {{anything}} to do with France. The team was British (having been founded by a New Zealander), the tyres were American Goodyears, the TAG-Porsche engine was German, the chassis itself was built by Hercules Aerospace in the USA, and was sponsored by an American tobacco company (Marlboro) and the Saudi Arabian owned company Techniques d'Avant Garde (TAG).|$|E

5|$|A {{sequel to}} Nights into Dreams with the working title Air Nights was {{originally}} outlined for the Sega Saturn and subsequently {{developed for the}} Dreamcast with motion control being a central element of gameplay. In an August 1999 interview, Yuji Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development, but by December 2000 the project had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel after the Dreamcast's discontinuation, but later noted in 2003 {{that he would be}} interested in using the licence of Nights into Dreams to reinforce Sega's identity as a video game developer. Discussion concerning a new game in the series had increased in frequency by 2006. Rumours regarding a Wii version continued to appear when a list of upcoming games was published by Japanese developer G.rev, which included an unspecified Nights title. Before the development of Journey of Dreams, Naka confirmed in retrospective <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> he had intended to base the next Nights game around a unique motion controller.|$|E
5|$|Bosh {{eventually}} {{chose to}} follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management. There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, {{but by the end}} of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA. He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career. He said he intends to obtain a college degree in the future, to fulfill a promise made to his mother.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the {{university}} {{responded to a}} series of New York Times <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> showed a pattern of labor abuses in its fledgling Abu Dhabi location, creating a statement of labor values for Abu Dhabi campus workers. A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms where workers had to sleep under beds. According to the article, workers who attempted to protest the NYU contractors' conditions were promptly arrested. Reports also claimed that those arrested by police were later abused at the police station. Many workers who were not local were then deported to their home countries. The university quickly responded to the reports with an apology to the workers. In 2015, NYU compensated thousands of migrant workers on its Abu Dhabi complex.|$|E

5|$|Lang filmed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse {{at the end}} of 1932 and the {{beginning}} of 1933, desiring to have the film viewed worldwide. In his film, where gun-play, fires, or explosions are needed, Lang often used real weapons. In the opening scene during a power outage, a stunt actor did the gun play. Cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner stated that he spent most of the production in a state of panic due to the way Lang would endanger his crew. The film is generally filmed in a realistic style with the exception of Mabuse's ghostly appearances throughout the film. Lang admitted later in <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> if he could re-do the film, he would not have included these supernatural scenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time that Detox had been record for, {{as well as the}} limited amount of {{material}} that had been officially released or leaked from the recording sessions, had given it considerable notoriety within the music industry. Numerous release dates (including the ones mentioned above) had been given for the album over the years since it was first announced, although none of them transpired to be genuine. Several musicians closely affiliated with Dr. Dre, including Snoop Dogg, fellow rappers 50 Cent and Game and producer DJ Quik, had speculated in <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> the album will never be released, due to Dr. Dre's business and entrepreneurial ventures having interfered with recording work, as well as causing him to lose motivation to record new material.|$|E
5|$|The troupe hired {{several of}} the people they had worked with on Brain Candy, {{including}} Craig Northey and director Kelly Makin. They shot the series in North Bay, along with locations in Mattawa and Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, which allowed them to access federal and provincial funding incentives for economic development in Northern Ontario. For example, the courtroom scenes were filmed in North Bay's Trinity United Church and the graveyard site was filmed on Mattawa's Explorer's Point. McKinney has claimed in <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> the red vest worn by Death was found in a storehouse of old CBC props and costumes, and was previously worn by Bob Homme in The Friendly Giant. While drafting the script, cast member Scott Thompson was diagnosed with stage one non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He began chemotherapy sessions shortly before the August – September 2009 shooting dates and started four weeks of radiation treatment once shooting wrapped.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, Van der Sloot gave several <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have a condom. Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that {{he had to go to}} school in the morning. According to Van der Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting on the beach. In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home. Van der Sloot stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|E
5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates. She explained in <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E
5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the <b>interviews</b> <b>that</b> {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E
