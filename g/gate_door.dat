6000|$|Jocelyn {{had promised}} to pay an early visit to {{ascertain}} the state of Mrs. Pierston's health after her night's rest, her precarious condition being more obvious to him than to Avice, and making him a little anxious. Subsequent events caused him to remember {{that while he was}} dressing he casually observed two or three boatmen standing near the cliff beyond the village, and apparently watching with deep interest {{what seemed to be a}} boat far away towards the opposite shore of South Wessex. At half-past eight he came from the door of the inn and went straight to Mrs. Pierston's. On approaching he discovered that a strange expression which seemed to hang about the house-front that morning was more than a fancy, the <b>gate,</b> <b>door,</b> and two windows being open, though the blinds of other windows were not drawn up, the whole lending a vacant, dazed look to the domicile, as of a person gaping in sudden stultification. Nobody answered his knock, and walking into the dining-room he found that no breakfast had been laid. His flashing thought was, 'Mrs. Pierston is dead.' ...|$|E
60|$|Daylight {{was just}} {{breaking}} when the Sarci entered the forest four miles from Camalodunum. Here they scattered {{in search of}} dry wood. In two hours sufficient had been gathered for their purpose, and it was made up into two hundred great faggots nearly four feet across and ten in length, in weight {{as much as a}} strong man could carry on his head. With these they returned to the city. It needed no questions as to the result of the attack, which had just terminated with the same fortune that had befallen that on the day previous. Unser had been killed, and large numbers of his men had fallen in their vain attempts to hew down the gates. The battering rams had proved a complete failure. Many of the fifty men who carried the beam had fallen as they advanced. The others had rushed at the <b>gate</b> <b>door,</b> but the recoil had thrown them down, and many had had their limbs broken from the tree falling on them. Attempts had been made to repeat the assault; but the Romans having pierced the under part of the roof in many places, let fall javelins and poured down boiling oil; and at last, having done all that was possible, but in vain, the tribesmen had fallen back.|$|E
60|$|But {{the strongest}} {{influence}} {{of all was}} the love of the old premises where he had run about when he was a boy, just as Tom had done after him. The Tullivers had lived on this spot for generations, and he had sat listening on a low stool on winter evenings while his father talked of the old half-timbered mill that had been there before the last great floods which damaged it so that his grandfather pulled it down and built the new one. It was when he got able to walk about and look at all the old objects that he felt the strain of his clinging affection for the old home as part of his life, part of himself. He couldn't bear to think of himself living on any other spot than this, where he knew the sound of every <b>gate</b> <b>door,</b> and felt that the shape and color of every roof and weather-stain and broken hillock was good, because his growing senses had been fed on them. Our instructed vagrancy, which was hardly time to linger by the hedgerows, but runs away early to the tropics, and is at home with palms and banyans,--which is nourished on books of travel and stretches the theatre of its imagination to the Zambesi,--can hardly get a dim notion of what an old-fashioned man like Tulliver felt for this spot, where all his memories centred, and where life seemed like a familiar smooth-handled tool that the fingers clutch with loving ease. And just now he was living in that freshened memory of the far-off time which comes to us in the passive hours of recovery from sickness.|$|E

On the one hand, we are a professional community that has managed to reduce irre-ducible concepts to streams of incomprehensible acronyms. On the other hand, we borrow rich and descriptive language from other dis-ciplines to illuminate our own. Such terms as architecture, ecology, and webs have originated elsewhere and emerged anew from the information technology (IT) cauldron, often to reemerge as a new part of the vernacular. The most recent linguistic borrowing is the term portal, which Winston Dictionary defines as “a <b>gate,</b> <b>door,</b> or entrance; especially one that is stately and imposing, as of a cathedral. ” Given the eccle-siastical origins of the modern university, perhaps it is fitting and appropriate that the latest information technology metaphor is one that fits the collegiate idea so well. The term portal, however, is a somewhat troublesome metaphor because it leaves as much un-answered as it purports to answer. One might legitimately ask, a doorway to what? What on earth, our campus colleagues must won-der, is a portal strategy, and why is one important to me?

40|$|This paper covers {{research}} examining the restoration {{work of the}} Shimo-no-hashi-mon gate inside the Fukuoka-jo castle. The ground floor of Shimo-no-hashi-mon (lit. the Lower Bridge Gate) still exists. However, photos depicting the original structure of the gate do not exist. Fukuoka City is doing restoration works of Shimo-no-hashi-mon gate based on images of the Kami-no-hashi-mon gate old photos of which still remain. The most similar building to this Shimo-no-hashi-mon gate is honmaru-omote-mon gate. The window shutters of the honmaru-omote-mon gate are hung by hinges and projected from the wall when they are open. In this style of window {{which is similar to}} Bahama shutter style, the window looks consecutive with the wall, and the number of windows can be doubled that of the sliding shutter style windows needing storage place behind the wall. The upper half of the Shimo-no-hashi-mon <b>Gate</b> <b>door</b> is a lattice and has holes through which you can shoot at the enemies. The restoration plan made by Fukuoka City assumed that the part colored white in the black and white photo was a wall and decided to make sliding shutter style windows on the wall. It is argued, however, the part coloured white is the shutter which made look lighter than it should be in the photo by overexposure. The restoration plan made by Fukuoka City has failed to catch the characters and values Fukuoka castle gates. In addition, it also points out that the restoration plan has made a mistake to make the passage of the second floor not passabl...|$|E

50|$|Trapped key {{interlocking}} utilizes locks and keys for sequential control {{of equipment and}} machinery to ensure safe operation. Trapped key interlocks are widely used to ensure safe access to potentially live or dangerous plant or equipment in an industrial setting. A safe sequence of operations is enabled through transfer of keys that are either trapped or released in a predetermined order. For example, a key is used to isolate a power source (circuit breaker or supply valve), this key is then released and can then be used to gain access through a <b>gate</b> or <b>door</b> to a high risk area by inserting it into an access lock. The key will then remain trapped until the <b>gate</b> or <b>door</b> is closed. A personnel or safety key can be released from the access lock, this ensures that the <b>gate</b> or <b>door</b> can not be closed and the initial key released until this personnel or safety key is returned. This provides increased operator safety.|$|R
