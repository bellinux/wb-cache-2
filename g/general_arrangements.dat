5|$|In case {{of war or}} {{national}} emergency, the Naval Staff was to become directly subordinate to the Supreme Command. The Naval Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and Naval Coastal Command. All other naval establishments would remain {{under the control of}} the Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these <b>general</b> <b>arrangements.</b> For example, the naval detachments on Lake Ohrid and Lake Scutari were subordinated to the local army districts, and the Naval Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command. In case of mobilisation, the navy would need to requisition about 250 sea-going and 25 river vessels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>general</b> <b>arrangements</b> of Yulius Fuchik {{were largely}} {{dictated}} by the cargo handling system. The superstructure, spanning across the weather deck, housed {{only part of the}} ship's accommodation space. The entire crew of 50 was housed in single cabins, most of them located within the narrow side compartments {{on both sides of the}} cargo decks. In addition to normal messes and saloons, the amenities of the ship also included sports and hobby rooms, library, sauna, photographic laboratory and even a swimming pool.|$|E

25|$|Harland and Wolff {{put their}} leading {{designers}} to work designing the Olympic-class vessels. It was overseen by Lord Pirrie, {{a director of}} both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews' deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager. Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment and all <b>general</b> <b>arrangements,</b> including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design.|$|E
25|$|Tarmo {{is almost}} {{identical}} to the older Sampo in terms of structural layout and <b>general</b> <b>arrangements,</b> but she was built {{with a number of}} minor modifications such as a smaller stem angle of 20 degrees. She is also slightly larger than the older icebreaker, having an overall length of , waterline length of , and moulded breadth of , both slightly greater than those of Sampo. When loaded to an average draft of , Tarmo has displacement of 2,400 tons, some 350 tons more than that of her predecessor. Both Tarmo and Sampo were served by a crew of 43.|$|E
25|$|It {{was most}} {{essential}} {{that some of}} the principal fortresses should be secured; and made to constitute a new basis whence to direct the operations now contemplated against the interior. The following, which first presented themselves on the respective lines of advance of the two Commanders, were destined to be immediately blockaded: Valenciennes, Le Quesnoy, and Cambrai, by the Anglo-allied army; and Maubeuge, Landrecy, Avesnes-sur-Helpe (Avesnes), and Rocroi, by the Prussians. The <b>general</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the besieging of the fortresses, and the planning of the further operations, formed the subject of the conference at Catillon held on 23 June 1815.|$|E

25|$|When SuomenJoutsen was {{converted}} to a school ship for the Finnish Navy, her <b>general</b> <b>arrangements</b> were changed considerably {{in order to accommodate}} up to 180 men on long international voyages. In addition to living quarters, bathrooms and toilets, this included building kitchens and six refrigerated rooms for provisions, workshops for a carpenter, shoemaker and tailor, laundry room, hospital with ten beds and a small isolation ward, classroom, library, canteen, and more storage space for sails, ropes, paint, sand and coal. Nine freshwater tanks with a total capacity of 206 tons were also built, but in order to conserve water a traditional Finnish sauna was not provided. Instead, hot steam could be diverted into the washing rooms under the forecastle.|$|E
25|$|Some {{modifications}} {{were made}} to cargo spaces and cargo handling equipment. The aftmost lower hold {{was turned into a}} refrigerated cargo space and a dividing bulkhead was removed from the foremost hold. The tweendeck hatch covers were changed from wire-operated to hydraulic and, due to the rearranging of the aft deck winches and to ease the handling of mooring lines, the aft hatch was made slightly smaller than in the original ships. The capacity of the deck crane in front of the superstructure was increased to 40 tons to allow better handling of ore containers. The stern quarter ramp was also changed to a folding type that would maintain constant pressure on the quay. There were also some changes to the <b>general</b> <b>arrangements</b> of the lowest accommodation deck.|$|E
2500|$|After {{purchasing}} the steamboats Armenia and Daniel Drew in 1863 and running {{them on the}} Hudson {{for a number of}} months, Alfred Van Santvoord decided to build a new steamboat to operate in conjunction with Daniel Drew. Accordingly, a steamboat [...] "with the same <b>general</b> <b>arrangements</b> and appearance" [...] as Daniel Drew was ordered from the Williamsburg, New York shipyard of Lawrence & Foulks. Completed in early 1864, the new steamer was named Chauncey Vibbard after the prominent railroad executive, who at the time was one of Van Santvoord's partners.|$|E

5000|$|Project: One of {{the most}} {{relevant}} developments of the new version is the <b>General</b> <b>Arrangement</b> module (FGA) for spaces and <b>general</b> ship <b>arrangement</b> definition, both in 2D or 3D environments, with all data stored in the FORAN database. The application allows generating the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> drawing in an efficient way. On the other hand, the module for the probabilistic damage stability calculations (FSUBD) offers now the possibility to consider intermediate stages of flooding, according to SOLAS standard. The automatic assignment of spaces to subzones has also been improved.|$|R

Beyond this was the principal entrance-hall or antechamber of the palace. It was gorgeous in marble pillars, stucco designs, horse-shoe arches, and other Mooresque decorations. Here a large party of officials and friends were moving about.
