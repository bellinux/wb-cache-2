In lower eukaryotes such as aspergillus and in bacteria the main role of amine oxidases is to provide a source of ammonium. PAOs in plants, bacteria and protozoa oxidise spermidine and spermine to an aminobutyral, <b>diaminopropane</b> and hydrogen peroxide and are involved in the catabolism of polyamines.

40|$|Hexahydropyrimidine {{and some}} N-alkylated {{derivatives}} {{have been obtained}} from {{the reaction of the}} corresponding trimethylenediamine or its monoprotonated salt with formaldehyde. A variety of spectroscopic evidence supports a cyclic structure for these compounds in preference to a tautomeric open-chain form. The chemical behaviour of hexahydropyrimidine is explicable in terms of a cyclic di-secondary amine structure. The cyclic structure is destabilized with respect to the open- chain form if the hydrogen atoms attached to C 2 of the hexahydropyrimidine ring are replaced by alkyl groups and cannot be detected when, in addition, one of the hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen is replaced by the bulkier t-butyl group. Hexahydro- 2 -methylpyrimidine is dehydrogenated to 1, 4, 5, 6 - tetrahydro- 2 -methylpyrimidine on shaking with Adams catalyst and hydrogen under laboratory conditions.

40|$|Repeated {{injections}} of 1, 3 -diaminopropane, a potent inhibitor of mammalian ornithine decarboxylase, induced protein-synthesis-dependent formation of macromolecular inhibitors or `antienzymes' [Heller, Fong & Canellakis (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 73, 1858 – 1862] to ornithine decarboxylase in normal rat liver. Addition of the macromolecular inhibitors, produced {{in response to}} repeated {{injections of}} <b>diaminopropane,</b> to active ornithine decarboxylase in vitro resulted in a profound loss of the enzyme activity, which, however, could be partly recovered after passage of the enzyme–inhibitor mixture through a Sephadex G- 75 columin {{in the presence of}} 0. 4 m-NaCl. This treatment also resulted in the appearance of free inhibitor. In contrast with the separation of the enzyme and inhibitory activity after combination in vitro, {{it was not possible to}} re-activate, by using identical conditions of molecular sieving, any inhibited ornithine decarboxylase from cytosol fractions obtained from animals injected with <b>diaminopropane.</b> However, the idea that injection of various diamines, also in vivo, induces acute formation of macromolecular inhibitors, which reversibly combine with the enzyme, was supported by the finding that the ornithine decarboxylase activity remaining after <b>diaminopropane</b> injection appeared to be more stable to increased ionic strength than the enzyme activity obtained from somatotropin-treated rats. Incubation of the inhibitory cytosol fractions with antiserum to ornithine decarboxylase did not completely abolish the inhibitory action of either the cytosolic inhibitor or the antibody. A single injection of <b>diaminopropane</b> produced an extremely rapid decay of liver ornithine decarboxylase activity (half-life about 12 min), which was comparable with, or swifter than, that induced by cycloheximide. However, although after cycloheximide treatment the amount of immunotitrable ornithine decarboxylase decreased only slightly more slowly than the enzyme activity, <b>diaminopropane</b> injection did not decrease the amount of the immunoreactive protein, but, on the contrary, invariably caused a marked increase in the apparent amount of antigen, after some lag period. The diamine-induced increase in the amount of the immunoreactive enzyme protein could be totally prevented by a simultaneous injection of cycloheximide. These results are in accord with the hypothesis that various diamines may result in rapid formation of macromolecular inhibitors to ornithine decarboxylase in vivo, which, after combination with the enzyme, abolish the catalytic activity but at the same time prevent the intracellular degradation of the enzyme protein...|$|E

40|$|The {{influences}} {{of the hydrogen}} sulfide partial pressure and of a basic nitrogen compound (<b>diaminopropane)</b> on the activity of a sulfided CoMo/carbon catalyst in hydrodeoxygenation were studied from 10 to 150 kPa H 2 S, under a total pressure of 7 MPa, at 270 and 200 degreesC in the transformation of a mixture of guaiacol, ethyldecanoate, and 4 -methylacetophenone in p-xylene, It is likely that three different active sites are responsible for hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and acid-catalysed reactions. An increase in hydrogen sulfide partial pressure decreases the average degree of reduction and uncoordination of the active sites and inhibits the hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation pathways, the first being affected to a larger extent. This accounts for the decrease of guaiacol dehydroxylation and the increase of 4 -methylacetophenone conversion. The reactions catalysed by acid sites located on the metal sulfide, namely decarboxylation and alcohol dehydration, are promoted by hydrogen sulfide.

No definitive correlation between the zeta potential values and the transfection efficiencies could be established, but the uptake of lipoplexes by the cells was correlated with their final transfection efficiencies. Our results show that imidazolium phosphoramidate lipids constitute a potential new class of cationic lipids for gene transfer...|$|E
40|$|Putrescine and cadaverine are {{essential}} constituents of the peptidoglycan of Veillonella alcalescens, Veillonella parvula, and Selenomonas ruminantium and {{are necessary for}} the growth of these organisms (Y. Kamio and K. Nakamura, J. Bacteriol. 169 : 2881 - 2884, 1987, and Y. Kamio, H. Pösö, Y. Terawaki, and L. Paulin, J. Biol. Chem. 261 : 6585 - 6589, 1986). In this study, the structural specificity of the diamine requirement for normal cell growth of these bacteria was examined by using a series of diamines with a general structure of NH 3 + X (CH 2) n X NH 3 +. Diaminohexane (n = 6) which was incorporated into the peptidoglycan was as effective as putrescine (n = 4) and cadaverine (n = 5) for normal cell growth. However, <b>diaminopropane</b> (n = 3) and diaminoheptane (n = 7) were less effective for growth than diaminohexane, although they were incorporated into the peptidoglycan to the same extent...|$|E
40|$|The enzyme putrescine hydroxycinnamoyl {{transferase}} (PHT) was purified 400 -fold in 7. 1 % yield from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Xanthi) cell suspensions {{to a final}} {{specific activity}} of 45 nanokatal per milligram protein. The purification procedure involved conventional chromatography techniques (anion exchange chromatography, gel permeation, and hydroxylapatite chromatography) followed by chromatography on caffeoyl-cysteamine-Sepharose. This procedure led to considerable enrichment of a 50 kilodalton protein that could be further purified to near homogeneity by chromatofocalization (apparent isoelectric point = 8). PHT activity was repeatedly found associated with this protein, although approximately 66 % of the enzymic activity was lost during chromatofocalization. Purified PHT exhibited the same properties as in the unpurified extract. It was not specific for putrescine and used other aliphatic diamines (mainly <b>diaminopropane</b> and cadaverine) as substrates. The most efficient phenolic substrate was caffeoyl-CoA, but cinnamoyl-, feruloyl-, sinapoyl-, and p-coumaroyl-CoA were also conjugated to putrescine, in decreasing order of activity. PHT could also use the artificial substrate p-fluorocinnamoyl-CoA...|$|E
40|$|Rootstock-scion {{interaction}} in nutrient transport and in polyamine synthesis {{was investigated in}} loess soil with low K availability in Tokaj region. Vitis vinifera L. cv. Furmint and Hárslevelű (Linden leaf) grafted on different rootstocks (Riparia portalis, Gogliordo, BxR T 8 B, Teleki-Fuhr S. O. 4, Teleki 5 C, Teleki-Kober 5 BB, ChxB 41 B and Fercal) were studied. Furmint showed more serious K deficiency indicated by leaf blade K contents (< 0. 5 w/w % DW at ripening) than Hárslevelű. K deficiency not only resulted in higher Mg uptake, but also in increased putrescine (Put) concentration in the leaves and berries which was strongly affected by the rootstock variety. The close negative correlation between leaf K and Put concentration and clear varietal differences can be identified in physiological K demand. Concentration of Put in ripe berries were lower with order of magnitude (< 15 nmol Put/g FW). Polyamine levels in wines were similar to that’s in berries. Cadaverine and <b>diaminopropane</b> appeared peculiarly in „aszu ” wines...|$|E
40|$|A {{potentially}} hexadentate N 2 O 4 donor Schiff base ligand N,N¤-bis(5 -bromo- 3 -methoxysalicylideneimino) - 1, 3 - <b>diaminopropane</b> (H 2 L 1) {{has been}} used to synthesize two mononuclear coordination complexes [Cu(L 1) ]¢H 2 O (1) and [Co(L 1) (HL 2) ]ClO 4 ¢CH 3 CN (2). The cobalt complex is a unique mixed-ligand species comprising both the di- and monocondensed ligands; the latter (HL 2) resulted from in situ hydrolytic cleavage of H 2 L 1. Ligand L 1 assumes a planar arrangement in 1 and a folded β-cis configuration in 2, induced in this case by the chelating HL 2 ligand. The complexes are characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, and UV-vis spectral methods, and their structures are established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. Both the complexes are proven to be efficient catalysts for the epoxidation of alkenes by H 2 O 2 or PhIO. The efficiency of alkene epoxidation is however somewhat superior with PhIO, and in each case, 2 appears to be a slightly better catalyst than 1...|$|E
40|$|Hyaluronan-based hydrogels were {{synthesised}} {{using different}} crosslinking agents, such as 1, 3 <b>diaminopropane</b> (1, 3 -DAP) and 1, 6 -diaminohexane (1, 6 -DAE). The hydrogels were sulfated to provide materials (Hyal- 1, 3 -DAP, Hyal- 1, 6 -DAE, HyalS- 1, 3 -DAP and HyalS- 1, 6 -DAE) that were characterised by both high- and low-resolution {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectroscopy. The 13 C NMR spectra of the materials were analysed to identify, characterise and study the crosslinking degree of the hydrogels. The crosslinking degree was also determined by potentiometric titration {{and the effectiveness of}} the two techniques was compared. Measurements of longitudinal relaxation times (spin–lattice) and of NOE enhancement were used to study the mobility of the hydrogels. Low-resolution NMR studies allowed the determination of the water transport properties in the hydrogels. In addition, the swelling degree for the various hydrogels was calculated {{as a function of the}} longitudinal and transversal relaxation times of the water molecules. Lastly, the self-diffusion coefficients of the water in interaction with the four polysaccharides were measured by the pulsed field gradient spin echo (PFGSE) sequence...|$|E
