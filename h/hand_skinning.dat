This experimental longitudinal study examined the effects of an intervention (applying barrier cream before donning gloves) to reduce <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> problems in glove-wearing HCPS. The hypotheses of this study were: (1) HCPs who wear barrier cream under their gloves will experience a decrease in <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> problems and (2) HCPs who wear barrier cream under their gloves will report an improvement in perceived skin condition. Using self-report questionnaires, data were collected on demographic information, glove usage, and hand condition. Information on incidence and severity of <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> problems, perceived <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> condition, gloving practices, and hand care routines, including use of the barrier cream in the intervention group, was requested every three weeks after enrollment, until the subject had been in the study for a total of twelve weeks.

40|$|Many studies {{related to}} {{three-dimensional}} facial reconstruction have been previously reported. On the other hand, no extensive {{work has been}} found in the literature about hand reconstruction as an identification method. In this paper, the feasibility of virtual reconstruction of <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> based on (1) its skeleton and (2) another <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> and skeleton used as template was assessed. One cadaver hand and one volunteer's hand have been used. For the two hands, computer models of the bones and skin were obtained from computerized tomography. A customized software allowed locating spatial coordinates of bony anatomical landmarks on the models. From these landmarks, the spatial relationships between the models were determined and used to interpolate the missing <b>hand</b> <b>skin.</b> The volume of the interpolated skin was compared to the real skin obtained from medical imaging for validation. Results seem to indicate that such a method is of interest to give forensic investigators morphological clues related to an individual <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> based on its skeleton.

40|$|Abstract Since ancient times, warm or cold skin on {{the human}} body {{has been used as}} a {{parameter}} in evaluating health. Changes in body temperature are attributed to diseases or disorders. The assessment of body temperature is often performed to measure fever by detecting an elevated core temperature. With techniques such as infrared thermography, it is possible to perform a non-contact temperature measurement on a large surface area. The overall aim of this thesis was to contribute to a better understanding of the <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> temperature variability in healthy persons and in persons experiencing whitening fingers (WF). The enclosed four papers discuss issues such as thermal variability response to cold stress test (CST) in repeated investigations; the specific rewarming pattern after CST; the difference between the hand’s palmar and dorsal temperatures; and evaluating skin temperatures and response to CST in participants with WF and healthy participants. All four papers used an experimental approach involving healthy males (I-III) and females (III) as well as individuals with (IV) and without WF (I-IV). Data were generated using dynamic infrared imaging before and after a CST. The radiometric images were analyzed using image analysis and statistics. The study showed that: (I) there is variability in <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> temperature; (II) there are cold and warm <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> temperature response patterns; (III) the skin temperatures on the palmar and dorsal sides of the hand are closely related; and (IV) a baseline <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> temperature measurement can distinguish between whitening fingers and controls. The conclusion of this thesis is that it is necessary to engage in thorough planning before an investigation in order to choose the most adequate method for evaluating peripheral skin temperature response depending on the question asked...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Manicurists {{are exposed}} to various {{chemicals}} in nail and skin care products and may develop ocular, nasal, respiratory or skin adverse reactions to them. To investigate the occurrence of ocular, nasal, respiratory and skin problems among manicurists and to identify their causal factors, particularly allergic etiology and occupational origin. Material and Methods: Manicurists employed in beauty salons in the central region of Poland were invited {{to fill in the}} questionnaire and undergo medical examination, skin prick tests with common aeroallergens, patch tests with European Baseline Series and (Meth) Acrylates Series-Nails and spirometry. Results: In the questionnaire adverse nasal symptoms were reported by 70 %, ocular – by 58 %, respiratory – by 42 %, hand eczema – by 43 % of manicurists. In the medical interview, the frequency of those complaints was lower: nasal ones – 41 %, ocular – 24 %, cough – 18 %, <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> dryness – 20 %, hand eczema – 6 %. Cough and <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> dryness occurred significantly more frequently than in the case of controls. Contact allergy was found for 41 % of manicurists and 35 % of controls. The prevalence of nickel sensitization was high in both groups (38 % and 27 %, respectively). Only 3 manicurists reacted to (meth) acrylates. The frequency of atopic diseases was similar in compared groups. Irritant nasal and respiratory reactions were significantly more prevalent among manicurists (nasal – 18 % vs. 2 %, p < 0. 01; respiratory – 18 % vs. 1 %, p < 0. 001). Work-related nasal irritant reactions were finally diagnosed for 19 %, ocular ones – for 13 %, respiratory – for 18 % and within <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> – for 23 % of manicurists. Conclusions: The frequency of workattributed irritant mucosal and skin symptoms among manicurists is high. Exposure to acrylates is an important source of mucosal irritant reactions while occlusive gloves cause irritation of <b>hand</b> <b>skin.</b> The prevalence of nickel allergy among Polish females is high.

40|$|Objectives. Glove wearing during patient {{treatment}} has {{been central to}} dental surgery infection control for over 15 years. However, {{little is known about}} the cutaneous effects of glove wearing on the hands of dental healthcare workers (DHCWs). The objective of this project was to assess the <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> health of DHCWs before and after wearing gloves of two types and to compare this with a control group of non-DHCWs. Methods. Following a mailing to all dentists in the West of Scotland, 50 DHCWs who wore gloves during dental treatment procedures for a minimum of 8 h daily for at least 4 days per week were invited to participate in the project. The control group comprised 25 subjects who did not routinely use surgical or examination gloves. Hands were assessed by clinical examination and by transepidermal water loss at baseline, 1 month and 3 months. Results. Of the 50 DHCWs, 26 wore a non-powdered latex glove (Microtouch Powder-free: Johnson and Johnson, Arligton, TX, US), and 24 wore a nitrile glove (Hartalega SDN BHD, Malaysia) from the time of the baseline examination until the 3 -month examination. No differences were observed in <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> health between the control group and the DHCWs at baseline, nor between those wearing the latex or nitrile gloves during the 3 month period of the study.

Their ages and anthropometric characteristics including body mass index (BMI), hand length, hand width, hand depth, hand palm, and wrist circumference were measured. The hand was exposed to different bath temperatures (5 °C, 25 °C, and 45 °C) and hand grip strength was measured using a Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer with and without wearing the gloves (chemical protection glove, rubber insulating glove, anti-vibration impact glove, cotton yarn knitted glove, and RY-WG 002 working glove). The data were analyzed using the Shapiro–Wilk test, Pearson correlation coefficient, Tukey test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the within-subject design analysis. The results showed that wearing gloves significantly affected the maximum grip strength. Wearing the RY-WG 002 working glove produced a greater reduction on the maximum grip when compared with the bare hand, while low temperatures (5 °C) had a significant influence on grip when compared to medium (25 °C) and high (45 °C) <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> temperatures.

After strain identification, the Oxacillin resistance was measured by Etest. 23 strains were identified as S. aureus, four as S. hyicus, 15 as S. xylosus and 31 as other coagulase negative staphylococci. Because of their minimum inhibition concentration (mic) between 0. 5 and 1 mg/mL four S. aureus isolates were assigned to borderline Oxacillin resistant S. aureus. Nine coagulase negative isolates had this property too. In total 19 staphylococci isolates had a mic > 1 mg/L and were classified as Oxacillin resistant according to DIN 58940 - 4 Bbl 1 : 2004 - 02.

40|$|During mild cold exposure, {{elderly are}} at risk of hypothermia. In humans, glabrous <b>skin</b> at the <b>hands</b> is well adapted as a heat exchanger. Evidence exists that elderly show equal {{vasoconstriction}} due to local cooling at the ventral forearm, yet no age effects on vasoconstriction at <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> have been studied. Here, we tested the hypotheses that at hand sites (a) elderly show equal vasoconstriction due to local cooling and (b) elderly show reduced response to noradrenergic stimuli. Skin perfusion and mean arterial pressure were measured in 16 young adults (Y: 18 – 28  years) and 16 elderly (E: 68 – 78  years). To study the effect of local vasoconstriction mechanisms local sympathetic nerve terminals were blocked by bretylium (BR). Baseline local skin temperature was clamped at 33 °C. Next, local temperature was reduced to 24 °C. After 15  min of local cooling, noradrenalin (NA) was administered to study the effect of neural vasoconstriction mechanisms. No significant age effect was observed in vasoconstriction due to local cooling at BR sites. After NA, vasoconstriction at the forearm showed a significant age effect; however, no significant age effect was found at the hand sites. [Change in CVC (% from baseline) : Forearm Y: − 76  ±  3 vs. E: − 60  ±  5 (P <  0. 01), dorsal hand Y: − 74  ±  4 vs. E: − 72  ±  4 (n. s.), ventral hand Y: − 80  ±  7 vs. E: − 70  ±  11 (n. s.) ].

40|$|Advancements in {{computer}} vision facilitate new interactions between {{parts of the}} human body with technological devices. This research builds upon past technologies by introducing new digital image processing concepts and algorithms that improve hand based human-computer synergies. At present, hand gesture recognition systems are limited by the environmental conditions in which the signalled gesture is captured and the number of gestures that it can understand. Hand gestures are further characterised by the position and orientation of the fingers, however the lack of image features to recognise and track fingers makes it a challenging problem to solve. In order to extract more precise hand boundaries, two image quality enhancement techniques that rely on the manipulation of its intensity channel values were adapted into a skin-pixel detector. Experiments were then conducted to study the effects of image quality enhancement techniques on skin pixel detection in a newly collected <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> dataset. The new dataset gives focus to a range of human <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> types under different illumination conditions and varies from traditional skin datasets that consist of face images and mainly focus on background distractions. From this, an improved Mixture of Gaussian based <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> detector is trained. Next, a method based on intuitive finger counting was introduced to simplify the hand gesture classification process. To achieve this, a new Fourier-based boundary decomposition method was introduced to divide hand boundaries into smaller sub-segments. Features were designed to evaluate the resemblance of each boundary segment to fingers and the wrist. Once recognised, finger tip and web points were identified by applying geometric manipulation. The effectiveness of the proposed system were validated against state-of-the-art algorithms on natural scene images, skin pixel extraction datasets and an American Sign Language datasets. On a proof of concept example, where shapes drawn using tracked fingers are used as supplementary inputs to content-based image retrieval system, the proposed content-based image retrieval by hand gesture system was shown to possess potential to further enhance image retrieval performance...|$|R

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{is known}} to be {{synthesized}} by mammalian cells from L-arginine by a group of NO synthase enzymes. We now show that NO is generated from human skin and propose a different mechanism of production. Whereas enzymatic NO synthesis is inhibited by monomethyl L-arginine, this arginine analog, when infused into the brachial artery at concentrations sufficient to inhibit endothelial NO synthase activity, has little effect on <b>hand</b> <b>skin</b> NO production. <b>Hand</b> <b>skin</b> NO production is increased by topical acidification of the skin surface and greatly increased by the addition of nitrite solutions. We propose that NO generation from skin derives from sweat nitrite (the concentration of which was found to average 3. 4 μM in six subjects) due to chemical reduction consequent to the acidic nature of sweat. Sweat contains nitrate in appreciable amounts, and skin commensal bacteria can synthesize nitrate reductase enzyme. Patients on long-term tetracycline antibiotics showed significantly reduced skin NO synthesis, although topical antiseptic and antibiotics had little effect on NO generation in the short-term. We propose that NO generation from skin is dependent on bacterial nitrate reduction to nitrite and subsequent reduction by acidification. We speculate that this has a physiologic role in the inhibition of infection by pathogenic fungi and other susceptible microorganisms and may affect cutaneous T-cell function, keratinocyte differentiation, and skin blood flow...|$|R
