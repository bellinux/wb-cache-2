40|$|For {{scavenging}} {{species that}} evolved {{to search for}} ephemeral and unpredictable resources, supplementary feeding may act as an ecological trap. Increasing food predictability {{may lead to the}} emergence of foraging routines liable to make individuals too dependent on human-mediated feeding. Using recent methodologies (Fourier, Wavelet and conditional entropy-based analyses), we investigated the degree of routine movement behaviour in a population of Eurasian Griffon vultures (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus)</b> that mostly feed on livestock carrion provided at Supplementary Feeding Stations (SFS).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} {{performed}} in Yazılı Kanyon (Isparta Province) between October 2007 and July 2008 was to define the number of individual sand mobility of Griffon Vulture (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus).</b> We observed 12 individuals in the area during pre-breeding and courtship periods. The number of individuals changed daily and seasonally depending on climatic, geographic and anthropological factors. Only one pair showed breeding activity. The nesting and roosting areas include limestone mountains (800 m) with granite. Feeding activities were observed more often in the breeding season than other times because parents had to find food materials for their chick.

50|$|Rüppell's vulture or Rüppell's {{griffon vulture}} (Gyps rueppelli) {{is a large}} vulture that occurs {{throughout}} the Sahel region of central Africa. The current population of 30,000 is decreasing due to loss of habitat, incidental poisoning, and other factors. Known also as Rüppell's griffon, Rueppell's griffon, Rüppell's griffin vulture, Rueppell's vulture and other variants, {{it is not to}} be confused with a different species, the griffon vulture (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus).</b> Rüppell's vulture is named in honor of Eduard Rüppell, a 19th-century German explorer, collector, and zoologist. Rüppell's vulture is considered to be the highest-flying bird, with confirmed evidence of a flight at an altitude of 11300 m above sea level.|$|R
50|$|The very {{attractive}} and unreachable Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius) lives at high altitudes. Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) breeds in this area. Griffon vultures (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus)</b> are common. Chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar) {{has a high}} population and nests between stone and shrubs. Red-fronted serin (Serinus pusillus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), snow finch (Montifringilla nivalis), rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), rock bunting (Emberiza cia) and horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) are native; in winter {{they come to the}} lower hill sides. In each spring wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), rock thrush (Monticola saxatilis), and nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) come from Africa for breeding. Grey-necked bunting (Emberiza buchanani), black-headed bunting (Emberiza melanocephala) and common rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus) come from India.|$|R
40|$|The Griffon Vulture (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus)</b> is {{considered}} to be socially monogamous. However, extra-pair fertilizations are suspected due to observations of extra-pair copulations in some populations. We performed parentage studies based on ten polymorphic microsatellite markers in two reintroduced colonies of Griffon Vulture. Out of 40 genotyped chicks, we found eight chicks whose genotypes mismatched those of their observed parents. Two could be explained by the occurrence of a null allele at one locus. The six remaining mismatches detected relied on mismatches at one locus, and they were not detected when we increased the potential genotyping error rate. We thus conclude that the Griffon Vulture is genetically monogamous, at least in low-density populations. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} heavy metals concentrations in feathers of a griffon vulture population (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus,</b> Linnaeus 1758) present in the central Italy. Body feathers of 27 live griffon vultures were examined for lead, chromium and cadmium by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) while for mercury by thermal decomposition amalgamation and atomic absorption spectrophotometry (TDA-AAS). The heavy metals concentrations did not differ significantly between juveniles and adults neither between males and females. The analysed samples showed a lower Hg concentration than those found elsewhere for this species. Furthermore, for Cr, Cd and Hg levels were not significant correlations between tarsus length and body weight. Contrary Pb was negatively correlated with tarsus length, showing the absence of recent exposure of the birds...|$|R
50|$|Gyps {{species were}} the most {{affected}} by diclofenac. The population of the White-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis) fell 99.7% between 1993 and 2002. The populations of the Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and the slender-billed vulture (Gyps tenuirostris) fell 97.4%. The percentages differ slightly because the white-rumped vulture is more sensitive to diclofenac {{than the other two}} species, but all three were in danger of extinction. Two other species of Gyps, the Himalayan vulture (Gyps himalayensis) and the Eurasian griffon (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus)</b> were less affected, the Eurasian griffon because it only winters in India and has a much smaller initial population and the Himalayan vulture, with a similarly small population, because it is exclusively mountain-dwelling. Vulture populations have continued to decline in India at a rate of between 20% and 40% each year since 2007.|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasmas are commensals and {{pathogens}} {{of various}} avian species, {{and are also}} regularly found in birds of prey, although their significance to birds&#x 2019; health remains unclear. Here we describe two novel Mycoplasma isolated from the upper respiratory tract of four Eurasian griffon vultures (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus)</b> housed in a wildlife recovery centre in Sardinia (Italy). By sequencing the 16 S rRNA gene and the entire 16 S/ 23 S intergenic spacer region, the new strains were classified within the Mycoplasma taxonomy at the group and cluster levels, showing that the two isolates fall into the Mycoplasma synoviae and Mycoplasma hominis clusters of the hominis group, respectively. We combined molecular tools and immunoblotting methods {{in order to further}} characterize these isolates, and antigenic analyses overall confirmed the molecular findings. Different levels of pathogenicity and prevalence of these strains might have different implications for the conservation and reintroduction of vultures...|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity {{losses are}} {{increasing}} {{as a consequence}} of negative anthropogenic effects on ecosystem dynamics. However, the magnitude and complexity of these effects may still be greatly underestimated. Most Old World vultures have experienced rapid population declines in recent years. In Europe, their immediate conservation depends on changes in health regulations affecting the availability of food provided by domestic carcasses. Information is lacking on the effects of a hypothetical food shortage on the population dynamics of vultures, and is necessary to assess the potential impacts of policy decisions on future changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Anovel computational model (P-systems) was used to model these effects, forecasting a rapid decline in the Eurasian griffon vulture (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus).</b> By contrast, vulture species with greater plasticity in their dietary range appeared less sensitive to declining food availability. This study extends our understanding of vulture ecosystem services, which have social and economic implications...|$|R
2500|$|Birds: The {{reserve is}} home to 200 species of birds, of which 19 are {{considered}} rare at the national level. More than 22 species have been confirmed to be resident, the rest are migratory or rare visitors, {{and at least two}} or three species have been introduced. The reserve holds a combination of birds found in Europe, Africa, and Asia which include: chukar (Alectoris chukar), Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), blackbird (Turdus merula), common raven (Corvus corax), common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), shore lark (Eremophila alpestris), common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), common chaffinch, (Fringilla coelebs), turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur), rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis). [...] Two species at least have been introduced to the shouf area for hunting and expanded their range into the reserve, the two species are: rock partridge (Alectoris graeca), and common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). The reserve is also home to many species of birds of prey such as: griffon vulture (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus),</b> and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos).|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{negative}} {{factors that}} affect Griffon vulture (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus)</b> were investigated between August 2010 -August 2012 in Antalya and Isparta Province. Chemical substance use in Köprülü Kanyon National Park (Antalya) and marbel quarries constructed at nesting and roosting areas in Sütçüler (Isparta) have {{detrimental effects on the}} species. It was observed that as the marble quarries around nesting and roosting areas in Yazılı Kanyon National Park grow in number, Griffon vultures leave the area trying to go further away. Nests with limefree brown forest soil structures were observed to be closer to hydroelectric power plants in both fields and the differences between soil and rock stuctures were statistically important (p < 0. 01). It was determined that the nests on limestone areas which are far away from hydroelectric power plants have high success rate and the success rate of nests on lime-free brown forest soils which are closer is lo...|$|R
40|$|Three endemic vulture species Gyps bengalensis, Gyps indicus and Gyps tenuirostris are {{critically}} endangered following dramatic {{declines in}} South Asia resulting {{from exposure to}} diclofenac, a veterinary drug present in the livestock carcasses that they scavenge. Diclofenac is widely used globally and could present a risk to Gyps species from other regions. In this study, we test the toxicity of diclofenac to a Eurasian (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus)</b> and an African (Gyps africanus) species, neither of which is threatened. A dose of 0. 8  mg kg− 1 of diclofenac was highly toxic to both species, indicating that they {{are at least as}} sensitive to diclofenac as G. bengalensis, for which we estimate an LD 50 of 0. 1 – 0. 2  mg kg− 1. We suggest that diclofenac is likely to be toxic to all eight Gyps species, and that G. africanus, which is phylogenetically close to G. bengalensis, would be a suitable surrogate for the safety testing of alternative drugs to diclofenac...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} a collection of Escherichia coli strains isolated from asymptomatic griffon vulture (<b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus)</b> during a reintroduction program in the southeast of Spain, in order to establish if griffon vulture could play a role in the spread of resistant or potentially pathogenic E. coli strains. For this purpose, 14 E. coli strains obtained from 10 griffon vulture were studied to establish their serotypes, phylogroups, virulence-gene profiles and anti-microbial resistances. High heterogeneity was observed within the 14 strains isolated which belonged to three phylogroups (A, B 1 and D), 8 serogroups (O 2, O 21, O 29, O 60, 073, O 78, O 103 and O 141) and 13 different serotypes. Out of 34 genes screened, we have detected eight virulence genes that are typical of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) (fimH, fimAvMT 78, iroN, iucD, cvaC, iss, traT and tsh); however, none of the studied strains showed the ExPEC status.

40|$|The karyotypes of most birds {{consist of}} {{a small number of}} macrochromosomes and {{numerous}} microchromosomes. Intriguingly, most accipitrids which include hawks, eagles, kites, and Old World vultures (Falconiformes) show a sharp contrast to this basic avian karyotype. They exhibit strikingly few microchromosomes and appear to have been drastically restructured during evolution. Chromosome paints specific to the chicken (GGA) macrochromosomes 1 - 10 were hybridized to metaphase spreads of three species of Old World vultures (<b>Gyps</b> rueppelli, <b>Gyps</b> <b>fulvus,</b> Gypaetus barbatus). Paints of GGA chromosomes 6 - 10 hybridize only to single chromosomes or large chromosome segments, illustrating the existence of high chromosome homology. In contrast, paints of the large macrochromosomes 1 - 5 show split hybridization signals on the chromosomes of the accipitrids, disclosing excessive chromosome rearrangements which is in clear contrast to the high degree of chromosome conservation substantiated from comparative chromosome painting in other birds. Furthermore, the GGA chromosome paint hybridization patterns reveal remarkable interchromosomal conservation among the two species of the genus Gyps...|$|R
