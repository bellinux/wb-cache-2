5|$|Aetosaurs were herbivores, likely {{feeding on}} ferns and seed ferns that were {{common in the}} Triassic. The upturned shape of their snout {{suggests}} that aetosaurs may have dug up roots and tubers. Aetosaurs have several anatomical features {{that may have been}} adaptations to <b>digging,</b> including a short radius relative to the humerus (seen in many other <b>digging</b> tetrapods) and a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus that served as an attachment for muscles. Aetosaurs also have large hind feet, or pes, with large claws that were likely used for skratch-digging. One aetosaur, Typothorax, has an entepicondyle on the humerus, which is the origin of forearm pronator and manual flexor muscles often used in <b>digging.</b> Moreover, it has a large olecranon process on the ulna which projects backward past the elbow, giving a large area for the insertion of the triceps muscle. While many studies have suggested that aetosaurs had a fossorial or burrowing lifestyle, aetosaurs have few of the characteristics that fossorial animals have as adaptations to <b>digging.</b> Therefore, it is likely that aetosaurs were able to dig to some extent, possibly rooting for food, but were unable to burrow.|$|E

5|$|Swanberg {{found the}} process of editing <b>Digging</b> for Fire more {{difficult}} than for his previous films, since there were many different possibilities of how to integrate the separate storylines involving Tim and Lee. He dedicated the film to Paul Mazursky, who died in 2014, because of the influence Mazursky had on Swanberg's work {{and because of the}} thematic similarities between Mazursky's work (particularly the 1969 film Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice) and <b>Digging</b> for Fire.|$|E

5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and <b>digging</b> his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys <b>digging</b> Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E
5|$|Both parents remain {{involved}} in guarding the fry from brood predators {{and engage in}} behaviors to assist feeding such as moving leaves or fin <b>digging</b> (<b>digging</b> up the substrate with their fins). Brood care of eggs, larvae and free-swimming juveniles in the wild can last 4 to 6 weeks, and occurs only once per season {{for the majority of}} females. In contrast, females in aquaria are known to breed many times per year with short intervals of 12 or 13 days between broods, as long as suitable rocks or similar surfaces are available for them to lay their eggs on.|$|E

5|$|<b>Digging</b> deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while <b>digging</b> into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass {{down through the}} entire magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|E

5|$|<b>Digging</b> {{the tunnel}} {{turned out to}} be more {{difficult}} than expected. The soil was rocky, which forced the men to dig deeper than planned. There, they discovered a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the <b>digging,</b> one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified to discover that the entrance was blocked by a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.|$|E

5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short arms for defense against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms were too short to reach its mouth.

5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales.
