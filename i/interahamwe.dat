5|$|Following Habyarimana's death, a {{military}} committee led by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora took immediate {{control of the}} country. Under the committee's direction, the Hutu militia <b>Interahamwe</b> and the Presidential Guard began to kill Hutu and Tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent Tutsi figures; within 24 hours they had killed all moderate leaders, including Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. The killers then began targeting the entire Tutsi population, as well as moderate Hutu, beginning the Rwandan Genocide. Over the course of approximately 100 days, over 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks.|$|E
5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan Genocide. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the <b>Interahamwe</b> paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.|$|E
25|$|The crisis committee, {{headed by}} Théoneste Bagosora, took {{power in the}} country {{following}} Habyarimana's death, and was the principal authority coordinating the genocide. Bagosora immediately began issuing orders to kill Tutsi, addressing groups of <b>interahamwe</b> in person in Kigali, and making telephone calls to leaders in the provinces. Other leading organisers {{on a national level}} were defence minister Augustin Bizimana; commander of the paratroopers Aloys Ntabakuze; {{and the head of the}} Presidential Guard, Protais Mpiranya. Businessman Felicien Kabuga funded the RTLM and the <b>Interahamwe,</b> while Pascal Musabe and Joseph Nzirorera were responsible for coordinating the <b>Interahamwe</b> and Impuzamugambi militia activities nationally.|$|E
50|$|Although born in Rutshuru, Democratic Republic of Congo (then Belgian Congo), Bemeriki's {{hometown}} is Giciye commune, Gisenyi préfecture, in Rwanda. Prior {{to working}} at RTLM, Bemeriki {{worked for the}} ruling MRND party as a propagandist, also writing for the <b>Interahamwe's</b> (MRND's youth wing) publication.|$|R
2500|$|The crisis {{committee}} appointed {{an interim}} government on 8 April; using {{the terms of the}} 1991 constitution instead of the Arusha Accords, the committee designated Theodore Sindikubwabo as interim president of Rwanda, while Jean Kambanda was the new prime minister. All political parties were represented in the government, but most members were from the [...] "Hutu Power" [...] wings of their respective parties. The interim government was sworn in on 9 April, but immediately relocated from Kigali to Gitarama to avoid fighting between the RPF and the Rwandan army in the capital. The crisis committee was officially dissolved, but Bagosora and the senior officers remained the de facto rulers of the country. The government played its part in mobilising the population, giving the regime an air of legitimacy, but was effectively a puppet regime with no ability to halt the army or the <b>Interahamwe's</b> activities. When Romeo Dallaire visited the government's headquarters a week after its formation, he found most officials at leisure, describing their activities as [...] "sorting out the seating plan for a meeting that was not about to convene any time soon." ...|$|R
25|$|During the Rwandan genocide, Islam as a {{faith was}} not the main target of the genocide. There {{were only a few}} {{incidents}} in which Tutsis in mosques were attacked. The most widely known example occurred at Nyamirambo Main Mosque, where hundreds of Tutsi had gathered to take refuge. The refugees in the mosque fought off Hutu militias with stones, bows and arrows, putting up stiff resistance against the soldiers and militiamen of the <b>Interahamwe.</b> Only once the soldiers attacked with machine gun fire were the <b>Interahamwe</b> able to enter the mosque and kill the refugees.|$|E
25|$|The {{appeal was}} too late. The {{government}} {{troops and the}} <b>Interahamwe</b> Hutu paramilitaries perpetuated mass killings before fleeing from the RPF, which took control of Kabgayi on 2 June 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{genocide}} {{was planned}} {{by members of}} the core political elite, many of whom occupied positions at top levels of the national government. Perpetrators came from the ranks of the Rwandan army, the Gendarmerie, government-backed militias including the <b>Interahamwe</b> and Impuzamugambi.|$|E
25|$|In this war, militarized Tutsi {{elements}} in the South Kivu area of Zaire, known as Banyamulenge to disguise their original Rwandan Tutsi heritage, allied with the Tutsi RDF forces against the Hutu refugees in the North Kivu area, which included the <b>Interahamwe</b> militias.|$|E
25|$|On 10 January, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, {{meeting in}} Libreville (Gabon), decided {{in favour of}} {{assistance}} to Kinshasa for the disarmament of the old genocide forces (<b>Interahamwe</b> militia and ex-FAR (Rwandan Armed Forces of the former regime), moved to the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1994.|$|E
25|$|The mass rapes {{were carried}} out by the <b>Interahamwe</b> militia and members of the Hutu {{civilian}} population, both male and females, the Rwandan military, and the Rwandan Presidential Guard. The sexual violence was directed at the national and local levels by political and military leaders in the furtherance of their goal, the destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group.|$|E
25|$|RTLM was {{established}} in 1993, primarily railing against on-going peace talks between President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose family supported the radio station, and the Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front. It became a popular station since it offered frequent contemporary musical selections, unlike state radio, and quickly developed a faithful audience among youth-aged Rwandans, who later made {{up the bulk of}} the <b>Interahamwe</b> militia.|$|E
25|$|The Gikondo {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} murder of about 110 people of Tutsi identity, including children, who sheltered in a Polish Pallottine mission church in , Kigali. The massacre {{took place on}} April 9, 1994 and was executed by <b>Interahamwe</b> militia under supervision of the Hutu presidential guard. The massacre was the first absolute proof of a genocide discovered by UNAMIR during the Rwandan Genocide in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Another tragedy {{took place}} {{a few days}} later in a private Pallotine chapel {{neighboring}} the church. About eleven Tutsi Rwandans including children who managed to survive the first attack on the church took refuge in the chapel, where Polish Pallotine Father Zdzisław gave them supplies necessary to survive. When <b>Interahamwe</b> members discovered that there were still refugees in the chapel, they burned it after dousing it in gasoline. No one survived.|$|E
25|$|Shortly, about 100 <b>Interahamwe</b> militiamen {{came into}} the church and began to kill people, {{striking}} with their clubs and slashing with their machetes, hacking arms, legs, genitals and {{the faces of the}} terrified people who tried to protect the children under the pews. Some people were dragged outside the church and attacked in the courtyard. The identity cards of the murdered ones were burned. The killing continued for two hours after which the whole compound was searched. The militia then left the church compound.|$|E
25|$|The Rwandan Genocide {{began on}} April 6, 1994, after the plane {{carrying}} Rwandan president Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, {{the president of}} Burundi on board was shot down while approaching the runway of Kigali International Airport, which is widely considered {{to have been the}} direct signal to start the actions planned beforehand. Both men were Hutus. <b>Interahamwe</b> and Impuzamugambi militia began systematic, house-by-house searches for persons bearing Tutsi identity, who were then subsequently murdered using clubs and machetes. People living in the Gikondo neighborhood had fled to the Pallottine church in the hopes of finding shelter and to sit out the turmoil.|$|E
25|$|On 30 July 2002, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo {{signed a}} peace deal known as the Pretoria Accord after five days of talks in Pretoria, South Africa. The talks {{centered}} on two issues. One was {{the withdrawal of the}} estimated 20,000 Rwandan soldiers in the Congo. The other was the rounding up of the ex-Rwandan soldiers and the dismantling of the Hutu militia known as <b>Interahamwe,</b> which took part in Rwanda's 1994 genocide and continues to operate out of eastern Congo. Rwanda had previously refused to withdraw until the Hutu militias were dealt with.|$|E
25|$|By then, France had {{established}} a field hospital at the area of Lake Kivu {{in an attempt to}} help the large numbers of refugees. Some of these refugees were <b>Interahamwe</b> leaders and members of the government who fled the country fearing retaliation from the RPF. To aid the ground forces, Israel conducted the largest medical mission in its history, and, although their supplies were not as abundant as those of the other forces, their all-volunteer force of military surgeons was composed both of specialists and sub-specialists, including well-known surgeons. The two units established a unique and constructive method of operation which relied on France's abundant medical supplies and Israel's medical expertise.|$|E
25|$|The role of France in the Rwandan Genocide of 1994 {{has been}} a source of {{controversy}} and debate both within and beyond France and Rwanda. France actively supported the Hutu-led government of Juvénal Habyarimana against the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, which since 1990 had been engaged in a conflict intended to restore the rights of Rwandan Tutsis both within Rwanda and exiled in neighboring countries following over four decades of anti-Tutsi violence. France provided arms and military training to Habyarimana's youth militias, the <b>Interahamwe</b> and Impuzamugambi, which were among the government's primary means of operationalizing the genocide following the assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira on April 6, 1994.|$|E
25|$|In Kigali, the {{genocide}} {{was led by}} the Presidential Guard, the elite unit of the army. They were assisted by the <b>Interahamwe</b> and Impuzamugambi, who set up road blocks throughout the capital; each person passing the road block was required to show the national identity card, which included ethnicity, and any with Tutsi cards were slaughtered immediately. The militias also initiated searches of houses in the city, slaughtering Tutsi and looting their property. Kigali governor Tharcisse Renzaho played a leading role, touring the road blocks to ensure their effectiveness and using his position {{at the top of}} the Kigali provincial government to disseminate orders and dismiss officials who were not sufficiently active in the killings.|$|E
25|$|One such {{massacre}} {{occurred at}} Nyarubuye. On April 12, more than 1,500 Tutsis sought refuge in a Catholic church in Nyange, then in Kivumu commune. Local <b>Interahamwe,</b> acting {{in concert with}} the authorities, used bulldozers to knock down the church building. The militia used machetes and rifles to kill every person who tried to escape. Local priest Athanase Seromba was later found guilty and {{sentenced to life in prison}} by the ICTR for his role in the demolition of his church; he was convicted of the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity. In another case, thousands sought refuge in the Official Technical School (École Technique Officielle) in Kigali where Belgian UNAMIR soldiers were stationed. On April 11, the Belgian soldiers withdrew, and Rwandan armed forces and militia killed all the Tutsi.|$|E
25|$|The {{assassination}} of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira {{on the evening}} of 6 April 1994 was the catalyst for the Rwandan Genocide. The airplane carrying Rwandan president Juvénal Habyarimana and Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira was shot down as it prepared to land in Kigali, Rwanda. The assassination set in motion some of the bloodiest events of the late 20th century, the Rwandan Genocide and the First Congo War. Responsibility for the attack is disputed, with most theories proposing as suspects either the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) or government-aligned Hutu Power extremists opposed to negotiation with the RPF. Regardless of the cause of the assassination, it unquestionably resulted in the immediate national mobilization of anti-Tutsi militias, the <b>Interahamwe,</b> who proceeded to set up roadblocks across Rwanda and slaughter every Tutsi or moderate Hutu until driven away by rebel RPF troops.|$|E
25|$|Several {{individuals}} {{attempted to}} halt the Rwandan genocide, or to shelter vulnerable Tutsi. Among them were Romeo Dallaire (Canadian Lieutenant-General of UNAMIR), Henry Kwami Anyidoho (Ghanaian Deputy Commander of UNAMIR), Pierantonio Costa (Italian diplomat who rescued many lives), Antonia Locatelli (Italian volunteer who in 1992, {{two years before the}} actual genocide, tried to save 300 or 400 Tutsis by calling officials in the international community and was later murdered by the <b>Interahamwe),</b> Jacqueline Mukansonera (Hutu woman who saved a Tutsi during the genocide), Paul Rusesabagina (the Academy Award nominated film Hotel Rwanda is based on his story), Carl Wilkens (the only American who chose to remain in Rwanda during the genocide), André Sibomana (Hutu priest and journalist who saved many lives) and Captain Mbaye Diagne (Senegalese army officer of UNAMIR who saved many lives before he was killed).|$|E
25|$|The 1993 Arusha Accords {{attempted}} {{to offer a}} diplomatic solution to both the RPA threat and the internal tensions, {{but it was not}} implemented. Ethnic tensions became even greater following the murder of Burundian President Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, in October 1993, an event that sparked the Burundian Civil War in which large numbers of both Hutus and Tutsis were killed. Hutu militants, known as <b>Interahamwe,</b> and elements in the government in Rwanda began to plan a genocide to rid the country of the Tutsis. The assassinations of Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira on 6 April 1994 became the pretext {{for the start of the}} Rwandan Genocide, which resulted in the deaths of several hundred thousand people, mostly Tutsi, over the next three months. Most murders were carried out by, with the cooperation of, or in the absence of protest by Hutus who lived in the same communities as their victims.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{environmental problem}} the Pygmies {{seem to be}} facing {{is the loss of}} their traditional homeland, the tropical forests of Central Africa. In several countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo this is due to deforestation and the desire of several governments in Central Africa to evict the Pygmies from their forest habitat in order to cash in on quick profits from the sale of hardwood and the resettlement of farmers onto the cleared land. In some cases, as in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this conflict is violent. Certain groups, such as the Hutus of the <b>Interahamwe,</b> wish to eliminate the Pygmy and take the resources of the forest as a military conquest, using the resources of the forest for military as well as economic advancement. Since the Pygmies rely on the forest for their physical as well as cultural survival, as these forests disappear, so do the Pygmy.|$|E
25|$|The FDLR counts {{among its}} number the {{original}} {{members of the}} <b>Interahamwe</b> that opposed the RPFsthe 1994 Rwandan Genocide. It received extensive backing from, and cooperation from, the government of Congolese President Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who used the FDLR as a proxy force against the foreign Rwandan armies operating in the country, in particular the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPF military wing) and Rwanda-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy. In July 2002, FDLR units still in Kinshasa-held territory moved into North and South Kivu. At {{this time it was}} thought to have between 15,000 and 20,000 members. Even after the official end of the Second Congo War in 2002, FDLR units continued to attack Tutsi forces both in eastern DRC and across the border into Rwanda, vastly increasing tensions in the region and raising the possibility of another Rwandan offensive into the DRC – what would be their third since 1996. In mid-2004, a number of attacks forced 25,000 Congolese to flee their homes.|$|E
25|$|Military and militia groups began {{rounding}} up and killing Tutsis en masse, {{as well as}} political moderates irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. The killing swiftly spread from Kigali to all corners of the country; between April 6 and the beginning of July, a genocide of unprecedented swiftness left between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsis (800,000 is a commonly noted number) and moderate Hutus dead at the hands of organized bands of militia (<b>Interahamwe).</b> Even ordinary citizens were called on by local officials to kill their neighboring Tutsis who were called Inkotanyi - Cockroaches by the local radio stations inciting fear and hatred. The president's MRND Party was implicated in organizing many aspects of the genocide. The Hutu genocidaires were abetted by the Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines broadcasting hate speech advocating violence against Tutsis. It broadcast {{at the same time as}} Radio Muhabura broadcast from Uganda, sponsored by the RPF and their Ugandan allies.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwean arms exports {{continued}} to fall throughout the 2000s, with only minor sales {{being made to}} the Lord's Resistance Army, <b>Interahamwe,</b> and Sri Lanka. This {{has been attributed to}} the relatively high cost of manufacturing in Zimbabwe, which in turn necessitates higher market prices. Consequently, ZDI-made arms and ammunition have been unable to compete with the cheaper identical products being offered by countries such as China abroad. The inflated civil service wage—which applies to ZDI workers—has also been identified as another factor slowing down output. Between 2004 and 2014 Managing Director Dube presided over a methodical diversification process in an attempt to drum up revenue. In January 2005, ZDI announced its intention {{to take advantage of the}} ongoing land reform programme by managing expropriated commercial farmland on behalf of the army. The company garnered headlines when it attempted to seize the farm of Roy Bennett, a white Zimbabwean member of parliament. ZDI currently manages at least one farm, although others it has occupied remain neglected. ZDI's next major diversification phase was in the Marange diamond fields, where it haggled the majority shares in Anjin Investments, a joint mining project between Zimbabwe and China.|$|E
25|$|The RPF renewed its {{civil war}} against the Rwanda Hutu {{government}} when it received word that the genocidal massacres had begun. Its leader Paul Kagame directed RPF forces in neighboring countries such as Uganda and Tanzania to invade the country, but here, Paul Kagame did not direct RPF Forces from neighbouring countries because RPF was already in Rwanda {{for three years and}} half battling the Hutu forces and <b>Interahamwe</b> militias who were committing the massacres. The resulting civil war raged concurrently with the genocide for two months. The Tutsi-led RPF continued to advance on the capital, and soon occupied the northern, eastern, and southern parts of the country by June. Thousands of additional civilians were killed in the conflict. UN member states refused to answer UNAMIR's requests for increased troops and money. The remaining part of the country not under RPF control was occupied by France in Operation Turquoise. While the French operation did prevent mass killings it has been alleged that the deployment of French troops was intended to allow the Hutu militias to escape, and that the slaughter of Tutsis continued in the French controlled area.|$|E
25|$|There were {{early signs}} that {{something}} was amiss when, on January 22, 1994, a French DC-8 aircraft landed in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, loaded with ammunition and weapons for the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR). (FAR was the Hutu army under Habyarimana's control.) Through an informant, Dallaire learned that these weapons were {{to be used for}} an attack on Tutsis after the Belgians would have been forced to withdraw by violence orchestrated by the <b>Interahamwe</b> (a Hutu paramilitary organization). Despite his telegram to the UN, Dallaire was not permitted to seize the weapons, as this was deemed to be an action beyond his UN mandate. The Chief of Staff of the Rwandan Army told Dallaire that since the munitions were ordered before Arusha, the UN was not allowed to detain the shipment, and displayed paperwork showing that the weapons had been sent by Belgium, Israel, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Egypt. In addition to the arms deliveries, troops from the Rwandan government began checking identity cards which identified individuals as Hutus or Tutsis. These cards would later allow Hutu militias to identify their victims with accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{uprising}} by the ethnic Tutsi, {{sometimes referred to}} as a whole as Banyamulenge (although this term only represents people from one area in eastern Zaire—other ethnic Tutsi Kinyarwanda-speaking people include the Banyamasisi and the Banyarutshuru, as an example) people in eastern Zaire in October 1997, a huge movement of refugees began which brought more than 600,000 back to Rwanda {{in the last two weeks}} of November. This massive repatriation was followed at the end of December 1996 by the return of another 500,000 from Tanzania, again in a huge, spontaneous wave. Less than 100,000 Rwandans are estimated to remain outside of Rwanda, and they are thought to be the remnants of the defeated army of the former genocidal government, its allies in the civilian militias known as <b>Interahamwe,</b> and soldiers recruited in the refugee camps before 1996. There are also many innocent Hutu who remain in the forests of eastern Congo, particularly Rutshuru, Masisi and Bukavu, who have been misinformed by rebel forces that they will be killed upon return to Rwanda. Rebels also use force to prevent these people from returning, as they serve as a human shield.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{agreement}} and ongoing negotiations, President Habyarimana, {{supported by the}} French government, spent the subsequent months forging a [...] "common front" [...] against the RPF. This included {{members of his own}} party and the CDR, and also factions from each of the other opposition parties in the power sharing coalition. At the same time, other members of the same parties issued a statement in conjunction with the RPF, in which they condemned French involvement in the country and called for the Arusha process to be respected in full. The hardline factions within the parties became known as Hutu Power, a movement which transcended party politics. Apart from the CDR, there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement. Instead, almost every party was split into [...] "moderate" [...] and [...] "Power" [...] wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party. Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal. Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the <b>Interahamwe,</b> which was attached to the ruling party, and the CDR's Impuzamugambi. The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country. The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware {{of the fact that the}} training they provided was being used to perpetrate the mass killings.|$|E
2500|$|Between 19 April {{and late}} June 1994 Nyiramasuhuko, Ntahobali, <b>Interahamwe</b> and {{soldiers}} {{went to the}} BPO to abduct hundreds of Tutsis; the Tutsi refugees were physically assaulted and raped; and the Tutsi refugees were killed in various locations throughout Ngoma commune." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the country, Lake Muhazi was the scene of many killings during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. Large numbers of bodies were {{discarded}} in the lake by <b>Interahamwe</b> militias, while others drowned attempting to escape; witnesses described the water at the time as [...] "mixed with blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{magazine}} was the print {{equivalent to the}} later-established Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM), publishing articles harshly critical of the RPF and of Tutsis generally. [...] Its sensationalist news was passed by word-of-mouth through the largely illiterate population. Copies of Kangura were read in public meetings and, as the genocide approached, during <b>Interahamwe</b> militia rallies.|$|E
2500|$|Hutu Power was a {{supremacist}} ideology propounded by Hutu extremists in Rwanda. [...] It {{contributed to}} the 1994 Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi. Hutu Power political parties and movements included the Akazu, the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic and its Impuzamugambi paramilitary militia, and the governing National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development and its <b>Interahamwe</b> paramilitary militia.|$|E
