When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' I was like, 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E
500|$|What makes [...] "Ray Of Light" [...] one of Madonna's best singles is {{the fact}} that it is such a bitch to sing. Filled with {{multiple}} octave changes, it forced Madonna to push her vocal as far as it could possibly go. The song demanded she make use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. It really is a techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts. After hearing a sample of it for the first time in the spring of 1998, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> that Madonna had outdone herself. The song brings the entire album of to a whole new level.|$|E
500|$|After {{the band}} ended its brief tour {{in support of}} Tweez, most of its members {{attended}} college. Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It was weird while I was doing [...] because I remember sitting there, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> there was something about it. I've never heard anything like this. I'm really digging this but it's really fucking weird." ...|$|E

500|$|Ruck {{says that}} with Cameron Frye, Hughes gave him [...] "the best part I {{ever had in}} a movie, and any success that I've had since 1985 is because he took a big chance on me. I'll be forever grateful." [...] "While we were making the movie, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> I {{had a really good}} part", Ruck says. [...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend to dwell on the ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Through {{the tour}} Mars {{and his band}} mates used Sennheiser microphones, with the former relying on the Sennheiser SKM 5200-II {{wireless}} transmitter and MD 5235 capsule. James Berry, monitor engineer for Bruno Mars, remembered [...] "When I took on the Bruno Mars gig over two to half a year ago (The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour), he and the background singers were using a competitor's model. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> there was a better microphone and capsule combination for him". Over the time, every vocalist on the band changed the microphones they used, {{it all started with}} the background singers, followed by [...] "the front-of-house guy" [...] and finally Bruno Mars. The same brand of equipment was used for the wireless audio during the tour. Derek Brener, in charge of Wireless Touring Rig, is the front of house engineer for three to half a year ago.|$|E
500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> that when you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.'

500|$|Soon {{after his}} {{departure}} from the British-Irish band One Direction, Zayn started working on his debut solo studio album; months later, on 22 July 2015, {{it was announced that}} Zayn was recording new music with record producer Malay Ho, after the producer posted a photo with the singer on his Instagram account. Malik's management team reached out to him because Zayn was a fan of his work with artists such as John Legend, Alicia Keys and Frank Ocean. Later, Ho heard [...] "Pillowtalk" [...] and [...] "Fool for You" [...] before signing on to produce the record, and thought Malik's voice was [...] "incredible" [...] and agreed to work with him. The two recorded most of the songs in the Studio Suite at the Palms Casino Resort, inside Malik’s Beverly Hills Hotel room, {{and in the middle of}} the woods. As recalled by Ho, the work had a [...] "super creative, super free" [...] atmosphere. Zayn admitted that [...] "He’s just an amazing person.

2500|$|In November 2011, it was {{announced}} that Jackson would vacate the role due to the heavy amount of work he was receiving. TV Guide reported that Jackson attempted to negotiate with the network for a lighter schedule and to be repaired with on-screen love interest Herbst (Elizabeth), but was denied on both accounts. Jackson explained: [...] "I love to work hard but I've been at maximum capacity in terms of mental and emotional output for months on end and it has become too difficult. I am extremely thankful that they wanted to give me all those storylines with so much depth, but there's just no balance. (...) I have a wife and three kids and other things in life I have to think about. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> I couldn't sustain the schedule at GH and that kind of emotion for much longer.

2500|$|Sigsworth {{created a}} demo backing track that was [...] "{{finished}} enough to impress, {{but not so}} finished as to restrict Madonna's freedom to write {{over the top of}} it." [...] According to him, [...] "'What It Feels Like For a Girl' was done very quickly. 'I sent her a backing track, and she wrote a top line to it, we put it together and four days later we had a record. And what was kind of good for me was that we decided on day one that we liked all the noises I'd already used on the demo, and it was more a matter of repositioning them in the arrangement around M's top line. So the whole job, apart from recording the voice, was moving things around in Pro Tools", he claimed. He remarked that he sent her two sketches and that she chose the more unusual one. [...] "And at the start of it, I put this sample from a movie of the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> that M would fall in love with that, and she did", he declared.|$|E

When Ali began casting for the film, Kareena Kapoor was the director's first choice to portray the role of Geet Dhillon whilst actor Bobby Deol was the first choice {{for the role of}} Aditya Kashyap but Shahid replaced Bobby after Ali met him and discovered the actor was more than a poster boy. On the two lead actors, Ali commented, [...] "I wanted a girl who could look natural in scenes where she misses the train. She had to be without make-up, someone who could be hyper, talkative and interesting but not irritating. I was never a fan of her [...] and hadn't seen too many of her flicks, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> Kareena was perfect as Geet [...] , When I met him , I realised he wasn't the forgettable actor that he comes across in several of his movies.

2500|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the success}} of Hellbilly Deluxe, Zombie {{released}} American Made Music to Strip By in October of 1999. The album was composed solely of remixes of songs featured on Hellbilly Deluxe, featuring contributions from Charlie Clouser and Rammstein, among others. The album was a commercial success in the United States, entering the top forty of the Billboard 200. In 2010, Zombie announced that his fourth studio album would be titled [...] (2010). When asked about the album's title, Zombie was quoted as stating [...] "Well, it was around the ten- year anniversary of the first record, and the idea just popped into my head. It really wasn’t this big master plan by any means, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> I wanted to return to the old ways of doing things, and I thought that {{that would be a good}} starting point." [...] Songs taken from Hellbilly Deluxe were featured in Zombie's retrospective album Past, Present & Future (2003). The album featured songs from both Zombie's work with White Zombie as well as his solo career, along with some new material. Songs from Hellbilly Deluxe would later appear in Zombie's greatest hits collections The Best of Rob Zombie: 20th Century Masters The Millennium Collection (2006) and Icon (2010). Zombie has included songs taken from the album on all of his subsequent tours, including his Hellbilly Deluxe 2 World Tour (2009-12). The music found on the album has been used extensively in the media, including films, video games, and television. [...] "Dragula" [...] and [...] "Superbeast" [...] have been covered by acts such as Motionless In White and Suicide Silence, respectively. The songs [...] "Superbeast", [...] "Dragula", [...] "Living Dead Girl", [...] "Meet the Creeper", [...] "How to Make a Monster", and [...] "Demonoid Phenomenon" [...] were all covered on the tribute album The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Rob Zombie (2002).|$|E
2500|$|From 1951 {{until he}} was first slated for {{election}} in 1965, Washington worked {{in the offices of}} the 3rdWard Alderman, former Olympic athlete Ralph Metcalfe. Richard J. Daley was elected party chairman in 1952. Daley replaced C.C. Wimbush, an ally of William Dawson, on the party committee with Metcalfe. Under Metcalfe, the 3rd Ward was a critical factor in Mayor Daley's 1955 mayoral election victory and ranked first in the city in the size of its Democratic plurality in 1961. While working under Metcalfe, Washington began to organize the 3rd Ward's Young Democrats (YD) organization. At YD conventions, the 3rd Ward would push for numerous resolutions in the interest of blacks. Eventually, other black YD organizations would come to the 3rd Ward headquarters for advice on how to run their own organizations. Like he had at Roosevelt College, Washington avoided radicalism and preferred to work through the party to engender change. While working with the Young Democrats, Washington met Mary Ella Smith. They dated for the next 20 years, and in 1983 Washington proposed to Smith. In an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Smith said that she never pressed Washington for marriage because she knew Washington's first love was politics, saying, [...] "He was a political animal. He thrived on it, and I knew any thoughts of marriage would have to wait. I wasn't concerned about that. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> the day would come." [...] In 1960, with Lemuel Bentley, Bennett Johnson, Luster Jackson and others, Washington founded the Chicago League of Negro Voters, one of the first African-American political organizations in the city. In its first election, Bentley drew 60,000votes for city clerk. After dropping out of view after the elections, it resurfaced as the group Protest at the Polls in 1963. Washington participated in the planning process to further the goals of 3rd Ward YDs. By 1967, the independent candidates had gained traction within the black community, winning several aldermanic seats; in 1983, the League of Negro Voters were instrumental in Washington's run for mayor. By then, the YDs were losing influence in the party, as more black voters supported independent candidates.|$|E
