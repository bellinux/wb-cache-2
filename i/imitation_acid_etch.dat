40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{morphology}} and the irreversible enamel abrasion {{of the conventional}} acid-etch technique with the combination of sandblasting and the acid-etch technique. In addition the resulting tensile bond strength was investigated. For {{the first part of}} this study 50 extracted human molar teeth were randomly divided into the following 5 groups: (1) 30 sec <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> with 37 % phosphoric acid, (2) 5 sec sandblasted with 110 µm aluminium oxide + <b>acid</b> <b>etched,</b> (3) 10 sec sandblasted + <b>acid</b> <b>etched,</b> (4) 5 sec sandblasted + <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> + bracket + debonding, (5) 10 sec sandblasted + <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> + bracket + debonding. After the preparation of slices the correspondent enamel loss was measured microscopically using the computer programm “Discus”: (1) 7, 10 µm ± 1, 25 µm, (2) 43, 22 µm ± 17, 66 µm, (3) 96, 32 µm ± 36, 57 µm, (4) 121, 17 µm ± 14, 94 µm, (5) 184, 31 µm ± 36, 17 µm. The sandblasting followed by acid etching groups had significantly higher enamel abrasion values when compared to the acid etching group. Only between group 3 and 4 no significantly higher enamel loss could be determine. In the second part of this study a Zwick testing machine was used to determine tensile bond strengths between the enamel and the fixed brackets after a 24 h immersion in water at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/sec. The 2 groups were as follows: (A) 30 sec <b>acid</b> <b>etched,</b> (B) 5 sec sandblasted + <b>acid</b> <b>etched.</b> The results showed that the bond strength of group A was 3, 9 MPa ± 1, 12 MPa and the group that was sandblasted followed by <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> was 4, 49 MPa ± 1, 26 MPa. The statistical analysis documented that the pre-treatment with aluminium oxide does not effect significantly higher tensile bond strength. The occurrence of bond failures in the 2 groups primarily at the bracket-adhesive interface was responsible for that result whereby the exact registration of the maximum tensile bond strength between the enamel and the adhesive was not possible with this experimental setup. Considering the enamel abrasion caused by 5 sec sandblasting of 43 µm rather 121 µm after bracketdebonding, the sandblasting technique does not cause an improved clinical result due to the established bond failures at the bracket base. The sandblasting for 10 sec is just due to the very high irreversible enamel abrasion about 180 µm to estimate as censorious...|$|R

The biological consequences of such changes are poorly understood, and therefore, we have analyzed the cellular and molecular responses of osteoblasts that were plated on nanotubular anodized surface of a titanium-zirconium (TiZr) alloy. Upon comparing these results with those obtained on <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> and polished surfaces of the same alloy, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in adhesion and proliferation of cells on anodized surfaces as compared to <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> or polished surface.

40|$|Background: A {{prolonged}} life of fissure sealant {{has always}} been the target for preventing caries in vulnerable newly erupted teeth. The use of preparatory techniques including bur introduction to the fissures is considered among such improving steps. The aim of this investigation was to compare the microleakage level of fissure sealants prepared by a fissurotomy bur or pumice prophylaxis prior to acid etching. Materials and Methods: Ninety freshly extracted healthy maxillary premolar teeth were randomly selected for this investigation. Teeth were then divided into three fissure sealant preparatory groups of A: Fissurotomy bur + acid etch; B: Pumice prophylaxis + <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> and C: <b>Acid</b> <b>etch</b> alone. Sealant was applied to the occlusal fissures of all specimens using a plastic instrument. This was to avoid any air trap under the sealant. Sample teeth were first thermocycled (1000 cycles, 20 s dwell time) and then coated with two layers of nail varnish leaving 2 mm around the sealant. This was then followed by immersion in basic fuchsin 3 %. Processed teeth were sectioned longitudinally and examined under a stereomicroscope for microleakage assessment using a score of 0 - 3. Collected data was then subjected to Kruskall-Wallis Analysis of Variance and Mann-Whitney U-test. P < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: Teeth in fissurotomy bur and pumice prophylaxis groups had significantly reduced level of microleakage than those in <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> alone (P = 0. 005 and P = 0. 003, respectively).

Material and Methods The sealant was characterised by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and Vickers indentation test. Occlusal surfaces of extracted human molars were either conventionally <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> (n= 10), or sequentially <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> and laser irradiated (n= 10). UltraSeal XT® hydro&# 8482; was applied to both groups of teeth which were then subjected to 2, 500 thermocycles between 5 and 55 °C prior to microleakage assessment by fuchsin dye penetration. Results UltraSeal XT® hydro&# 8482; is an acrylate-based sealant that achieved a degree of conversion of 50. 6 ± 2. 2 % and a Vickers microhardness of 24. 2 ± 1. 5 under standard light curing (1, 000 mWcm- 2 for 20 s). Fluoride ion release is negligible within a 14 -day period. SEM and EDX analyses indicated that the sealant comprises irregular submicron and nano-sized silicon-, barium-, and aluminium-bearing filler phases embedded in a ductile matrix. Laser preconditioning was found to significantly reduce microleakage (Mann-Whitney U test, p< 0. 001). The lased teeth presented enhanced surface roughness on a 50 to 100 &# 956;m scale that caused the segregation and concentration of the filler particles at the enamel-sealant interface.

40|$|Abstract: This review {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} dentin collagen hybrid bond layer degradation and the Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) after their release by <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> and rinse adhesives and self etching bonding adhesives that can reduce the bond stability over time. MMP- 2, MMP- 8 and MMP- 9 are indicated as the active proteases that breakdown the collagen fibrils in the hybrid bond layer. Phosphoric acid in the <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> and rinse bonding process and acid primers in the self etch process are implicated in the release of these proteases and their activation by several non-collagen proteins also released from dentin by the etching. MMPs are released in saliva by salivary glands, by cells in the gingival crevices to crevicular fluid and by pulpal odontoblasts cells to the dentinal fluids. These sources may affect the hybrid layer also. Evidence of the bond strength deterioration over time {{and the ability of}} Chlorhexidine to prevent bond deterioration by inhibiting MMP action are discussed.

The application of 2 % Chlorhexidine to the phosphoric <b>acid</b> <b>etch</b> surface after rinsing off the acid is the only procedure that has been clinically tested {{for a longer period of}} time and shown to prevent bond strength degradation so far.

A tensile test was used to measure the bond strengths of the composite resins (Adaptic and HL- 72) and the unfilled resin (Sevriton). The following results were obtained: (1) Pretreating the enamel surface with 50 per cent phosphoric acid for 60 seconds significantly increased the bond strength of composite resins; (2) when placed on <b>acid</b> <b>etched</b> enamel, {{there was no significant difference}} in initial bond strengths obtained for the Adaptic and unfilled Sevriton resins; (3) with prolonged water storage, the Adaptic composite resins developed significant loss of bond strength when compared to the unfilled Sevriton resins and the composite HL- 72 resins; (4) when Adaptic resins and the HL- 72 resin specimens were compared, there was no significant difference in initial bond strengths but the HL- 72 specimens were less affected by storage time.

Acid conditioning of dental enamel causes superficial tissue loss that ranges between 20 and 50  μm [7], while a possible removal of the bonded material or the bonded attachment (de-bonding) is associated with additional loss of dental tissue [7], enamel tear-outs [8], or enamel cracks [8].|$|R
