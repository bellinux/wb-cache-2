40|$|Objectives. This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the prevalence of US-detected tenosynovitis in RA patients in clinical remission and to explore its clinical correlates. Methods. A total of 427 RA patients in clinical remission were consecutively enrolled from 25 Italian rheumatology centres. Tenosynovitis and synovitis were scored by US grey scale (GS) and power Doppler (PD) semi-quantitative scoring systems at wrist and hand <b>joints.</b> Complete <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> was performed by rheumatologists blinded to the US results. A flare questionnaire {{was used to assess}} unstable remission (primary outcome), HAQ for functional disability and radiographic erosions for damage (secondary outcomes). Cross-sectional relationships between the presence of each US finding and outcome variables are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % CIs, both crude and adjusted for pre-specified confounders. Results. The prevalence of tenosynovitis in clinical remission was 52. 5 % (95 % CI 0. 48, 0. 57) for GS and 22. 7 % (95 % CI 0. 19, 0. 27) for PD, while the prevalence of synovitis was 71. 6 % (95 % CI 0. 67, 0. 76) for GS and 42 % (95 % CI 0. 37, 0. 47) for PD. Among clinical correlates, PD tenosynovitis associated with lower remission duration and morning stiffness while PD synovitis did not. Only PD tenosynovitis showed a significant association with the flare questionnaire [OR 1. 95 (95 % CI 1. 17, 3. 26) ]. No cross-sectional associations were found with the HAQ. The presence of radiographic erosions associated with GS and PD synovitis but not with tenosynovitis. Conclusions. US-detected tenosynovitis is a frequent finding in RA patients in clinical remission and associates with unstable remission...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Spasticity is {{a common}} {{impairment}} that follows stroke, and it results typically in functional loss. For this reason, accurate quantification of spasticity has both diagnostic and therapeutic significance. The most widely used <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> of spasticity is the modified Ashworth scale (MAS), an ordinal scale, but its validity, reliability and sensitivity have often been challenged. The present study addresses this deficit by examining whether quantitative measures of neural and muscular components of spasticity are valid, and whether they are strongly correlated with the MAS. Methods We applied abrupt small amplitude joint stretches and Pseudorandom Binary Sequence (PRBS) perturbations to both paretic and non-paretic elbow and ankle joints of stroke survivors. Using advanced system identification techniques, we quantified the dynamic stiffness of these joints, and separated its muscular (intrinsic) and reflex components. The correlations between these quantitative measures and the MAS were investigated. Results We showed that our system identification technique is valid in characterizing the intrinsic and reflex stiffness and predicting the overall net torque. Conversely, our results reveal {{that there is no}} significant correlation between muscular and reflex torque/stiffness and the MAS magnitude. We also demonstrate that the slope and intercept of reflex and intrinsic stiffnesses plotted against the joint angle are not correlated with the MAS. Conclusion Lack of significant correlation between our quantitative measures of stroke effects on spastic <b>joints</b> and the <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> of muscle tone, as reflected in the MAS suggests that the MAS does not provide reliable information about the origins of the torque change associated with spasticity, or about its contributing components. </p...|$|R
40|$|The knee is a {{frequent}} target for gout and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) disease with involvement of both articular and peri-articular structures. The aims {{of the present study}} were to investigate the relationship between clinical and ultrasound (US) findings and to describe the prevalence and distribution of crystal deposits in the knee in patients with gout and CPPD disease. Thirty patients with gout and 70 patients with CPPD disease were enrolled in the study. Prior to US assessment all patients underwent a clinical examination by an expert rheumatologist who recorded the presence/absence of pain, tenderness (evocated by palpation and/or active or passive mobilisation of the knee), and knee swelling. US examinations were performed using a Logiq 9 (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) equipped with a multifrequency linear probe, working at 9 MHz. Two hundred knee joints were investigated in a total of 100 patients. Fifty-one (25. 5 %) knee joints were found clinically involved, while at least one US finding indicative of joint inflammation was obtained in 73 (36. 5 %) knee joints. The most frequent US finding indicative of knee joint inflammation was joint effusion, detected in 21 (35 %) out of 60 knees and in 52 (37 %) out of 140 knees, in gout and CPPD disease, respectively. Ten (17 %) out of 60 knees and 21 (15 %) out of 140 knees were found positive for synovial hypertrophy with or without intra-articular power Doppler, in gout and CPPD disease respectively. Sonographic evidence of crystal deposition within joint cartilage (hyaline and fibrocartilage) was more frequently seen than in the soft tissue in the knee. This study demonstrated that US detected a higher number of inflamed knee <b>joints</b> than <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> in patients with crystal related arthropathies and that the distribution of crystal deposits at joint cartilage level permitted distinction between gout and CPPD disease. Further studies are required to investigate both sensitivity and specificity of US features indicative of crystal aggregates at both tendon and entheseal level...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the utility of}} ultrasonography in guiding modification of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) and steroid therapy for inflammatory arthritis (IA) in routine clinical practice. Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed DMARD and steroid use in IA patients referred to a rheumatologist-led ultrasound clinic. Power Doppler (PD) vascularity and greyscale (GS) synovial hypertrophy joint findings were categorized as positive/negative for each patient. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) {{was used as a}} measure of disease activity. Results: We assessed single visit data for 46 adult IA patients: 67. 4 % (n= 31) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 15. 2 % (n= 7) psoriatic arthritis, 10. 9 % (n= 5) spondyloarthritis, and 6. 5 % (n= 3) undifferentiated IA. The mean ESR was 28. 8 mm/hr. Thirty-seven patients with both GS and PD ultrasound results were subsequently analyzed. All patients (n= 10) escalated and/or initiated on DMARD and 9 of 10 patients escalated or initiated on steroid were PD and GS positive. 6 of 7 patients with dose reduction and/or cessation of DMARD and 5 of 7 patients with dose reduction or cessation of steroid were PD negative. Of 6 patients with GS positive and PD negative, 3 had dose reduction and/or cessation of DMARD, while 4 had dose reduction of steroid; none of the 6 patients had DMARD/steroid escalation. Conclusion: By clarifying joint inflammation in an IA cohort with overall low ESR, ultrasonography of physician-selected <b>joints</b> can improve <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> resulting in treatment modification.

40|$|Background: Pre-operative {{preparation}} {{is an important}} component of surgical workup. Adequate <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> to determine fitness for anaesthesia and surgery and to outrule possibilities of existing disease or risk factors against the procedure would suffice in elective surgery on healthy young patients.

Results: Significant co-relation was demonstrated between <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> and routine investigations. Only 03 abnormal results were reported following 600 laboratory investigations on 150 patients. Conclusion: Thorough <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> is mandatory for successful outcome of surgery.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} and integrates {{concepts of}} causality in psychopathology, <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment,</b> <b>clinical</b> case formulation and the functional analysis. We propose that identifying causal variables, relations and mechanisms in psychopathology and <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> {{can lead to}} more powerful and efficient interventions. Four criteria must be met in order to infer a causal relation between two variables: (a) covariation between the variables, (b) temporal precedence of the causal variable over the effect, (c) the exclusion of plausible alternative explanations, and (d) a logical basis for inferring a causal relation. These are challenging criteria to meet in <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment.</b> They require multivariate time-series assessment or manipulation strategies with measures that are sensitive-to-change. The bidirectional and dynamic nature of causal relations {{and the role of}} the clinician in deriving causal judgments present further challenges to causal inference in <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment.</b> We emphasize the functional analysis as a model of clinical case formulation. The functional analysis emphasizes the specificity of constructs and requires that we identify the mechanisms that explain the causal relations - the means through which a causal effect operates. In sum, concepts of causality provide a scientific foundation and methodological guidance for <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment,</b> <b>clinical</b> case formulation, and the functional analysis...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Our {{aim was to}} {{identify}} a group of patients with clinical signs of tonsillitis to whom antibiotics could be prescribed without further diagnostic actions, and to compare the outcome of <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> with {{the result of an}} antigen detection test using culture as the gold standard. Methods. During two winter months, patients aged >= 4 years attending for sore throat at three primary health care centres in Malmö, Sweden, were examined. Odds ratios, sensitivities, specificities and predictive values were calculated for <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> and for an antigen detection test. Results. Among the 169 participating patients, growth of group A ß-haemolytic streptococci (GAS) was found in 53 cultures, and 23 patients (14 %) were clinically assessed as ‘absolutely positive’, representing positive <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment.</b> Nineteen had positive cultures for GAS.

40|$|Background and Objectives Little {{is known}} about the {{relation}} between residual muscle strength and joint contracture formation in neuromuscular disorders. This study aimed to investigate the relation between residual muscle strength and shoulder joint contractures in children with sequelae of obstetric brachial plexus lesion (OBPL). In OBPL a shoulder joint contracture is a frequent finding. We hypothesize that residual internal and external rotator strength and their balance are related to the extent of shoulder <b>joint</b> contracture. Methods <b>Clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> was performed in 34 children (mean 10. 0 years) with unilateral OBPL and Narakas classes I-III. External and internal rotation strengths were measured with the shoulder in neutral position using a handheld dynamometer. Strength on the affected side was given as percentage of the normal side. Contracture was assessed by passive internal and external rotations in degrees (in 0 ° abduction). Mallet classification was used for active shoulder function. Results External and internal rotation strengths on the affected side were approximately 50 % of the normal side and on average both equally affected: 56 % (SD 18 %) respectively 51 % (SD 27 %); r = 0. 600, p = 0. 000. Residual strengths were not related to passive internal or external rotation (p > 0. 200). Internal rotation strength (r = - 0. 425, p < 0. 05) was related to Narakas class. Mallet score was related to external and internal rotation strengths (r = 0. 451 and r = 0. 515, respectively; p < 0. 01). Conclusion The intuitive notion that imbalances in residual muscle strength influence contracture formation cannot be confirmed in this study. Our results are of interest for the understanding of contracture formation in OBPL...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{comparative}} contribution of <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment,</b> electrocardiography, and chest radiography to {{the diagnosis of}} left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients admitted to a general medical ward with acute dyspnoea. DESIGN: Prospective cross sectional study. SETTING: Acute medical admissions ward of a teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: 71 randomly selected patients admitted with acute dyspnoea. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity of each investigation and logistic regression analysis of each variable in identifying left ventricular systolic dysfunction. RESULTS: <b>Clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> in this cohort of patients with severe dyspnoea was generally sensitive (sensitivity 81 %). Patients were divided into three groups {{on the basis of}} <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment.</b> In the first group (37 patients) the diagnosis of systolic dysfunction was clear, in the second (22) it was in doubt, and in the third (12) it was unlikely. The sensitivity of <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> in identifying left ventricular systolic dysfunction was 81 % and the specificity was 47 %. The specificity of diagnosis was improved by electrocardiography (69 %) and chest radiography (92 %). Logistic regression analysis showed that isolated pulmonary crepitations were a comparatively poor predictor of left ventricular systolic dysfunction chi 2 = 10. 215, P = 0. 0014) but that a full clinical examination had reasonable predictive value (chi 2 = 24. 82, P < 0. 00001). The combination of <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> and chest radiography improved the accuracy of diagnosis (chi 2 = 28. 08, P < 0. 00001), as did the combination of <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> and electrocardiography (chi 2 = 32. 41, P < 0. 00001). CONCLUSION: <b>Clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> in patients admitted with acute dyspnoea is comparatively accurate. Patients with abnormal results on chest radiography, electrocardiography, and clinical examination have a high likelihood of having left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Echocardiography contributes little more to the diagnosis in these patients and may be more efficiently directed towards patients in whom the diagnosis is still in doubt after <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment,</b> chest radiography, and electrocardiography...|$|R

40|$|Control {{of walking}} has been {{described}} by a tripartite model consisting of stepping, equilibrium, and adaptability. This review focuses on walking adaptability, which is defined as the ability to modify walking to meet task goals and environmental demands. Walking adaptability is crucial to safe ambulation in the home and community environments and is often severely compromised after a stroke. Yet quantification of walking adaptability after stroke has received relatively little attention in the clinical setting. The objectives of this review were to examine the conceptual challenges for clinical measurement of walking adaptability and summarize the current state of <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> for walking adaptability.
