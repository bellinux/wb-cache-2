5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane produces {{inorganic fluoride}} and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA). The combined {{effects of these}} two compounds {{may be responsible for}} the toxicity of methoxyflurane to some of the major organs of the human body. Methoxyflurane was determined to be nephrotoxic (<b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> the kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and hepatotoxic (<b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> the liver) at anesthetic doses in 1973, and the drug was abandoned as a general anesthetic in the late 1970s. In 1999, the manufacturer discontinued distribution of methoxyflurane in the United States and Canada, and on September 6, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns. It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for transport of injured people.|$|E

5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually. This bird is not considered to be as <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> agriculture in South Africa {{as it is in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the outcome at Vukovar {{was not a}} disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke {{the back of the}} JNA offensive and left Croatia's main adversary exhausted and unable to press its offensive deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost surrounded by Serb-held territory and closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb, and although the defeat was <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> morale, in a strategic context the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.|$|E

5|$|As a bishop, Baldwin {{came to the}} {{attention}} of King Henry II of England, who was so impressed he insisted that Baldwin become archbishop. In that office, Baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over the founding of a church, which led to the imprisonment of the clergy in their cloister for more than a year. Baldwin spent some time in Wales with Gerald of Wales, preaching and raising money for the Third Crusade. After the coronation of King Richard I, the new king sent Baldwin ahead to the Holy Land, where he became embroiled in the politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Baldwin died in the Holy Land while participating in the crusade; his long-running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise Baldwin as more <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> Christianity than Saladin.|$|E
5|$|Dennis claimed {{at least}} 88 lives: 56 in Haiti, 16 in Cuba, 15 in the U.S. and 1 in Jamaica. Total damages are {{estimated}} at US$4–6billion, including $2.23billion in the United States {{and the rest}} in the Caribbean. Dennis was most <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> Cuba, where the storm wiped out {{a significant portion of}} the citrus crop. As the storm struck near the end of Cuba's dry season, farmers were not yet prepared for the heavy rainfall brought by the storm. In the United States, Dennis drew comparison with Hurricane Ivan of the previous year, but it was both smaller and weaker than Ivan at landfall and caused significantly fewer damages, partly because the region had not yet fully rebuilt.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{complications}} of diabetes due <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> in small blood vessels include <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> the eyes, known as diabetic retinopathy, {{is caused by}} <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the {{blood vessels in the}} retina of the eye, and can result in gradual vision loss and blindness. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> the kidneys, known as diabetic nephropathy, can lead to tissue scarring, urine protein loss, and eventually chronic kidney disease, sometimes requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> the nerves of the body, known as diabetic neuropathy, is the most common complication of diabetes. The symptoms can include numbness, tingling, pain, and altered pain sensation, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the skin. Diabetes-related foot problems (such as diabetic foot ulcers) may occur, and can be difficult to treat, occasionally requiring amputation. Additionally, proximal diabetic neuropathy causes painful muscle atrophy and weakness.|$|R
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{also occur}} {{naturally}} and {{are involved in}} the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of negative feedback slows the production line when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised example of this is the ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the tightest known protein–protein interactions. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
5|$|In March 1942 the Indies were {{occupied}} by the Empire of Japan. The occupation government captured numerous (mostly Dutch) men and women, both clergy and laymen, and instituted policies that changed how services were held. They forbade the use of Dutch in services and in writing, and seized several church properties; several others, including the presbytery at Gedangan, were protected by the clergy. After two European head pastors, G. Schoonhoff and G. de Quay, were confined, ultimately on 27 August 1943 the ethnic Javanese Soegijapranata took on parish duties {{in addition to his}} work as vicar apostolic. Although he promoted non-compliance with Japanese demands considered <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> the church, Soegijapranata also endorsed some collaboration. For instance, on 28 February 1944 a Latin-language Mass was delivered at Gedangan by , bishop of Nagasaki.|$|E

In July 2001, Phytophthora cinnamomi, a significant cause of plant disease in the Adelaide Hills, {{was found in the}} park. Mechanical countermeasures, in the form of boot scrubbing stations, have been introduced to control its spread.|$|E
5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water {{should not be}} used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> cell membranes, but this is not an important risk because it is not very soluble in water.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} Song and Liao (led by the Khitans) were {{relatively}} peaceful {{in the first}} two decades after Song was founded, the disputed territories of the Northern Han and the Sixteen Prefectures notwithstanding. In 974, the two began exchanging embassies on New Years Day. However, in 979 the Song moved against the Northern Han, long under the protection of the Liao dynasty. The Song emperor succeeded in forcing the Northern Han to surrender, but when marching on the Liao Southern Capital (present-day Beijing) in the Sixteen Prefectures, Song forces were defeated at the Battle of Gaoliang River. This defeat was politically <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> the prestige of Emperor Taizong of Song (r. 976–997), so much so that his top military commanders orchestrated an aborted coup to replace him with his nephew Zhao Dezhao.|$|E

5|$|The Fire Emblem series' Weapon Triangle {{mechanic}} {{is featured}} again, {{in which the}} three main close-combat weapons are strong or weak against each other: axes are strong against lances, lances are strong against swords, and swords are strong against axes. Other similar mechanics exist, such as fire magic being more <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> some beasts, and arrows being more effective against airborne enemies. Weapon durability decreases over time, with weapons eventually breaking when used {{a certain number of}} times. Weapons have different levels of strength, with its assigned letter (E to A and S) denoting the level of skill required to wield it. Weapons forged at Base can also be customized with a unique name. Magic is governed by a similar system to the Weapons Triangle; fire is weak to wind, wind is weak to thunder, and thunder is weak to fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{hammering}} of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great {{forces which}} are potentially <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> the birds. In the {{great spotted woodpecker}} {{and most of its}} relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} can procure various weapons, {{including}} melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, and alien weapons. Non-melee weapons degrade with use and will break {{if they are}} not regularly repaired with maintenance tools. There are a variety of ammunition types, each of which is most <b>damaging</b> <b>to</b> a specific enemy. For example, organic enemies are vulnerable to anti-personnel rounds, while mechanical foes are weak against armor-piercing rounds. Similarly, energy weapons cause the most damage against robots and cyborgs, and the annelid-made exotic weaponry is particularly harmful to organic targets. Because ammunition is scarce, to be effective the player must use it sparingly and carefully search rooms for supplies.|$|E
