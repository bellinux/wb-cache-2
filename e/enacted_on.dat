5|$|Rather than {{repeating the}} devolved {{arrangements}} of previous treaties, Edward chose to permanently colonise North Wales instead.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{as the price}} of silver rose, Treasury Department vaults were {{depleted}} of silver dollars by the public. No silver dollars had been minted in the United States since 1935, and a shortage developed in the Western United States, especially in areas in which gambling was common. As a result, Congress voted to authorize production of 45 million new silver Peace dollars on August 3, 1964. However, the move drew strong condemnation from critics who believed that the issuance of the coins was influenced by special interests, and that they would be quickly removed from circulation. The dollars were subsequently melted, and the Coinage Act of 1965, <b>enacted</b> <b>on</b> July 23, 1965, forbade all production of dollar coins for a period of five years.|$|E

5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{influential}} factor shaping this new class was the competitive nature of scholarly candidates entering civil service through the imperial examinations. Although not all scholar-officials came from the landholding class, sons of prominent landholders had better access to higher education, and thus greater ability to pass examinations for government service. Gaining a scholarly degree by passing prefectural, circuit-level, or palace exams in the Song period {{was the most important}} prerequisite in being considered for appointment, especially to higher posts; this was a departure from the Tang period, when the examination system was <b>enacted</b> <b>on</b> a much smaller scale. A higher degree attained through the three levels of examinations meant a greater chance of obtaining higher offices in government. Not only did this ensure a higher salary, but also greater social prestige, visibly distinguished by dress. This institutionalized distinction of scholar-officials by dress included the type and even color of traditional silken robes, hats, and girdles, demarcating that scholar-official's level of administrative authority. This rigid code of dress was especially enforced during the beginning of the dynasty, although the prestigious clothing color of purple slowly began to diffuse through the ranks of middle and low grade officials.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nearly}} three decades since passage of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the annual demand for silver bullion rose {{steadily}} from roughly 11 million ounces (1933) to 110 million ounces (1962). The Acts of 1939 and 1946 established floor prices for silver of 71 cents and 90.5 cents (respectively) per ounce. Predicated by an anticipated shortage of silver bullion, Public Law 88-36 (PL88-36) was <b>enacted</b> <b>on</b> 4 June 1963 which repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, and the Acts of 6 July 1939 and 31 July 1946, while providing specific instruction regarding the disposition of silver held as reserves against issued certificates and the price at which silver may be sold. It also amended the Federal Reserve Act to authorize the issue of lower denomination notes (i.e., $1 and $2), allowing for the gradual retirement (or swapping out process) of $1 silver certificates and releasing silver bullion from reserve. In repealing the earlier laws, PL88-36 also repealed {{the authority of the}} Secretary of the Treasury to control the issue of silver certificates. By issuing Executive Order 11110, President John F. Kennedy was able to continue the Secretary’s authority. While retaining their status as legal tender, the silver certificate had effectively been retired from use.|$|E

5|$|The {{kings of}} England and the Welsh princes had vied {{for control of}} North Wales since the 1070s and the {{conflict}} had been renewed during the 13th century, leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales {{for the second time}} during his reign in 1282. Edward invaded with a huge army, pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. Edward decided to permanently colonise North Wales and provisions for its governance were set out in the Statute of Rhuddlan, <b>enacted</b> <b>on</b> 3March 1284. Wales was divided into counties and shires, emulating how England was governed, with three new shires created in the north-west, Caernarfon, Merioneth and Anglesey. New towns with protective castles were established at Caernarfon and Harlech, the administrative centres of the first two shires, with another castle and walled town built in nearby Conwy, and plans were probably made to establish a similar castle and settlement near the town of Llanfaes on Anglesey. Llanfaes was the wealthiest borough in Wales and largest in terms of population, an important trading port and on the preferred route from North Wales to Ireland. The huge cost of the building the other castles, however, meant that the Llanfaes project had to be postponed.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the issuing of situado concluded, {{with two}} last {{deliveries}} of 500,000 and 100,000 between 1809 and 1810. This brought forth a critical economical crisis to Puerto Rico. At the moment, Salvador Meléndez Bruna, the colonial governor in office, ordered {{the production of}} provincial paper money. The decree was officially <b>enacted</b> <b>on</b> August 31, 1812. These banknotes used the peso being used as equivalent to Spanish reales. Produced by hand, these banknotes featured quantities in the thousands, with 1 peso being worth 8 reales. Mechanical printing had arrived to Puerto Rico years earlier, but up until 1813, part of the issued notes were being produced by hand and stamped. Between 1812 and 1813, the tradition of collecting paper money continued, which reduced the amount of surviving banknotes drastically. The other notes printed between 1813 and 1814, featured a combination of printed types and stamps, the printing was done by Puerto Rico's National Printing Office and featured patterns to prevent the production of counterfeits. Those featuring denominations in reales, were adorned by Spain's Royal Seal, with the color varying depending on the date of issue, the 1813 8-real banknotes featured a lamb on the obverse. However, these security measures were ineffective against counterfeiting, eventually copies of several denominations were circulating in a widespread manner, forcing cities outside of San Juan, Arecibo and Loiza to discontinue their use. Meléndez Bruna decided {{that the only way}} to prevent forgery was by asking Spain to produce sealed paper for the printing of the banknotes. The first issue bore the signatures of treasurers or accountants, but this was dropped the subsequent year.|$|E
5|$|The Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN) first {{proposed}} a {{station in the}} Strand area in a private bill presented to Parliament in November 1898. The station {{was to be the}} southern terminus of an underground railway line planned to run from Wood Green station (now Alexandra Palace) via Finsbury Park and King's Cross and was originally to be located at the corner of Stanhope Street and Holles Street, north of the Strand. When the two streets were scheduled for demolition as part of the London County Council's plans for the construction of Kingsway and Aldwych, the GN moved the location to the junction of the two new roads. Royal Assent to the bill was given and the Great Northern and Strand Railway Act 1899 was <b>enacted</b> <b>on</b> 1 August. In September 1901, the GN was taken over by the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B), which planned to build an underground line from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus via Knightsbridge. Both were under the control of Charles Yerkes through his Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company and, in June 1902, were transferred to Yerkes' new holding company, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Neither of the railways had carried out any construction, but the UERL obtained permission for new tunnels between Piccadilly Circus and Holborn to connect the two routes. The companies were formally merged as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) following parliamentary approval in November 1902. Prior to confirmation of the merger, the GN had sought permission to extend its line southwards from the future junction of Kingsway and Aldwych, under Norfolk Street to a new interchange under the Metropolitan District Railway's station at Temple. The extension was rejected following objections from the Duke of Norfolk under whose land {{the last part of the}} proposed tunnels would have run.|$|E
