5|$|Syracuse University Ambulance, {{commonly}} referred to as SUA, is a SU Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing intermediate life support (ILS), rapid cardiac defibrillation, emergency and nonemergency transportation, and special event standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly car, and a MCI trailer for mass-casualty incidents. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. Advanced life support (ALS) mutual aid is provided by the City of Syracuse's private EMS provider, Rural/Metro Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical Crisis Unit was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides emergency and non-emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student <b>health</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} {{was to examine}} peoples and {{professionals}} opinions on introduction of the regulatory <b>health</b> <b>fees.</b> Within {{the scope of the}} two sub-targets, I tried to find out the amounts of the regulatory <b>health</b> <b>fees</b> acceptable for the citizens and something about the possibility to arrange a private health insurance. I briefly described the system of the public health insurance and I mentioned the system of the regulatory <b>health</b> <b>fees</b> and the annual protection limit in more detail in the theoretical part of the diploma thesis. In order to compile the thesis I used the method of questioning which I carried out by collecting data using a questionnaire and the method of the secondary analysis of data. Two statistics groups [...] general public and professionals from the South Bohemian Region - were defined for the research part. Based on the available literature, I established four hypotheses of which the first three were confirmed and the fourth one was disconfirmed by the research. The research revealed differences in opinions and perception of the regulatory <b>health</b> <b>fees</b> between the individuals and general public and professionals. The citizens awareness [...] which still has its deficiencies as the questionnaire survey revealed [...] has definitely influence on the opinion on the regulatory <b>health</b> <b>fees.</b> The thesis could be used to increase the awareness of the system of the regulatory <b>health</b> <b>fees</b> and the annual protection limit, for lectures, eventually the respondents replies and the research results could be taken into consideration when amending the existing Act No. 48 / 1997 Coll., on Public Health Insurance...|$|R

30|$|The Nanguo {{municipal}} government benefited from these policy innovations in two ways. First, the new health insurance program, with its high quality and efficiency, became {{a vital part}} of the social security network of Nanguo City to maintain social stability. By the end of 2011, over 6 million residents in Nanguo City, including about 70  % of the migrant population, had participated in the unified basic health insurance, indicating that the health insurance system in Nanguo City was able to provide basic health security for most of its residents. An insured resident who received hospital service and outpatient health care in a communal health center would be reimbursed 95  % of their expenses (100  % for retired people, the ceiling was 150 [*]¥) and 70  % (no cap set) maximum of the total <b>health</b> <b>fee.</b> Second, the success of the policy innovation contributed remarkably to the political achievements of local leaders. The Nanguo {{municipal government}} gained a high reputation in health reform and was frequently praised by both the provincial government and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand {{government}} {{introduced a}} Primary Health Care Strategy (PHCS) in 2001 {{aimed at improving}} access to primary health care, improving health, and reducing inequalities in health. The Strategy represented a substantive increase in health funding by government and a move from a targeted to a universal funding model. This paper uses representative national survey data to examine the distribution of fees paid for primary health care by different individuals under the mixed public-private financing model in place prior {{to the introduction of}} PHCS. Using multivariate regression analysis, we find that fees do vary, with people who might be expected to have greater needs paying less. However, apart from people with diabetes, there is no direct link between self-reported <b>health</b> status and <b>fees</b> paid. The findings indicate that a mixed public-private financing model can result in a fee structure which recognises differences across different population groups. The findings also provide a baseline against which changes in funding brought about by the PHCS can be evaluated.

This fiscal year {{represented}} {{the first year of}} fiscal reductions based on the fiscal condition of the state. While we did receive 1. 8 million for compensation increases and 3. 3 million for enrollment growth, we also had to absorb a 3. 2 million mid-year reduction imposed by the State. Our enrollments have continued to rise. The initial 2002 / 03 allocation to our campus included funding for 5 percent enrollment growth bringing our FTE target to 16, 590. During the year we received funding for an additional 1 percent in enrollment growth bringing our FTE target to 16, 689. These additional enrollment growth funds have helped mitigate the impact of the mid-year reduction.

40|$|This paper emphasises that {{malnutrition}} {{cannot be}} tackled without understanding its causes. Child malnutrition remains {{a major public}} health problem in Ethiopia, yet the government has no specific nutrition policy. Levels of wasting (acute malnutrition) and stunting (chronic malnutrition) in children aged 6 to 59 months are among the world’s highest. As long as so many children remain malnourished, Ethiopia will not achieve the first Millennium Development Goal – eradication of extreme poverty and hunger. Drawing on a sample of 1, 999 one-year-olds across 20 sites, Young Lives has sought {{to better understand the}} child, household, community and policy level determinants of malnutrition {{and the ways in which}} they differ across different regions of Ethiopia. The paper quantifies the impact of poverty, health-care and caring practices, and challenges the World Bank belief that investment in growth monitoring to promote change in caregivers’ behaviour will, by itself, significantly improve nutritional status. Coverage of health services may have expanded, but limited and costly services discourage users. Quality services are lacking. Respondents complained about inadequate equipment, poorly trained and/or insensitive medical staff, and expensive medication. The key findings of this paper are grouped under three headings: child, family/household, and community characteristics. Policy implications are discussed with reference to UNICEF’s three-part conceptual framework on child malnutrition. The paper suggests that tackling child malnutrition requires training programmes for nutritionists; sensitivity training for health professionals; availability of essential quality drugs and health personnel who know how to administer these appropriately; <b>health</b> <b>fee</b> waiver systems for poor households; and the inclusion of specific nutritional indicators in the new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper...|$|E

The ČSSD {{tried to find a}} similar controversial topic {{that might have been the}} church restitutions for a moment.

The objectives of the study were to ascertain health, education and psychosocial needs and problems of children infected with HIV, to establish how children infected with HIV are benefiting and helped to cope through the SOS Childrenâ€™s Villages outreach community program and to find out the challenges faced by SOS Childrenâ€™s Villages in providing services to HIV infected children. The study was carried out in three high density suburbs in Harare. Thirty four children infected with HIV and seven key informants formed the respondents. The responses generally show that the needs of HIV children infected include access to basic food, <b>health</b> <b>fees</b> assistance, and school fees assistance, access to counselling and support group services and clothing. The major problems that the child participants noted included continued ill health, drug shortages, limited access to psychosocial support services such as counselling services, stigma and discrimination and anxiety about what will happen in the future. It was recommended that collaborative efforts be strengthened between relevant government ministries, and non state actors to ensure increased availability of basic food and other services such as drugs, school fees and psychosocial support services so as to meet fully the needs of HIV infected children and promote their growth.
