40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of employment policies in the Western Balkan countries and examines levels of harmonization of national employment policies throughout these countries with the European Union employment policy framework. The observed Western Balkan countries achieved different statuses {{in the process of}} approaching the European Union. Today they include acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. Depending on their current statuses, levels of convergence of employment policies vary. Only Croatia, that will join the European Union through the seventh enlargement, was obliged to propose to the European Commission the pre-accession <b>Joint</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Paper</b> on employment policy priorities. Next three candidate countries – Montenegro, FYR Macedonia and Serbia – will be obligated to propose similar documents, in order to prepare their institutional capacities for the implementation of integrated employment policy guidelines and to show certain levels of commitment to the reforms inspired by achievement of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth until 2020. In this chapter the convergence is observed through possible translation of the European Union employment policy guidelines, set out by the Europe 2020 Strategy, to the labour market of an individual country. In terms of available employment policy outcomes, all observed Western Balkan countries are still far from achieving the European Union headline targets. The common priorities of the Western Balkan countries are to increase overall level of employability, through better education and skills, and to conduct prominent reforms in order to improve their economies...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to address {{the gap in the}} area of wearable knee <b>joint</b> health <b>assessment.</b> Knee injuries are among the most common reasons for doctor’s visits. The physical examinations of the joint during these visits are typically limited to qualitative observations. Examination methods based on diagnostic imaging are expensive and time consuming. Beyond the clinic, such as in the home or with wearable technologies, there are no viable solutions available for providing in-depth, quantitative <b>joint</b> health <b>assessment.</b> Developing novel, ubiquitous technologies for <b>joint</b> health <b>assessment</b> would enable personalized, feedback-controlled therapies for patients. Towards the proposed research goal, sensing systems and signal processing techniques that can provide biomarkers for knee <b>joint</b> health <b>assessment</b> are developed and discussed. Two types of physiological signals acquired from the knee joint are considered for this purpose: (1) electrical bioimpedance and (2) acoustic emission signals. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the issues}} {{surrounding}} decision making about medication treatments {{has important implications}} for public health, including improving the quality of care for patients with chronic conditions. This dissertation examines medication decisions in one chronic condition, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Chapter one introduces the context of decision making about medications in RA. Guidelines recommend treating RA to the target (T 2 T) of low disease activity (LDAS) with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). T 2 T requires regularly monitoring for moderate/high disease activity (MHDAS), and adjusting DMARDs at least every 3 months until the patient reaches LDAS. The chapter provides background on the challenges of implementing T 2 T, and summarizes chapters two through four. Chapter two addresses delays in DMARD adjustment for patients with MHDAS. Survival analysis is used to examine the extent of delays in DMARD adjustments and whether delayed DMARD adjustment leads to delayed LDAS. Forty percent of RA patients with persistent MHDAS wait longer than 3 months to receive DMARD adjustment, and timely DMARD adjustment is associated with reaching LDAS sooner. There may be a need to reduce delays in DMARD therapy adjustment for many patients. Chapter three examines patients’ perspectives on medication decisions, exploring how feelings in response to events and information motivate decisions to accept or resist medications. Patients’ feelings towards the benefits and dangers of medications, their identity as an ill person, the act of taking medication, and the decision process itself affect willingness to accept medications. Awareness of feelings motivating resistance to taking medications may allow physicians to better support patients confronting threatening information and difficult treatment decisions. Chapter four compares patient <b>joint</b> <b>assessments</b> with physician <b>joint</b> <b>assessments</b> to examine their suitability for disease activity monitoring between visits. Although agreement on <b>joint</b> <b>assessment</b> items is modest, agreement on detection of MHDAS is better. Patient <b>joint</b> <b>assessments</b> may be useful for disease monitoring between visits, potentially reducing delays to DMARD adjustment. This dissertation provides a multi-level view of treatment guideline implementation in RA. Understanding the interdependency of patient, provider, and system level factors in medication decisions is valuable for improving the quality of care for patients with chronic conditions...|$|R
