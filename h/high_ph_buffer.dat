40|$|Three {{different}} reversed phases for high-performance {{liquid chromatography}} obtained with monofunctional octadecylsilane or with cross-linked polymethyloctadecylsiloxane with and without trimethylsilane precapping of the substrate were synthesized on the same batch of Nucleosil silica. After extensive characterization, these phases were subjected to artificial ageing under simulated routine conditions. Changes in properties of the bonded-phase packings were quantified with chromatographic techniques, solid-state 29 Si NMR and elemental analysis. These changes are correlated with lipophilic and polar selectivity, accessibility of silanol groups at the surface, loss of silanes/siloxanes, separation performance and silica degradation of the stationary phases. Improved surface shielding properties and stability towards eluents of high pH are considerable advantages of cross-linked polymer-coated and octadecyl stationary phases. Precapping of the substrate with trimethylsilanes prior to polymer coating reduces the concentration of silanol groups to less than 50 % and yields stationary phases which exhibit further decreased silanol interactions because the residual silanol groups are shielded in a double manner by the trimethylsilyl groups and by the polymer layer on top of it. This also leads {{to an increase in}} stability. The non-precapped polymer-coated stationary phase showed an advanced cross-linking of the polymers after ageing experiments with <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer</b> solutions, resulting in improved silanol shielding and large shifts in selectivity. After precapping with trimethylsilane-enolate the polymeric methyloctadecylsiloxane coating proved to be more stable than the non-precapped phase. Also, the precapped phase showed hardly any chemical bonding with the silica surface; only Van der Waals and other dispersive interactions with the anchored trimethylsilanes at the surface exist. The high mobility of the polymer coating at the pore surface of the substrate is retained for the precapped stationary phase, also after simulated ageing experiments. This precapped polymer coated stationary phase showed an almost consistent separation performance after ageing experiments with <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer</b> solutions, but a small shift in selectivity was observed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} novel, porous biomass fly ash-containing geopolymers with <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer</b> {{capacity}} and tailored alkalis leaching were produced by using hydrogen peroxide as blowing agent. Results {{demonstrate that the}} geopolymers leaching rate can be controlled by the hydrogen peroxide content and by the solids-to-liquid ratio during geopolymers preparation. Total leaching of hydroxyl ions from the porous geopolymers ranged between 0. 0104 and 0. 0180 mol/(dm(3) g). Higher solids-to-liquid ratios promoted a gentler alkalis leaching from the geopolymers, while higher porosities shifted the initial pH towards higher values without compromising their buffering ability. The excellent ability to control pH over time shown by these novel geopolymers demonstrates their potential as pH regulators in applications where high buffer capacity is required. Furthermore the reuse of biomass fly ash in these innovative materials reduces the environmental footprint associated with this waste disposal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Additional studies conducted to achieve the thesis objectives include kinetic studies of KMnO 4 oxidation with PCE at <b>high</b> <b>pH.</b> The kinetic studies of KMnO 4 oxidation of PCE were conducted using a sodium carbonate solution (1 g/l, pH = 10. 6 +/- 0. 1) at three different temperatures (5, 10, and 20 °C) and three KMnO 4 concentrations (0. 2, 1, and 5 g/l). Extensive kinetic {{studies suggest that the}} overall oxidation is a second-order reaction and pseudo-first-order with respect to PCE and KMnO 4, respectively.

This study identified a set of antibodies for investigating the immunopathology of infectious CNS diseases in horses. Multiple commercially available staining reagents and antibodies derived from antigens of various species for manual immunohistochemistry (IHC) were screened. Several techniques and reagents for heat-induced antigen retrieval, non-specific protein blocking, endogenous peroxidase blocking, and visualization-detection systems were tested during IHC protocol development. Boiling of slides in a low <b>pH,</b> citrate-based <b>buffer</b> solution in a double-boiler system was most consistent for epitope retrieval. Pressure-cooking, microwaving, <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffers,</b> and proteinase K solutions often resulted in tissue disruption or no reactivity.

Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle analysis to gain structural insight into the full-length dimeric structures of LRRK 2 and LRRK 1.

A simulation analysis of the phasing power of the (Ta 6 Br 12) 2 + ions at artificially imposed resolution limits shows that it is not possible to resolve the individual Ta atoms if the dmin limit of the data is higher than 2. 9 angstroms. Additionally, for successful Ta identification the (Ta 6 Br 12) 2 + complex should be specifically bound and ordered.

METHODS [...] The ability of recombinant secretory leucoprotease inhibitor (rSLPI) to inhibit neutrophil mediated degradation of fibronectin in vitro is demonstrated and its efficacy compared with native alpha- 1 -proteinase inhibitor (n alpha 1 -PI), recombinant alpha- 1 -proteinase inhibitor (r alpha 1 -PI), and the chemical elastase inhibitor ICI 200, 355. RESULTS [...] When preincubated with neutrophils both rSLPI and r alpha 1 -PI were effective inhibitors of fibronectin degradation although n alpha 1 -PI and ICI 200, 355 were less effective. Recombinant SLPI was the most effective inhibitor when the cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin before the addition of the inhibitors. Preincubation of rSLPI (0. 1 mumol/l) with the fibronectin plate resulted in almost total inhibition of fibronectin degradation (reduced to 3. 3 (SE 0. 9) % of control). Pretreating the fibronectin plate with 1 mumol/l rSLPI, r alpha 1 -PI and ICI 200, 355 followed by thorough washing before the addition of cells resulted in no inhibition of fibronectin degradation with r alpha 1 -PI and the ICI inhibitor, but rSLPI retained its inhibitory effect. This effect could be reduced by adding rSLPI in <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer</b> or 2 mol/ 1 NaCl. CONCLUSIONS [...] It is postulated that rSLPI binds to fibronectin to form a protective layer which prevents its degradation by neutrophil elastase.

40|$|The {{isolation}} of individual enantiomers of drugs {{is an important}} subject {{of interest in the}} pharmaceutical and medical fields, because stereochemistry can {{have a significant effect on}} the biological activity of the drug. Therefore, it is important to develop enantiomeric separation methods for the determination of the optical purity of drugs, since the undesired enantiomer is regarded as one of the impurities. The available single isomer anionic cyclodextrins (CD) can resolve the enantiomers of only a few weakly acidic analytes. To rectify this problem, the chloride salts of heptakis(6 -deoxy- 6 -morpholinio) -cyclomaltoheptaose (HMBCD), and mono(6 - deoxy- 6 -N,N,N r,N r,N r-pentamethylethylenediammonio) -cyclomaltoheptaose (PEMEDA-BCD), the first members of the permanently charged, single-isomer cationic cyclodextrin family, have been synthesized. The purity of process intermediates and final products was determined by HPLC-ELSD and indirect UV-detection capillary electrophoresis. Structural identity was verified by 1 D and 2 D NMR and massBoth cationic CD derivatives have been used for the separation of the enantiomers of strong acid, weak acid, weak base, ampholytic, and neutral analytes by capillary electrophoresis. Because the charge state of these cationic chiral resolving agents is independent of the pH of the buffer, separation could be performed in both low and high pH buffers without compromising the charge density of the resolving agent. Contrary to expectation, the multiply charged HMBCD showed poor complexation with the newly synthesized strong electrolyte test analytes. The weak binding between the analytes and HMBCD resulted in separation of enantiomers of only three strong electrolyte analytes. Strong complexation was observed between PEMEDA-BCD and the anionic and nonionic analytes in both low and high pH buffers, though complexation was stronger in the <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer.</b> Due to strong complexation between the anions and PEMEDA-BCD, only low concentrations of the resolving agent were required to effect good enantiomer resolutions. spectrometry...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of pH on metal extractability from two sacrificial soils that received {{large amounts of}} biosolids was studied in four separate trials. The soils (Soil 1 : gravelly sandy loam; Soil 2 : sandy clay loam) were collected from different water treatment plants in Gauteng. Both soils had undergone significant changes in physical (organic carbon content) and chemical characteristics (pH, metal and nutrient content) due to the prolonged disposal of biosolids. A preliminary pot trial was conducted where large quantities of lime {{were added to the}} soils. Results indicated that the soils had <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer</b> capacities due to low pH and high organic matter content. An unexpected increase in the metals extracted with NH 4 EDTA after intensive liming lead to the performing of three further trials to shed light on the phenomenon. In the second trial lime was added to the soils at four rates (0, 12, 24, 36 tons ha- 1). An increase in most NH 4 EDTA extractable metals was found and this was correlated with increasing absorbance values (at 465 nm) of the extracting solutions (indicating increased extractability of organic matter). In the third trial limed (27 ton ha- 1) and unlimed samples were incubated over a period of 20 weeks with regular sampling intervals. The NH 4 NO 3 extractable metals decreased significantly in the lime treated soils but the NH 4 EDTA extractable metals generally increased. A fourth trial was conducted due to concern regarding the increased EDTA extractable metals after liming and a possible correlation with plant metal bioavailability. The soils were incubated in pots with four lime rates (0, 12, 24, and 36 ton ha- 1) and wheat and spinach grown for two months. Although similar trends as for the previous trials were obtained in terms of metal extractability, plant metal content was best correlated with NH 4 NO 3 extraction levels. The results indicate that liming is a safe option for sacrificial soils and that NH 4 NO 3 extractable and plant metal levels decrease with liming. The use of EDTA in metal guidelines or in soil metal content studies is discouraged due to its increased metal extractability with liming and poor correlation with plant metal content.

Greater differences in <b>buffer</b> <b>pH</b> and pH at 0 - 7.5  cm among treatments showed that the acidity in the surface soil layer can be reduced by liming, especially in NTCW, STCW, and FSTCW. Because soil pH was > 6.0 below 7.5  cm, lime can be applied at variables rates depending on soil pH among treatments in the surface layer without the need for incorporating it into the soil to neutralize acidity and increase the availability of most nutrients, thereby improving crop yields.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe in situ porewater {{chemistry}} (PC) experiment {{carried out}} in the Opalinus Clay formation at the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory, Switzerland for a period of 5 a allowed the identification and quantification of the biogeochemical processes resulting from and affected by an anaerobic microbial disturbance. The unintentional release of degradable organic compounds (mainly glycerol) induced microbially-mediated SO 4 reduction in the borehole with concomitant significant geochemical changes in the circulating water and the adjacent porewater. These changes included a decrease in SO 4 concentration and pH and an increase in pCO 2 and alkalinity relative to the non-affected formation water. However, the cation composition of the water and the mineralogy of the clay close to the borehole wall showed very little change. This is explained by (1) the strong chemical buffering processes in the clay and (2) by the diffusion-limited flux of solutes. With the aid of a reactive transport model with a minimum set of kinetic parameters for the hypothesised degradation reactions, the evolution of solutes in the borehole could be modelled adequately. The model was also applied to the prediction of restoration times upon depletion of the C source and results indicated restoration times to undisturbed conditions of about 15 a, but also highlighted the rather large uncertainties inherent in the geochemical model. Nevertheless, the simulations provided additional evidence of the <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer</b> capacity of the Opalinus Clay. The results from the microbiological investigations do not allow unambiguous identification of the origin of the microbial population in the borehole. Possible sources were the drilling procedure, the artificial porewater, and perhaps some revival of indigenous dormant strains. Regardless of the origin of the microbes, the results from the PC experiment underlined the importance of anaerobic microbial activity in the ''disturbed'' Opalinus Clay, facilitated by the introduction of space, water and organic material, in rapidly establishing very reducing conditions. The PC experiment also yielded valuable insight with regard to the safety of a high-level radioactive waste repository emplaced in Opalinus Clay. Anaerobic microbial perturbations in the clay host rock may occur from the construction and excavation procedures and emplaced organic by-products. The resulting effects on porewater chemistry, i. e., especially on pH and Eh, may affect the mobility of radionuclides eventually released from the waste. However, the overall results of the PC experiment suggest that such effects are temporary and spatially limited because of the large buffering capacity and diffusive properties of the clay formation. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that the amounts of organic materials in a high-level waste repository should be kept small in order to achieve background conditions within a short time period after repository closure. A further conclusion from the PC experiment is that commonly used equipment materials may not display commonly assumed inert behaviour. This particularly holds for the gel-type ''robust'' reference electrodes, which may release substantial amounts of glycerol...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLeucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK 2) {{is a large}} multidomain protein {{implicated in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), and currently {{one of the most}} promising therapeutic targets for drug design in Parkinson's disease. In contrast, LRRK 1, the closest homologue to LRRK 2, does not play any role in PD. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle analysis to gain structural insight into the full-length dimeric structures of LRRK 2 and LRRK 1. Differential scanning fluorimetry-based screening of purification buffers showed that elution of the purified LRRK 2 protein in a <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer</b> is beneficial in obtaining high quality cryo-EM images. Next, analysis of the 3 D maps generated from the cryo-EM data show 16 and 25 Å resolution structures of full length LRRK 2 and LRRK 1, respectively, revealing the overall shape of the dimers with twofold symmetric orientations of the protomers that is closely similar between the two proteins. These results suggest that dimerization mechanisms of both LRRKs are closely related and hence that specificities in functions of each LRRK are likely derived from LRRK 2 and LRRK 1 's other biochemical functions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide 3 D structural insights in LRRK 2 and LRRK 1 dimers in parallel. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. It affects 1 – 2 % of all people above the age of 65 1 and is at present incurable, although treatments are available to alleviate the symptoms. Genetic studies have identified several genes involved in PD pathogenesis. The leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK 2) gene is of particular importance, with mutations in the coding sequence being the most prevalent known causes of genetic PD and genomic variants at the LRRK 2 locus being common risk factors for sporadic PD 2. In addition, LRRK 2 appears to act upstream of several other PD genes and PD risk factors, such as alpha-synuclein, tau, cyclin G associated kinase (GAK) and RAB 7 L 1 3, 4. The 144 kb-long LRRK 2 gene encodes for the 2527 amino acids long, cytosolic enzyme LRRK 2, which functions as a GTPase as well as a kinase. Most of the pathologically important mutations are clustered in the catalytic core of this protein, hinting that altered GTPase and kinase activities may play a crucial role in pathogenesis 5, 6. Targeting the LRRK 2 signaling pathway is currently regarded as {{one of the most promising}} approaches in drug development for PD 7 – 10. LRRK 2 is a member of the ROCO protein family 11. It contains several protein-protein interaction domains, including armadillo (ARM), ankyrin repeats (ANK), leucine-rich repeats (LRR), Ras Of Complex proteins GTPase (ROC), C-terminal Of ROC (COR), a kinase (KIN) and WD 40 12 (Fig. 1). The multidomain protein is involved in several cellular functions, including autophagy and neurite outgrowth regulation, and is related to some mitochondrial diseases 13 – 15. Biochemical experiments suggest that the kinase and GTPase activities of LRRK 2 are regulated by dimerization 16 – 19. Three other ROCO proteins have been identified in humans: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 1 (LRRK 1), death-associated kinase 1 (DAPK 1), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified sequence 1 (MFASHI 1). LRRK 1 is the closest homologue of LRRK 2. The domain organization is similar and, like LRRK 2, LRRK 1 i...|$|E
40|$|From Jello to {{mayonnaise}} to silly putty to biological cells, {{our world}} {{is replete with}} "soft matter" - materials that behave as soft, deformable solids or highly viscoelastic liquids. Living systems, in particular, {{can be thought of}} as extremely sophisticated `soft' machines, with each cellular unit representing a touchstone for the functional potential of soft materials built via self-assembly. Drawing inspiration from biology, we blueprint soft biomaterial designs which rely upon self-assembly to achieve enhanced functionality. As opposed to complex synthesis schemes often used to develop improved biomaterials, we take an `easy' approach by allowing relatively simple molecules orchestrate themselves into advanced machines. In this dissertation, we describe four separate "soft" systems, all constructed by self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules under designed and/or triggered conditions in aqueous media. These systems revolve around a common theme: the structural tandem of (1) vesicles and (2) biopolymers, and the resulting interactions between the two. Our blueprints show promise in several important biomedical applications including controlled drug release, tissue engineering, and wound care. In the first part of this study, we blueprint a biopolymer gel that entraps pH-sensitive vesicles. The vesicles are formed by the self-assembly of a single-tailed fatty acid surfactant. We show that the gel has pH-responsive properties imparted upon it via the embedded vesicle nanostructures. Specifically, when the gel is brought in contact with a <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer,</b> the diffusion of buffer into the gel disrupts the vesicles and transforms them into micelles. Accordingly, a vesicle-micelle front moves through the gel, and this can be visually seen by a difference in color. The disruption of vesicles means that their encapsulated solutes are released into the bulk gel, and in turn these solutes can rapidly diffuse out of the gel. Thus, we can use pH to tune the release rate of model drug molecules from these vesicle-loaded gels into the external solution. In the second part, we have blueprinted hybrid biopolymer capsules containing drug-loaded vesicles by means of a one-step self-assembly process. These capsules are called "motherships" as each unit features a larger container, the polymer capsule, carrying a payload of smaller vesicular containers, or "babyships," within its lumen. These motherships are self-assembled via electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged polymers/surfactants at the interface of the droplet. Capsule size is simply dictated by drop size, and capsules of sizes 200 - 5000 µm are produced here. Lipid vesicles, i. e. the babyships, are retained inside motherships due to the diffusional barrier created by the capsule shell. The added transport barrier provided by the vesicle bilayer in addition to the capsule shell provides sustained drug release from the motherships. Furthermore, this one-step drop method allows for the rapid synthesis of soft materials exhibiting structural features over a hierarchy of length scales, from nano-, to micro- to macro-. Thirdly, we have therapeutically functionalized biopolymer films by simply passing a solution of vesicles over the film surface. We deposit films of an associating biopolymer onto patterned solid substrates. Subsequently, these polymer films are able to spontaneously capture therapeutically-loaded vesicles from solution; this is demonstrated both for surfactant as well as lipid vesicles (liposomes). Importantly, it is verified that the vesicles are intact - this is shown both by direct visualization of captured vesicles (via optical and cryo-transmission electron microscopy) as well as through the capture and subsequent disruption of drug filled vesicles. Such therapeutically-functionalized films may be of use in the treatment of chronic wounds and burns. Lastly, we have demonstrated that the addition of a certain biopolymer transforms a suspension of whole blood into a gel. This blueprint is inspired from previous research in our group on the biopolymer-induced gelation of vesicles, which are structurally similar to cells. Upon mixture with heparinized human whole blood, this amphilic biopolymer rapidly forms into an "artificial clot. " These mixtures have highly elastic character, with the mixtures able to hold their own weight upon vial inversion. Moreover, the biopolymer shows significant hemorrhage-controlling efficacy in animal injury models. Such biopolymer-cell gelation processes are shown to be reversed via introduction of an amphiphilic supramolecule, thus introducing the novel concept of the "revesible hemostat. " Such a hemostatic functionality may be of large and unprecedented use in clinical the treatment of problematic hemorrhage both in trauma and routine surgeries...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{polypeptide}} hydrogel {{has been}} synthesized by crosslinking poly(L-glutamic acid) (PLG) with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The PLG-PEG hydrogel {{was shown to}} be highly hydrophilic, {{and the extent of}} swelling varied with <b>pH,</b> increasing at <b>higher</b> ionization of the PLG. Aside from electrostatic effects, such as ion–ion repulsion and internal ion osmotic pressure, circular dichroism studies showed that swelling response to pH also is affected by secondary structural attributes associated with the polypeptide backbone. Modification of the polypeptide by changing its hydrophobicity and degree of ionization was an effective method for altering the overall extent of pH-responsive swelling. Rapid de-swelling (contraction) was observed when the PLG-PEG hydrogel was transferred from <b>high</b> to low <b>pH</b> <b>buffer</b> solution, and this swelling/de-swelling behavior was reversible over repeated cycles.

40|$|This {{research}} has investigated proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) of quinone/hydroquinone and other simple organic PCET species {{for the purpose}} of furthering the knowledge of the thermodynamic and kinetic effects due to reduction and oxidation of such systems. Each of these systems were studied involving the addition of various acid/base chemistries to influence the thermodynamics and kinetics upon electron transfer. It is the expectation that the advancement of the knowledge of acid/base catalysis in electrochemistry gleaned from these studies might be applied in fuel cell research, chemical synthesis, the study of enzymes within biological systems or to simply advance the knowledge of acid/base catalysis in electrochemistry. Furthermore, it was the intention of this work to evaluate a system that involved concerted-proton electron transfer (CPET), because this is the process by which enzymes are believed to catalyze PCET reactions. However, none of the investigated systems were found to transfer an electron and proton by concerted means. Another goal of this work was to investigate a system where hydrogen bond formation could be controlled or studied via electrochemical methods, {{in order to understand the}} kinetic and thermodynamic effects complexation has on PCET systems. This goal was met, which allowed for the establishment of in situ studies of hydrogen bonding via 1 H-NMR methods, a prospect that is virtually unknown in the study of PCET systems in electrochemistry, yet widely used in fields such as supramolecular chemistry. Initial studies involved the addition of Brønsted bases (amines and carboxylates) to hydroquinones (QH 2 ’s). The addition of the conjugate acids to quinone solutions were used to assist in the determination of the oxidation processes involved between the Brønsted bases and QH 2 ’s. Later work involved the study of systems that were initially believed to be less intricate in their oxidation/reduction than the quinone/hydroquinone system. 	The addition of amines (pyridine, triethylamine and diisopropylethylamine) to QH 2 ’s in acetonitrile involved a thermodynamic shift of the voltammetric peaks of QH 2 to more negative oxidation potentials. This effect equates to the oxidation of QH 2 being thermodynamically more facile in the presence of amines. Conjugate acids were also added to quinone, which resulted in a shift of the reduction peaks to more positive potentials. To assist in the determination of the oxidation process, the six pKa’s of the quinone nine-membered square scheme were determined. 1 H-NMR spectra and diffusion measurements also assisted in determining that none of the added species hydrogen bond with the hydroquinones or quinone. The observed oxidation process of the amines with the QH 2 ’s was determined to be a CEEC process. While the observed reduction process, due to the addition of the conjugate acids to quinone were found to proceed via an ECEC process without the influence of a hydrogen bond interaction between the conjugate acid and quinone. 	Addition of carboxylates (trifluoroacetate, benzoate and acetate) to QH 2 ’s in acetonitrile resulted in a similar thermodynamic shift to that found with addition of the amines. However, depending on the concentration of the added acetate and the QH 2 being oxidized, either two or one oxidation peak(s) was found. Two acetate concentrations were studied, 10. 0 mM and 30. 0 mM acetate. From 1 H-NMR spectra and diffusion measurements, addition of acetates to QH 2 solutions causes the phenolic proton peak to shift from 6. 35 ppm to as great as ~ 11 ppm, while the measured diffusion coefficient decreases by as much as 40 %, relative to the QH 2 alone in deuterated acetonitrile (ACN-d 3). From the phenolic proton peak shift caused by the titration of each of the acetates, either a 1 : 1 or 1 : 2 binding equation could be applied and the association constants could be determined. The oxidation process involved in the voltammetry of the QH 2 ’s with the acetates at both 10. 0 and 30. 0 mM was determined via voltammetric simulations. The oxidation process at 10. 0 mM acetate concentrations involves a mixed process involving both oxidation of QH 2 complexes and proton transfer from an intermediate radical species. However, at 30. 0 mM acetate concentrations, the oxidation of QH 2 -acetate complexes was observed to involve an ECEC process. While on the reverse scan, or reduction, the process was determined to be an CECE process. Furthermore, the observed voltammetry was compared to that of the QH 2 ’s with amines. From this comparison it was determined that the presence of hydrogen bonds imparts a thermodynamic influence on the oxidation of QH 2, where oxidation via a hydrogen bond mechanism is slightly easier. 	In order to understand the proton transfer process observed at 10. 0 mM concentrations of acetate with 1, 4 -QH 2 and also the transition from a hydrogen bond dominated oxidation to a proton transfer dominated oxidation, conjugate acids were added directly to QH 2 and acetate solutions. Two different acetate/conjugate acid ratios were focused on for this study, one at 10. 0 mM/ 25. 0 mM and another at 30. 0 mM/ 50. 0 mM. The results of voltammetric and 1 H-NMR studies were that addition of the conjugate acids effects a transition from a hydrogen bond oxidation to a proton transfer oxidation. The predominant oxidation species and proton acceptor under these conditions is the uncomplexed QH 2 and the homoconjugate of the particular acetate being studied, respectively. Furthermore, voltammetry of QH 2 in these solutions resembles that measured with the QH 2 ’s and added amines, as determined by scan rate analysis. 	In an attempt to understand a less intricate redox-active system under aqueous conditions, two viologen-like molecules were studied. These molecules, which involve a six-membered fence scheme reduction, were studied under buffered and unbuffered conditions. One of these molecules, N-methyl- 4, 4 ’-bipyridyl chloride (NMBC+), was observed to be reduced reversibly, while the other, 1 -(4 -pyridyl) pyridinium chloride (PPC+), involved irreversible reduction. The study of these molecules was accompanied by the study of a hypothetical four-membered square scheme redox system studied via digital simulations. In unbuffered solutions each species, both experimental and hypothetical, were observed to be reduced at either less negative (low pH) or more negative (high pH), depending on the formal potentials, pKa’s of the particular species and solution pH. The presence of buffer components causes the voltammetric peaks to thermodynamically shift from a less negative potential (low pH buffer) to a more negative potential (<b>high</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer).</b> Both of these observations have been previously noted in the literature, however, there has been no mention, to our knowledge, of kinetic effects. In unbuffered solutions the reduction peaks were found to separate near the pKa, 1. While in buffered solutions, there was a noted peak separation throughout the pH region defined by pKa’s 1 and 2 (pKa, 1 and pKa, 2) of the species under study. The cause for this kinetic influence was the transition from a CE reduction at low pH to an EC reduction process at high pH in both buffered and unbuffered systems. This effect was further amplified via the study of the hypothetical species by decreasing the rate of proton transfer. 	In an effort to further this work, some preliminary work involving the attachment of acid/base species at the electrode surface and electromediated oxidation of phenol-acetate complexes has also been studied. The attachment of acid/base species at the surface is believed to assist in the observation of heterogeneous acid/base catalysis, similar to that observed in homogeneous acid/base additions to quinone/hydroquinone systems. Furthermore, our efforts to visualize a concerted mechanism are advanced in our future experiments involving electromediated oxidation of phenol-acetate complexes by inorganic species. It may be possible to interrogate the various intermediates more efficiently via homogeneous electron-proton transfer rather than heterogeneous electron transfer/homogeneous proton transfer...|$|E

As the amount of sludge produced {{is expected to increase}} greatly, the current sludge treatment, disposal and utilisation practices will have increasing environmental implications. Sewage sludge contains significant· organic matter and nutrients that can serve as soil conditioners or fertilisers. When sewage sludge is used as a soil conditioner, heavy metal and pathogen contamination can limit its application rates. In a preceding study bauxite refining residue (red mud) amendment was used to control the mobility of heavy metals and pathogen in MSW composting. To meet the requirement of a soil conditioner, sludge composting with an amendment of bauxite refining residue (red mud) was studied in this thesis. Thorough composting can meet the requirement for controlling pathogens by subjecting the wastes to thermophilic temperatures during the process. Digested sludge composting usually contains a higher moisture content and less available carbon, making it more difficult to reach the thermophilic stage of composting with anaerobically digested sludge alone. Two methods were tried to overcome these problems; reducing moisture content by drying the sludge and supplying available carbon by amending with readily biodegradable bulking agents. It was confirmed that the content of available carbon in digested sewage sludge was a key factor for the optimisation of composting in a forced aeration system. In order to investigate the long term effect of red mud amendment on the mobility of heavy metals in sludge composting, the speciation of heavy metals was studied. A sequential step extraction was employed to investigate metal speciation into exchangeable, carbonate bound, Mn & Fe oxides bound, organic matter bound and residual phases for the following heavy metals: cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc. The basis of this investigation is that potential hazards of heavy metals are dependent on the physio-chemical forms of metals in sludge and soil. To reduce the concentrations and the mobility of heaVy metals in sewage sludge compost, red mud - gypsum was mixed with the sludge prior to the sludge being composted. The red mud compost had the following improvements over conventional sludge compost: lower metal content and mobility; lower moisture content; much <b>higher</b> <b>pH</b> <b>buffer</b> capacity; was subjected to higher temperature and moisture removal; increased nutrient and water retention capacity and a greater stability of the organic fractions. It was found that heavy metals are present in very stable forms in sludge compost relative to MSW compost.

However, this additional nitrogen can also be lost by volatilization during land application. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to measure NH 3 volatilization from both ISPAD and open tank swine manures when applied to 5 different soils, namely, washed sand, a Ste Rosalie clay, an Upland sandy loam, a St Bernard loam, and an Ormstown loam. This research was conducted using laboratory wind tunnels simulating land application. The five experimental soils offered similar pH values but different water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, cation saturation, and organic matter. After 47 [*]h of wind tunnel monitoring, the % of total available nitrogen (TAN or NH 4 [*]+ and NH 3) volatilized varied with both manure and soil type. For all soil types, the ISPAD manure consistently lost less NH 3 as compared to the open tank manure, averaging 53 % less. Lower volatile solids content improving manure infiltration into the soil and a more complex ionic solution explain the effect of the ISPAD manure advantages.
