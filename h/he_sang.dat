5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while <b>he</b> <b>sang</b> his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E

5|$|During {{a trip to}} Nashville, Tennessee, Nelson {{attended}} a party in Harlan Howard's house, where <b>he</b> <b>sang</b> the songs that he had written for the album Phases and Stages. Another guest was Atlantic Records vice-president Jerry Wexler, who previously had produced works for artists such as Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin. Wexler was interested in Nelson's music, so when Atlantic opened a country music division of their label, he offered Nelson a contract that gave him more creative control than his deal with RCA. When Nelson was released from his RCA contract, he signed with Atlantic for US$25,000 per year, becoming the label's first country artist.|$|E
5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, <b>he</b> <b>sang</b> in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E

After leaving school, in 1950, he joined the United States Air Force for eight to nine months.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while <b>he</b> <b>sang</b> into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{discharge}} from the Army {{and return to the}} States in 1946, Benedetto studied at the American Theatre Wing on the GI Bill. He was taught the bel canto singing discipline, which would keep his voice in good shape for his entire career. He continued to perform wherever he could, including while waiting tables. Based upon a suggestion from a teacher at American Theatre Wing, he developed an unusual approach that involved imitating, as <b>he</b> <b>sang,</b> the style and phrasing of other musicians — such as that of Stan Getz's saxophone and Art Tatum's piano — helping him to improvise as he interpreted a song. He made a few recordings as Bari in 1949 for small Leslie Records, but they failed to sell.|$|E

5|$|When Dyer {{returned}} to Europe he initially travelled to France, where <b>he</b> <b>sang</b> and played to theatres in Paris. Only one boxing match is recorded {{during his time}} there, against middleweight Jean Audouy. Before the fight Dyer was advised by a doctor not to wear his strapping he had used to support his injured left leg, but in the seventh round his leg gave way again and Audouy was declared the winner. Just a week before his encounter with Audouy, Ted Lewis had regained his British middleweight title but Dyer's reoccurring injury now ruled out any encounter between the fighters.|$|E
5|$|While touring with Powderfinger, Middleton {{also wrote}} his own works, {{occasionally}} fine tuning them in hotels where {{the band was}} staying. These {{would go on to}} be the songs <b>he</b> <b>sang</b> for Drag. Middleton formed Drag with drummer and Powderfinger engineer Mark McElligott, Brisbane bass guitarist Sean Hartman, and long-time friend Matt Murphy. Drag released an EP, Gas Food Lodging, on 26 October 2003 through Dew Process. The band followed this up with several gigs in Brisbane; a tour down the East Coast of Australia was canceled when Middleton caught the flu. After completing work on Gas Food Lodging, Powderfinger reunited and went on to record Vulture Street.|$|E
5|$|His {{mother left}} {{soon after he}} was born, and his father {{remarried}} and also moved away, leaving Willie and his sister Bobbie to be raised by their grandparents. The Nelsons, who taught singing back in Arkansas, started their grandchildren in music. Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords, and with his sister Bobbie, <b>he</b> <b>sang</b> gospel songs in the local church. He wrote his first song at age seven, {{and when he was}} nine, played guitar for the local band Bohemian Polka. During the summer, the family picked cotton along with other citizens of Abbott. Nelson disliked picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age 13, and continuing through high school. Nelson's musical influences were Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Django Reinhardt, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong.|$|E
