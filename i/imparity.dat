In the first Yugoslavia (between the two World Wars) Croatia was economically handicapped through different political practices; the monetary reform, taxing <b>imparities,</b> Sebian colonization in Eastern Slavonia and disadvantageous treatment in infrastructure construction. In the socialist Yugoslavia this handicap was continued primarily through a policy of industrial disinvestment. The economic reforms by Prime Minister Ante Marković in the late 1980 s could not save the Yugoslav federation, they even attempted to increase centralization, which was inacceptable for Croatia.

The key is, will the fuel cell patent’s value be worth renewing? Thus assessment of patent value is essential. Our study focus online searching was made available after 1976, as the initial year to conduct the patent search. Up to 2001, there are 2269 patents classified in the H 01 M 008 / 00 ~H 01 M 008 / 24 category, which is the category concerning fuel cell under the classification of the International Patent Classification. Effective exploitation of technology values is subject to the complementarities of organizational resources.

40|$|Summary: Hungary aims at {{reconciling}} its diversification {{efforts and}} improvement of {{its relations with}} Russia. In order to achieve such a balance, diversification is understood not {{as a result of}} Russian threat, but as a consequence of existing <b>imparities</b> in the coun-try’s energy system. Hungary has to decrease the level of its energy supply vulnerability anyway, not particularly because of Russia’s policy. At the same time, Russian supplies are going to remain crucial in the country’s and Europe’s imports even in a more diversi-fied energy landscape. Therefore Hungary tries to help in finding a new balance of inter-ests in the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue and avoid any breakdown in these relations. Hungary {{has one of the most}} one-sided and vulnerable energy systems in the EU 25. Almost half of the primary energy supply consists of natural gas 1, a share comparable only to that of the Netherlands’. What is more, in contrast to the leading gas consumer countries of the EU, Hungary has no significant indigenous production, imports nearly 84 % of its demand exclusively from Russia through the Russian-Ukrainian pipeline network. Transit volumes to Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are irrevelevant in the light of its own needs.

40|$|Introduction: Nutritional {{assessment}} {{is a prerequisite}} for nutritional delivery. Patients in intensive care suffer from under-nutrition and nutritional failure due to poor assessment. Nursing ability to early detect nutritional failure is the key for minimizing <b>imparities</b> in practice and attaining nutritional goals. Aim {{of this article is to}} examine the ability of Jordanian ICU nurses to assess the nutritional status of critically ill patients, considering biophysical and biochemical measures. Methods: This cross sectional study recruited nurses from different health sectors in Jordan. ICU nurses from the governmental sector (two hospitals) and private sectors (two hospitals) were surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire. Nurses' knowledge and responsibility towards nutritional assessment were examined. Results: A total of 220 nurses from both sectors have completed the questionnaire. Nurses were consistent in regard to knowledge, responsibility, and documentation of nutritional assessment. Nurses in the governmental hospitals inappropriately perceived the application of aspiration reduction measures. However, they scored higher in applying physical examination and anthropometric assessment.   Although both nurses claimed higher use of biochemical measurements, biophysical measurements were less frequently used. Older nurses with longer clinical experience exhibited better adherence to biophysical measurement than younger nurses. Conclusion: Nursing nutritional {{assessment is}} still suboptimal to attain nutritional goals. Assessment of body weight, history of nutrition intake, severity of illness, and function of gastrointestinal tract should be considered over measuring albumin and pre-albumin levels.   A well-defined evidence-based protocol as well as a multidisciplinary nutritional team for nutritional assessment is the best to minimize episodes of under-nutrition...|$|R

A single swimmer floating alone in the water, created a sense of isolation, whereas the autonomous swimmer had no boundaries, possibly a romanticized longing by the artist to set his own body free. This figure, though small in its surroundings, seemed to have had domain of its environment - able to float away on a whim devoid of any <b>imparities.</b> Within his newer work, the swimmer is transferred into an arbor, and it is juxtaposed within a panoramic landscape somewhat agoraphobic.

30|$|Although {{concrete}} is a noncombustible material, {{high temperatures}} {{such as those}} experienced during a fire {{have a negative effect}} on the mechanical properties. This paper studies the effect of elevated temperatures on the mechanical properties of limestone, quartzite and granite concrete. Samples from three different concrete mixes with limestone, quartzite and granite coarse aggregates were prepared. The test samples were subjected to temperatures ranging from 25 to 650  °C for a duration of 2  h. Mechanical properties of concrete including the compressive and tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and ultimate strain in compression were obtained. Effects of temperature on resistance to degradation, thermal expansion and phase compositions of the aggregates were investigated. The results indicated that the mechanical properties of concrete are largely affected from elevated temperatures and the type of coarse aggregate used. The compressive and split tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity decreased with increasing temperature, while the ultimate strain in compression increased. Concrete made of granite coarse aggregate showed higher mechanical properties at all temperatures, followed by quartzite and limestone concretes. In addition to decomposition of cement paste, the <b>imparity</b> in thermal expansion behavior between cement paste and aggregates, and degradation and phase decomposition (and/or transition) of aggregates under high temperature were considered as main factors impacting the mechanical properties of concrete. The novelty of this research stems from the fact that three different aggregate types are comparatively evaluated, mechanisms are systemically analyzed, and empirical relationships are established to predict the residual compressive and tensile strength, elastic modulus, and ultimate compressive strain for concretes subjected to high temperatures.|$|E

Yet, as its contents evolved as mostly independent (due to our inaptitude to interconnect both trends as strongly as we wished), it seemed preferable to publish it separately. More factually, our account is an attempt to get familiarized with the current consensus about Hilbert's 16 th in degree 8. This is a nearly finished piece of mathematics, thanks heroic breakthroughs by Viro, Fiedler, Korchagin, Shustin, Chevallier, Orevkov, yet still leaving undecided six tantalizing bosons among a menagerie of 104 logically possible distributions of ovals (respecting Bézout, Gudkov periodicity, and the Fiedler-Viro <b>imparity</b> law sieving away 4 + 36 schemes).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop the sensitive diagnostic method of Time Differential Perturbed Angular Distributions (TDPAD) using implanted fluorine (10 F) as the nuclear probe, and apply it to defect and impurity studies of diamond crystals, by detecting the internal electric field gradient (efg) at the <b>imparity</b> sites. Defects and impurities can substantially determine and modify the electrical and physical properties of materials. Such studies lead to theoretical advances and new materials. Diamond presents a unique system in which to perform these studies. The related Muon Spin Rotation (MSR) technique, which detects the local magnetic field at the muon residence sites, was also used to study the behaviour of the implanted hydrogen-like impurity. The l 0 F is recoil implanted into the diamond by a 4 MeV pulsed proton beam from an accelerator. The parameters describing the local efg (magnitude, asymmetry, distribution and orientation) at the residence sites of the implanted 10 F probes are measured by detecting the perturbed Tf-ray angular distribution from the 19 F deexcitation. The efg reflects the local microscopic structure and dynamic processes. Measurements were performed as a function of crystallographic orientation, diamond type (naturally present defects and impurities) and temperature. Studies were also made of other carbon allotropes. The accelerator pulsing facilities were improved by the stabilization of the chopper {{and the development of a}} buncher. Theoretical model functions were developed for the analysis of data for non-axially symmetric efg’s in cubic single crystals. Essentially two different residence sites for 19 F probe ions in diamond and its allotropes were found.

40|$|Objectives: {{this study}} aimed to assess nurses' {{practice}} and {{perception of their}} knowledge, responsibility and documentation in relation to enteral nutrition in the critically ill and to explore nurses' attitudes towards establishing evidence-based practice and teamwork in three health care sectors in Jordan. Background: poor nursing adherence to evidence-based guidelines has negative consequences leading to higher mortality rates, delayed recovery and longer length of stay. Evidence-based practice and team working {{is the key to}} minimising complications and discrepancies between nurses. Design and methods: mixed-methods strategies were employed. A cluster randomised sample recruited 253 ICU nurse for the survey. Fourteen nurses were selected purposively for the interviews and fifty five patients were involved in bedside observations. Both statistical and thematic analysis findings were integrated and discussed together. Results: Nurses revealed a tendency to undertake nutritional care despite the recognition clinical nutrition is a secondary role. In terms of nursing processes, nurses showed greater levels of knowledge and responsibility for ‘preventing complications' and ‘evaluation' more than ‘assessment' and ‘identifying goals'. However, female nurses scored higher in taking responsibility for ‘assessment' and ‘planning' than male nurses. The internet and clinical experience were the most effective sources of knowledge along with university education and colleagues. Nurses showed inconsistency in assessment tasks such as controlling gastric residual volume and confirming tube placements. Diarrhoea was the most frequent complication followed by abdominal pain, vomiting, tube dislodgment, weight loss. However, nurses realised that the incidences of complications is less likely when applying such evidence-based protocol for enteral nutrition. Multidisciplinary team work was introduced as a source of evidence-based practice and establishing a nutritional team contributes to a greater nursing involvement in decision making. Poor cooperation and interaction within the team prohibits standardized care and increases the <b>imparity</b> in nursing practice. Conclusion: increased nursing awareness of nutritional assessment through providing training programs and surveillance of clinical performance is necessary. Management should be concerned with offering an accessible source of knowledge, the required equipment and documentation systems. Enhancing collaboration between health care providers and offering appropriate counselling should also be emphasized. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Impairment is usually accompanied by long term functional loss which requires dedicated post-stroke rehabilitation to regain motor function. The incidence of stroke is increasing rapidly while there remains a shortage of therapists to provide sufficient rehabilitation. There is therefore a high demand for therapists to attend to the rising number of stroke survivors. Robot-aided therapy has emerged as a beneficial tool for providing continuous rehabilitation of the upper limb and is widely being implemented. With this technology, there is great potential to reduce the ill-effects brought about by the low therapist-patient ratio which has hindered sufficient rehabilitation and consequently the effective recovery of motor function among stroke survivors. Hypothesis: The use of a portable robotic rehabilitation system, as a complementary tool, in hand therapy, would promote continuous rehabilitation by encouraging repetition of task oriented exercises which would enhance motor function of an impaired hand. Task-oriented writing practice would potentially improve hand coordination and result in better accuracy while repetitive training would potentially increase hand motor strength. Objectives: 1. To design and manufacture a portable robotic rehabilitation system. 2. To test the performance and usability of the system. Methods: The system was manufactured and its performance tested in a pilot pre-clinical trial involving three participants. The system's ease of use was assessed using a standardised usability scale. Writing accuracy and hand motor strength were also assessed and the results analysed at the end of the study. Results: The average overall score of usability for the rehabilitation system was a few points higher than the average score. The users of the system also experienced increased motivation whilst performing the repetitive and task oriented exercises. There was an improvement in the completion time of the writing accuracy test and the tasks of the trace sample test. The variation in grip strength of the non-dominant hand during the rehabilitation period was small for each of the participants. Conclusion: The rehabilitation system motivated its users to repetitively perform rehabilitative training which may have improved writing accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Understanding and {{addressing}} linguistic disadvantage {{must be a}} central facet of the social justice agenda of our time. This book explores {{the ways in which}} linguistic diversity mediates social justice in liberal democracies undergoing rapid change due to high levels of migration and economic globalization. Focusing on the linguistic dimensions of economic inequality, cultural domination and <b>imparity</b> of political participation, Linguistic Diversity and Social Justice employs a case-study approach to real-world instances of linguistic injustice. Linguistic diversity is a universal characteristic of human language but linguistic diversity is rarely neutral; rather it is accompanied by linguistic stratification and linguistic subordination. Domains critical to social justice include employment, education, and community participation. The book offers a detailed examination of the connection between linguistic diversity and inequality in these specific contexts within nation states that are organized as liberal democracies. Inequalities exist not only between individuals and groups within a state but also between states. Therefore, the book also explores the role of linguistic diversity in global injustice with a particular focus on the spread of English as a global language. While much of the analysis in this book focuses on language as a means of exclusion, discrimination and disadvantage, the concluding chapter asks what the content of linguistic justice might be. 1.

40|$|Oncogenes, {{activated}} {{copies of}} normal cellular genes, {{are involved in}} carcinogenesis and have been suggested to be determinants of cellular radiosensitivity (RS). Mutations and gene rearrangement of c-Ha-RAS and c-MYC oncogenes were analysed in 70 biopsies and 51 blood samples from the same patients and compared with RS estimated by the clinical tumour response and by response to irradiation of tumour samples using subrenal capsule assay. We did not find a correlation between the alterations of c-Ha-RAS and/or c-MYC and RS. DNA {{is considered to be}} a target for ionizing radiation. Efficiency of repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been suggested to be a determinant of cellular RS. Two human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines showing different RSs did not differ with regard to induction levels of DNA DSBs. However, the resistant cell line showed a faster rate of the first part of the repair process. The radioresistant cell line had a higher activity of the DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), an enzyme which is a component of the DNA DSB repair apparatus called non-homologous end joining - NHEJ, compared with the more radiosensitive cell line. In order to study DNA DSB and SSB repair processes in more detail, an in vitro endjoining assay based on utilization of bacterial plasmid DNA, was developed. Using this method we showed that Ku protein, the function of which is considered to be limited to NHEJ, stimulates the repair of SSBs. The result therefore points towards the possibility of sharing of the same enzyme by two DNA repair pathways. Ku protein did not protect DNA against nuclease degradation but it did compete with the process of nuclease degradation by accelerating the repair process. Using the same system, we compared the efficiency of repair of SSBs generated by low (X-ray) - and high (nitrogen ions) - LET (linear energy transfer) radiations. High-LET irradiation has been shown to result in a higher proportion of locally multiply damaged sites (LMDSs) compared to low-LET irradiation. LMDSs are DNA lesions that are thought to be least repairable. However, in our system, X-ray and nitrogen iongenerated SSBs were repaired with the same efficiency. The DNA is constantly inflicted by DNA damage that the cellular repair system copes with most likely in competition with nuclease activities. The constitutive level of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) correlated with RS in four squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (including the two described above). As <b>imparity</b> in DNA replication is a major source of SSBs during normal cell metabolism, DNA polymerase (pol) and DNA ligase activities were measured. DNA pol activity increased gradually with increasing RS. The ligase activity of the most radiosensitive cell line was lowest compared to the three other cell lines. Our data indicate that low ligase activity may depend on a high activity of nucleases in the cells. The results suggest that spontaneous level of SSBs may be predictable for cellular RS. The high level of SSBs may be a result of deficiency in handling of strand breaks, which consists of an imbalance between the processes that lead to introduction of DNA strand breaks and the DNA strand break repair process...|$|E
