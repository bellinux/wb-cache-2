25|$|Convoy SL 125 sailed on 16 October 1942 before Operation Torch {{discontinued}} sailings from Freetown. Shipping was routed {{along the}} east coast of the Americas to Halifax until convoy SL 126 sailed from Freetown on 12 March 1943. Convoy SL 128 merged with convoy MKS 12 off Gibraltar in April 1943 to be designated SL 128/MKS 12 and all subsequent SL convoys had a similar <b>joint</b> <b>designation</b> format. The effective range of U-boats was decreased by Allied capture of French Atlantic seaports in 1944. The reduced threat of submarine attack off the African Atlantic coast allowed merchant ships to sail independently to Gibraltar after convoy SL 178/MKS 69 left Freetown on 25 November 1944.|$|E
2500|$|Slow convoys {{returning}} from the Mediterranean to the United Kingdom after Operation Torch were designated MKS replacing the former HG series. The first MKS convoys were ships {{returning from}} Operation Torch. [...] MKS 1 sailed from Gibraltar on 21 November 1942, and reached Liverpool on 30 November. Convoy MKS 12 sailed from Bône on 22 April 1943 and merged with convoy SL 128 to be designated SL 128/MKS 12. All subsequent MKS convoys merged with an SL convoy with a similar <b>joint</b> <b>designation</b> until SL 178/MKS 69 {{marked the end of}} the SL series in November 1944. The MKS series continued until convoy MKS 103 reached Liverpool on 1 June 1945.|$|E
2500|$|From 7 September 1939, OutBound OB convoys had sailed from Liverpool south through St George's Channel to {{the open}} Atlantic. [...] OB convoys were escorted for about four days from Land's End before the convoy would {{disperse}} and individual ships proceed independently to their destinations. As U-boats found and sank increasing numbers of ships dispersed from OB convoys, OB convoys were replaced by ON convoys and by OS convoys formed of ships Outbound to the South Atlantic and escorted {{all the way to}} Freetown. Convoy OS 1 sailed from Liverpool on 24 July 1941, and reached Freetown on 10 August. An escort group would screen a southbound OS convoy and return with a northbound SL convoy. Convoy OS 40 reached Freetown on 27 September 1942, but following convoys OS 41 and OS 42 dispersed at sea; and OS convoys were suspended by Operation Torch until convoy OS 43 left Liverpool on 14 February 1943. Convoy OS 46 was combined with convoy KMS 13 of ships detaching off Gibraltar with the <b>joint</b> <b>designation</b> OS 46/MKS 13. Sailings from Liverpool continued under the joint designations until convoy OS 130/KMS 105 on 27 May 1945; but, as the Mediterranean route became safe for Indian Ocean destinations, convoy OS 92/KMS 66 was the last to proceed as far as Freetown on 4 November 1944.|$|E

50|$|Epigraphical {{evidence}} {{points out}} to the tendency shown by Pisye's ancient inhabitants to expand their sphere of influence {{in the direction of}} the sea, the coast being quite near at a distance only about twenty kilometers to the south-east. By some time in the middle of the third century BC (between 275 and 225 BC) Pisye had joined part of the population of Pladasa, located near the Gulf of Akbük on the Gulf of Kerme (Ceramic Gulf) in a sympoliteia in which the identity of the partners remained preserved in the new, combined entity. The <b>joint</b> <b>designation</b> persisted as late as the first century AD. This union, which may have been related to the financial troubles Pladasa was having in the late 4th century BC, had allowed Pisye to gain a port and was possibly the continuation of absorption, in fuller form this time, by Pisye of two other entities, Koloneis and Londeis, whose territories lay between Pisye and Pladasa.|$|E

5000|$|The first Model 369 {{prototype}} flew on 27 February 1963. Originally {{designated as}} the YHO-6A according to the Army's designation system, the aircraft was re{{designated as the}} YOH-6A in 1962 when the Department of Defense created a <b>Joint</b> <b>designation</b> system for all aircraft. Five prototypes were built, fitted with a [...] Allison T63-A-5A, and delivered to the U.S. Army at Fort Rucker, Alabama to compete against the other ten prototype aircraft submitted by Bell and Fairchild-Hiller. During {{the course of the}} competition, the Bell submission, the YOH-4, was eliminated as being underpowered (it used the [...] T63-A-5). The bidding for the LOH contract came down to Fairchild-Hiller and Hughes. Hughes won the competition, and the Army awarded a contract for production in May 1965, with an initial order for 714 that was later increased to 1,300 with an option on another 114. Hughes's price was $19,860 per airframe, less engine, while Hiller's price was $29,415 per airframe, less engine. The Hiller design (designated OH-5A) had a boosted control system, while the Hughes design did not. This would account for some of the price difference. Hughes is reported to have told Jack Real that he lost over $100 million in building 1,370 airframes. It was reported that Howard Hughes had directed his company to submit a bid at a price below the actual production cost of the helicopter in order to secure this order, resulting in substantial losses on the U.S. Army deal, with the anticipation that an extended production cycle would eventually prove financially viable.|$|E
