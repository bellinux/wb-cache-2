5|$|Because of {{its design}} focus on player choice, Deus Ex has been {{compared}} with System Shock, a game that inspired its design.

5|$|The overall {{impression}} of space within the cockpit {{area and the}} <b>great</b> <b>degree</b> of visual sighting afforded by the Plexiglas panelling were regarded as positive factors, with one important provision in relation to weather conditions. Should either bright sunshine or rainstorms be encountered, the pilot's visibility could be dangerously compromised either by glare throwback or lack of good sighting.|$|E

50|$|A lack of {{community}} support {{resulted in an}} increased sense of alienation and a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> of apathy among police officers. A lack {{of community}} support and working in a larger populated community was {{associated with an increased}} sense of alienation and a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> of inactivity among police officers. An increased sense of alienation resulted in a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> of negative feelings and lethargy among police officers. The more police officers felt socially isolated from the community they served, the more they withdrew and the more negative they felt towards its citizens.|$|R

5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the <b>great</b> <b>degree</b> of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|Extravagant to a <b>great</b> <b>degree,</b> Ernest {{had many}} money {{troubles}} throughout his reign. In January 1848, Ernest visited {{his brother in}} the midst of political unrest in Germany. Upon his return, he also discovered unrest in Coburg. One of the many concerns related to finances. Although Ernest had a large inheritance, he also had frequent debts. There were increasing calls to nationalize most of his property. Indeed, Albert had to intervene at one point and spare his brother the embarrassment of losing one of his Coburg properties.|$|E
5|$|Garnering a <b>great</b> <b>degree</b> of {{attention}} from the Mighty Ducks' fanbase, Kariya's first public practice at Arrowhead Pond drew an attendance of 9,000, while 16,000 fans watched his first exhibition game. Due to the NHL lockout, resulting from a dispute between players and owners, his regular season debut was delayed until January 1995 and the campaign was shortened to 48 games. During the suspension, Kariya participated in a charity tournament held in Hamilton, Ontario, sponsored by the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA).|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to constitutional powers, governors {{also have a}} considerable degree of statutory authority. Most of the authority exercised by governors {{on a daily basis}} is derived from statute, giving the General Assembly a <b>great</b> <b>degree</b> of power to expand or contract the governor's authority. Historically, the party in control of the General Assembly would reassign control of agencies from the governor or to the governor based his party affiliation, and the party affiliation of the cabinet heads, which at times has left the governor with no direct control over state agencies.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the account's {{authenticity}} has been questioned {{is the fact that it}} claims St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law. Offler doubted that canon law had penetrated to England to any <b>great</b> <b>degree</b> in 1088. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of one of the basis of canon law, the False Decretals. The bishop's manuscript of the Decretals still survives.|$|E
5|$|Prog {{is based}} on fusions of styles, {{approaches}} and genres, involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any <b>great</b> <b>degree,</b> and {{only a handful of}} groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.|$|E

5|$|The mid-fifteenth century {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the private feuds of the nobility, and the Wars of the Roses in general. Devonshire, whilst experiencing none of the pitched battles, was still ravaged by a private feud. This was between Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon, whose family had been earls of that county since 1335 and William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville. Their feud became inextricably tied to the national political scene, but originated in regional Devon society. In 2003, historian Martin Cherry agreed that the south west was to a <b>great</b> <b>degree</b> lawless at this time. However, he suggested that the Bonville-Courtenay feud, whilst being the best-known, is not the sole example of political upheaval in the region, which was common throughout the century.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality {{after the}} outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter {{the war against the}} Central Powers with promises of territory acquisition in Italia irredenta. The Austro-Hungarian Navy, which had been Italy's primary rival for decades, was the primary opponent in the conflict. The Austro-Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across the narrow Adriatic Sea. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the narrow waters and numerous islands of the Adriatic allowed Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers to operate with a <b>great</b> <b>degree</b> of freedom. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. As a result, Iride did not see action during the war. She was sold for scrap in December 1920 and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

The author makes his assumptions on the basis of some fundamental issues of representatives of the school of the new institutional economists on the problem of information asymmetry like: O. Williamson, Arrow, Akerlof, Stiglitz and Weiss, Bester, Besanko and some others. The analysis also concerns some peculiar features of the small businesses that makes them in a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> affected by the uneven distribution of information and hence, in a <b>greater</b> <b>degree</b> affected by the problems of financing. ...|$|R
