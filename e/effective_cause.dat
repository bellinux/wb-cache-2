2500|$|Mahon's report, {{released}} on 27 April 1981, cleared {{the crew of}} blame for the disaster. Mahon said the single, dominant and <b>effective</b> <b>cause</b> of the crash was Air New Zealand's alteration of the flight plan waypoint coordinates in the ground navigation computer without advising the crew. The new flight plan took the aircraft directly over the mountain, rather than along its flank. Due to whiteout conditions, [...] "a malevolent trick of the polar light", the crew were unable to visually identify the mountain in front of them. Furthermore, they may have experienced a rare meteorological phenomenon called sector whiteout, which creates the visual illusion of a flat horizon far in the distance. (It {{appeared to be a}} very broad gap between cloud layers allowing a view of the distant Ross Ice Shelf and beyond.) Mahon noted that the flight crew, with many thousands of hours of flight time between them, had considerable experience with the extreme accuracy of the aircraft's inertial navigation system. Mahon also found that the radio communications centre at McMurdo Station had authorised Collins to descend to , below the minimum safe level.|$|E

60|$|That {{concern for}} his family, he believed, {{had been his}} chief motive in {{clinging}} to Lady Sunderbund's projects long after he had realized how little they would forward the true service of God. No doubt there had been moments of flattery, moments of something, something rather {{in the nature of}} an excited affection; some touch of the magnificent in her, some touch of the infantile,--both appealed magnetically to his imagination; but the real <b>effective</b> <b>cause</b> was his habitual solicitude for his wife and children and his consequent desire to prosper materially. As his first dream of being something between Mohammed and Peter the Hermit in a new proclamation of God to the world lost colour and life in his mind, he realized more and more clearly {{that there was no way}} of living in a state of material prosperity and at the same time in a state of active service to God.

60|$|There {{is still}} another and highly <b>effective</b> <b>cause,</b> {{leading to the}} mouth being opened, when we are astonished, and more {{especially}} when we are suddenly startled. We can draw a full and deep inspiration much more easily through the widely open mouth than through the nostrils. Now when we start at any sudden sound or sight, almost all {{the muscles of the}} body are involuntarily and momentarily thrown into strong action, for the sake of guarding ourselves against or jumping away from the danger, which we habitually associate with anything unexpected. But we always unconsciously prepare ourselves for any great exertion, as formerly explained, by first taking a deep and full inspiration, and we consequently open our mouths. If no exertion follows, and we still remain astonished, we cease for a time to breathe, or breathe as quietly as possible, in order that every sound may be distinctly heard. Or again, if our attention continues long and earnestly absorbed, all our muscles become relaxed, and the jaw, which was at first suddenly opened, remains dropped. Thus several causes concur towards this same movement, whenever surprise, astonishment, or amazement is felt.|$|E

Lonesome unknown Patch of Meadow, lying far amid peaty wildernesses in those Salzwedel regions: unknown to all writing mortals as yet; but which threatens, in this summer of 1729, to become famous as Runnymead among the Meadows of History! And the FIFTH cause--In short, there was no real [...] "cause" [...] of the least magnitude; the effect was produced by the combination of many small and imaginary ones. For if there is a will to quarrel, we know there is a way. And perhaps the FIFTH namable cause, in efficiency worth all the others together, might be found in the Debates of the Smoking Parliament that season, were the Journal of its Proceedings extant! We gather symptoms, indisputable enough, of very diligent elaborations and insinuations there; and conclude that to have been the really <b>effective</b> <b>cause.</b> Clouds had risen between the two Courts; but except for the Tobacco-Parliament, there never could have thunder come from them.|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} was whether that is permissible in law. The court referred to the English Court of Appeal case of Igbo v Johnson Matthey Chemicals Ltd. The court found that the terms of Mampeule's employment contract could not neatly be construed in isolation from SAPO's act of removing Mampeule from the Board. Effectively, had the Minister of Communications not removed Mampeule from the Board, his employment would not have terminated. The removal of Mampeule as a director triggered, proximately or effectively, the termination of his employment. The <b>effective</b> <b>cause</b> of termination of Mampeule's contract of employment was thus clearly the Minister's removal of him from SAPO's Board.|$|E
