25|$|In a very {{definite}} sense, {{we are all}} beneficiaries {{from the}} life of Fr. Kapaun. He has left us a stirring example of devotion to duty. He has passed on to us a spirit of tolerance and understanding. He has <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> share of dauntless bravery– of body and soul. He has transmitted to every one of us a new appreciation of America, and a keener, more realistic understanding of our country's greatest enemy– godlessness, now stalking the world in the form of communism. He has bequeathed a picture of Christ-like life. What Fr. Kapaun willed to us cannot be contained in memorials, however costly or beautiful. It is a treasure for the human soul– the spirit of one who loved and served God and man– even unto death.|$|E

Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E

This is evidenced by the episode's opening, a [...] "sexy" [...] look at the character Quake getting dressed. Executive producer Jeph Loeb added, [...] "what it does is give us the chance to tell different stories. The idea is some of the material might be more mature, there may be more grit, what we're doing might be darker. It certainly made a lot more sense when we wanted to introduce a character like Ghost Rider into this world." ...|$|E

500|$|Priestley {{contended that}} Walpole had {{fulfilled}} his early potential, unlike Compton Mackenzie, Gilbert Cannan and other promising young novelists of his generation. This view was not universal among critics: Walpole sometimes divided opinion. Writing of Walpole's Russian novels the contemporary critic and novelist Douglas Goldring commented, [...] "Russia {{has been the}} grave of many reputations; and our Napoleon of the drawing-room novel has fared no better than other would-be conquerors of that disconcerting land." [...] Goldring's complaint was that Walpole's Russian (and English) characters were clichéd stereotypes. The reviewer in Punch, by contrast, wrote, [...] "I consulted a Russian, who is very much alive, and received the opinion that, if Mr. Walpole has not succeeded in drawing the real average Russian, he has <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> type whose faults and virtues sound the keynote of the situation as it is to-day." [...] The Observer rated The Dark Forest as [...] "one of the finest novels of our generation".|$|E
500|$|The I EP {{contains}} a single, 21-minute song of complex arrangements {{and was a}} hint of the forthcoming album, 2005's Catch Thirtythree. The EP, which was never played live by the band, was written and recorded during jamming sessions of Haake and Thordendal. On Catch Thirtythree, Meshuggah again used eight-string guitars, but utilized programmed drums for the first time also for the release, with the exception of two songs from 2001's compilation Rare Trax. The album was self-produced by the band and was recorded at the studio that Meshuggah shares with Clawfinger. Hagström notes, [...] "The eight-strings really have <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> whole new musical vocabulary to work with. Part of it is the restrictions they impose: you really can't play power chords with them; the sound just turns to mush. Instead, we concentrated on coming up with really unusual single-note parts, new tunings and chord voicings. We wanted to get as far away from any kind of conventions and traditions as we could on the album, so the guitars worked out beautifully." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{has also}} been {{the fact that the}} {{composer}} did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what Schonberg termed [...] "a professional reevaluaton" [...] of Tchaikovsky's work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intent of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In a 1992 article, New York Times critic Allan Kozinn writes, [...] "It is Tchaikovsky's flexibility, after all, that has <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> sense of his variability.... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music—entertaining and widely beloved though it is—that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded {{in the context of the}} whole literature. The First Piano Concerto is a case in point. It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow." ...|$|E

[...] Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: [...] "The feeling I have now is that we can do anything". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car {{from the beginning of the}} season was a [...] "great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment". Räikkönen said that he was [...] "a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could have <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> better result but anyhow, that's racing". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{addresses}} {{the death of}} Dale Horvath, who is attacked and ripped open by a walker. Since writer Robert Kirkman felt that Dale epitomized a character of morality and humanity, much of [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] explores themes related to the declining morality of individuals during a catastrophic event. Kirkman proclaimed that Dale's death was a momentous occasion, ultimately marking {{a turning point for}} future development of The Walking Dead. [...] "Dale's character has been {{the heart and soul of}} the show," [...] he iterated. [...] "He's definitely the moral compass. He’s the guy that, more so than anyone, has been warning people to be careful how you let this world change you and monitoring what lengths people are going to survive. His loss is going to mean a great deal for all the characters in the show and is definitely going to represent a turn to a darker space. His death means a lot." [...] Kirkman added that it was difficult to release DeMunn from the cast. He stated: [...] "It’s heartbreaking to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's really <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> lot, these last two seasons on the show. It's been amazing to work with him and get to know him and he’s an awesome dude and we’re definitely going to miss him." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{critical}} {{reviews of}} the work came from scientists who objected to Bakker's looseness with scientific fact. The paleontologist Thomas Holtz noted that Bakker combined fauna in ways not directly supported by the fossil record; for example, several of the dinosaurs featured in the books lived millions of years after Utahraptor died out. Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that [...] "Raptor Red is an accurate portrayal only {{within the context of}} uncertainties over the reconstruction of fossil animals as living forms ... Bakker's postscript never really admits these uncertainties." [...] David B. Norman criticized the book as [...] "no more than a children's adventure story—and a rather poorly written one at that ... The merging of science and fantasy is at its worst in books like Raptor Red because none but the experts can disentangle fact from fiction; this type of nonsense turns an uninformed reader into a misinformed one." [...] Jay Ingram, from the Discovery Channel, published a rebuttal, saying, [...] "The most important point is that Bakker's portrayal of the dinosaurs in Raptor Red is vivid—vivid in a way few museum displays or factual accounts can be. And if it turns out in the long run that some of the speculation is unwarranted, who cares? Bob Bakker has <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> unique window onto the era of dinosaurs." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{generated}} {{some political}} controversy. Republican members of Congress {{complained about the}} film's obviously leftist politics, and demanded that Will H. Hays, President of the Motion Picture Production Code, establish guidelines regarding propagandization for the motion picture industry. Critical reaction {{at the time was}} mixed. While at least one reviewer felt the film was reminiscent of motion pictures like Citizen Kane and Rebecca, Hedda Hopper called it [...] "Citizen Kane with all the art scraped off". Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, concluded that while {{the first half of the}} film was very good, the latter half felt slow and failed to deliver emotional punch. Crowther called the film [...] "a courageous and timely drama" [...] and praised Tracy and Hepburn for performances that featured [...] "taut solemnity". But the script seemed uneven dramatically ("...the nature of this story is a murder mystery and yet the interest is centered much more upon the dead man than on the hunt"), and a critical problem was that the audience [...] "is informed much sooner than the journalist what the nature of Forrest was, and the story drags while we wait for the journalist to catch up." [...] Crowther still enjoyed Cukor's direction, which he felt sustained mystery even when little existed. Like Crowther, the Chicago Tribune and other critics pointed out that the picture seemed slow. The Hartford Courant, meanwhile, raved about the film: [...] "Hepburn and Tracy have <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> great film in Keeper of the Flame... Great because of the courage and daring it took to make it, the magnificent production it has been given, the excellent acting within it, and the exciting, tense story it contains." [...] Generally speaking, the film was better received in the eastern half of the United States.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It seems like there should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E
