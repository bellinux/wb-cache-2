As the producer Nominal Protection Coefficient (NPC) for both crops is less than 1, the burden of tax is indirectly imposed on the producer. The Nominal <b>Inputs</b> <b>Protection</b> Coefficient (NIPC) is greater than 1 for both tomato and cucumber; this means that an indirect taxed is imposed on producers in using <b>inputs.</b> The Effective <b>Protection</b> Coefficient (EPC) is less than 1, or government’s interventions come to producers harm.

40|$|The ongoing Energy Harvesting from Exercise Machines (EHFEM) {{project at}} Cal Poly San Luis Obispo seeks to provide {{renewable}} energy without {{the high cost}} of implementation by harvesting DC power generated on machines used for physical exercise. The EHFEM project consists of numerous subprojects that involve converting different types of exercise machines for power generation. This project specifically works by scaling the output voltage from an elliptical machine using a DC-DC converter and sending it through an Enphase Micro-inverter to feed AC power back to the power grid and minimize energy spending. As a subset of the much larger project, the design presented in this paper seeks to improve on a previously designed SEPIC topology for the project’s DC-DC converter by providing an <b>input</b> <b>protection</b> scheme. DC-DC converter circuits operate within set parameters regarding current and voltage at their input. Any input above the designed limits may adversely affect the circuit. Implementing an <b>input</b> <b>protection</b> circuit helps to prevent damage to the DC-DC converter in the off chance that inputs stray outside the designed operating range. This paper proposes a two stage <b>input</b> <b>protection</b> circuit to limit the input of the DC-DC converter to within its operational range of 5 V to 65 V. The first stage uses capacitive filtering and decoupling techniques to protect against overvoltage transients and smooth the DC signal. The second phase of protection deals with sustained overvoltages associated with the Enphase Micro-inverter’s start-up period where an open load appears across the DC-DC converter. The design operates without significant loss of energy when within the operating range, and, during overvoltage events, allows the DC-DC converter to remain in operation with a 65 V input. The device also minimizes fabrication costs to allow recovery of its initial production costs within 10 years of normal use and uses a minimal number of components without use of any excessively large components to facilitate an easy assembly and device installation...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Energy Harvesting from Exercise Machines (EHFEM) project {{seeks to}} harness the energy {{generated}} by people using exercise machines and deliver this energy to the electric grid [1]. The implementation consists of a protection system, DC-DC converter, and an inverter. This project involves redesigning the existing DC-DC <b>input</b> <b>protection</b> circuit and current limiter for the EHFEM project [2]. The DC-DC converter takes in the power from the exercise machines and converts it to a manageable voltage level for the inverter. Due to a problem where the inverter may overload the converter, a current limiter sets to limit the current between the two circuits [4]. The inverter demanding more current at a lower voltage than the DC-DC converter can provide causes this overload. The <b>input</b> <b>protection</b> circuit for the DC-DC converter presents another major component of the protection system. The DC-DC converter must operate within set input voltage and current parameters. Concurrent with this project, students Byung Yoo and Sheldon Chu have developed a new DC-DC converter design with an operational range of 6 V to 51 V [7]. This paper proposes a design for an overvoltage protection circuit to limit the input of Yoo’s and Chu’s DC-DC converter to within its operational range. The <b>input</b> <b>protection</b> circuit regulates the incoming voltage from the elliptical machine and filters out any high frequency transient responses with capacitive filtering to generate a smooth DC signal. The circuit also functions to divert excess voltage and current that accumulates during the Enphase Micro-inverter’s startup period where an open load appears across the DC-DC converter leading to an overvoltage level [3]. A current sense circuit ensures the output from the DC-DC converter to the inverter delivers only as much power as the inverter can convert [4]. The device maintains a minimal component count number and lacks any excessively large components permitting easy assembly and installation. The device operates with a minimal loss of energy and minimizes fabrication costs allowing for recuperation of initial production costs over 10 years of normal use...|$|E
