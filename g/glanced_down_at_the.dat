60|$|Now {{he merely}} <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cigar {{for a moment}} and then {{conveyed}} it to his lips.|$|E
60|$|After a while Ida {{lifted his}} right hand gently, and <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{battered}} knuckles and broken nails.|$|E
60|$|She broke off, and <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> big liner with cream-colored funnel {{that was}} slowly {{swinging}} across the stream.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will she?" [...] said James, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> solid boots, {{which the}} short bicycle skirt rather obtrusively exposed to view.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{woman is}} here," [...] replied the chief gravely, casting a brief <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{wrinkled}} old visage that nestled upon his breast--"my mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{one of the}} {{unpleasant}} things of the country," [...] responded Paul, with a little laugh. [...] "But how came you in it?" [...] with a <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spurs on the man's boots.|$|R
60|$|Courthorne <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> deerskin {{jacket and}} {{smiled as he}} {{straightened}} himself into a caricature of Winston's mounted attitude. It was done cleverly.|$|E
60|$|Laura hesitated, puzzled. Just {{then the}} Professor came cantering {{in with a}} bundle of grass in his hand. He <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Chinaman.|$|E
60|$|Maxwell next <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> negro pitifully, his {{forehead}} contracted {{and his lips}} firmly set, but he nodded abruptly when Dane spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|... "All will be right, dear," [...] said she, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fluffy yellow {{curls and}} tiny ear. [...] "There {{is still much}} to be done, but I think we may venture to order the trousseau." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{after a short}} pause--"Will {{you burn}} the village for vengeance?" [...] asked the Malay with a quick <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead Lascar who, {{on his face and}} with {{stretched}} arms, seemed to cling desperately to that earth of which he had known so little.|$|R
6000|$|Breathing hard, {{he looked}} them over one by one. [...] "You're a pretty bunch of citizens," [...] he said, with cutting contempt. [...] "You {{ought to be}} shot--every man jack of you!" [...] Then <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wounded gambler <b>at</b> his feet, he added: [...] "Some of you better take this whelp to a doctor. He needs help." ...|$|R
60|$|Philip {{opened his}} eyes aghast. But Frida <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dress with a glance of approbation. The stranger's frankness, though quaint, was really refreshing.|$|E
6000|$|... "The patient man {{lifted his}} head and looked at the flour-strewn walls. Then he <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor, but drew back with a slight tremor.|$|E
60|$|They <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl. Quest's eyebrows came {{together}} quickly. There were two blue marks upon her throat where a man's thumbs might have been.|$|E
60|$|Viewing {{the remains}} was {{considered}} a religious duty, and the men from outside, and even the boys from behind the smoke-house, felt constrained {{to come in and}} pass in shuddering horror before the still face whose breath did not dim the glass above it. Most of them hurried by the box with only a swift side <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> strange thing within.|$|R
6000|$|MISS GILPIN (indicating {{the chairs}} {{in front of}} the windows on the left, forward). Won't you gentlemen sit down? (Carmody grunts sullenly and plumps himself into the one nearest the door. Nicholls hesitates, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{suit-case}} he carries. Miss Gilpin turns to Eileen.) And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me---- (She turns toward the door in rear, centre.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] thought I, [...] "my {{friend the}} head chambermaid takes it easy here. Nice state for a carpet to be in, {{in one of}} <b>the</b> best {{bedrooms}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Gatliffe Arms." [...] Carpet! I had been jumping up on the bed, and staring up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> walls, but I had never so much as given a <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> carpet. Think of me {{pretending to be a}} lawyer, and not knowing how to look low enough! ...|$|R
60|$|The letter rustled {{slightly}} in her hand. I <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> flimsy blackened pages whose very handwriting seemed cabalistic, incomprehensible {{to the experience}} of Western Europe.|$|E
60|$|Lingard's eyes, {{that had}} been fixed aloft, <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dejected figure of the man sitting on the skylight. He seemed to {{hesitate}} for a minute.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new patent leathers which I was wearing. [...] "How on earth--" [...] I began, but Holmes {{answered}} my question {{before it was}} asked.|$|E
500|$|When Liz learns from Kenneth that NBC {{will have}} Green Week, she says [...] "Oh brother, are they {{actually}} {{going to do something}} this year or are they just going to put that stupid green peacock {{in the corner of the}} screen?", a reference to the NBC peacock symbol having a green logo design during Green Week. As a result of what Liz said, Kenneth breaks the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience, when he <b>glances</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> logo.|$|R
6000|$|He did not {{remember}} whether Ida or the others said anything to him; but they crept on again, almost immediately, clinging to the rock, and scarcely venturing to <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> climbing forest which now appeared to lie straight beneath them but very far away. A cold wind stung their faces, the rocks above rose higher, but there was, at least, no snow beneath their feet, and they moved on yard by yard, scarcely daring to breathe at times, until at length Kinnaird cried out {{in a voice that}} was hoarse with exultation: ...|$|R

60|$|He {{rose and}} wandered around the room, making murmured {{comments}} all the time. Presently {{he came back}} to the table and <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sheets of manuscript.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{panorama}} below, {{with its}} odd jumble of hideous buildings, softened {{here and there}} with wreaths of sunstained smoke, its great blots of ugliness irredeemable, insistent.|$|E
60|$|Alleyne, still {{standing}} in the stream, <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> graceful pink-and-white figure, the curve of raven-black hair, and the proud, sensitive face which looked up frankly and confidingly at his own.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your daughter,' {{said the}} other, {{when they had}} taken another silent turn to and fro, and, after {{standing}} for a moment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wall <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sea, had resumed their walk, 'is your only child, I know, Mr Meagles. May I ask you--in no impertinent curiosity, but because I have had so much pleasure in your society, may never in this labyrinth of a world exchange a quiet word with you again, and wish to preserve an accurate remembrance of you and yours--may I ask you, if I have not gathered from your good wife that you have had other children?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Hetty <b>glanced</b> <b>down,</b> flushing, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bedraggled dress. [...] "Larry," [...] {{she said}} softly. [...] "I couldn't marry you like this. I haven't one dollar in my pocket--and I am {{coming to you}} with nothing, dear." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ford {{said this}} {{with such an}} air of {{conviction}} and such a sober face that the Captain smiled. And <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time he <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> nervously <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new line of buttons on his chest.|$|R
60|$|While {{doing this}} he <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bed {{on which he}} had not slept that night. The hollow in the pillow made {{by the weight of}} Haldin's head was very noticeable.|$|E
60|$|Appleby set {{his lips}} as he <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> white face, {{and felt that}} this was true. Then his eyes grew a trifle dim as he laid his hand on Tonyâ€™s arm.|$|E
60|$|Wheeler <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> black {{mouth of}} the tunnel, on which the {{streaming}} radiance fell. He fancied that the river flowed into it, and the man's suggestion did not appeal to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know," [...] {{said the}} girl, {{constraining}} {{her voice to}} an effect of indifference and <b>glancing</b> carelessly <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sketch. [...] "The design might be improved; but I don't think those suggestions would do it." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{shift light}} {{is a warning}} lamp fitted to {{vehicles}} in order to indicate to the driver that maximum RPM has almost been reached. Ideally a shift lamp will illuminate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> engine speed beyond that which delivers the maximum BHP such that the BHP before and after shifting is the same. Accelerating the engine beyond this point is not conducive to rapid acceleration. In use a shift light allows the driver to judge the exact point that a gear change should be carried out without having to <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tachometer. This also increases safety for the driver by keeping his focus on <b>the</b> track <b>at</b> all times.|$|R
60|$|A <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sled {{with its}} canvas mail-bags was {{necessary}} to reassure him {{of the reality of}} those sixty days and the two thousand miles over the ice. As in a dream, he shook the hands that were thrust out to him. He felt a vast exaltation. Life was magnificent. He loved it all. A great sense of humanness and comradeship swept over him. These were all his, his own kind. It was immense, tremendous. He felt melting in the heart of him, and {{he would have liked to}} shake hands with them all at once, to gather them to his breast in one mighty embrace.|$|R
