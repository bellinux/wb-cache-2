5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
25|$|In {{my opinion}} {{the two great}} players were jealous of one another. There were times in the series when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{not so much a}} battle between England and Australia as a battle between Bradman and Hammond.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{called his}} {{scene at the}} end of the episode with The Smoking Man one of his {{favorite}} scenes he performed on the show. Rob Bowman was happy with the final product and said, [...] "I dug the script. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a good old-fashioned show, and people who didn't like 'Jose Chung's From Outer Space' would like 'Wetwired' because all the bad boys are back. A good clean steak-and-potatoes type of episode." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{not being}} signed to any MLB {{team for the}} 2008 season, Piazza {{announced}} his retirement on May 20, 2008, saying, [...] "After discussing my options with my wife, family and agent, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> time {{to start a new}} chapter in my life. <b>It</b> has <b>been</b> an amazing journey." ...|$|R
60|$|The sight was pathetic, {{and at this}} {{particular}} time <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> more than I could bear.|$|R

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, Wood {{received}} an offer by which he was seriously tempted: the Boston Symphony Orchestra invited him to become its musical director. He had been guest conductor of the Berlin and New York Philharmonic Orchestras, but he regarded the Boston orchestra as the finest in the world. Nonetheless, as he told Boult, [...] "it was hard to refuse, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a patriotic duty to remain in my own country, at the present moment." ...|$|E
500|$|All of {{a sudden}} it was kicking off, big time. Everyone started piling in, right in front of me... The only people not {{involved}} were [...] John Lukic, Tony Adams, David O'Leary and me... I went over to break things up... and spotted the cavalry coming over the half-way line, in the shape of O'Leary and Adams. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my job to head them off at the pass and moved in, instinctively grabbing Adams with one hand and thumping him with the other." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Now {{that that}} show is just humming and doing amazing {{business}} — it’s the #1 bestselling magic {{show in the}} world as far as ticket sales and the perception that people are experiencing and coming back to see it multiple times — <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in a great place and I could think about television again. Obviously, “Believe” will continue to evolve until its last performance because I always want to add new magic, I’m always tweaking and transforming it. I missed being on television, I had something new creatively to say, and Spike became the perfect home to do it." [...] Endemol purchased the foreign distribution rights for the show, and was the [...] "most-watched new original series [...] in more than 18 months" [...] according to The Hollywood Reporter.|$|E

60|$|This <b>was</b> well. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> so. <b>I</b> {{knew that}} her {{presence}} would have a disturbing influence on my studies, which were by that time nearly completed. <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> also, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> madness in me {{to fall in love}} with a girl whom I could not hope to marry for years, even if she were willing to have me at all, which I very much doubted.|$|R
500|$|We {{all know}} that steel making has been {{important}} to south Wales, just as slate making has changed {{the landscape of the}} north. We have to use a special type of steel that won't go rusty near to the salt-laden, maritime air of Cardiff Bay. This stainless steel will be made near to Pontypool. For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a [...] "natural" [...] texture, and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that we think of as more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1953–54 NBA season, the now 29-year-old Mikan slowly declined, {{averaging}} 18.1 points, 14.3 {{rebounds and}} 2.4 assists per game. Under his leadership, the Lakers won another NBA {{title in the}} 1954 NBA Finals, making it their third-straight championship and fifth in six years; the only time they lost had been when Mikan fractured his leg. From an NBA perspective, the Minneapolis Lakers dynasty has only been convincingly surpassed by the eleven-title Boston Celtics dynasty of 1957–69. At {{the end of the}} season, Mikan announced his retirement. He later said: [...] "I had a family growing, and I decided to be with them. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to get started with the professional world outside of basketball." [...] Injuries also were a factor, as Mikan had sustained 10 broken bones and 16 stitches in his career, often having to play through these injuries.|$|E
500|$|Her {{interest}} in acting sparked from watching her brother perform {{in a school}} production of The King and I when she was six. During rehearsals, she pleaded with his teachers to let her be in the play. They let her join the chorus. While enrolled in Woldingham School as a teen, she was heavily involved in theatre. She was the student head of the drama department there, performing in plays and musicals, conducting workshops with younger students, and helping put on productions. When she was 16, she attended a production of HenryV starring Kenneth Branagh. His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief {{that she wanted to}} pursue a career in acting. She wrote a letter to Branagh asking him for advice. [...] "I explained that my parents didn't want me to act, but that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my vocation in life," [...] she said. Branagh's sister replied: [...] "Kenneth says that if you feel such a strong need to be an actress, you must be an actress." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, Miss Clibborn, I understand! I'm afraid you've {{been very}} much upset. I {{wanted to tell you}} how sorry I was; but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> perhaps indelicate." ...|$|R

500|$|DJ Diplo {{introduced}} {{elements of}} Brazilian baile funk to [...] "Bucky Done Gun". Fellow composer-producer Richard X {{worked on the}} track [...] "Hombre", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on [...] "Galang", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song [...] "a more analogue sound" [...] than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as [...] "refreshing". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on the album, but was unable due to budget constraints and other artists' unfamiliarity with her work. She chose to perform all the vocals herself, saying, [...] "I just quietly got on with it... I didn't wanna convince anyone it was good. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> much better to prove that I could be an individual." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 23, 2008, Frazier {{verbally}} {{committed to}} the Penn State Nittany Lions basketball team. He said to Scout.com, [...] "I decided to be a Nittany Lion because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a great fit for me. Penn State has great academics {{as well as a}} great basketball team and that's what I was looking for." [...] Frazier also said that he had a [...] "great time" [...] on his official visit and all his relatives supported the decision. He received offers from various other schools across the country, including Bradley, Colorado State, New Mexico State, Santa Clara, Stanford, Stephen F. Austin, and UTEP. Frazier was also visited by San Diego, TCU, and Penn State, spanning from September to October 2008. After the move was made official, head coach Ed DeChellis said, [...] "We are very excited to have Tim join our program. He is a very fast, quick player with tremendous speed in the backcourt and a good shooter. He possesses the kind of athleticism that Stanley Pringle does. He can get in the lane and find open guys and is a great drive and kick passer and he can score. He is a very good on-the-ball defender and a tremendous athlete and we think he really solidifies our backcourt for the future." ...|$|E
500|$|On 25 October 2011, it was {{announced}} Bower would be leaving Neighbours in December 2011 {{to move into a}} new international role with FremantleMedia. Of her departure, Bower told Colin Vickery of the Herald Sun, [...] "I love Neighbours, it is a wonderful show and because of this <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important that fresh eyes and brains take over to keep this Australian icon contemporary. Having said that, I'm really excited about the new role and thank FremantleMedia for this wonderful opportunity." [...] Former City Homicide producer, Richard Jasek, took over Bower's role, while Alan Hardy took over the role of producer. On 4 December 2013, it was confirmed that Jasek would be leaving Neighbours and Jason Herbison had been promoted to series producer. FremantleMedia's head of drama Jo Porter became executive producer, while Laurence Wilson became the associate producer. The show celebrated its 7000th episode on 24 October 2014. In March 2015, Neighbours celebrated its 30th anniversary and twelve former cast members returned for the anniversary episodes that revolved around an Erinsborough Festival. Network Ten and Channel 5 aired a documentary special titled Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite, which featured interviews with current and former cast members, including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan and Guy Pearce, reflecting on their time on the show. Natalie Lynch succeeded Wilson as producer in early 2016.|$|E

2500|$|He stopped wearing {{virtually}} all his gold, {{one of his}} identifying marks, after helping with the cleanup after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He said, [...] "As a Christian, when I saw other people lose their lives and lose their land and property ... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> a sin before God for me to continue wearing my gold. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> insensitive and disrespectful {{to the people who}} lost everything, so I stopped wearing my gold." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> treachery. <b>I</b> {{thought of}} every {{conceivable}} explanation, {{and the most}} exalted and romantic confidence in her did not simply alternate, but mingled with the basest misgivings.|$|R
2500|$|Looking back {{seven years}} later, Lasseter told Variety: [...] "I was {{determined}} to bring back [...] because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> such a heritage of the Disney studio, and I love the art form ... I was stunned that Princess didn’t do better. We dug into it and {{did a lot of}} research and focus groups. It was viewed as old-fashioned by the audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the result}} of a misunderstanding, the second record was {{released}} before being cut down in a final edit that Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins had both intended to make. Perkins has said, [...] "t is far too long on each side. It's just a rough cut. [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> flabby, and I wanted to speed it up." [...] The Simon & Schuster Audioworks re-release of this LP was also abridged slightly from its original release. The scene with Ford Prefect and Hotblack Desiato's bodyguard is omitted.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2015, Khan stated {{his views}} at a popular online comedy group All India Bakchod for its celebrity Roast episode. He said, [...] "I {{completely}} believe in freedom of speech, no issues. But {{we have to}} understand that we all have a certain responsibility. When I heard what was being described to me <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a violent event." [...] He further said violence is not just physical but it has verbal aspects to it. Calling the roast a shameless act, Khan did not spare even his friends from the film industry Karan, Ranveer and Arjun.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. March fairly took Miss Triscoe in {{her arms}} to kiss her. [...] "Do you know <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> you, all the time! When did you come? Where is your father? What hotel are you staying at?" ...|$|R
30|$|Sabha: My friend left me alone. She told me: “Proceed by yourself”. But <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{very hard}} for me. Anyway, at night, I wrote the shown parts of the story on paper.|$|R

2500|$|Wright later {{claimed that}} his {{decision}} to join the YCV had {{been influenced by the}} Kingsmill massacre of January 1976, when ten local Protestant civilians were killed by republicans. Wright's cousin Jim Wright, future father-in-law Billy Corrigan, and brother-in-law Leslie Corrigan, were also killed by republicans in this period. Wright later said of the Kingsmill massacre, [...] "I was 15 when those workmen were pulled out of that bus and shot dead. I was a Protestant and I realised that they had been killed simply because they were Protestants. I left Mountnorris, came back to Portadown and immediately joined the youth wing of the UVF. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my duty to help my people and that is what I have been doing ever since." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{various other}} critics do, Michael Coveney is still asking: [...] "Yes, {{but what does}} it all mean? Kenneth Tynan railed against the 'gratuitous obscurity' of Harold Pinter's poetic 1975 play when it was first {{produced}} by Peter Hall at the National starring John Gielgud as the supplicant versifier Spooner and Ralph Richardson as his host Hirst, patron and supporter of the arts. But the play is always gloriously enjoyable as an off-kilter vaudeville of friendship and dependency." [...] In The Guardian, Billington concludes that [...] "This is a compelling revival much aided by Neil Austin's lighting and Adam Cork's subliminal sound," [...] observing: [...] "when audience and cast finally joined in applauding Pinter, [...] seated in a box, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in recognition of an eerily disturbing play that transports us into a world somewhere between reality and dream." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{relevant}} {{former prime}} ministers have supported an [...] "independent nuclear deterrent", including David Cameron and the incumbent Prime Minister Theresa May. Only one former Prime Minister, Lord Callaghan, has given any insight on his orders: Callaghan stated that, although {{in a situation}} where nuclear weapon use was required – and thus the whole purpose and value of the weapon as a deterrent had failed – he would have ordered use of nuclear weapons, if needed: ...if we had got to that point, where it was, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to do it, then I would have done it (used the weapon)...but if I had lived after pressing that button, I could have never forgiven myself. Lord Healey, Secretary of State for Defence and [...] "alternate decision-taker" [...] under Prime Minister Harold Wilson, said that in the event of Soviet nuclear weapons attacking the United Kingdom and the Prime Minister had been killed or incapacitated, he would not have ordered a retaliation.|$|E
