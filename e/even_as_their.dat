5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.|$|E
25|$|Most Egyptian deities {{were first}} worshipped by very local cults, and they {{retained}} those local centres of worship <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> popularity spread, so that most major {{cities and towns}} in Egypt were known {{as the home of}} a particular deity. However, the origins of the cult of Isis are very uncertain. In fact, Egyptologists such as Maria Münster and Jan Assmann point to the lack of archaeological evidences for a goddess 'Isis' before the time of the late Old Kingdom of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|This {{would suggest}} that the Bush tax cut policy was highly regressive, but some writers, notably at the Koch-funded Tax Foundation, argue that the concept of a {{progressive}} tax should be detached from its traditional association with income redistribution, noting that since the share of income of the most wealthy rose so much during the period, their share of the total tax burden went up <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> tax rates went down. Between 2003 and 2004, following the 2003 tax cuts, the share of after-tax income going to the top 1% rose from 12.2% in 2003 to 14.0% in 2004. (This followed the period from 2000 to 2002, where after-tax incomes declined the most for the top 1%.) At the same time, the share of overall tax liabilities of the top 1% increased from 22.9% to 25.3%,. In this way, they claim, the tax system actually became more progressive between 2000 and 2004.|$|E

500|$|Blaine Anderson is {{introduced}} in the episode [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] as the lead soloist of the Dalton Academy Warblers a cappella musical group. He meets Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), {{a member of the}} rival glee club New Directions. When Kurt asks if Blaine is gay, Blaine matter-of-factly says he is; Kurt tells Blaine that he is being bullied at school for being gay, and Blaine reveals that he too was harassed at his old school, so he transferred to Dalton Academy, which enforces a no-bullying policy. Blaine befriends Kurt, and helps him stand up to his tormentor, Dave Karofsky (Max Adler). When the threats and violence against Kurt reach a dangerous level, he transfers to Dalton Academy. He falls in love with Blaine, who is initially oblivious to Kurt's feelings <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> friendship grows. Blaine enlists Kurt's help to serenade his crush Jeremiah (Alexander Nifong), the assistant manager at a local Gap store. Jeremiah is subsequently fired and rebuffs Blaine. Kurt confesses his feelings, and Blaine tells Kurt that he cares for him, but is terrible at romance and does not want to risk damaging their friendship.|$|E
500|$|Radio Birdman {{broke up}} in June 1978 while touring the UK, where the early unity between bohemian, middle-class punks (many with art school backgrounds) and working-class punks had disintegrated. In {{contrast}} to North America, {{more of the}} bands from the original British punk movement remained active, sustaining extended careers <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> styles evolved and diverged. Meanwhile, the Oi! and anarcho-punk movements were emerging. Musically in the same aggressive vein as American hardcore, they addressed different constituencies with overlapping but distinct anti-establishment messages. As described by Dave Laing, [...] "The model for self-proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight-to-the-bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash.... It became essential to sound one particular way {{to be recognized as}} a 'punk band' now." [...] In February 1979, former Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious died of a heroin overdose in New York. If the Sex Pistols' breakup the previous year had marked the end of the original UK punk scene and its promise of cultural transformation, for many the death of Vicious signified that it had been doomed from the start.|$|E

The plants tend to wilt in hot temperatures, but quickly recover in the <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> flowers begin to open. They tolerate thrive in very fertile soils and average humidity.

On this schedule, most shows do not play on Monday and the shows and theatres {{are said to be}} [...] "dark" [...] on that day. The actors and the crew in these shows tend to regard Sunday evening through Tuesday <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> weekend. The Tony award presentation ceremony is usually held on a Sunday evening in June to fit this schedule.|$|R

'Men must endure their going hence, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> coming hither, ripeness is all.'" [...] De Chambrun describes how the W.H. theory originated. Thomas Thorpe, a [...] "pirate publisher", published a volume of Shakespeare's sonnets with the following inscription, [...] "To the onlie begetter of these [...] sonnets, Mr. W.H." [...] De Chambrun criticizes the initials and she {{does not believe in}} following the Herbertist (William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke in 1623) theory; rather she writes of [...] "graver critics" [...] seeing the letters standing for Will Hall, a trafficker of manuscripts and a favorite of Thorpe, the [...] "Piratical Publisher". De Chambrun continues, if the Earl of Pembroke, William Herbert, was Mr. W.H., then the critics who believe the dark lady to be Mary Fitton (known mistress) would be incorrect, because Mary Fitton was a blonde.|$|E

6000|$|But again, {{there are}} those, thank God, who have, or {{are at least}} trying to get, {{treasure}} in heaven, which they may carry away {{with them when they}} die, and keep for ever. And who are they? Those who are longing and trying to be true and to be good; who have seen how beautiful it is to be true and to be good; to know God and the will of God; to love God and the will of God; and therefore to copy His likeness and to do His will. [...] Those who long for sanctification, and who desire to be holy, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> Father in heaven is holy, and perfect, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> Father in heaven is perfect; and who therefore think, as St Paul bade them, of whatsoever things are just, true, pure, lovely, and of good report, if there be any true manhood, and if there be any just praise--in three words--who seek after whatsoever is true, beautiful, and good. These are they that have treasure in heaven. For what is really true, really beautiful, really good, is also really heavenly. God alone is perfect, good, beautiful, and true; and heaven is heaven because it is filled with the glory of His goodness, His beauty, and His truth. But wherever there is a soul on earth led by the Spirit of God, and filled by the Spirit of God with good and beautiful and true graces and inspirations, there is a soul which, as St Paul says, is sitting in heavenly places with Christ Jesus--a soul which is already in heaven though still on earth. We confess it by our own words. We speak of a heavenly character; we speak even of a heavenly countenance; and we speak right. We see that that character, though it be still imperfect, and marred by human weaknesses, is already good with the goodness which comes down from heaven; and that that countenance, though it may be mean and plain, is already beautiful with the beauty which comes down from heaven.|$|E
