Furthermore, <b>government</b> <b>services</b> are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province.

5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for <b>government</b> <b>services</b> available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E

5|$|Although French is an {{official}} language {{for the purposes}} of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be {{an official}} language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial <b>government</b> <b>services</b> in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.|$|E

5|$|A {{multitude}} of languages {{are used by}} Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians, respectively. Nearly 6.8million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some {{of the most common}} non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi (430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490). Canada's federal government practices official bilingualism, which is applied by the Commissioner of Official Languages in consonance with Section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Federal Official Languages Act English and French have equal status in federal courts, parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal <b>government</b> <b>services</b> in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.|$|E
5|$|English and French are {{recognized}} by the Constitution of Canada as official languages. All federal government laws are thus enacted in both English and French, with <b>government</b> <b>services</b> available in both languages. Two of Canada's territories give official status to indigenous languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government. In the Northwest Territories, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich'in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tłįchǫ. Multicultural media are widely accessible {{across the country and}} offer specialty television channels, newspapers and other publications in many minority languages.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Macdonald {{plunged into}} {{his role as}} a leading {{champion}} for the provinces. He argued that in order to maintain their independence, provinces needed exclusive jurisdiction over such sources of revenue as gasoline, electricity and amusement taxes. He lobbied for constitutional amendments designed to guarantee provincial rights. Macdonald urged the federal government to accept the 1940 recommendations of the Rowell-Sirois Commission and redistribute national wealth based on need. Such a policy, he maintained, would enable poorer provinces to sustain <b>government</b> <b>services</b> available {{in other parts of the}} country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation. In the end, Macdonald won only small victories such as gaining exclusive provincial access to gasoline taxes. The federal government refused to recognize financial need as the basis for provincial subsidies.|$|E

5|$|Other provinces have no {{official}} languages as such, but French {{is used as}} a language of instruction, in courts, and for other <b>government</b> <b>services,</b> in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures, and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official. There are 11 indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects. Of these, only the Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibway languages have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable to survive in the long term. Several indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories. Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut, and is one of three official languages in the territory.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 New Jersey state {{government}} shutdown {{was the first}} shutdown {{in the history of}} the U.S. state of New Jersey. The shutdown occurred after the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jon Corzine failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline. Furthermore, Corzine and the Legislature clashed on the issue of raising the state sales tax to help balance budget. Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Corzine ordered the shutdown as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget. The shutdown began at midnight on July 1, 2006, when Corzine called for an orderly shutdown of non-essential <b>government</b> <b>services,</b> which was followed by a second round of shutdowns three days later on July 4.|$|E
