5|$|Once {{the tour}} was over, Weinberg {{said he would}} {{continue}} to appear with his various own bands, including doing weddings and bar and bat mitzvahs <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> earlier in his career. He also liked to watch his son Jay play with Slipknot, although he conceded he did so from a safe zone where he would not get knocked down by the audience.|$|E
5|$|Bobby tells {{a fellow}} student, Lisa Baiocchi, {{that she must}} stand up to her {{overbearing}} father <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done with Phil. When Lisa returns home, a window explodes and a shadowy, arm-like appendage grabs her father by the throat after he demands she stop seeing Bobby. His lifeless body is discovered {{lying on the ground}} outside the house. Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed out of the window, Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out by an outside force. Later, the agents learn that Lisa is another one of Karin Matthews' patients.|$|E
5|$|Frank Stilwell {{had just}} arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup. Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At the {{preliminary}} hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let him stay," [...] said Amina, who {{had before}} proved herself his friend. [...] "It is only <b>just,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> given {{us so much}} amusement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Corny {{has been}} {{particularly}} lucky in having come to town <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has,</b> since we shall {{have a sort of}} gala-day, to-morrow, for the blacks and the children." ...|$|R
50|$|Dr. Emanuel Doremus: Medical Examiner for New York City. A cocky {{little man}} {{who wears a}} bowler hat and {{constantly}} complains (in a mock manner) about being called to check out corpses <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> sat down to a meal or is otherwise inconvenienced.|$|R
5|$|Unable to find Bruckman in the hotel, Mulder and Scully {{return to}} Bruckman's {{apartment}} {{to find that}} Bruckman has committed suicide; Scully sees a plastic bag has been tied around his head, {{and that he is}} clutching a bottle of pills in his hand. Scully sits on Bruckman's bed holding his hand, deeply moved, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> predicted. That night Scully sees a commercial for the Stupendous Yappi on TV, causing her to throw her phone at it.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{approved}} the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (see also Soviet–Afghan relations) <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> previously {{approved the}} Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. In both cases, Brezhnev {{was not the}} one pushing hardest for a possible armed intervention. Several leading members of the Soviet leadership decided to retain Brezhnev as General Secretary so that their careers would not suffer by a possible leadership reshuffling by his successor. Other members, who disliked Brezhnev, among them Dmitriy Ustinov (Minister of Defence), Andrei Gromyko (Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Mikhail Suslov (Central Committee Secretary), feared that Brezhnev's removal would spark a succession crisis, and so they helped {{to maintain the status}} quo.|$|E
50|$|Harmony is {{restored}} {{to just about}} everyone. Anandam, in tragicomic irony, is suddenly transferred away to Dindigul <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> found a job for his wife in Chennai. His wife now takes {{his place in the}} apartment and writes to him every week.|$|R
6000|$|... "He caught 'im up <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>'ad</b> undone {{the front}} door, and, {{catching}} hold of 'im {{by the back}} o' the neck, shook 'im till 'e was tired.

6000|$|... "Yes; I saw {{him off to}} England {{four days}} ago. I hope {{that he will be}} able to rejoin before long, but it is not certain yet that the wound won't bring on {{permanent}} lameness. I am very anxious about it, especially <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> now got his step, and it would be awfully hard on him to leave the service <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> got field-officer's rank." ...|$|R
5|$|Murray {{took the}} first set on a {{tie-break}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done in the US Open final the previous year, and while the second set followed a similar pattern with no breaks of serve, this time Djokovic took the tie-break. One break of serve in the eighth game (two hours and 52 minutes into the contest) was enough for Djokovic to take the third set before taking the fourth 6–2 comfortably against a tired-looking Murray, who needed four hours to defeat Federer in the semifinal just two days before. The match lasted three hours and 40 minutes and four sets. By winning Djokovic won his sixth Grand Slam tournament title to tie him with greats such as Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, whereas Murray equalled Edberg's feat of three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open.|$|E
5|$|On November 15, {{near the}} end of the Battle of Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting of the Military Affairs Commission's Supreme National Defense Council to {{undertake}} strategic planning, including a decision on what to do in case of a Japanese attack on Nanking. Here Chiang insisted fervently on mounting a sustained defense of Nanking. Chiang argued, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> during the Battle of Shanghai, that China would be more likely to receive aid from the great powers, possibly at the ongoing Nine Power Treaty Conference, if it could prove on the battlefield its will and capacity to resist the Japanese. He also noted that holding onto Nanking would strengthen China's hand in peace talks which he wanted the German ambassador Oskar Trautmann to mediate.|$|E
5|$|After this turmoil, Severus faced no more {{internal}} threats for {{the rest}} of his reign, and the reign of his successor Caracalla passed uninterrupted for a while until he was murdered by Macrinus, who proclaimed himself emperor. Despite Macrinus having his position ratified by the Roman senate, the troops of Varius Avitus declared him to be emperor instead, and the two met in battle at the Battle of Antioch in 218 AD, in which Macrinus was defeated. However, Avitus himself, after taking the imperial name Elagabalus, was murdered shortly afterwards and Alexander Severus was proclaimed emperor by both the Praetorian Guard and the senate who, after a short reign, was murdered in turn. His murderers were working on behalf of the army who were unhappy with their lot under his rule and who raised in his place Maximinus Thrax. However, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been raised by the army, Maximinus was also brought down by them and despite winning the Battle of Carthage against the senate's newly proclaimed Gordian II, he too was murdered when it appeared to his forces as though he would not be able to best the next senatorial candidate for the throne, Gordian III.|$|E
50|$|A more {{familiar}} version of Eurytus' death involves a feud with Heracles. Eurytus promised {{the hand of}} his daughter Iole to whoever who could defeat him and his sons in an archery contest. Heracles won the archery contest, but Eurytus reneged on his promise, fearing that Heracles would go mad and kill any children <b>he</b> <b>had</b> with Iole, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> slew the children <b>he</b> <b>had</b> with Megara.|$|R

5|$|The two {{return to}} the museum where Burton makes a ridiculous attempt to seduce Zero to ensure his participation. Rejecting his advances, Zero {{examines}} {{some of the other}} exhibits (including displays on Typhoid Mary and the Tuskegee syphilis study) before finding an African green monkey, another suspected early AIDS vector. The monkey (Marla Lukofsky) angrily denounces Zero for scapegoating her <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been scapegoated. Zero turns to Burton and they make love.|$|R
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
5|$|Danilo Di Luca made {{it clear}} that he was aiming for the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both at the finish line and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E
25|$|In the D-Day {{landings}} of June 1944, Sykes camouflaged snipers {{and made}} screens to block enemy sight lines, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done at Tobruk. The violent scenes {{made an impression}} on him which he sought to recreate in paintings and drawings.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{outside the}} Keep, Stump has {{fallen into a}} hole, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done twice before, taking Loogie with him. On {{the wall of the}} Keep, Susti {{suggests}} a way to end the conflict without any other blood being spilled and offers to make Groan the King of Phlegm. Groan and Phew both agree and Groan becomes King, Gordo becomes the new chief of the Phlegmian guard and Gape becomes Phlegm's chief of trade.|$|R

25|$|With the 1965 {{publication}} of Le mandat, précédé de Vehi-Ciosane (The Money Order and White Genesis), Sembène's emphasis began to shift. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> once vociferously attacked the racial and economic oppression {{of the colonial}} government, with this pair of novellas, he turned his sights on the corrupt African elites that followed.|$|E
25|$|Nineteen {{years after}} Voldemort’s defeat, Hagrid {{is still at}} Hogwarts and invites Harry and Ginny Weasley's second son Albus Severus Potter to his hut for tea, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> once done for Harry himself.

25|$|Once again Brian {{opted for}} reconciliation; he {{requested}} Sigtrygg {{to return and}} resume his position as ruler of Dublin, giving Sigtrygg the hand {{of one of his}} daughters in marriage, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> with the Eoganacht King, Cian. It may have been on this occasion that Brian married Sigtrygg's mother and Máel Mórda's sister Gormflaith, the former wife of Máel Sechnaill.|$|E
50|$|We {{are unsure}} what Antoine {{has done with}} his life; we know, however, that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{fulfilled}} his childhood ambition: to marry a haidresser. The reality proves to be every bit as wonderful as the fantasy and the two enjoy an enigmatic, enclosed and enchanting relationship. The final sequence shows Antoine, in the salon, dancing to Eastern music <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done throughout his life. His last line is the enigmatic comment that the hairdresser will return.|$|R
50|$|Léogâne, Haiti: The Carters {{and even}} more volunteers {{returned}} to Christianville and Léogâne to build houses alongside workers from Haven, an Irish nonprofit. On Sunday morning, President Carter held Sunday school in the mess tent for the volunteers, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> for years in Plains.

25|$|Despite rumours of a comeback, Trot Mondial was Varenne's last race.

The 15 races and 14 wins in 2002 took Varennes' tally up to 62 career victories, 6 seconds, and 2 thirds from 73 starts. With US$5,919,961 (€6,035,665) earned, Varenne is the richest trotter ever.|$|E
25|$|In September 1940, {{shortly after}} Phan Bội Châu's death, Japan {{launched}} its invasion of French Indochina, mirroring its ally Germany's conquest of metropolitan France.

As far as Vietnamese nationalists were concerned, this was a double-puppet government. Emperor Bảo Đại collaborated with the Japanese, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> with the French, ensuring his lifestyle could continue.|$|E
