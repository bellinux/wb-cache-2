500|$|Lopez {{began working}} on a [...] "collection of songs" [...] in 2011, unaware {{of what she was}} [...] "going to do with them". At the time, she was {{deciding}} whether she wanted to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album. Lopez stated that {{when it comes time to}} make an album, she doesn't sit down and write for the entire thing. She revealed that she is always working on new music and that her albums [...] "happen organically" [...] when she has recorded enough material. Lopez explained: [...] "I don't ever stop. I keep going with it. These records, like 'Follow the Leader,' [...] they just kind of came about. It wasn't something like, 'Oh, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and make a record right now.'" [...] Among the songs she recorded, two were chosen to be included on Dance Again... The Hits: [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "Goin' In".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1996, Iowa coach Hayden Fry {{told reporters}} that he had hired a new {{defensive}} coordinator and added, [...] "I don't anticipate Milan being back. Un-unh." [...] The following day, Vooletich told reporters {{he wanted to stay}} at Iowa, but that seemed unlikely based on Fry's comment. [...] Vooletich {{said he did not know}} what was going on: [...] "I'll be damned if I know. [...] He might think I'm looking for a job, but I'm not. [...] I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and talk with him and find out what the hell is going on. ... This has just devastated me." [...] Several days later, Vooletich announced his resignation saying, [...] "I've enjoyed my tenure at Iowa" [...] and adding, [...] "I'll leave Iowa with nothing but good memories." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the future}} of Savatage, {{frontman}} Jon Oliva explained, [...] "As far as that goes, the whole Wacken thing came up, and I was, like, you know what? If we're going to do anything, {{we have to do}} it now. I don't want to do it when I'm 60 years old. I mentioned that to Paul. He said to me, 'We're going to do the Wacken thing, but let's just wait until the winter tour is over and then you and me we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in January and discuss what we're going to do.'" [...] Oliva also said that Savatage has [...] "already gotten offers" [...] to play in [...] "certain areas of the world, America being one, Greece, South America, places like that", and added that he does not rule out the possibility of any more shows. Though Oliva said he does not know what the future holds for Savatage, he said, [...] "I just wish that everything works out good and then we'll see what happens down the road. I'll never say no to anything anymore, because every time I do, I get rained on." ...|$|E

"Yes, {{better quality}} nor any you're like to carry; you've got nothing first-rate but brazenness, I'll be bound," [...] said Mrs. Glegg, with a triumphant {{sense of her}} insurmountable sagacity.

5000|$|On October 21, 1994, she was {{appointed}} as Minister of Labour, replacing the retiring Robert W. Mackenzie. Opposition critic Steve Mahoney {{argued that the}} appointment placed her in {{a conflict of interest}} due to her past injury. Coppen who arrived at the swearing in ceremony in a wheelchair said, [...] "I do understand what people have to go through to get approved for a disability pension." [...] She dismissed the criticism. [...] "I just got sworn in 10 minutes ago. Let's be realistic. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and start Monday morning," [...] she said. Rae derided the criticism as well. He said, [...] "If you followed their (Liberal) logic, the minister of veterans' affairs couldn't be a veteran, couldn't be receiving a veteran's pension." ...|$|R
2500|$|Described by Gomez as [...] "a {{beautiful}} {{start to}} the album", [...] "Good for You" [...] was the third song she received since signing with her new label Interscope Records, as well the second track to be recorded for the album. It was uninterruptedly recorded in 45 minutes at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California; during the process, Gomez's vocals featured cracks as the song [...] "took on this emotion [...] didn't realize [...] could tap into", and {{at the beginning of}} the session she was exhausted from pressurizing herself for a sound and concept for the album. According to her, this recording had no beat and was [...] "just a skeleton of a song". There was also no specific sound planned for the song at the time although it was suggested that its soft melodies be made more pop-indebted which Gomez disagreed with, believing it would take away from her vocal. She was entirely involved in the song's creative direction, providing additional songwriting, and helped to develop it to represent her process of self-realization, her confidence as a young woman, and feelings of vulnerability. The song also formed part of a process in which she wanted to portray her story as an artist and as part of a transitional album over which she would take full control. In an interview for MTV, she said this was her time [...] "to embrace who I am, and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in a chair and talk about something that doesn't mean anything to me anymore" [...] and spoke about her involvement in the track: [...] "This is the most I've been creatively involved from the writing process ... every single thing I'm even remotely singing about is something I've related to and something I'm hitting the nail on, and I had to pick what was going to represent the album and who I am as a whole".|$|E

50|$|<b>To</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> or an even {{stronger}} signal, <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with the back turned towards someone - for instance the owner - has a very calming effect.
