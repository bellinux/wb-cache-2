However, he says he found himself enjoying it [...] "about halfway through" [...] and said [...] "it was a real pleasure to see Peter Bowles and Penelope Keith, for both of whom <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>great</b> affection, once again sparring on the small screen". Julius finished his review by commenting [...] "Not that I'm saying I'd like {{a whole series of}} it but as a one-off event it was surprisingly welcome".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the early}} guided summiters, Richard Bass (of Seven Summits fame) responded in an {{interview}} about Everest climbers and {{what it took to}} survive there, [...] "Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains. People don't realise the difference between a 20,000-foot mountain and 29,000 feet. It's not just arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate—an exponential curve. People climb Denali [...] or Aconcagua [...] and think, 'Heck, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>great</b> up here, I’m going to try Everest.' But it's not like that." ...|$|E

6000|$|I presume {{you would}} wish that {{constituent}} body {{to consist of}} artists, though you {{are not prepared to}} say precisely how they should be selected?--I should like the constituent body to consist both of artists and of the public. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>great</b> difficulties in offering any suggestion as to {{the manner in which the}} electors should elect: but I should like the public as well as artists to have a voice, so that we might have the public feeling brought to bear upon painting as we have now upon music; and that the election of those who were to attract the public eye, or direct the public mind, should indicate also the will of the public in some respects; not that I think that [...] "will" [...] always wise, but I think you would then have pointed out in what way those who are teaching the public should best regulate the teaching; and also it would give the public itself an interest in art, and a sense of responsibility, which in the present state of things they never can have.|$|E
6000|$|During the {{remainder}} of this year, B.C. 59, Cicero was at Rome, and seems gradually to have become aware that a personal attack was to be made upon him. At the close of a long and remarkable letter written to his brother Quintus in November, he explains the state of his own mind, showing us, who have now before us the future which was hidden from him, how greatly mistaken he was as to the results which were to be expected. He had been telling his brother how nearly Cato had been murdered for calling Pompey, in public, a Dictator. Then he goes on to describe his own condition.[264] [...] "You may see from this what is the state of the Republic. As far as I am concerned, it seems that friends will not be wanting to defend me. They offer themselves in a wonderful way, and promise assistance. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>great</b> hope and still greater spirit--hope, which tells me that we shall be victors in the struggle; spirit, which bids me fear no casualty in the present state of public affairs."[265] But the matter stands in this way: [...] "If he"--that is, Clodius--"should indict me in court, all Italy would come to my defence, so that I should be acquitted with honor. Should he attack me with open violence, I should have, I think, not only my own party but the world at large to stand by me. All men promise me their friends, their clients, their freedmen, their slaves, and even their money. Our old body of aristocrats"--Cato, Bibulus, and the makers of fish-ponds generally--"are wonderfully warm in my cause. If any of these have heretofore been remiss, now they join our party from sheer hatred of these kings"--the Triumvirs. [...] "Pompey promises everything, and so does Cæsar, whom I only trust so far as I can see them." [...] Even the Triumvirs promise him that he will be safe; but his belief in Pompey's honesty is all but gone. [...] "The coming Tribunes are my friends. The Consuls of next year promise well." [...] He was wofully mistaken. [...] "We have excellent Prætors, citizens alive to their duty. Domitius, Nigidius, Memmius, and Lentulus are specially trustworthy. The others are good men. You may therefore pluck up your courage and be confident." [...] From this we perceive that he had already formed the idea that he might perhaps be required to fight for his position as a Roman citizen; and it seems also that he understood the cause of the coming conflict. The intention was that he should be driven out of Rome by personal enmity. Nothing is said in any of these letters of the excuse to be used, though he knew well what that excuse was to be. He was to be charged by the Patrician Tribune with having put Roman citizens to death in opposition to the law. But there arises at this time no question whether he had or had not been justified in what he, as Consul, had done to Lentulus and the others. Would Clodius be able to rouse a mob against him? and, if so, would Cæsar assist Clodius? or would Pompey who still loomed to his eyes as the larger of the two men? He had ever been the friend of Pompey, and Pompey had promised him all manner of assistance; but he knew already that Pompey would turn upon him. That Rome should turn upon him--Rome which he had preserved from the torches of Catiline's conspirators--that he could not bring himself to believe! ...|$|E
