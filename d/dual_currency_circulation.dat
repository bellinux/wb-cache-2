40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this paper is}} to model the daily series of <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation</b> in Turkey. The <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation</b> is one of the most {{significant}} factors influencing the liquidity of the Turkish banking system. Therefore, the amount of <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation</b> has to be forecasted as accurately as possible. The <b>currency</b> in <b>circulation</b> displays an increasing long-term trend and strong seasonal factors which can be forecasted. This paper introduces the ARIMA-based approach to model seasonality in daily time series and evaluates the forecasting performance of the model. The results indicate that the forecasting performance of the model is better than the expert judgments both in the short-term and the long-term. <b>Currency</b> in <b>circulation,</b> Liquidity management, Time series models, Seasonality...|$|R
