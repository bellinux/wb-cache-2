60|$|She looked {{with her}} wide, steady eyes full at Loerke. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and averted his face.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and made}} her a deep obeisance, lest she should see the {{satisfaction}} and triumph which shone through his pity.|$|E
60|$|Letting go {{his hold}} of the satchel <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> leaped forward with full force, {{striking}} the officious stranger full in the stomach.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be it so," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and sitting}} {{down on a}} carronade, {{in order to avoid}} the gaze of those who {{surrounded}} him.|$|R
60|$|Beholding a female, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> horrid <b>head,</b> cocked <b>his</b> tail, {{and made}} at her. This {{it was that}} drew from poor Miss Lillycrop a yell such as she had not uttered {{since the days of}} infancy.|$|R
50|$|Breeding peaks late in wet {{season and}} in the dry season. When the male {{displays}} for the female, <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> down, stretches forward, and then rhythmically swings <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up and down while simultaneously wagging his fanned tail. Although the female does most direct brooding, both parents help raise the young. The female usually lays a single white egg in a well-built tree nest of stems, sticks, and palm leaves. In the weeks before she lays the egg, the male brings nesting material to the female. The egg is incubated around 30 days. The young leave the nest when they are still much smaller than their parents, but are actively tended to {{for a total of}} 13 weeks.|$|R
60|$|Aaron {{looked at}} Jim, then at her, and smiled slowly, with remote bitterness. Then <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again. His hands were loosely clasped between his knees.|$|E
60|$|The mighty tusker {{turned at}} the sound of his falling body, and, seeing only the easy prey of a young ape, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and charged madly at the {{surprised}} youth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I'm {{sorry for}} you. I'm that sorry for you!' she cried impulsively, and took Dick's hands. Mechanically, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{as if to}} kiss--she {{was the only woman}} who had taken pity on him, and he was not too proud for a little pity now. She stood up to go.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Horta stood {{motionless}} facing the ape-man. His wicked, deep-set eyes flashed angrily. <b>He</b> shook <b>his</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sunni Muslims {{believe that}} Isa will descend on Mount Afeeq, {{on the white}} Eastern Minaret of Damascus. He will descend from the heavens with his hands resting on the {{shoulders}} of two angels. His cheeks will be flat and his hair straight. When <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> it will seem as if water is flowing from his hair, when he raises <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> it will appear as though his hair is beaded with silvery pearls. He will descend during Fajr (sunrise) and the leader of the Muslims will address him thus, [...] "O' Prophet of God, lead the prayer."Isa will decline with the words, [...] "The virtue of this nation that follows Islam is that they lead each other." [...] Implying that he will pray behind the imam (the man that leads the prayings (Mahdi)) as the word of God was completed after revelation of Qur'an and Muhammad being the last prophet of God.|$|R
5000|$|Atticus Shaffer as Brick Ishmael Heck, {{youngest}} of Mike and Frankie's children. He loves {{to read and}} is very intelligent, but is also introverted, odd, and often easily distracted. Occasionally, while speaking, <b>he</b> will <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and repeat the last word spoken in an audible whisper. In season 1, Brick was starting second grade. He is a freshman in high school as of the season 8 premiere.|$|R
60|$|Crusoe obeyed at once. Whatever mistake {{there might}} be, there was evidently none in that command; so <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and tail humbly, and trotted {{on with his}} master; but he perpetually turned {{his head as he}} went, first on this side and then on that, to look and wonder at Charlie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{sorry for}} you. I'm that sorry for you!" [...] she cried impulsively, and took Dick's hands. Mechanically, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{as if to}} kiss--she {{was the only woman}} who had taken pity on him, and he was not too proud for a little pity now. She stood up to go.|$|E
60|$|His rage {{had become}} an almost equally {{consuming}} passion with his hunger, so that now, as his delicate nostrils apprised him of the recent passage of man, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and rumbled forth a thunderous roar, and at a swift walk, careless of the noise he made, set forth upon the trail of his intended quarry.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this point}} the {{endurance}} of Jack Molloy failed him, and he also [...] "went in" [...] for violent action! But Jack was a genius {{as well as a}} sailor, and profited by the failures of his comrades. Instead of making futile efforts to break his bonds like them, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> hairy <b>head,</b> and, with a howl and a tremendous rush, like a fish-torpedo, launched himself, or, as it were, took [...] "a header," [...] into the fiery man! ...|$|R
50|$|Helius and Windegger draw straws to see {{who must}} stay and Windegger loses. Seeing Windegger's anguish, Helius decides to drug Windegger and Friede with a last drink {{together}} and take Windegger's place, letting Windegger return to Earth with Friede. Friede senses that something is in the wine. She pretends to drink and then retires to the compartment where her cot is located, closes and locks the door. Windegger drinks the wine, becoming sedated. Helius makes Gustav his confidant and the new pilot for the ship. Helius counts down {{the time for the}} ship's liftoff from a distance away. He watches it depart and a stricken look crosses his face as he realizes that he is alone on the moon. As <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and resignedly starts to move towards the survival camp originally prepared for Windegger, Helius discovers that Friede has decided to stay with him on the moon. He throws his arms wide like a child seeking to be held and Friede runs to him. They embrace and Helius weeps into her shoulder while Friede strokes his hair and whispers words of comfort to him.|$|R
500|$|Apart {{from his}} up-tempo and {{aggressive}} style of play, Ginóbili {{is known for}} his clutch play. This is documented by his numerous European league MVP awards, and his performances in San Antonio's championship-winning campaigns. Ginóbili's modus operandi however, causes concerns for some of his opponents. His go-to move is either a 3-pointer or a fierce attack to the basket, while <b>he</b> often <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> when driving to the basket to collapse defenses and create shots or passes to his teammates. [...] Although Ginobili was not the originator or the first to bring the move to the NBA, he is credited for popularizing the Euro step in the league.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the eyes}} of Paradise lit up: <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> made a rush, balked himself purposely, and darted at Cashel. There was a sound like the pop of a champagne-cork, after which Cashel was seen {{undisturbed}} {{in the middle of}} the ring, and Paradise, flung against the ropes and trying to grin at his discomfiture, showed his white teeth through a mask of blood.|$|E
60|$|Again {{he swung}} his sword in that {{favourite}} stroke of his; but this time I caught the edge upon my mace, and ere he could recover I aimed a blow straight at his face. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> like a bull {{on the point of}} charging, and so my blow descended again upon his morion, but with a force that rolled him, senseless, from the saddle.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and rested}} his aching brow against her cool, white hand. She did not {{withdraw}} it, {{for a great}} joy had suddenly filled her heart, mingling with its sadness, {{a sense of security}} and of bitter, yet real, happiness pervaded her whole being: a happiness which she could not--wished not--to explain, but which prompted her to stoop yet further towards him, and to touch his hair with her lips.|$|E
60|$|The {{scene is}} {{the blue and}} white {{room in the house}} of the Misses Susan and Phoebe Throssel in Quality Street; and in this little country town there is a {{satisfaction}} about living in Quality Street which even religion cannot give. Through the bowed window at the back we have a glimpse of the street. It is pleasantly broad and grass-grown, and is linked to the outer world by one demure shop, whose door rings a bell every time it opens and shuts. Thus by merely peeping, every one in Quality Street can know at once who has been buying a Whimsy cake, and usually why. This bell is the most familiar sound of Quality Street. Now and again ladies pass in their pattens, a maid perhaps protecting them with an umbrella, for flakes of snow are falling discreetly. Gentlemen in the street are an event; but, see, just as we raise the curtain, there goes the recruiting sergeant to remind us {{that we are in the}} period of the Napoleonic wars. If he were to look in at the window of the blue and white room all the ladies there assembled would draw themselves up; they know him for a rude fellow who smiles at the approach of maiden ladies and continues to smile after they have passed. However, <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to-day so that they shall not see him, his present design being converse with the Misses Throssel's maid.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not long}} before the hyaenodon's leg was {{sufficiently}} mended to permit him to rise and hobble about on three legs. I shall never forget with what intent interest I watched his first attempt. Close at my hand lay my pile of rocks. Slowly the beast came to his three good feet. <b>He</b> stretched himself, <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and lapped water from the drinking-shell at his side, turned and looked at me, and then hobbled off toward the cliffs.|$|R
5000|$|When Heyward was [...] "12 or 13," [...] {{according}} to his son, Cameron Heyward, a defensive lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers writing for the Players' Tribune, {{he was at the}} Boys & Girls Club in Passaic, New Jersey, when another boy approached him and ultimately broke a pool cue over Heyward's head. Heyward barely flinched, and after relating the story later, his grandmother called him [...] "Ironhead," [...] and the nickname stuck.Heyward carried the nickname through Passaic High School, where it also became a reference to his wild-man strength {{and the fact that he}} had to wear a hat size of 8¾. Heyward's obituary in The New York Times made an additional reference; that in street football games <b>he</b> would <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into the stomach of the tackler and one opponent said it hurt so much that Heyward's head must be made of iron.|$|R
60|$|This cry {{fell into}} {{the silence of the}} room with strangely little effect. Only the doctor, {{crumbling}} up a piece of bread, with his head inclined on one side, raised his face, and the few long hairs sticking out of his shaggy eyebrows stirred in a slight frown. Dr. Monygham thought quite sincerely that Decoud was a singularly unworthy object for any woman's affection. Then <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again, with a curl of his lip, and his heart full of tender admiration for Mrs. Gould.|$|E
6000|$|I saw, {{felt all}} this in one {{flashing}} instant. And as swiftly my spirit changed. What I might have done I never knew, but most likely I would have shot him through the brain. Only a sudden action of the stag paralyzed all my force. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He saw me. And dying, with lungs and heart and bowels shot to shreds, he edged his stiff front feet toward me, he dragged his afterquarters, he slid, he flopped, he skittered convulsively at me. No fear in the black, distended, wild eyes! ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{speaking}} <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and charged}} like a buffalo. Fair {{in the middle}} he caught that white man, causing him to double up, fly backwards and land with a most resounding splash in the deepest part of the muddy sluit. Here I may remark that, as his shins are the weakest, a Hottentot's head {{is by far the}} hardest and most dangerous part of him. Indeed it seems to partake of the nature of a cannon ball, for, without more than temporary disturbance to its possessor, I have seen a half-loaded wagon go over one of them on a muddy road.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female <b>he</b> often <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|R
60|$|As {{they moved}} on thus slowly they noticed a man {{standing}} upon the upper steps {{of one of these}} stairs. His back was toward them; and, as their eyes fell upon him he stepped upon the upper sidewalk. He was walking with a cane which seemed to be rather short for him. He stood still for a moment, and appeared to be waiting for some one. Then, suddenly his whole frame thrilled with nervous action; <b>he</b> slightly <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and, in an instant, he brought his cane to his shoulder, {{as if it had been}} a gun. The captain had seen that sort of thing before. It was an air-gun. Without a word he made a dash at the man. He was elderly, but in a case like this he was swift. As he ran he glanced out in the direction in which the gun was aimed. Along the broad, sunlighted avenue a barouche was passing. On the back seat sat two gentlemen, well-dressed, erect. Even in a flash one would notice an air of dignity in their demeanor.|$|R
60|$|Some {{species of}} deer, when savage, display far more {{expression}} than do cattle, sheep, or goats, for, as {{has already been}} stated, they draw back their ears, grind their teeth, erect their hair, squeal, stamp on the ground, and brandish their horns. One day in the Zoological Gardens, the Formosan deer (Cervus pseudaxis) approached me in a curious attitude, with his muzzle raised high up, so that the horns were pressed back on <b>his</b> neck; the <b>head</b> being held rather obliquely. From the expression of his eye I felt {{sure that he was}} savage; he approached slowly, {{and as soon as he}} came close to the iron bars, <b>he</b> did not <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to butt at me, but suddenly bent it inwards, and struck his horns with great force against the railings. Mr. Bartlett informs me that some other species of deer place themselves in the same attitude when enraged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thrice Matara, {{standing}} by my side, called aloud her name with grief and imprecations. He stirred my heart. It leaped three times; {{and three times}} with the eyes of my mind I saw in the gloom within the enclosed space of the prau a woman with streaming hair going away from her land and her people. I was angry--and sorry. Why? And then I also cried out insults and threats. Matara said, 'Now they have left our land their lives are mind. I shall follow and strike--and, alone, pay the price of blood.' A great wind was sweeping towards the setting sun over the empty river. I cried, 'By your side I will go!' <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in sign of assent. It was his destiny. The sun had set, and the trees swayed their boughs with a great noise above our heads.|$|E
60|$|Foster {{felt that}} he must find out who the men were. The thing was risky, {{but it was worth}} trying, and he crawled out from behind the stones. The rock was rough and wet; his hand plunged into some water and he scraped his knee, but he made a few yards and then stopped and lay flat as the light went out. It looked as if the others had heard him, and <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> until his face was buried in {{withered}} fern. There was silence for a few moments, and then his nerves tingled as he heard steps; the men, he thought, were coming out to look for him. He did not move, however, and the footsteps got farther off. By and by there was a sharp rustle and he cautiously looked up. Two hazy figures showed among the trees, but it was plain that they were going away.|$|E
60|$|For {{half a mile}} he closely {{followed}} the Delaware's plainly marked trail. Then he stopped {{to take a quick}} survey of the forest before him. He abruptly left the trail, and, breaking into a run, went through the woods as fleetly and noiselessly as a deer, running for a quarter of a mile, when he stopped to listen. All seemed well, for <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and walked slowly along, examining the moss and leaves. Presently he came upon a little open space where the soil was a sandy loam. He bent over, then rose quickly. He had come upon the Indian's trail. Cautiously he moved forward, stopping every moment to listen. In all the close pursuits of his maturer years he had never been a victim of that most cunning of Indian tricks, an ambush. He relied solely on his ear to learn if foes were close by. The wild creatures of the forest were his informants. As soon as he heard any change in their twittering, humming or playing--whichever way they manifested their joy or fear of life--he became as hard to see, as difficult to hear as a creeping snake.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Kenneth had full leisure {{to enjoy}} these and similar high-souled thoughts, fostered by that wild spirit of chivalry, which, amid its most extravagant and fantastic flights, was still pure from all selfish alloy--generous, devoted, and perhaps only thus far censurable, that it {{proposed}} objects and {{courses of action}} inconsistent with the frailties and imperfections of man. All nature around him slept in calm moon-shine or in deep shadow. The long rows of tents and pavilions, glimmering or darkening as they lay in the moonlight or in the shade, were still and silent as the streets of a deserted city. Beside the banner-staff lay the large staghound already mentioned, the sole companion of Kenneth's watch, on whose vigilance he trusted for early warning of the approach of any hostile footstep. The noble animal seemed to understand the purpose of their watch; for he looked {{from time to time}} at the rich folds of the heavy pennon, and, when the cry of the sentinels came from the distant lines and defences of the camp, he answered them with one deep and reiterated bark, as if to affirm that he too was vigilant in his duty. From time to time, also, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> lofty <b>head,</b> and wagged <b>his</b> tail, as his master passed and repassed him in the short turns which he took upon his post; or, when the knight stood silent and abstracted leaning on his lance, and looking up towards heaven, his faithful attendant ventured sometimes, in the phrase of romance, [...] "to disturb his thoughts," [...] and awaken him from his reverie, by thrusting his large rough snout into the knight's gauntleted hand, to solicit a transitory caress.|$|R
60|$|He drank a few mouthfuls, {{and then}} motioned to <b>his</b> son to <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> down again.|$|R
60|$|Mills <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly, then tossed {{down his}} throat some wine out of a Venetian goblet.|$|R
