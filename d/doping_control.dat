Though the Italian Cycling Federation originally refused to punish him, the Italian National Olympic Committee appealed the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, resulting in a suspension for the rider and forfeiture of all his results from the Giro.|$|E
5|$|At both Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors matches, away {{supporters}} are {{situated in the}} North Stand behind the goal. Occasionally, during rugby games which attract low away support, the 5,418 capacity North Stand is closed altogether, and the away fans who attend are put into an alternative stand. The eastern stand, known as 'The Boston Stand', and the western 'Springfield Stand' run across the longer sides of the pitch. The Boston Stand is the largest, capable of seating up to 8,238 fans and holding an electronic scoreboard. The Springfield Stand contains the stadium's vital facilities; four dressing rooms, benches, a <b>doping</b> <b>control</b> room and a treatment room for the players, as well as four executive boxes, ten radio commentary points and a designated TV studio, in addition to holding 6,100 fans. The North Stand and South Stand have a seating capacity of 5,418 and 5,412 respectively. The stadium also has facilities and access for up to 278 fans with disabilities, with facilities for partially sighted fans. The seats are a mixture of both resident teams' main colours — cherry red and blue. The stadium is fully compliant with safety guidelines for a sports ground.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a hearing}} on 7 and 8 September 2016, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) panel found that Sharapova had a reduced {{perception}} of the risk that she took while using Mildronate, because (a) she had used Mildronate for around ten years without any anti-doping issue, (b) she had consulted the Russian doctor who prescribed the Mildronate for medical reasons, not to enhance her performance, and (c) she had received no specific warning about the change in status of meldonium from WADA, the ITF, or the WTA. However, the CAS panel also noted Sharapova’s failure to disclose her use of meldonium on her <b>doping</b> <b>control</b> forms {{and that she was}} at fault for (a) failing to give her agent adequate instructions as to how to carry out the important task of checking the Prohibited List, and (b) failing to supervise and control the actions of her agent in carrying out that task (specifically the lack of any procedure for reporting or follow-up verification to make sure that her agent had actually discharged his duty).|$|E

40|$|Urine <b>doping</b> <b>controls</b> {{have become}} a part of the daily lives of elite athletes. However, little {{knowledge}} is available on how athletes perceive these controls. In order to investigate this question, four hundred elite athletes completed an online survey in which they replied to open and closed questions about their experiences. The results showed that athletes approve of doping testing and that the majority of them are careful to report all substances they have consumed. Fear of a false positive test result despite not having taken forbidden substances is of concern for about half of the athletes, and significantly more for female and younger athletes. Furthermore, a third of the athletes report about experiencing stress caused by urination difficulty during the control, and a smaller group (approximately one out of seven) feel their personal integrity is violated because someone is watching them urinate. In addition, a quarter of the athletes feel that urine <b>doping</b> <b>controls</b> performed at their home are an invasion of privacy. Suggestions for the improvement of urine <b>doping</b> <b>controls</b> as well as for future research are given in the article...|$|R

500|$|Six days later, Japanese {{news agency}} Kyodo News {{reported}} that Indian middle distance runner Sunita Rani had {{tested positive for}} a banned substance, which was later confirmed by Lee Choon-Sup, Deputy Secretary General of the Busan Asian Games Organizing Committee; an unofficial report stated that the substance was the anabolic steroid nandrolone. Sunita had won two medals in athletics: a gold in the 1,500m (setting an Asian Games record) and a bronze in the 5,000m, (in which Sunita jointly bettered the Games record set by Indonesian Suprianti Sutono in Bangkok during the 1998 Asian Games with six other athletes). The Indian Chef de Mission at the Games backed Sunita—who denied using any banned drug—and asked for a [...] "B" [...] sample test from Bangkok, but tests were run only at the Asian Games’ <b>Doping</b> <b>Control</b> Center (AGDCC) in Seoul (the laboratory accredited by the IOC). On October 16, the AGDCC confirmed the steroid nandrolone in Sunita's urine sample; as a consequence, the OCA stripped her of both medals and dismissed her Asian Games record for the 1,500m.|$|E

40|$|Title: Doping in the triathlon Aims: The aim of our thesis was {{to become}} acquainted with doping as such, to analyse surveys on doping {{offences}} in the Czech Republic and on international scale in triathlon and to find substances mostly abused in triathlon. Methods: On the basis of information obtained from the World anti-doping agency (WADA) I performed an evaluation of doping offences. It dealt with the evaluation of results of <b>doping</b> <b>controls</b> in triathlon and cycling in the Czech Republic. Further I evaluated the results of <b>doping</b> <b>controls</b> in triathlon and cycling in {{the world on the}} basis of WADA information and compared them with the ones from the Czech Republic. Results: For displaying of the obtained data we used survey tables, which imply that the number of noted doping substance abuses between 2000 and 2009 was 3 triathlonist out of the 310 controls in the Czech Republic. For comparison there were 13 doping abuses out of 899 controls in cycling in the same time period in the Czech Republic. The same method was used for the evaluation of data on the international scale between the years 2003 and 2009 in the number of proved offences in triathlon 444 and in cycling 4 268 from the overall number 16 709 <b>doping</b> <b>controls</b> in triathlon and 110 264 in cycling, which represents 2, 7 % in triathlon and [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In May 2010, Floyd Landis accused Verbruggen of {{accepting}} a $100,000 bribe from Lance Armstrong to cover-up a positive <b>dope</b> <b>control</b> in 2001. Verbruggen denied the allegation, but confirmed that Armstrong representatives had approached the UCI {{with the intention}} of donating money. Verbruggen indicated that Armstrong's money would not have gone toward testing, but may have been used to purchase a Sysmex machine to analyze blood samples. Pat McQuaid, Verbruggen's successor as UCI president, later confirmed that Armstrong made two donations during Verburggen's tenure: a personal check for $25,000 in 2002, which went toward <b>doping</b> <b>controls</b> for junior racers, and a $100,000 donation from Armstrong's management company in 2005, which went toward the Sysmex machine. Given UCI's endorsement of USADA's decision: that the donation was made by the leader {{of one of the most}} sophisticated, systematic and successful doping programs in sporting history, ironically, for the express purpose of improving <b>doping</b> <b>controls,</b> Verbruggen's acceptance of the donation has not been without controversy. McQuaid also conceded that the UCI's acceptance of Armstrong's money may have been a mistake. The Cycling Independent Reform Commission concluded in February 2015 that Lance Armstrong did not test positive and confirmed that it didn’t find any indication of a financial agreement or corruption. It was later conceded that the UCI's acceptance of Armstrong's money may have been a misjudgment.|$|R
