5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of <b>graphite</b> occur {{in many parts}} of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. <b>Graphite</b> deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of <b>graphite</b> in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural <b>graphite</b> into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller {{deposits of}} <b>graphite</b> are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter <b>graphite</b> out on water.|$|E

With a neutron absorption cross section of 4.97 mbarns, the AGOT <b>graphite</b> is considered as the first true nuclear-grade <b>graphite.</b> By November 1942 National Carbon had shipped 255 tons of AGOT <b>graphite</b> to the University of Chicago, where it became {{the primary source of}} <b>graphite</b> {{to be used in the}} construction of Chicago Pile-1.|$|E

40|$|Radiation-induced {{contraction}} as {{a function}} of temperature was studied in needle-like and conventional coke <b>graphites</b> from 450 to 1200 deg C. Fast neutron exposures ranged up to 3. 2 x 10 /sup 21 / nvt, E) 0. 18 Mev, corresponding to approximately 20, 000 Mwd/at. in a Hanford graphitemoderated reactor. The results significantly extend information on the effect of high temperature irradiation on needle-like coke <b>graphites</b> manufactured with particle size, impregnation, and graphitization temperature as variables. In general, the transverse contraction rate goes through a broad minimum between the temperatures of 850 and 950 deg C with the least contraction occurring at approximately 800 deg C. Needle coke and CSF <b>graphites</b> show the same effect but the contraction of needle coke <b>graphites</b> is approximately 0. 8 that of CSF at all temperatures.

40|$|For {{fine-grain}} <b>graphites</b> {{with different}} final heat treatment, {{the influences of}} the porosity, degree of graphitization, and dopant (TiC, VC, WC, and ZrC) on the fluence dependence of the retention of 1 keV deuterium were investigated using thermal desorption spectroscopy. A strong decrease of the D retention for fluences higher than 1021 D/m² was observed for the undoped <b>graphites</b> graphitized at temperatures above 2000 K compared to material only calcined at 1270 K. Due to the identical manufacturing processes for the carbide-doped <b>graphites</b> used in this study, the structure is comparable for all of them. The choice of dopant {{as well as the}} ratio of open to closed porosity show no influence on the D retention. Therefore, these properties of the <b>graphites</b> can be neglected for hydrogen retention estimations...|$|R

5|$|In {{gray iron}} the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of <b>graphite,</b> and also renders the {{material}} brittle {{due to the}} sharp edged flakes of <b>graphite</b> that produce stress concentration sites within the material.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a {{previously}} derived semiempirical equation for describing observed ablation rates of isotropic <b>graphites</b> {{cannot be applied to}} low-density flows containing dissociated oxygen. Experimentally determined reaction probabilities of isotropic <b>graphites</b> to molecular and atomic oxygen are used to calculate heat-transfer rates and stagnation-point ablation rates for typical conditions. Integrated mass losses are computed for a group of flight trajectories which start from geosynchronous orbit and enter earth's atmosphere in a skipping motion following near-elliptic decaying orbits. A comparison of the results with those obtained by the equation under question shows excellent agreement for steep trajectories, but large discrepancies for shallow trajectories. The differences are attributed to surface oxidation by atomic oxygen...|$|R
5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The <b>graphite</b> feed material {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the <b>graphite</b> and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center {{to the ends of the}} tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The <b>graphite</b> feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E
5|$|The allotropes {{of carbon}} include <b>graphite,</b> {{one of the}} softest known substances, and diamond, the hardest {{naturally}} occurring substance. It bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable, multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds, {{a large majority of}} all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330°C or 7,820°F), so it sublimes at about 3,900K. <b>Graphite</b> is much more reactive than diamond at standard conditions, despite being more thermodynamically stable, as its delocalised pi system is much more vulnerable to attack. For example, <b>graphite</b> can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric acid at standard conditions to mellitic acid, C6(CO2H)6, which preserves the hexagonal units of <b>graphite</b> while breaking up the larger structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} <b>graphite,</b> in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives <b>graphite</b> its softness and its cleaving properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, <b>graphite</b> conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of <b>graphite</b> over diamond at room temperature.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} review {{is made for}} the AA-, AB- and ABC-stacked <b>graphites.</b> The generalized tight-binding model, accompanied with the effective-mass approximation and the Kubo formula, is developed to investigate electronic and optical properties in the presence/absence of a uniform magnetic field. The unusual electronic properties cover the stacking-dependent Dirac-cone structures, the significant energy widths along the stacking direction, the Landau subbands (LSs) crossing the Fermi level, the $B_ 0 $-dependent LS energy spectra with crossings and anti-crossings, and the monolayer- or bilayer-like Landau wavefunctions. There exist the configuration-created special structures in density of states and optical spectra. Three kinds of <b>graphites</b> quite differ from {{one another in the}} available inter-LS excitation channels, including the number, frequency, intensity and structures of absorption peaks. The dimensional crossover presents the main similarities and differences between <b>graphites</b> and graphenes; furthermore, the quantum confinement enriches the magnetic quantization phenomena in carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons. The cooperative/competitive relations among the interlayer atomic interactions, dimensions and magnetic quantization are responsible for the diversified essential properties.
