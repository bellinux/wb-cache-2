Fasting plasma Hcy concentrations and levels of serum vitamin B 12 and folic acid were measured using competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay; values exceeding 14 μm/l were considered elevated. RESULTS: Mean plasma Hcy was significantly higher in PEXG (16. 55 [*]±[*] 7. 23 μm/l) compared with POAG (13. 91 [*]±[*] 3. 61 μm/l) <b>and</b> <b>controls</b> (<b>13.</b> 12 [*]±[*] 5. 13 μm/l) (p[*]=[*] 0. 03 and p[*]=[*] 0. 0007 respectively).

RESULTS: LV twist angle was smaller in the HT group (6. 2 ± 3. 3 °) in comparison with the CS group <b>and</b> <b>controls</b> (<b>13.</b> 2 ± 3. 5 ° and 13. 1 ± 4. 5 °, respectively; p< 0. 0001 for all) and untwist rate was reduced (HT group: - 74 ± 30 °/s; CS group: - 118 ± 43 °/s; controls: - 116 ± 39 °/s; p< 0. 0001 for all).

To elucidate this issue, we studied osteoblast function in six patients with IJO (five males, one female; aged 2. 3 - 14. 6 years) and five healthy sex- and age-matched subjects (four males, one female; aged 2. 0 - 15. 1 years) measuring serum values of osteocalcin under basal condition and during an osteoblast stimulation test performed by oral 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3] administration (1. 8 -mu-g/ 1. 73 m 2 /daily).

Much work has been done on the effects of water on deck. 676 Journal of Vibration <b>and</b> <b>Control,</b> <b>13</b> (3) : 269 – 280, 2007 DOI: 10. 1177 / 1077546307073 2007 SAGE PublicationsFor example, the water level and hydraulic pressure for water on deck were computed using experimentation and numerical methods (Mizoguchi, 1989 Buchner, 1995), and the occur-rence probability of water on deck was studied using probability statistics (Hamoudi and Varyani, 1998 Davidson et al., 2002). In recent years, Murashige and Aihara have worked on the motion of a flooded ship. First, the experimental study of chaotic motion of a flooded ship was presented (Murashige and Aihara, 1998). They found that the roll response of a flooded ship exhibits irregularHomoclinic and heteroclinic, where the heteroclinic model emulates symmetric vessel capsize and the ho-moclinic model represents a vessel with an initial bias caused by water on deck. We investigate the stability and capsizing of ships in the homoclinic region using the probability method and nonlinear stochastic dy-namics theory.
