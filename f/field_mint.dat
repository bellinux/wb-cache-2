The farmgate value of this oil is worth approximately $ 115 million each year. In final product form, this translates to a $ 3. 5 billion domestic market. Consumption of US peppermint and spearmint oils is dominated by the chewing gum and toothpaste industries which use about 90 % of the oil produced; lesser amounts are used in the confectionary, pharmaceutical and liqueur flavoring trades. One drum of mint oil weighing about 400 pounds can flavor more than 5 million sticks of chewing gum or 400, 000 tubes of toothpaste. More than 90, 000 acres of mint are grown commercially for oil in the western and mid-western US. The United States is the largest producer in the world of peppermint oil and spearmint oil and accounts for 70 % of the world’s mint oil production. Mint is a perennial plant that produces no seed.

40|$|Many animals use {{volatile}} {{chemicals to}} detect and locate their food, but they frequently {{have to cope with}} a large variation in volatile blends associated with food. It has often been suggested that they do this by learning the association between odors and the presence of food. Indeed, associative learning was demonstrated for a range of animals under laboratory conditions and individuals usually take seconds to hours to modify their behavior. However, it is poorly understood at which timescale field populations and communities of animal species respond. We studied this by exposing egg batches of arthropod herbivores, half of which were combined with a volatile, to a community of natural enemies in the <b>field.</b> We used <b>mint</b> oil as a volatile blend, which we showed not to be attractive in the laboratory for 2 predators that commonly occur in the field. The predation of egg batches with volatiles in the field was initially slightly lower than that of batches without volatiles, indicating that the odor was not innately attractive to the natural enemies. However, relative to the controls, the predation of eggs associated with volatiles increased significantly over a period of 4 - 5 days. This suggests that individuals in the community of natural enemies associated the presence of eggs with the volatiles. We observed 3 different types of predation, indicating that various groups of predator species were responsible for predation in the field. Our results show that communities of animals rapidly associate volatiles with food in the field...|$|R

40|$|Peppermint and {{spearmint}} {{are high}} value essential oil crops in Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Although the mints are profitable alternatives to corn and soybeans, mint production efficiency must improve {{in order to}} allow industry survival against foreign produced oils and synthetic flavorings. Weed control is the major input cost in mint production and tools to increase efficiency are necessary. Remote sensing-based site-specific weed management offers potential for decreasing weed control costs through simplified weed detection and control from accurate site specific weed and herbicide application maps. This research showed the practicability of remote sensing for weed detection in the mints. Research was designed to compare spectral response curves of <b>field</b> grown <b>mint</b> and weeds, and to use these data to develop spectral vegetation indices for automated weed detection. Viability of remote sensing in mint production was established using unsupervised classification, supervised classification, handheld spectroradiometer readings and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs). Unsupervised classification of multispectral images of peppermint production fields generated crop health maps with 92 and 67 % accuracy in meadow and row peppermint, respectively. Supervised classification of multispectral images identified weed infestations with 97 % and 85 % accuracy for meadow and row peppermint, respectively. Supervised classification showed that peppermint was spectrally distinct from weeds, but the accuracy of these measures was dependent on extensive ground referencing which is impractical and too costly for on-farm use. Handheld spectroradiometer measurements of peppermint, spearmint, and several weeds and crop and weed mixtures were taken over three years from greenhouse grown plants, replicated field plots, and production peppermint and spearmint fields. Results showed that mints have greater near infrared (NIR) and lower green reflectance and a steeper red edge slope than all weed species. These distinguishing characteristics were combined to develop narrow band and broadband spectral vegetation indices (SVIs, ratios of NIR/green reflectance), that were effective in differentiating mint from key weed species. Hyperspectral images of production peppermint and spearmint fields were then classified using SVI-based classification. Narrowband and broadband SVIs classified early season peppermint and spearmint with 64 to 100 % accuracy compared to 79 to 100 % accuracy for supervised classification of multispectral images of the same fields. Broadband SVIs have potential for use as an automated spectral indicator for weeds in the mints since they require minimal ground referencing and can be calculated from multispectral imagery which is cheaper and more readily available than hyperspectral imagery. This research will allow growers to implement remote sensing based site specific weed management in mint resulting in reduced grower input costs and reduced herbicide entry into the environment and will have applications in other specialty and meadow crops. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, textual {{scholarship}} and editing have become areas of contention. On the one hand Ray Siemens and his group publish articles praising {{the wonders of the}} so-called “social editing” (2012); on the other, Elena Pierazzo promotes the idea that digital editing is only documentary editing (2011). It seems to be a field day for anyone who can invent the next “big thing” in textual scholarship. All of this comes directly from the relatively new field of Digital Humanities. One notes that these articles were not published in a journal devoted to Textual Scholarship such as Textual Cultures, Variants or Ecdotica, but rather in Digital Scholarship in the Humanities (formerly Literary and Linguistic Computing/ LLC). Whereas textual criticism can trace its roots back to classical texts in the library of Alexandria, Digital Humanities was named {{for the first time in}} 2001, popularized in 2005, and made mainstream at the MLA conference in 2009. Enterpreneurs of this newly <b>minted</b> <b>field</b> declare that their work is acting to “revolutionize” editing. By nature, however, real revolutions are rare and, generally, more destructive than productive. Metaphorical revoltions can be dangerous because they make use of political language in order to advance a particular agenda. Pierazzo, for example, makes a strong case for documentary editing, about which she states: [...] . we could define this new type of editorial object, the documentary digital edition, as the recording of as many features of the original document as are considered meaningful by the editors [...] . (475) This is a valid type of edition, which actually has existed, albeit in a more limited fashion, in print. However, Pierazzo overstates her case by declaring that other types of editing are not equally valid (as during her presentation at ESTS 2014 in Helsinki). Moreover, a many remarkable digital editions (Shaw’s Comedia and Monarchia; the Canterbury Tales Project’s publications, the Variorum of the Origin of Species, Foys’ Bayeux Tapestry, the digital forms of the Greek New Testament coming from Münster and Birmingham, the digital classical epigraphy projects from King’s and elsewhere, and many others) are not considered by her, as they cannot fit into her model. When one attempts to develop a theoretical model for editions, one should do so from within the theoretical frame of the discipline in question, that is, from a ample and general knowledge and understanding of textual scholarship. When necessary, a the model can (and should) be modified to fit the developments of the field. But such developments, should mainly arise from issues within the discipline, rather than respond to the limitations or possibilities of the tools of tools developed in adjacent fields, as is the case of Digital Humanities. There is no doubt that there are many types of digital editions and, in many ways, it is possible to subcategorize digital editions in many more divisions than we ever had for editions in print. The reason for this is related to the almost limitless space available for digital work, which allows editors a multitude of choices previously unavailable – including, particularly, the choice of audience. There is a challenge linked to this potential: editors have to make choices about the materials they want to present for a particlar audience, taking into account the needs of that audience. Editors must continue to edit according to the principles of textual scholarship, and not according to the dictates of the digital fashionistas. status: publishe...|$|R
