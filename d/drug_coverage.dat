5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription <b>drug</b> <b>coverage.</b> In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{people with}} Medicare can get {{prescription}} <b>drug</b> <b>coverage</b> through a Medicare Advantage plan {{or through the}} standalone private prescription drug plans (PDPs) established under Medicare Part D. Each plan established its own coverage policies and independently negotiates the prices it pays to drug manufacturers. But because each plan has a much smaller coverage pool than the entire Medicare program, many argue that this system of paying for prescription drugs undermines the government’s bargaining power and artificially raises the cost of <b>drug</b> <b>coverage.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of the {{expansion}} of public prescription <b>drug</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> from Medicare Part D on the elderly and find evidence of substantial crowd-out.

Medicinal plants were shown by healers for identification. Forty-eight medicinal plant species classified into 35 families were documented and claimed to treat 22 animal health constraints. Leaves were the most frequently utilized plant part (31. 58 %). Oral route (57. 89 %) was found as the most common route of administration.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{repeated}} ivermectin treatments on {{the transmission of}} #Onchocerca volvulus$ was evaluated in the Vina valley, northern Cameroon, by comparing the prevalence and intensity of infection observed in untreated 5 - 7 years old children living in the treated communities before and after 7 - 8 successive annual rounds of ivermectin treatment {{of the general population}} of those communities. The villages studied were Ngoumi and Babidan, where the initial community microfilarial loads (CMFL) were 83. 7 and 216. 4 microfilariae per skin snip, respectively. In 1995, after 8 annual treatments, the prevalence and intensity in Ngoumi had decreased by more than 90 %, compared with the pretreatment values, and the prevalence continued to decrease between 1992 and 1995. In Babidan, after 7 annual treatments, the prevalence and intensity had also decreased significantly, but less than in Ngoumi. The study demonstrated that repeated treatments brought about a notable reduction in the transmission of #O. volvulus$ in the Vina valley, despite unfavourable factors such as mean <b>drug</b> <b>coverages</b> below 60 % and the good vectorial competence of #Simulium damnosum$ s. s. and #S. sirbanum$.

Infliximab is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder, so must be reconstituted and administered by a health care professional, usually in a hospital or office setting.

About two thirds of Canadians have private prescription <b>drug</b> <b>coverage,</b> mostly through their employers.

25|$|All Medicare Advantage {{plans are}} {{required}} to limit out-of-pocket (OOP) spending by a beneficiary for Parts A and B {{to no more than}} $6,700 (as of 2016) per year for in-network providers. The OOP limit may be higher for out of network providers in a PPO; out of network providers are typically not permitted in an HMO. The average OOP limit in 2016 is around $5000. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is often reported; it is instead a very valuable financial-protection benefit although is very rare that a Medicare Advantage beneficiary spends anywhere near the amount of his or her annual OOP limit. Original Medicare provides no similar OOP spending cap and the exposure of an Original Medicare beneficiary to a financial catastrophe is unlimited (but equally rare). Once the OOP maximum is reached for an individual, the plan will pay 100% of medical services {{for the remainder of the}} calendar year, with no lifetime maximum. This OOP limit does not apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered <b>drug</b> <b>coverage</b> (which has its own different means of addressing catastrophic costs).|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Injection {{drug users}} (IDUs) {{are at high}} risk for HIV, hepatitis, {{overdose}} and other harms. Greater drug treatment availability has been shown to reduce these harms among IDUs. Yet, little is known about changes in drug treatment availability for IDUs in the U. S. This paper investigates change in <b>drug</b> treatment <b>coverage</b> for IDUs in 90 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) during 1993 - 2002. Methods: We define treatment coverage as the percent of IDUs who are in treatment. The number of IDUs in drug treatment is calculated from treatment entry data and treatment census data acquired from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, divided by our estimated number of IDUs in each MSA. Results: Treatment coverage was low in 1993 (mean 6. 7 %; median 6. 0 %) and only increased to a mean of 8. 3 % and median of 8. 0 % coverage in 2002. Conclusions: Although some MSAs experienced increases in treatment coverage over time, overall levels of coverage were low. The persistence of low <b>drug</b> treatment <b>coverage</b> for IDUs represents a failure by the U. S. health care system to prevent avoidable harms and unnecessary deaths in this population. Policy makers should expand drug treatment for IDUs to reduce blood-borne infections and community harms associated with untreated injection drug use...|$|R
