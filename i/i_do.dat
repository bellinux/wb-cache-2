5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not mean anything so precise as that. However, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know how long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language {{which can be used}} not because of facilities and all that... but because <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E

"He {{said it was}} God's will," [...] said poor Viola, [...] "but I knew it was mamma's. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> what he told me, Lucy; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not get {{so wrong}} {{as long as he}} lived, but after that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not care what became of me, and yet <b>I</b> <b>did</b> love him as much as ever." ...|$|R

5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
