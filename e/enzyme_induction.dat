5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction.</b> For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions. Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to treat disease. Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim {{to correct a}} {{pathological}} condition. However, not all drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Some, such as anti-epileptic drugs, alter enzyme activity by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced. These effects are called <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> and inhibition and are alterations in gene expression, which is unrelated {{to the type of}} enzyme inhibition discussed here. Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as ion channels or membrane receptors.|$|E
25|$|Primidone, carbamazepine, {{phenobarbital}} and phenytoin {{are among}} the most potent hepatic enzyme inducing drugs in existence. This <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> occurs at therapeutic doses. In fact, people taking these drugs have displayed the highest degree of hepatic <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> on record. In addition to being an inducer of CYP3A4, it is also an inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants, as well as potentially increasing the toxicity of tobacco products. Its metabolite, phenobarbital, is a substrate of CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP3A5, CYP1E1, and the CYP2E subfamily. The gene expression of these isoenzymes is regulated by human pregnane receptor X (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Phenobarbital induction of CYP2B6 is mediated by both. Primidone does not activate PXR.|$|E

For example, if one drug inhibits the CYP-mediated metabolism of another drug, the second drug may accumulate within the body to toxic levels. Hence, these drug interactions may necessitate dosage adjustments or choosing drugs that do not interact with the CYP system. Such drug interactions are especially important to take into account when using drugs of vital importance to the patient, drugs with important side-effects and drugs with small therapeutic windows, but any drug may be subject to an altered plasma concentration due to altered drug metabolism.|$|E

In the group of subjects (12) controlled before and after toluene entered in the working operation, mean GGT activity resulted twofold after exposure, without any modification of other tests.

40|$|Anaerobically grown Escherichia coli K- 12 contain {{only one}} {{superoxide}} dismutase {{and that is}} the iron-containing isozyme found in the periplasmic space. Exposure to oxygen caused the induction of a manganese-containing superoxide dismutase and of another, previously undescribed, superoxide dismutase, as well as of catalase and peroxidase. These inductions differed in their responsiveness towards oxygen. Thus the very low levels of oxygen present in deep, static, aerobic cultures were enough for nearly maximal induction of the manganese-superoxide dismutase. In contrast, induction of the new superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase required the much higher levels of oxygen achieved in vigorously agitated aerobic cultures. Anaerobically grown cells showed a much greater oxygen enhancement of the lethality of streptonigrin than did aerobically grown cells, in accord with the proposal that streptonigrin can serve as an intracellular source of superoxide.

P 4 H are key enzymes in collagen- and HIF metabolism. Previous findings were able to demonstrate, that inhibition of P 4 H in experimental myocardial infarction reduces LV remodeling and ameliorates survival. Aim {{of this study was}} to investigate the role of P 4 H in pressure-induced myocardial remodeling. Aortic banding was induced in Wistar-rats and animals were treated over 28 consecutive days with either vehicle, the C-P 4 HI FG 0041 or the HIF-P 4 HI FG 2216. At the experimental endpoint, echocardiographic and hemodynamic data were collected, and expression of ECM-proteins, growth hormones and neurohormones was investigated in the LV myocardium. AoB led to LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction with elevated LVEDP and lung weight, while the systolic function was preserved. Oral administration of FG 0041 was able to normalize diastolic function, but did not influence LV hypertrophy. FG 2216 did not lead to hemodynamic unloading, while LV hypertrophy was augmented. AoB led to dysregulation of ECM-modulating <b>enzymes,</b> <b>induction</b> of growth hormones, upregulation of Melusin and activation of neurohumoral systems. The influence of TGF(beta) 1 on secretion of matrix enzymes was demonstrated. C-P 4 HI was able to reduce changes in the ECM-modulating <b>enzymes</b> partially. <b>Induction</b> of growth hormones was inhibited, AoB-induced overexpression of ETR(beta) and ECE- 1 was normalized. Collagen expression was under FG 0041 -medication not changed when compared to Sham. HIF-P 4 HI led to unchanged and elevated expression of growth hormones, an upregulated expression and activity of matrix enzymes, upregulated collagen expression and persistent activation of neurohormones. C-P 4 HI led to an enhancement of AoB induced LV dysfunction and reduced the dysbalance of profibrotic ECM remodeling as well as hypertophy-associated gene expression. In contrast to inhibition of HIF-P 4 H, inhibition of C-P 4 H therefore might present a therapeutic alternative to influence myocardial remodeling accompanying pressure-induced hypertrophy.

Using acyl-CoAs as donors, glycerophospholipids are formed by the de novo pathway (Kennedy pathway) and modified in the remodeling pathway (Lands' cycle). Various acyltransferases, including two lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAATs), have been discovered from a 1 -acylglycerol- 3 -phosphate O-acyltransferase (AGPAT) family. Proteins of this family contain putative acyltransferase motifs, but their biochemical properties and physiological roles are not completely understood. Here, we demonstrated that mouse LPAAT 3, previously known as mouse AGPAT 3, possesses strong LPAAT activity and modest lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase activity with a clear preference for arachidonoyl-CoA as a donor.

C 1 q/TNF-related protein 9 (CTRP 9) is identified to be an adipocytokine with cardioprotective properties. However, the potential roles of CTRP 9 in endothelial function remain largely elusive. In the present study, the effects of CTRP 9 on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, angiogenesis, nitric oxide (NO) production and oxidative stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to ox-LDL were investigated. We observed that treatment with ox-LDL inhibited the proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and the generation of NO, while stimulated the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HUVECs. Incubation of HUVECs with CTRP 9 rescued ox-LDL-induced endothelial injury. CTRP 9 treatment reversed ox-LDL-evoked decreases in antioxidant enzymes including heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P) H) dehydrogenase quinone 1, and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), as well as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).
