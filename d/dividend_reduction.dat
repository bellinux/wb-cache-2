We document that the market reaction for firms with long patterns of past earnings and dividend payouts is significantly more negative than for firms with lessestablished past earnings and dividends records. Our results {{can be explained by}} the following line of reasoning. First, consistent with DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and Skinner (1992), a loss following a long stream of earnings and dividend payments represents an unreliable indicator of future earnings. Thus, established firms have higher loss reliability than less-established firms. Second, because current earnings and dividend policy are a substitute source of means of forecasting future earnings, lower loss reliability increases the information content of <b>dividend</b> <b>reductions.</b> Therefore, given the presence of a loss, the longer the stream of prior earnings and dividend payments, (1) the lower the loss reliability and (2) the more reliably dividend cuts are perceived as an indication that earnings difficulties will persist in the future...|$|R

We note that downside risk offers a theoretical justification for the “distress risk” explanation of the contrarian effect of Fama and French (1996).

The effect of tax uncertainty is stronger in the presence of financial constraints and weaker for firms that distribute dividends to alleviate agency conflicts. Furthermore, I find a negative effect of tax uncertainty on dividend levels, which is moderated by the costs of <b>dividend</b> <b>reductions.</b> These results are economically meaningful as a one standard deviation higher tax uncertainty leads to a 9. 9 percentage point lower probability and a $ 23. 6 million <b>reduction</b> in <b>dividend</b> payouts.

The paper also examines the role that repurchases played in large BHCs' decisions to reduce or eliminate dividends. Did BHCs with a high level of repurchases prior to the financial crisis cut dividends later, or by less, than BHCs with lower levels of pre-crisis repurchases? The key findings are that the smaller BHCs in the sample (those with assets between $ 5 billion and $ 25 billion) with higher levels of repurchases before the financial crisis reduced dividends later and by less than BHCs with lower pre-crisis repurchases.

In addition, we find that the tendency of dividend cuts upon technical default weakened after the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. This is consistent with weakened bargaining power of creditors due to increased competition among banks, and increased conflict of interest due to combining commercial and investment banking businesses.

The information content of dividend policy for firms that incur earnings reductions following long patterns of positive earnings and dividends has been examined (DeAngelo et al., 1992, 1996; Charitou, 2000).

Our evidence supports the hypotheses that, among earnings-reducing or loss firms, longer patterns of past earnings and dividends: (a) strengthen the information conveyed by dividends regarding future earnings, and (b) enhance the role of the magnitude of low earnings realizations in explaining dividend policy decisions, in that earnings hold more information content that explains the likelihood of dividend cuts the longer the past earnings and dividend patterns.

One of the striking findings of this paper reveals that a majority of ISE firms prefer dividend omissions rather than dividend reductions.

Because most firms reduce dividend payment in distress period as prior researches suggested, this dissertation focuses on exploring the factors that influence the probability of <b>dividend</b> <b>reduction</b> decisions from 2000 to 2005. A liner probability model is undertaken. Several potential factors that affect the firms’ decision to cut dividend are chosen: earnings, profitability, investment opportunity, binding debt covenant and firm size. Most results are consistent with prior empirical evidence except that firm size is found to have the mixing results relating to firms’ decision to cut dividends. In addition, this dissertation attempts to test the information content of dividends Hypothesis (ICH) and the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) by investigating the stock price reaction to dividend announcements in 2000. The results indicate a significant market adjusted abnormal return associating with dividend announcements that provides the support for signaling theory and also suggests that the US stock market is inefficient with regard to the semi-strong form EMH...|$|E

40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the dividend policy of German firms is more flexible than the one of their Anglo-American counterparts. This paper analyses the decision to change the dividend for a panel of 221 German firms from 1984 to 1994. The choice of the period of study is motivated by the fact that at the start of this period there was an economic boom which was followed by a recession. Consistent with the traditional dividend literature, e. g. Lintner (1956), net earnings are key determinants of the decision to change the dividend. However, the study comes up with two findings which are contrary to Lintner (1956) and Miller and Modigliani (1961). First, the level of net earnings is not the only key determinant of the dividend decision, as the occurrence of a loss - whatever its magnitude - has an explanatory power exceeding the one of the level of the loss. Second, dividend cuts or omissions tend to be temporary and the majority of German firms quickly (within two years) revert to their initial dividend level. This stands in marked contrast with DeAngelo et al. (1992) who find that US firms are more likely to reduce their dividend when earnings deteriorate on a permanent basis. Furthermore, the fact that German firms frequently omit and cut their dividend and quickly return to their initial dividend suggests that dividends in Germany have less of a signalling role than dividends in the US and the UK. Our findings also contradict Bhattacharya's (1979) argument that the costs of dividend changes are asymmetric with <b>dividend</b> <b>reductions</b> being more costly to the firm than dividend increases. Finally, we find evidence that firms with banks as their major shareholder are more willing to omit their dividend than firms controlled by other types of shareholder. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{dividend}} paying firms {{has been on}} the decline since the popularity of stock repurchases in the 1980 s, and the recent financial crisis has brought about a wave of <b>dividend</b> <b>reductions</b> and omissions. This dissertation examined the U. S. firms and American Depository Receipts that are listed on the U. S. equity exchanges according to their dividend paying history in the previous twelve quarters. While accounting for {{the state of the economy}}, the firm’s size, profitability, earned equity, and growth opportunities, it determines whether or not the firm will pay a dividend in the next quarter. It also examined the likelihood of a dividend change. Further, returns of firms were examined according to their dividend paying history and the state of the economy using the Fama-French three-factor model. ^ Using forward, backward, and step-wise selection logistic regressions, the results show that firms with a history of regular and uninterrupted dividend payments are likely to continue to pay dividends, while firms that do not have a history of regular dividend payments are not likely to begin to pay dividends or continue to do so. The results of a set of generalized polytomous logistic regressions imply that dividend paying firms are more likely to reduce dividend payments during economic expansions, as opposed to recessions. Also the analysis of returns using the Fama-French three factor model reveals that dividend paying firms are earning significant abnormal positive returns. ^ As a special case, a similar analysis of dividend payment and dividend change was applied to American Depository Receipts that trade on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX exchanges and are issued by the Bank of New York Mellon. Returns of American Depository Receipts were examined using the Fama-French two-factor model for international firms. The results of the generalized polytomous logistic regression analyses indicate that dividend paying status and economic conditions are also important for dividend level change of American Depository Receipts, and Fama-French two-factor regressions alone do not adequately explain returns for these securities. ...|$|R
