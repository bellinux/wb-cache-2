40|$|Melanoma {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{aggressive}} cancers and its incidence is increasing worldwide. So far there are no curable therapies especially after metastasis. Due to frequent mutations in members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, this pathway is constitutively active in melanoma. It has been shown that the SONIC HEDGEHOG (SHH) -GLI and MAPK signaling pathway regulate cell growth in many tumors including melanoma and interact with each other in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. Here we show that the SHH-GLI pathway is active in <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines as they express downstream target of this pathway GLI 1. Expression of GLI 1 was significantly higher in <b>human</b> primary <b>melanoma</b> tissues harboring BRAF(V 600 E) mutation than those with wild type BRAF. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRAF(V 600 E) in <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines resulted in decreased expression of GLI 1 thus demonstrating interaction of SHH-GLI and MAPK pathways. Inhibition of SHH-GLI pathway by the novel small molecule inhibitor of smoothened NVP-LDE 225 was followed by inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines, interestingly with both BRAF(V 600 E) and BRAF(Wild Type) status.

50|$|Telomerase is {{an enzyme}} {{that works to}} create {{telomeric}} ends for DNA, and it is thought to play important roles {{in the development of}} cancer. Specifically, telomeric stability is known to be a common occurrence in cancer cells. Along with the telomerase, the shelterin complex, and TERF2 and TERF1 specifically, also have been noted to control the lengths of telomeres formed by these telomerases. Shelterin works to protect telomeres against unsuitable activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as noted in the function section above. TERF2 as part of the shelterin complex, has been known to block the ATM signaling pathways and prevent chromosome end fusion. In cancer cells, TERF2 phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) is a controlling factor in the major pro-oncogenic signaling pathways (RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK) that affect telomeric stability. Additionally, when TERF2 was non-phosphorylated in melanoma cells, there was a cell induced DNA damage response, arresting growth and causing tumor reversion. Studies have found that in tumor cells, TERF2 levels are observed to be high, and this raised level of TERF2 contributes to oncogenesis in a variety of ways. This high level of TERF2 decreases the ability to recruit and activate natural killer cells in human tumor cells. One study used a dominant negative form of TERF2ΔBΔC, to inhibit TERF2, and found that it could induce a reversion malignant phenotype in <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, over-expression of TERF2ΔBΔC, and therefore blocking of TERF2, induced apoptosis and reduced tumourigenicity in certain cell lines. Additionally, upregulation of TERF2 may be the cause of the establishment and maintenance of short telomeres. These short telomeres increase chromosomal instability, and increase the chances of certain cancers progressing in the body, such as with leukemia. In gastric mucosa tissues, the expression of TERF2 proteins was significantly higher than normal, and this over-expression of TERF2, along with over-expression of TERF1, TIN2, TERT, and BRCA1 protein transposition, may cause a reduction in telomere length, further contributing to multistage carcinogenesis of gastric cancer.|$|E

All of the <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines expressed snail, which is known to encode a transcription repressor for E-cadherin, {{at a higher level}} than melanocytes whereas expression levels of the snail varied among cell lines. Transduction of snail gene into MMAc cells which expressed a high level of E-cadherin and an extremely low level of snail decreased expression of E-cadherin but not P-cadherin.

Moreover, TPL-induced apoptosis in SK-MEL- 2 cells was mediated through dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and its cleavage by caspase- 8 -mediated caspase- 3 activation via upregulation of Fas expression.

40|$|Abstract Background Melanoma is an {{aggressive}} tumor with increasing incidence. To develop accurate prognostic markers and targeted therapies, changes leading to malignant transformation of melanocytes {{need to be}} understood. In the Xiphophorus melanoma model system, a mutated version of the EGF receptor Xmrk (Xiphophorus melanoma receptor kinase) triggers melanomagenesis. Cellular events downstream of Xmrk, such as the activation of Akt, Ras, B-Raf or Stat 5, were also shown {{to play a role}} in human melanomagenesis. This makes the elucidation of Xmrk downstream targets a useful method for identifying processes involved in melanoma formation. Methods Here, we analyzed Xmrk-induced gene expression using a microarray approach. Several highly expressed genes were confirmed by realtime PCR, and pathways responsible for their induction were revealed using small molecule inhibitors. The expression of these genes was also monitored in <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines, and the target gene FOSL 1 was knocked down by siRNA. Proliferation and migration of siRNA-treated <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines were then investigated. Results Genes with the strongest upregulation after receptor activation were FOS-like antigen 1 (Fosl 1), early growth response 1 (Egr 1), osteopontin (Opn), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (Igfbp 3), dual-specificity phosphatase 4 (Dusp 4), and tumor-associated antigen L 6 (Taal 6). Interestingly, most genes were blocked in presence of a SRC kinase inhibitor. Importantly, we found that FOSL 1, OPN, IGFBP 3, DUSP 4, and TAAL 6 also exhibited increased expression levels in <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines compared to human melanocytes. Knockdown of FOSL 1 in <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines reduced their proliferation and migration. Conclusion Altogether, the data show that the receptor tyrosine kinase Xmrk is a useful tool in the identification of target genes that are commonly expressed in Xmrk-transgenic melanocytes and <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines. The identified molecules constitute new possible molecular players in melanoma development. Specifically, a role of FOSL 1 in melanomagenic processes is demonstrated. These data are the basis for future detailed analyses of the investigated target genes. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{selected}} human CD 4 ? T cells using immunomagnetic beads from periph-eral blood mononuclear {{cells of}} 5 healthy volunteers, and cultured with recom-binant interleukin- 2 (RIL- 2) plus anti-CD 3 culture supernatants. After success-ful {{generation of the}} CD 4 ? T cell cultures, we examined the therapeutic value for <b>human</b> malignant <b>melanoma.</b> Through flow cytometry analysis, ??Cr-release assay and proliferation assay, we found that a) the total increase in 7 to 10 day cultures ranged from 30 to 100 -fold; b) the expanded cells were mostly CD 2 ?, CD 3 ?, CD 4 ?, CD 8 ?, CD 25 ?, CD 29 ?, CD 56 ? and T cell receptor (α/β) ? T cell; c) some of them possessed moderate levels of natural killer cell and lymphokine -activated killer cell activities; d) culture supernatants significantly inhibited the growth of cultured <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines; e) culture supernatants enhanced surface expression of class I, class II and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 on cultured <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> lines; and f) culture supernatants contained large amounts of cytokines such as IL- 2, IL- 6 and interferon-γ. These results sug-gested that selectively expanded CD 4 + T cells may be available as a new strategy in the future human adoptive immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|An acid-sensitive {{growth factor}} for <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> has been {{partially}} purified from human platelets. TSK gel filtration HPLC provides a molecular weight estimation of 60, 000 daltons. This factor {{is not only}} mitogenic for <b>human</b> <b>melanoma,</b> but also stimulates 3 H-thymidine uptake and increases the number of bovine aortic endothelial cells, while fibroblasts are nonresponsive. Radioiodination of active HPLC fraction has been accomplished. The <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>cell</b> line, M 1 RW 5 demonstrates specific, time-dependent binding of the labeled protein. These {{studies suggest that the}} growth of <b>human</b> <b>melanoma</b> may in part be regulated by a newly described growth factor present in human platelets...|$|R
