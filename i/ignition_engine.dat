Further, the thermal efficiency of steam was considerably {{less than that of}} diesel engines.

500|$|The prototypes of the AMX-30 weighed , {{and were}} compact, with a width of , {{comparable}} {{only to the}} Swiss Panzer 61, and a height of , comparable only to the Soviet T-55. In contrast to the AMX 50, the AMX-30 was issued a conventional turret, because {{it was found that}} it was more difficult to seal oscillating turrets from radioactive dust and against water when the tank was submerged. Oscillating turrets also had a large ballistic weakness {{in the area of the}} skirt and turret ring. Originally, the first two prototypes were powered by a [...] spark <b>ignition</b> <b>engine,</b> named the SOFAM 12 GSds. Later, a multi-fuel diesel engine was adopted, developed by Hispano-Suiza. The seven 1963 prototypes of the AMX-30 were later rebuilt with the new diesel engine. Two further prototypes, meant to be direct preproduction vehicles, were delivered in November 1965. Besides the diesel engines, they had changed hull and turret casts and different gun mantlets; the latter would again be changed in the production vehicles.|$|E

2500|$|As a fuel, {{methanol}} and ethanol {{both have}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} over fuels such as petrol (gasoline) and diesel fuel. In spark ignition engines, both alcohols can run {{at a much higher}} exhaust gas recirculation rates and with higher compression ratios. [...] Both alcohols have a high octane rating, with ethanol at 109 RON (Research Octane Number), 90 MON (Motor Octane Number), (which equates to 99.5 AKI) and methanol at 109 RON, 89 MON (which equates to 99 AKI). Note that AKI refers to 'Anti-Knock Index' which averages the RON and MON ratings (RON+MON)/2, and is used on U.S. gas station pumps. [...] Ordinary European petrol is typically 95 RON, 85 MON, equal to 90 AKI. [...] As a compression <b>ignition</b> <b>engine</b> fuel, both alcohols create very little particulates, but their low cetane number means that an ignition improver like glycol must be mixed into the fuel with approx. 5%.|$|E

40|$|Performance of {{the spark}} <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> may be {{increased}} by changing the geometrical compression ratio according {{to the amount of}} charging in cylinders. The designed geometrical compression ratio can be realized as an effective compression ratio under the full load and full open throttle conditions since the effective compression ratio changes with the amount of charging into the cylinder in spark <b>ignition</b> <b>engines.</b> So, this condition of the spark <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> forces designers to change their geometrical compression ratio according to the amount of charging into the cylinder for improvement of performance and fuel economy. In order to improve the combustion efficiency, fuel economy, power output, exhaust emissions at partial loads, compression ratio must be increased; but, under high load and low speed conditions to prevent probable knock and hard running the compression ratio must be decreased gradually. In this paper, relation of the performance parameters to compression ratio such as power, torque, specific fuel consumption, cylindir pressure, exhaust gas temperature, combustion chamber surface area/volume ratio, thermal efficiency, spark timing etc. in spark <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> have been investigated and using of engines with variable compression ratio is suggested to fuel economy and more clear environment...|$|R

40|$|Exhaust unburnt {{hydrocarbons}} (HC) in spark <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> arisefrom {{a number of}} sources, includingflame quenching {{at the entrance of}} crevice volumes and at the combustion chamber wall, absorption and desorption of fuel vapour into oil layers on the cylinder wall, partial burning and misfring. All sources other than partial burning and misfiring are in close proximity to the wall surjiies of the combustion chamber. The significance of this observation is that unburnt NC emissionsfrom spark <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> may be reduced at their sources of production using in-cylinder catalysts on the surfaces of the combustion chamber wall. This paper examines in detail a novel approach to reduce exhaust HC emissions using an in-cylinder catalyst on the combustion chamber walls, in particular, the surfaces of the crevice volumes. Platinum-rhodium coating on the piston crown led to a reduction of approximately 20 per cent in engine-out HC emissions over a wide range of engine operating conditions.
