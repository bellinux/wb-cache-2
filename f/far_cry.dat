5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 was an {{improvement}} over <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 did not stray far away from <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{gameplay}} {{elements were}} directly taken from <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3. Exotic locations, hunting, {{and the freedom}} for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 an evolution for the series. As a result, {{the size of the}} game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons. The team also realized that players {{spent a lot of time}} interacting with the open world of <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3, and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.|$|E
5|$|Announced in May 2014, {{development}} on <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 began {{immediately after the}} shipment of Assassin's Creed III in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3 that continues 3s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided {{to develop a new}} setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films Ichi the Killer and Brother. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto.|$|E

25|$|Crysis uses Microsoft's API, Direct3D for {{graphics}} rendering, {{and includes}} the same editor {{that was used}} by Crytek to create the game. The game runs on a new engine (CryEngine 2) that is the successor to <b>Far</b> <b>Crys</b> CryEngine. CryEngine 2 {{was among the first}} engines to use the Direct3D 10 (DirectX 10) framework of Windows Vista, but was designed primarily to run using DirectX 9, both on Vista and Windows XP.|$|R

5|$|Ubisoft {{expected}} {{the game to}} sell at least six million copies {{in its first year}} of release. <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 became the fastest-selling game and the most successful launch in the series {{in the first week of}} release. <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 was the second best selling game in the United Kingdom for all-formats during the week of its release, only behind Grand Theft Auto V. It was also the sixth best selling game in the US according to The NPD Group. As of December 31, 2014, the game has shipped seven million copies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 was {{met with}} a mostly {{positive}} critical reception upon release. Critics praised the open world design, visuals, soundtrack, and characters, particularly antagonist Pagan Min, {{as well as new}} gameplay additions and the wealth of content. However, some critics disliked the story and found the game too similar to its predecessor. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by the end of 2014, and was the biggest launch in the franchise's history. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently published. A sequel, <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 5, is set to be released in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Evolves environments {{are based}} on Earth's as the design team {{wanted to create a}} world that felt {{believable}} for players and had regions that made geological sense after an early concept design was found to be too extreme. As a result, the design team drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. The design team wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. The design team tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. The design team then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> and Crysis. As the design team felt that <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> and Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters can hide from each other, as well as presenting a sense of surprise when players are ambushed.|$|E
25|$|Crysis {{contains}} a level editor called Sandbox, much like <b>Far</b> <b>Crys,</b> in which new levels {{can be created}} and edited. Such levels will have full support in all multiplayer modes. This will allow the player to easily build their own levels, seeing everything in real time within the editor. The player can also jump into the map {{they are working on}} at any time to test it. The editor is the same one that was used by Crytek to create the game.|$|R

5|$|McCabe totalled 385 runs at 42.78 for {{the series}} and was the only Australian batsman other than Bradman to score a century, as the English decisively won the series 41. He took three wickets at 71.66, and opened the bowling {{in some of the}} matches due to Australia's lack of fast bowling. It was a <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the {{intimidation}} that Bodyline provided.|$|E
5|$|The match started amid clear weather, a <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> {{from the}} {{previous}} Ashes Test at the ground in 1938, which was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to continuous rain for several days. The outfield was also smooth and green, a contrast to its state during World War II, when it was left cratered by German bombing raids. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E

Popular game series from Germany include Turrican, the Anno series, The Settlers series, the Gothic series, SpellForce, the FIFA Manager series, <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> and Crysis. Relevant game {{developers}} and publishers are Blue Byte, Crytek, Deep Silver, Kalypso Media, Piranha Bytes, Yager Development, and some of the largest social network game companies like Bigpoint, Gameforge, Goodgame and Wooga.|$|E
5|$|According to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, {{the team}} {{originally}} used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, {{realizing that the}} best way to create a tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armor, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought that this would be enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience. The game's music was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had worked on the score of the previous Rainbow Six games and the <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> series. His co-composer was Ben Frost, who debuted his first video game soundtrack with Siege. Leon Purviance assisted Frost and Haslinger in composing the music.|$|E
5|$|According to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond, {{the series}} {{had become too}} grueling and {{complicated}} for modern gamers, and its popularity had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as Assassin's Creed and <b>Far</b> <b>Cry.</b> The Toronto studio hoped to introduce the franchise to a broader audience, while remaining tactical and hardcore for long-term series fans. It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities. The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players, crafting open-ended levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play. The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity, allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.|$|E

Other BBC radio dramas produced and directed by Jane Morgan (a lifelong, friend and colleague) included her Dickens series.|$|R
5|$|Affected by her {{association}} with Cheng Shuyao, Shangguan {{did not play}} any major role for several years. This changed in 1955, when she starred in the film Storm on the Southern Island. Director Bai Chen (白沉) chose her to play the leading role as a heroic nurse, a <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from her traditional roles of socialites and rich wives. She adjusted to her new role well, and portrayed {{a wide variety of}} characters in many films including It's My Day Off (1959), Spring Comes to the Withered Tree (1961, director Zheng Junli), Early Spring in February (1963, director Xie Tieli), and Stage Sisters (1965, director Xie Jin).

5|$|An art {{exhibition}} of Little Busters! {{was held in}} Osaka, Japan between May 3 and May 4, 2007, and in Tokyo, Japan between May 24 and May 25, 2007. A large amount of the character and background art featured in the game was showcased, along with original art used to promote the character artwork, and other production sketches drawn when the game was still in development. Flowcharts outlining the story for the game were on display, along with the flowcharts for Clannad. Also at the exhibition was a life-size mannequin of Rin Natsume with a baseball glove in one hand, though instead of a baseball, a cat was in the glove. This mannequin was later put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website in late September 2007 and sold for 764,000 yen, a <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the original wish of selling the figure for 5,000,000 yen.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It was a <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But {{it would not be a}} replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E

5|$|His 1964–65 tour of {{the subcontinent}} {{on the way back}} to Australia was even worse, a <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from his leading role in the {{previous}} tour to the subcontinent. After making 40 and 0 in the First Test win in Madras, he was unable to bat either innings in the Second Test in Bombay after being hospitalised due to persistent vomiting, injury as Australia ceded their series lead. He missed the remainder of the series, the Third Test in Calcutta and a one-off Test in Pakistan. Upon his return home, he has a shortened domestic season before Australia left for the West Indies. In five domestic matches, he scored 357 runs at 59.50, including a 133 not against South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1960–61 NBA season, Robertson {{made himself}} {{eligible}} for the 1960 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals as a territorial pick. The Royals gave Robertson a $33,000 signing bonus, a <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from his childhood days when he was too poor to afford a basketball. In his rookie season, Robertson averaged 30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.7 assists (leading the league), almost averaging a triple-double for the entire season. He was named NBA Rookie of the Year, was elected into the All-NBA First Team – which would happen in each of Robertson's first nine seasons – and made the first of 12 consecutive All-Star Game appearances. In addition, he was named the 1961 NBA All-Star Game MVP following his 23-point, 14-assist, 9-rebound performance in a West victory. However, the Royals finished with a 33–46 record and stayed in the cellar of the Western Division.|$|E

5000|$|... "Break Down Here" [...] is a mid-tempo ballad centralizing on the narrator, who {{is driving}} by {{herself on the}} freeway, {{escaping}} a failed relationship with all of her belongings {{in the back of}} the vehicle. Realizing that her vehicle is beginning to make a noise and that she is far from an exit, she states that she would [...] "sure hate to break down here". The phrase has a double meaning, in that she does not want the vehicle to break down, and she does not want to break down and cry ("I've made it this <b>far</b> without <b>crying</b> a single tear").|$|R
