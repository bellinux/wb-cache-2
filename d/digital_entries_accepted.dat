40|$|Many {{argue that}} {{monitoring}} conducted exclusively by scientists {{is insufficient to}} address ongoing environmental challenges. One solution entails the use of mobile digital devices in participatory monitoring (PM) programs. But how <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> affects programs with varying levels of stakeholder participation, from nonscientists collecting field data to nonscientists administering every step of a monitoring program, remains unclear. We reviewed the successes, in terms of management interventions and sustainability, of 107 monitoring programs described in the literature (hereafter programs) and compared these with case studies from our PM experiences in Australia, Canada, Ethiopia, Ghana, Greenland, and Vietnam (hereafter cases). Our literature review showed that participatory programs {{were less likely to}} use digital devices, and 2 of our 3 more participatory cases were also slow to adopt <b>digital</b> data <b>entry.</b> Programs that were participatory and used digital devices {{were more likely to report}} management actions, which was consistent with cases in Ethiopia, Greenland, and Australia. Programs engaging volunteers were more frequently reported as ongoing, but those involving <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> were less often sustained when data collectors were volunteers. For the Vietnamese and Canadian cases, sustainability was undermined by a mismatch in stakeholder objectives. In the Ghanaian case, complex field protocols diminished monitoring sustainability. Innovative technologies attract interest, but the foundation of effective participatory adaptive monitoring depends more on collaboratively defined questions, objectives, conceptual models, and monitoring approaches. When this foundation is built through effective partnerships, <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> can enable the collection of more data of higher quality. Without this foundation, or when implemented ineffectively or unnecessarily, <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> can be an additional expense that distracts from core monitoring objectives and undermines project sustainability. The appropriate role of <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> in PM likely depends more on the context in which it is used and less on the technology itself. </p...|$|R

50|$|The Parrish {{also has}} a long {{tradition}} of juried exhibitions. For most of the Museum’s history, these exhibitions were open to all artists, who were selected by a panel of three judges. In 2008, in recognition of the Museum’s important mission of celebrating the art of the East End, the format changed. Submissions were limited to artists from eastern Long Island, whose <b>digital</b> <b>entries</b> were reviewed by nine established artists from the region. Each juror gradually narrowed his or her choices until a single selection was made. The nine chosen artists exhibited their work in tandem with the artists who selected them. This format not only focused on the artists of the region but also encouraged interaction among artists at different points in their careers. Artists Choose Artists of the East End will be a recurring program.|$|R
