50|$|The <b>Hardcard</b> II and <b>Hardcard</b> II XL were advertised with {{effective}} access {{times as a}} result of the disk cache. The <b>Hardcard</b> II listed both times, but <b>Hardcard</b> II XL only listed the effective access time. The <b>Hardcard</b> EZ line returned to listing the access times without the benefit of the cache.|$|E
50|$|All <b>Hardcard</b> {{products}} up to {{and including}} <b>Hardcard</b> II XL were produced under the Plus Development name. The <b>Hardcard</b> EZ was released under the Quantum name after Quantum absorbed the wholly owned subsidiary Plus Development.|$|E

50|$|Hence Plus {{development}} <b>hardcards</b> are {{not physically}} compatible, {{as they are}} too long to fit in a Tandy 1000 computer. If the cover is removed, and the metal plate is removed so that a Plus Development card could fit in physically, it would work normally.|$|R
50|$|For most Tandy 1000 models (other {{than the}} compact EX and HX) {{that did not}} come already {{equipped}} with a hard drive, Tandy offered hard disk options {{in the form of}} <b>hardcards</b> that were installed in one of the computer's expansion slots and consisted of a controller and drive (typically a 3.5-inch MFM or RLL unit with a Western Digital controller) mounted together on a metal bracket. Although this arrangement provided a neat physical coupling between the controller and the disk, single-sector internal transfers and dependence on the speed of the host machine to transfer data to memory meant that a trial-and-error approach was still needed to set the disk interleave correctly to ensure optimum transfer rates. Even then, transfer rates could be as low as 40 KB/s for 8088 and 8086 machines.|$|R
5000|$|The AT Attachment (ATA) {{hard disk}} {{interface}} is directly descended from ISA (the AT bus). ATA has {{its origins in}} <b>hardcards</b> that integrated a hard disk controller (HDC) — usually with an ST-506/ST-412 interface — and a hard disk drive on the same ISA adapter. This was at best awkward from a mechanical structural standpoint, as ISA slots were not designed to support such heavy devices as hard disks (and the 3.5" [...] form-factor hard disks of the time were about twice as tall and heavy as modern drives), so {{the next generation of}} Integrated Drive Electronics drives moved both the drive and controller to a drive bay and used a ribbon cable and a very simple interface board to connect it to an ISA slot. ATA, at its essence, is basically a standardization of this arrangement, combined with a uniform command structure for software to interface with the controller on a drive. ATA has since been separated from the ISA bus, and connected directly to the local bus (usually by integration into the chipset), to be clocked much much faster than ISA could support and with much higher throughput. (Notably when ISA was introduced as the AT bus, there was no distinction between a local and extension bus, and there were no chipsets.) Still, ATA retains details which reveal its relationship to ISA. The 16-bit transfer size is the most obvious example; the signal timing, particularly in the PIO modes, is also highly correlated, and the interrupt and DMA mechanisms are clearly from ISA. (The article about ATA has more detail about this history.) ...|$|R
50|$|After the {{introduction}} of <b>Hardcard,</b> Plus Development continued working on higher capacity hard drives in the same form factor of the first <b>Hardcard.</b> The brand name became so widely known the name was continued through the follow on products.|$|E

50|$|By 1985, Plus Development had {{engineered}} {{their first}} Hardcard; {{it had a}} 10 megabyte (MB) capacity; its suggested retail price was $1,095. In the mid-1980s, hard drives were as small as 1.6 inches tall, {{but in order to}} fit into a single ISA PC card expansion slot a custom one-inch thick hard drive had to be designed. Having spent $15 million on the project, Plus Development started shipping <b>Hardcard</b> in October 1985, and trademarked the <b>Hardcard</b> brand in 1988.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hardcard</b> is the genericized {{trademark}} for a {{hard disk}} drive, disk controller, and host adapter on an expansion card {{for a personal}} computer.|$|E
50|$|Users {{could buy}} a <b>hardcard</b> which was a hard drive mounted on an {{expansion}} card that would fit inside. This PC was in service in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Within {{one year}} of the Plus Development {{introduction}} of <b>Hardcard,</b> 28 companies had released similar products. At that time, {{all of the other}} products were using a standard hard drive with a 1.6 inch/40.6 mm height forcing the card to hang over the adjacent PC slot. The hard drive was located on the opposite side away from the connector sometimes enabling a short half-length expansion card to be installed in the adjacent slot. These hard drive cards were usually described as occupying 1.5 expansion slots.Below are some of companies and product names with a similar product to the Plus <b>Hardcard.</b>|$|E
50|$|Plus Development Corporation was a majority-owned {{subsidiary}} of Quantum Corporation and invented the <b>Hardcard</b> {{hard disk drive}} on a card which started a wave of companies producing similar products in the late 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Plus Development, a {{subsidiary}} of Quantum Corporation, developed the first ISA <b>Hardcard,</b> and released it in October 1985. By June 1986, 28 of Plus Development's competitors were producing similar products. The term has been used generically to refer to any hard disk on a card.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hardcard</b> {{provided}} {{the computer industry}} with the first one-inch-thick HDD, {{but it was an}} interface and form factor only compatible with the full length card slot of the ISA bus first introduced with the IBM PC. As such it had a thicker head disk assembly than the subsequently introduced 1-inch high standard form factor 3½-inch HDDs.|$|E
50|$|Typically a {{hard disk}} drive (HDD) {{installs}} into a drive bay; cables connect the drive to a host adapter and power source. If the personal computer lacks an available bus on a compatible host adapter, then one may have to install an adapter into an expansion slot. The <b>Hardcard</b> supplies its own host adapter, and doesn't require an empty drive bay.|$|E
50|$|While sources {{inside the}} company during {{the launch of}} <b>Hardcard</b> claim {{it was the first}} HDD {{controller}} integrated into the drive printed circuit board, Xebec, a HDD controller manufacturer in the early 1980s, had already done that with their Owl product around August 1984. It was a complete 5.25 inch half-height HDD with an integrated controller and drive electronics on the same printed circuit board with a SASI interface.|$|E
50|$|Early on, {{the company}} {{designed}} smaller ST-506-compatible versions of its hard drives, the Q500 series, {{using the same}} servo system. In 1985, it introduced the Plus <b>Hardcard,</b> which was essentially a smaller version of the Q500, designed to fit in an ISA slot. In 1986, Quantum entered the then-new SCSI market with the Q280 80MB drive, {{which was one of}} the first mass-market drives to use embedded servo. Later on, Quantum combined the Q280's embedded controller design with the servo hardware from the Q500 series, and developed the ProDrive range, which was also its first drive family to support the ATA interface.|$|E
