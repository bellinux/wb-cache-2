40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of enzyme supplementation on the bioavailable energy (AMEn) and apparent digestibilities of lipid (ALD) and protein (APD) in young broiler chicks was examined for diets containing either wheat, hulled or hulless barley, naked oats, or spring rye. Dietary AMEn, APD, and ALD values were depressed (P <. 01) for all test grains (except hulled Bedford barley) as the inclusion {{rate of the}} grain replacing wheat increased. The antinutritives, (3 -glucans (barley and oats) and pentosans (rye), had the most pronounced effect on ALD. The decreases in ALD were 43, 77, and 67 % for chicks fed diets containing 70 % Scout barley (hulless), Terra oats, and Gazelle rye, respectively, compared with those fed the control wheat diet. Enzyme supplementation increased (P <. 01) AMEn, APD, and ALD for all test cereals. The corresponding increases in the AMEn, of the enzyme-supplemented diets containing 70 % HY 320 wheat, Bedford barley, Scout barley, Terra oats, and Gazelle rye diets were 4, 7, 42, 33, and 14 %, respectively, compared with their unsupplemented counterparts. Enzyme treatment also improved (P <. 01) weight gains and feed conversion efficiencies of chicks fed diets containing each of the cereals. Overall, the results demonstrate that the nutritive value of cereal grains such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye can be improved {{by the addition of}} crude fungal extracts to the diet of young chicks. {Key words: enzyme supplementation, protein digestibility, lipid digestibility, bioavailable <b>energy,</b> <b>cereal</b> grains...|$|E

40|$|Energy plants, {{cultivated}} on set-aside land, could substitute nearly 3 % of {{the primary}} energy in Germany and could raise the income of farmers. However, the substitution of fossil fuels by plants requires the selection of plant species with high site suitability, an ecologically benign farming system and high yields. If these requirements are satisfied, a durable economic and ecological advantage, {{as well as the}} acceptance by politics and the public can be expected. Method and Material A field trial site was established as a split-plot on sandy soil (Sl, Albic Luvisol) in Potsdam-Bornim in 1994. On 3 hectares of land ten different annual and perennial energy plants intended for combustion were tested under comparable soil and climate conditions (540 mm/a; 9, 4 °C). Objects of the evaluation were plant species such as cocksfoot grass, poplar, willow, Jerusalem artichoke and hemp, as well as <b>energy</b> <b>cereals</b> such as triticale, winter rye and perennial rye. The yearly nitrogen-fertilisation was carried out at three intensity levels from 0 up to 150 kg N/ha for each crop.

40|$|The <b>energy</b> {{value of}} <b>cereal</b> grains for {{livestock}} varies widely between grains and animal species. For example, the digestible energy content for pigs of wheat and barley grain ranges from 13. 3 to 17. 0 MJ/kg and 11. 7 to 16. 0 MJ/kg, respectively. However, the digestible energy content of sorghum grain for pigs shows little variation from 17. 0 to 18. 0 MJ/kg. Hughes & Choct reported a similar wide range across some grains in apparent metabolisable energy (AME) values for broiler chickens, being from 10. 4 to 15. 9 MJ/kg for wheat, 10. 4 to 13. 5 MJ/kg for barley and 8. 6 to 16. 6 MJ/kg for triticale. The chicken AME values for sorghum and maize, again, show a small range from only 15. 6 to 16. 1 MJ/kg, {{with a similar}} small range for oat grain (11. 8 to 12. 4 MJ/kg). Significant variation exists between grains in the digestibility of starch within the rumen of cattle, being 0. 92 for oat grain, 0. 65 for maize and 0. 62 for sorghum starch. There are also striking differences between animal species in their capacity to digest cereal starch.

40|$|International audienceBackground: No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached how to measure the effectiveness of climate change mitigation in the land-use sector and how to prioritize land use accordingly. We used the long-term cumulative and average sectorial C stocks in biomass, soil and products, C stock changes, the substitution of fossil energy and of energy-intensive products, and net present value (NPV) as evaluation criteria for {{the effectiveness of a}} hectare of productive land to mitigate climate change and produce economic returns. We evaluated land management options using real-life data of Thuringia, a region representative for central-western European conditions, and input from life cycle assessment, with a carbon-tracking model. We focused on solid biomass use for energy production. Results: In forestry, the traditional timber production was most economically viable and most climate-friendly due to an assumed recycling rate of 80 % of wood products for bioenergy. Intensification towards "pure bioenergy production" would reduce the average sectorial C stocks and the C substitution and would turn NPV negative. In the forest conservation (non-use) option, the sectorial C stocks increased by 52 % against timber production, which was not compensated by foregone wood products and C substitution. Among the cropland options wheat for food with straw use for <b>energy,</b> whole <b>cereals</b> for <b>energy,</b> and short rotation coppice for bioenergy the latter was most climate-friendly. However, specific subsidies or incentives for perennials would be needed to favour this option. Conclusions: When using the harvested products as materials prior to energy use there is no climate argument to support intensification by switching from sawn-wood timber production towards energy-wood in forestry systems. A legal framework would be needed to ensure that harvested products are first used for raw materials prior to energy use. Only an effective recycling of biomaterials frees land for long-term sustained C sequestration by conservation. Reuse cascades avoid additional emissions from shifting production or intensification. 2012 Böttcher et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A six-year {{research}} program, “Premium Grains for Livestock”, {{funded by}} the Grains R&D Corporation, several animal R&D Corporations and Ridley Agriproducts is focussed on {{improving the quality of}} cereal grains for livestock. Cereal grains provide the major source of energy for animals raised in intensive production systems. However, the <b>energy</b> available from <b>cereal</b> grains can vary widely between both grain and animal species. For example, the digestible energy (DE) content of wheat and barley for pigs has been reported to range from 13. 3 to 17. 0 and from 11. 7 to 16. 0 MJ/kg, respectively (van Barneveld, 1999). Similarly, Hughes and Choct (1999) reported a range in apparent metabolisable energy (AME, MJ/kg) for broiler chickens from 10. 4 to 15. 9 MJ/kg for wheat, 10. 4 to 13. 5 for barley and 8. 6 to 16. 6 for triticale. There are also large differences between animal species in their capacity to digest starch in cereals. Sorghum starch is almost completely digested by poultry, compared with significant excretion of sorghum starch in the faeces of cattle (Rowe et al. 1999). A primary aim of the research is to identify the chemical, physical and morphological characteristics of grains that determine their nutritional value for sheep, cattle, pigs and poultry...|$|R
40|$|Maximising {{digestible}} energy (DE) yield from cereals {{is fundamental to}} optimising efficiency in pig and poultry production systems. Given the potential interaction between grain structure and composition and DE (or AME) yields in monogastrics, consideration {{must be given to}} cost–effective interventions that may improve available energy supply from grains. Processing options such as extrusion and expansion have potential to significantly disrupt cellular arrangements within a grain and gelatinize the starch components, but the resulting increase in energy yield must be significant if the additional processing costs are to be justified. Such responses are poorly defined for specific cereals. The objective of this experiment was to assess the influence of extrusion of milled cereal grains and expansion of hydrated whole cereal grains on DE yield {{at the end of the}} small intestine and across the entire digestive tract in pigs, broiler chickens and laying hens. The results suggest that if <b>energy</b> yield from <b>cereal</b> grains for pigs, broiler chickens and laying hens is to be consistently improved, interventions other than extrusion or expansion are required, or a better understanding of the factors influencing specific responses to processing treatments is required. Results from the current experiment reveal that apparently similar cereal grains can respond differently when subjected to identical extrusion or expansion treatments...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was made to}} study {{the effect of the}} duration of the excreta collection period on the True Metabolizable Energy (TME) values of cereals as wheat, maize and barley and wheat bran. The {{experiment was}} performed with 48 mature Cornish and Rhode Island Red (RIR) cockerel strains, under standard conditions. Droppings voided during the experimental period were collected and assayed for gross energy and nitrogen. The results showed that the rate of excretion of EEL (32. 71 % for Cornish and 17. 82 % for RIR) and nitrogen (40. 26 % for Cornish and 22. 80 % for RIR) voided by adult birds of two strains decreases during the period of fasting bird (12 to 72 h). The effect of fasting period (12, 24, 48 and 72 h) on the TME values obtained of barley, wheat and maize 18. 98, 6. 24 and 16. 32 % for Cornish and 12. 78, 7. 82 and 8. 31 % for RIR birds, were significantly due to be reduced respectively.

40|$|Current {{conventional}} agricultural systems using intensive {{energy has}} to be re-vitalized by new integrated approaches relying on renewable energy resources, which can allow farmers to stop depending on fossil resources. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare wheat production in dryland (low input) and irrigated (high input) systems in terms of energy ratio, energy efficiency, benefit/cost ratio and amount of renewable energy use. Data were collected from 50 irrigated and 50 dryland wheat growers by using a face-to-face questionnaire in 2009. The results showed that the total energy requirement under low input was 9354. 2 Â MJÂ ha- 1, whereas under high input systems it was 45367. 6 Â MJÂ ha- 1. Total energy input consumed in both dryland and irrigated systems could be classified as direct, indirect, renewable and non-renewable energies which average in two wheat production systems were 47 %, 53 %, 24 % and 76 %, respectively. Energy ratios of 3. 38 in dryland and 1. 44 in irrigated systems were achieved. The benefit-cost ratios were 2. 56 in dryland and 1. 97 in irrigated wheat production systems. Based on the results of the present study, dry-land farming can have a significant positive effect on energy-related factors especially in dry and semi-dry climates such as Iran. <b>Cereals</b> <b>Energy</b> efficiency Low-input systems Rain-fed Triticum aestivum...|$|R
40|$|The use of cereals {{and other}} {{agricultural}} crops for energy purposes and the increased demand for food world-wide have increased cereal prices. However since energy prices have also increased, it can still be profitable to use <b>cereals</b> for <b>energy</b> production. To date, the cereals used for bioenergy have usually been grown {{in the same way}} as food and feed cereals, but there is scope to tailor the cultivation system to the end product. The overall objective of this project was to improve the profitability of <b>cereal</b> cultivation for <b>energy</b> purposes. Changes to the cultivation system in terms of e. g. choice of crop and cultivar, strategies for fertilisation and crop protection and transport/handling of cereals for bioethanol production or combustion were studied. Timeliness costs associated with bioenergy cereals were also examined. The financial impact of changes in the cultivation system for bioenergy cereals was then examined for three typical farms, located in the provinces of Skåne, Östergötland and Uppland. Based on the results obtained, concrete guidelines for farmers were formulated. The average arable area of the typical farms was 203 ha, the farms had a seven-year crop rotation and for all locations winter wheat was the dominant crop but triticale and oats were also included. Two cultivation systems, Traditional and Energy, were examined. In the Energy cultivation system, the winter wheat and triticale were used for bioethanol production in an ethanol plant located in Norrköping (Östergötland), while the oats were used for combustion in plants close to the typical farms. The results showed that cultivation of bioenergy cereals did not differ greatly from cultivation of food/feed cereals. However, when cultivating cereals for bioethanol production it is important to adapt the nitrogen fertilisation strategy to achieve high starch content together with high yields of the specific cultivar grown. The most important change in the Energy system proved to be decreasing the nitrogen fertiliser dose to winter wheat for bioethanol production compared with food winter wheat, by 25 kg per ha and year overall for the typical farms. Yield then decreased by 200 kg per ha. There are currently no cereal cultivars developed specifically for combustion, but plant breeders should work towards producing cultivars that combine high yield with high energy content per kg dry matter. The economic analyses of the typical farms showed that the Traditional system gave higher profits than the Energy system in Uppland and Skåne, but the systems were equally profitable in Östergötland. This was because the ethanol plant was located in Östergötland, so the transport costs were the same for both systems in this province but were higher for the Energy system in Skåne and Uppland. Detailed analysis of the <b>energy</b> <b>cereals</b> grown showed that due mainly to the increased transport costs associated with the ethanol plant being located in Norrköping, the price of winter wheat for ethanol production in Skåne should be 0. 06 SEK/kg higher than the price of feed wheat to achieve the same level of profit. In Östergötland the profitability was higher for bioethanol wheat both when delivered at harvest or after storage (in December). For delivery at harvest, for each percentage increase in starch content there was a bonus of SEK 0. 02 per kg winter wheat produced, and also higher permitted grain water content on delivery to the ethanol plant. The price of bioethanol wheat could therefore be 0. 08 SEK/kg lower at harvest delivery and 0. 03 SEK/kg lower at delivery after storage without lowering the profitability compared with feed wheat. For Uppland the profitability for bioethanol wheat was comparable with that of feed wheat. Compared with wheat, the profitability of triticale increased more when it was used for bioethanol instead of feed. The price of oats for combustion rather than for feed could decrease for all typical farms without decreasing profitability due to the subsidy available for cultivation of energy crops and to the decreased transport costs when the combustion plant is located close to the typical farm. In this study timeliness costs had minor effects on overall costs, at most constituting 4 % of the total. Lower quality requirements (falling number) on bioethanol wheat compared with food wheat resulted in lower timeliness costs for the Energy system, while timeliness costs for the other cereals studied were similar...|$|R
