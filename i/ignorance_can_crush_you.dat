500|$|After the war, Harlan {{claimed that}} no other {{director}} would touch the project and that he himself had tried to decline the role of director. The filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, in her 1987 memoir, confirmed that Harlan had told her of Goebbels's insistence that he direct the film and of his ardent desire {{to get out of}} the project. Harlan had even written to Goebbels volunteering for military service in order to avoid making the film. Goebbels' responded to this by informing Harlan that, if he enlisted, he would do his military service at the front. According to Harlan, Goebbels screamed at him, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>crush</b> <b>you</b> like a bug on the wall!" [...] When Harlan asked Riefenstahl to intercede for him with Goebbels, she demurred citing her own conflicts with the propaganda minister. Instead of intervening on his behalf, Riefenstahl advised Harlan to move to Switzerland; however, Harlan expressed fear for his life and the impact it would have on his wife.|$|R

5000|$|Gravity, {{gaps in the}} floors, and {{wandering}} enemies {{stand in}} the way of Flappy reaching his goal. Flappy can pick up and throw sleeping mushrooms at the enemies to knock them out for a while, or drop stones on them to crush them permanently. There are, however, many obstacles along the way: brick walls you must work your way around, brown stones which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>crush</b> but which <b>can</b> also <b>crush</b> <b>you</b> if they fall on you, holes or dead angles in which the blue stone becomes irretrievable if it falls into them, and moving enemies. The game features just two enemies: Unicorns and Ebira. Unicorns are green creatures that move in mostly-repetitive horizontal patterns. Ebira are red crab-like enemies (the word [...] "ebi" [...] is a Japanese term for shellfish) that relentlessly chase Flappy both horizontally and vertically. Ebira tend to mimic Flappy's movements, so Flappy must be careful to avoid being charged by a persistent Ebira.|$|R
