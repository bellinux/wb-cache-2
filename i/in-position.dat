40|$|An {{explicit}} {{finite element}} method was used to study the neck load and the contact force between an occupant and an airbag during an out-of-position frontal automobile crash. Two different folding patterns and two different mounting angles of the airbag were simulated. For the four cases simulated, the occupant’s neck axial force ranged from 156 to 376 % of the data obtained from <b>in-position</b> sled tests using the Hybrid III dummy. The neck shear force ranged from 87 to 229 % and the neck flexion moment ranged from 68 to 127 % of <b>in-position</b> experimental results. In both 300 mounting angle simulations, the neck axial forces were {{higher than that of}} the two simulations with 00 mounting angles, but the trend for the neck shear force was the opposite. Although the kinematics of the model appear reasonable, the numbers generated by the model must be reviewed with great caution because the model has not been fully validated...|$|E

Metal-bonded ball-headed {{diamond wheel}} with small {{diameter}} {{has been widely}} used in the ultra-precision grinding of optical parts, especially in the parts with complex surface. <b>In-position</b> precise dressing technique of ball-headed diamond wheel is the key technology to improve grinding precision. The effect of mechanical errors on the profile accuracy of wheel dressing were theoretically analyzed firstly. Afterwards a ball-headed diamond wheel dressing equipment based on electrical discharge principle has been designed and built. Orthogonal experiments {{have been carried out}} on the dressing equipment, and the dressing quality of wheels under different dressing electrical parameters were analyzed in terms of wheel profile accuracy and wheel surface micro-topography. The influence of dressing electrical parameters on the dressing quality were investigated and the best electrical parameter combination was obtained. Experimental result showed that the wheel profile accuracy can reach upward 0. 8 µm after dressing, and the protrusion heights of diamond grain were uniformity and the protrusion effect was better than without dressing...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that in the rear seat of cars, small {{children}} squirm, slide, slump, sleep, play and interact with their fellow passengers. Our previous findings from a pilot study show that children rarely remain in an optimal position for the efficient functioning of their restraint systems throughout the duration of their journey. Such behaviours may not only affect restraint effectiveness but may also have a negative influence on driver performance and distraction. Moreover, quantification of children’s position and out-of-position (OOP) status (i. e., their actual position relative to the ideal position for which the technology was designed) has important implications for design of test programs using anthropomorphic test devices (ATD) intended to mimic the human occupant. For example, understanding true pre-crash positions may lead to different design specifications of rear seat restraint systems and energy management features of the vehicle interior compared with the kinds of solutions that might arise from evaluations with an <b>in-position</b> ATD. This paper builds on our preliminary research findings and describes the design of the first international large-scale study of children in cars which uses innovative methods to observe and quantify the positions of child occupants in cars and identify the injury effects of OOP status and its impact on driver distraction. The study will facilitate a paradigm-shifting advance in child occupant protection – from the concept of safety technology designed to protect an ideally positioned occupant to the concept of dynamic restraint systems that maintain optimal restraint over a range of expected child positions/movements in a vehicle. Outcomes of the research will directly inform the design of future restraints for children, the development of appropriate crash test procedures that account for natural positions of child occupants, and the development of community awareness messages to improve the safety of children...|$|E
40|$|There are {{increasing}} fears that trade reform - and globalization generally - {{will increase the}} uncertainty the average (especially less skilled) worker faces. If product markets become more competitive and the access to foreign inputs is increased, will demand for workers among existing firms become more elastic? Will labor markets become more volatile because bad shocks to output will translate into greater impacts on wages and employment? So far the literature on this question has focused almost entirely on labor demand within continuing firms. But much of the movement {{in the job market}} arises from the entry and exit of firms. The authors show that firms entering and exiting a market contribute almost as much to employment changes as firms continuing in a market. In several samples, firms entering and exiting affected the net change <b>in-positions</b> more than the expansion of continuing plants did, although contributions varied greatly across the business cycle and period of adjustment. Estimates of labor demand elasticities of entering and exiting firms were surprisingly similar in Chile and Colombia and somewhat higher than elasticities for firms that survived. Estimates of the effect of trade liberalization offer only ambiguous lessons on trade reform's probable impact on these elasticities. The data suggest that in Chile greater exchange rate protection does reduce the wage-employment elasticity of entering and exiting plants, but the results are reversed in Colombia's case. Moreover, in Colombia higher import penetration lowers the elasticity of labor demand and in Chile higher tariffs increase it. These findings,combined with very ambiguous results from probit regressions on the determinants of plant exit, suggest that circumspection is warranted in asserting that trade liberalization will increase the wage elasticity of labor demand.

40|$|Recent {{years the}} {{numerical}} method of the simulation for the airbag deployment {{process has been}} improved with new material model and thermodynamic model, {{and has become a}} standard application of finite element codes. With such simulation tools, it is possible to attempt supporting the airbag module design and evaluating the injuries of dummy in airbag hazard area or out-of-position. Although the simulation model for the airbag’s deployment process is usually correlated with the static airbag deployments and reaction force results, up-to-date the numerical approach to represent the fluid flow within the airbag is both costly and time consuming. This paper will provide an overview of the correlation process for reducing the resource to be invested. The following two tests are conducted for acquiring the reference data. 1. Static deployment test for acquiring the airbag internal pressure during the deployment process and 2. Drop tower test for acquiring the fully deployed airbag’s reaction force. The drop tower test is simulated to determine the parameter related to the leakage of fabric and vent holes with the airbag model using the uniform pressure method offering the relatively short solving time. And then Static deployment test is simulated for determining the parameter related to the unfolding phase with the airbag model using the corpuscular (particle) method. These two simulations are compared to the test results and satisfactory correlation is found in both the cases. The drop tower simulation using the uniform pressure method leads to reduce the total correlation time and to easily extend the application for protection of the driver occupant while <b>in-position.</b> This airbag model can be used in parametric studies to investigate the effects of airbag module design changes and to study the out-of-position (OOP) load case...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of ‘good governance’ in Indonesia’s regional government sector became a central tenet in governance research following {{the introduction of}} the national code for governance in 2006. The code was originally drafted in 1999 {{as a response to the}} Asian financial crises and many cases of unearthed corruption, collusion, and nepotism. It was reviewed in 2001 and again in 2006 to incorporate relevant political, economical, and social developments. Even though the national code exists along with many regional government decrees on good governance, the extent of {{implementation of}} the tenets of good governance in Indonesia’s regional government is still questioned. Previous research on good governance implementation in Indonesian regional government (Mardiasmo, Barnes and Sakurai, 2008) identified differences in the nature and depth of implementation between various Indonesian regional governments. This paper analyses and extends this recent work and explores key factors that may impede the implementation and sustained application of governance practices across regional settings. The bureaucratic culture of Indonesian regional government is one that has been shaped for over approximately 30 years, in particular during that of the Soeharto regime. Previous research on this regime suggests a bureaucratic culture with a mix of positive and negative aspects. On one hand Soeharto’s regime resulted in strong development growth and strong economic fundamentals, resulting in Indonesia being recognised as one of the Asian economic tigers prior to the 1997 Asian financial crises. The financial crises however revealed a bureaucratic culture that was rife with corruption, collusion, and nepotism. Although subsequent Indonesian governments have been committed to eradicating entrenched practices it seems apparent that the culture is ingrained within the bureaucracy and eradication of it will take time. Informants from regional government agree with this observation, as they identify good governance as an innovative mechanism and to implement it will mean a deviation from the “old ways. ” Thus there is a need for a “changed” mind set in order to implement sustained governance practices. Such an exercise has proven to be challenging so far, as there is “hidden” resistance from within the bureaucracy to change its ways. The inertia of such bureaucratic cultures forms a tension against the opportunity for the implementation of good governance. From this context an emergent finding is the existence of a ‘bureaucratic generation gap’ as an impeding variable to enhanced and more efficient implementation of governance systems. It was found that after the Asian financial crises the Indonesian government (both at national and regional level) drew upon a wider human resources pool to fill government positions – including entrants from academia, the private sector, international institutions, foreign nationals and new graduates. It suggested that this change in human capital within government is at the core of this ‘inter-generational divide. ’ This divergence is exemplified, at one extreme, by [older] bureaucrats who have been <b>in-position</b> for long periods of time serving during the extended Soeharto regime. The “new” bureaucrats have only sat in their positions since the end of Asian financial crisis and did not serve during Soeharto’s regime. It is argued that the existence of this generation gap and associated aspects of organisational culture have significantly impeded modernising governance practices across regional Indonesia. This paper examines the experiences of government employees in five Indonesian regions: Solok, Padang, Gorontalo, Bali, and Jakarta. Each regional government is examined using a mixed methodology comprising of on-site observation, document analysis, and iterative semi-structured interviewing. Drawing from the experiences of five regional governments in implementing good governance this paper seeks to better understand the causal contexts of variable implementation governance practices and to suggest enhancements to the development of policies for sustainable inter-generational change in governance practice across regional government settings. ...|$|E
