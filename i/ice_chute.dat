The <b>iced</b> <b>chute</b> is 400 ft long, and the four-man teams attain speeds of up to 35 mi an hour.

When he began playing bantam baseball in his teens, he {{started out as a}} first baseman. He honed his pitching skills by throwing pieces of coal from a local coal yard, aiming at either an open <b>ice</b> <b>chute</b> or the gaps of passing boxcars. He was also encouraged to continue working on his pitching by Gene Dziadura, a former shortstop in the Chicago Cubs minor league system, and a Philadelphia Phillies scout. Many training sessions between the two followed until Jenkins graduated from high school.|$|E
