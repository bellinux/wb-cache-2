40|$|Key words: Dian Lake; {{constructed}} wetland; {{water quality}} improvement liants; plant growth; vertical velocity; Abstract: A surface-flow wetland and a subsurface-flow wetland respectively were constructed {{at the entrance}} of Dian Lake in Yunnan Province. Six plants such as Canna indica L., Scirpus tabernaemontanl Gmel., Eichornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms., Oenanthe ja vania (Bl.) DC., Acorus calamus L., Phragmitas communis Trin. were planted in the two constructed wetlands in separated sections on condition that hydraulic loading was 12 cm/d, hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 3 d. The results show that the removal <b>efficiencies</b> <b>of</b> subsurface constructed wetlands on TP and TN with canna indica L. or Scirpus tabernaemontanl Geml. are stable. Removal <b>efficiencies</b> <b>of</b> the former on TN and TP are 70. 60 % and 88. 27 %, respectively.
