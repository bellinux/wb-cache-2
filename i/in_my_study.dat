500|$|The {{penetration}} of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (<b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>study</b> over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some {{who are unable to}} penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, {{with the help of the}} [...] "little knife". This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the latter}} part of his life was spent entirely abroad, Cronin {{retained}} a great affection for the district of his childhood, writing in 1972 to a local teacher: [...] "Although I have travelled the world over I must say in all sincerity that my heart belongs to Dumbarton. ... <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>study</b> there is a beautiful 17th century coloured print of the Rock... I even follow with great fervour the fortunes of the Dumbarton football team." [...] Further evidence of Cronin's lifelong support of Dumbarton F.C. comes from a framed typewritten letter hanging in the foyer of the club's stadium. In the letter, written in 1972 and addressed to the club's then secretary, Cronin congratulates Dumbarton on their return to the top division after an absence of 50 years and recalls his childhood supporting the Sons (the club's nickname) and on occasion being [...] "lifted over" [...] the turnstiles (a common practice in times past so that children did not have to pay).|$|E
