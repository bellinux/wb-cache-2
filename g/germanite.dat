40|$|International audienceThis {{study shows}} that the design of copper-rich sulfides by {{mimicking}} natural minerals allows a new germanite-type sulfide Cu 22 Fe 8 Ge 4 S 32 with promising thermoelectric properties to be synthesized. The Mössbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses provide evidence that the structure of our synthetic compound {{differs from that of}} the natural <b>germanite</b> mineral Cu 26 Fe 4 Ge 4 S 32 by its much higher Cu(+) /Cu(2 +) ratio and different cationic occupancies. The coupled substitution Cu/Fe in the Cu 26 -xFe 4 +xGe 4 S 32 series also appears as a promising approach to optimize the thermoelectric properties. The electrical resistivity, which decreases slightly as the temperature increases, shows that these materials exhibit a semiconducting behavior, but are at the border of a metallic state. The magnitudes of the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient increase with x, which suggests that Fe for Cu substitution decreases the hole concentration. The thermal conductivity decreases as the temperature increases leading to a moderately low value of 1. 2 W m(- 1) K(- 1) and a maximum ZT value of 0. 17 at 575 K...|$|E
40|$|Mass Spectrometry {{shows that}} Ge is enriched {{in the same}} bands as Fe, and that Ge-rich {{sphalerite}} also contains measurable levels of several other minor elements, including As, Pb and Tl. Micron- to nanoscale heterogeneity in the sample, both textural and compositional, is revealed by investigation using Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) combined with Synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence mapping and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy imaging of FIB-prepared samples. Results show that Ge is preferentially incorporated within Fe-rich sphalerite with textural complexity finer {{than that of the}} microbeam used for the X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) measurements. Such heterogeneity, expressed as intergrowths between 3 C sphalerite and 2 H wurtzite on [110] zones, could be the result of either a primary growth process, or alternatively, polystage crystallization, in which early Fe-Ge-rich sphalerite is partially replaced by Fe-Ge-poor wurtzite. FIB-SEM imaging shows evidence for replacement supporting the latter. Transformation of sphalerite into wurtzite is promoted by (111) * twinning or lattice-scale defects, leading to a heterogeneous ZnS sample, in which the dominant component, sphalerite, can host up to ~ 20 % wurtzite. Ge K-edge XANES spectra for this sphalerite are identical to those of the <b>germanite</b> and argyrodite standards and the synthetic chalcogenide glasses GeS₂ and GeSe₂, indicating the Ge formally exists in the tetravalent form in this sphalerite. Fe K-edge XANES spectra for the same sample indicate that Fe is present mainly as Fe²+, and Cu K-edge XANES spectra are characteristic for Cu+. Since there is no evidence for coupled substitution involving a monovalent element, we propose that Ge⁴+ substitutes for (Zn²+, Fe²+) with vacancies in the structure to compensate for charge balance.

40|$|International audienceWas the Wergeld a " Germanic " notion? The European {{research}} has modified {{the description of}} antique Germanity inherited from XIX' and XX' centuries The Franks, as Roman soldiers, were they {{in the position to}} transmit a specific juridical notion? The manuscripts reveal a primitive form in uueregildus. The study concentrates on the "barbarian" laws of the Franks, Lombards, Alemans and Bavarians. When comparing the cases of application of the uueregildus with the juridical contexts of the late Roman Empire many points appear in contradiction with the usual definition of the Wergeld. The actions are never private, but generally take place in front of a judge. The criminal procedures applied are similar to late Roman ones. The pecuniary estimation of a free man had become a common practice under late Roman Empire. The Theodosian code gives a proof of judicial ransom practises under imperial right. The uueregildus may have been a "popular" equivalent of a Roman penal denomination. The uuere-gildus could be the 'high tax', the maximal penalty. The default in its payment implies capital punishment of the condemned. In late Roman right, this procedure corresponds to the penal treatment of the causae capitales, sometimes said: poenae maximae, of which the uueregildus may be a synonym. The historiography of the uueregildus presents the abuse of its use as a pretended historical proof, under Carolingian times, and from the XVI' to XX' century, {{for the benefit of the}} thesis of a pretended Frank "conquest". Le Wergeld fut-il une notion "germanique"? La recherche européenne a modifié la description de la <b>Germanité</b> antique héritée des XIXe Et XXe siècles.

La notion juridique livrée par l'étude des manuscrits entre en contradiction complète avec la définition usuelle du Wergeld. La sentence n'est jamais privée, mais judiciaire. Les procédures suivies se placent en continuité avec l'ordre judiciaire romain tardif. L'historiographie du uueregildus montre l'abus de ce terme comme d'une "preuve" forgée au bénéfice de la thèse d'une prétendue conquête franque qui n'a pas eu lieu...|$|E
