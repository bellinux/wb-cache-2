500|$|Jaws: The Revenge was {{the first}} film of the series to be {{released}} on DVD. It was released on Region 1 as a 'vanilla' disc by Goodtimes, featuring Spanish and French subtitles. The feature is presented in a non-anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen transfer. The soundtrack was presented in Dolby Digital 4.1, with one reviewer saying that the [...] "stereo separation is great with ocean waves swirling around you, the bubbles going by during the scuba scenes, and Hoagie's airplane flying around behind you." [...] The same reviewer praised the <b>image</b> <b>transfer</b> of McPherson's [...] "extremely well photographed" [...] cinematography. The film was re-released on DVD by Universal on June 3, 2003 in an anamorphic transfer.

To make a complete picture, regardless of printing on flexible film or corrugated paper, the <b>image</b> <b>transferred</b> from each plate has to register exactly with the <b>images</b> <b>transferred</b> from the other colors. To ensure an accurate picture is made, mounting marks are made on the flexographic plates. These mounting marks can be microdots (down to 0.3 mm) and/or crosses. Special machinery is made for mounting these plates on the printing cylinders to maintain registration. Earle L. Harley invented and patent the Opti-Chek Mounting and Proofing machine enabling the operator to check the registration before going to the press.|$|R

50|$|Some Polaroid instant {{films are}} {{suitable}} for various forms of alternative processing leading to artistic effects. One form was the manipulation of SX-70 using various tools before the emulsion dried to create an oil painting effect. However, SX-70 {{is no longer in}} production and similar films by the Impossible Project {{do not have the same}} manipulable qualities. Emulsion lifting can be achieved by soaking Polaroid, Fuji peel-apart, and some Impossible Project's films in water and then transferring the emulsion to a new surface like wood, metal or paper. <b>Image</b> <b>Transfers</b> are another method of <b>transferring</b> the <b>image</b> from instant peel-apart film to a new surface. <b>Image</b> <b>Transfers</b> are done by peeling the negative positive sandwich apart early in development and pushing the wet negative side down firmly onto a sheet of print-making paper and applying an even pressure with a roller transferring it to the new surface.|$|R

25|$|If this <b>image</b> were <b>transferred</b> {{directly}} to paper, {{it would create}} a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet.

The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the <b>image</b> is <b>transferred</b> to the paper. Because the <b>image</b> is first <b>transferred,</b> or offset to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as offset lithography or offset printing.|$|R

40|$|Image {{compression}} is a {{large area}} of research. The objective of image compression is to reduce irrelevance and redundancy of the image data {{in order to be}} able to store or transmit data in an efficient form. There are so many problems in the digital grayscale encrypted <b>image</b> <b>transferring</b> over the internet, such as security level of encrypted image, the speed of internet, time of encrypted <b>image</b> <b>transferring</b> and so on. One of these problems is the insufficient of internet bandwidth that the encrypted <b>image</b> will <b>transferred</b> through it, so to solve the problem of insufficiently of internet bandwidth, the grayscale image will compressed by using quadtree fractal compression method before encrypting this <b>image</b> and <b>transferring</b> it via internet. Quadtree fractal compression method has advantage of high compression ratio but also has disadvantage with a long time of compression process which it effected on the decompressed image quality. In this thesis, we focused on quality problem of decompressed decrypted image, it is mean, how to improve quadtree fractal image compression to keep the image quality with reducing in compression time. So to solve this problem, the strength and limitations of current compression scheme has been investigated, design and develop new scheme that improved quality to overcome the limitation, and finally evaluate the new schemes using application scenarios. The proposed scheme improved the image quality by presenting improved quadtree fractal compression algorithm, which change the searching way for the best corresponding domain transformation and ranges, by dividing the image in to 3 selfsimilarity areas. Maximum and medium and minimum self-similarity areas. So the matching process had less time and better quality. The results shows that the proposed improved quadtree fractal compression get the best PSNR 37 dB and compression ratio 35. 9 and processing time with 65 ms...|$|R
