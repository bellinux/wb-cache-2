40|$|A {{significant}} hurdle towards {{realization of}} practical and scalable quantum computing {{is to protect}} the quantum states from <b>inherent</b> <b>noises</b> during the computation. In physical implementation of quantum circuits, a long-distance interaction between two qubits is undesirable since, it can be interpreted as a noise. Therefore, multiple quantum technologies and quantum error correcting codes strongly require the interacting qubits to be arranged in a nearest neighbor (NN) fashion. The current literature on converting a given quantum circuit to an NN-arranged one mainly considered chained qubit topologies or Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) topology. However, practical quantum circuit realizations, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), may not have an LNN topology. To address this gap, we consider an arbitrary qubit topology. We present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for achieving minimal logical depth while guaranteeing the nearest neighbor arrangement between the interacting qubits. We substantiate our claim with studies on diverse network topologies and prominent quantum circuit benchmarks...|$|R

50|$|A key {{advance in}} audio {{fidelity}} {{came with the}} Dolby A noise reduction system, invented by Ray Dolby and introduced into professional recording studios in 1966. It suppressed the light but sometimes quite noticeable steady background of hiss, which was the only easily audible downside of mastering on tape instead of recording directly to disc. A competing system, dbx, invented by David Blackmer, also found success in professional audio. A simpler variant of Dolby's noise reduction system, known as Dolby B, greatly improved the sound of cassette tape recordings by reducing the especially high level of hiss that resulted from the cassette's miniaturized tape format. It, and variants, also eventually found wide application in the recording and film industries. Dolby B was crucial to the popularization and commercial success of the cassette as a domestic recording and playback medium, {{and it became a}} standard feature in the booming home and car stereo market of the 1970s and beyond. The compact cassette format also benefited enormously from improvements to the tape itself as coatings with wider frequency responses and lower <b>inherent</b> <b>noise</b> were developed, often based on cobalt and chrome oxides as the magnetic material instead of the more usual iron oxide.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{two-dimensional}} {{gel electrophoresis}} method (2 -DE) is widely used in Proteomics to separate thousands of proteins in a sample. By comparing the protein expression levels of proteins in a normal sample with those in a diseased one, {{it is possible to}} identify a meaningful set of marker proteins for the targeted disease. The major shortcomings of this approach involve <b>inherent</b> <b>noises</b> and irregular geometric distortions of spots observed in 2 -DE images. Various experimental conditions can be the major causes of these problems. In the protein analysis of samples, these problems eventually lead to incorrect conclusions. In order to minimize the influence of these problems, this paper proposes a partition based pair extension method that performs spot-matching on a set of gel images multiple times and segregates more reliable mapping results which can improve the accuracy of gel image analysis. The improved accuracy of the proposed method is analyzed through various experiments on real 2 -DE images of human liver tissues. Keywords—Proteomics, spot-matching, two-dimensional electrophoresis.

40|$|Target {{positioning}} systems based on MEMS gyros and laser rangefinders (LRs) have extensive prospects {{due to their}} advantages of low cost, small size and easy realization. The target positioning accuracy is mainly determined by the LR’s attitude derived by the gyros. However, the attitude error is large due to the <b>inherent</b> <b>noises</b> from isolated MEMS gyros. In this paper, both accelerometer/magnetometer and LR attitude aiding systems are introduced to aid MEMS gyros. A no-reset Federated Kalman Filter (FKF) is employed, which consists of two local Kalman Filters (KF) and a Master Filter (MF). The local KFs are designed by using the Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) -based dynamic equations and the measurements from the two aiding systems. The KFs can estimate the attitude simultaneously to limit the attitude errors resulting from the gyros. Then, the MF fuses the redundant attitude estimates to yield globally optimal estimates. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the FKF-based system can improve the target positioning accuracy effectively and allow for good fault-tolerant capability...|$|R

40|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{prediction}} interval estimation so far focus on cases where input variables are numerical. In datasets with solely nominal input variables, we observe records with {{the exact same}} input x^u, but different real valued outputs due to the <b>inherent</b> <b>noise</b> in the system. Existing prediction interval estimation methods do not use representations that can accurately model such <b>inherent</b> <b>noise</b> {{in the case of}} nominal inputs. We propose a new prediction interval estimation method tailored for this type of data, which is prevalent in biology and medicine. We call this method Distribution Adaptive Prediction Interval Estimation given Nominal inputs (DAPIEN) and has four main phases. First, we select a distribution function that can best represent the <b>inherent</b> <b>noise</b> of the system for all unique inputs. Then we infer the parameters θ_i (e. g. θ_i=[mean_i, variance_i]) of the selected distribution function for all unique input vectors x^u_i and generate a new corresponding training set using pairs of x^u_i, θ_i. III). Then, we train a model to predict θ given a new x_u. Finally, we calculate the prediction interval for a new sample using the inverse of the cumulative distribution function once the parameters θ is predicted by the trained model. We compared DAPIEN to the commonly used Bootstrap method on three synthetic datasets. Our results show that DAPIEN provides tighter prediction intervals while preserving the requested coverage when compared to Bootstrap. This work can facilitate broader usage of regression methods in medicine and biology where it is necessary to provide tight prediction intervals while preserving coverage when input variables are nominal...|$|E

The communicator devices do dissipate energy however they do not emit net energy into the channel, instead of that, they modulate the parameters of inherent spontaneous fluctuations in the channel. The new method can use two different mechanisms, thermal noise (Johnson-Nyquist noise) for classical communication, and vacuum fluctuations/zero point energy (quantum uncertainty noise) for quantum communication. The strongest advantage of the method that this is apparently the most hidden (stealth) way of communication, because it is using the <b>inherent</b> background <b>noise</b> for communication, therefore {{it is extremely difficult}} or impossible to discover its presence. Moreover, with proper wave-based arrangements, the sender and the receiver can easily detect eavesdropper activities, so that the eavesdropper is detected as soon as she extracts a single bit of information, thus the security of the method is at least as good or better than the security of quantum communication/quantum key distribution schemes. Finally, concerning practical applications, environmental noise, out of the fundamental/inherent fluctuations, can also be used for this kind of communication provided that is sufficiently stationary...|$|R
40|$|In neural systems, {{synaptic}} plasticity is usually driven by spike trains. Due to the <b>inherent</b> <b>noises</b> of neurons, synapses and networks, spike trains typically exhibit externally uncontrollable variability such as spatial heterogeneity and temporal stochasticity, resulting in variability of synapses, {{which we call}} efficacy variability. Spike patterns with the same population rate but inducing different efficacy variability may result in neuronal networks with sharply different structures and functions. However, how the variability of spike trains influences the efficacy variability remains unclear. Here, we systematically study this influence when spike patterns possess four aspects of statistical features, i. e. synchronous firing, auto-temporal structure, heterogeneity of rates and heterogeneity of cross-correlations, under spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) after dynamically bounding the mean strength of plastic synapses into or out of a neuron (synaptic homeostasis). We then show the functional importance of efficacy variability on the encoding and maintenance of connection patterns and on the early development of primary visual systems driven by retinal waves.

The estimation of the vanishing point is a practical solution for general road detection using monocular vision, which however is not good enough for robust road detection in a campus environment due to the strong noises of texture orientations generated from roadside trees and buildings. In this paper, a novel system framework is proposed by combining the fast scene segmentation (FSS) and the rapid vanishing point detection. The proposed FSS algorithm can segment a single image into road and non-road regions based on the similarity analysis of color histogram, which can eliminate the <b>inherent</b> <b>noises</b> in the trees and buildings and improve the robustness of road detection effectively. Before voting for the vanishing point, we use Canny algorithm to extract the edges in the road region roughly segmented in FSS step. Since most of the strong texture orientations exist in the extracted edges, the computational complexity in the voting stage can be reduced significantly.
