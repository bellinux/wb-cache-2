The {{north and south}} sides of Huangling Complex dip gently while the basins on the eastern flank and western flank of the dome have different dip angles. Zigui Basin, which is {{to the west of}} Huangling Complex, dips moderately at 40° westward. Dangyang Basin, which is to the east of Huangling Complex, in contrast, dips gently at 15° eastward. The reason of asymmetric folding will be discussed in the later part. Besides, a large number of recumbent folds trending N-S can be found on Zigui Basin and Dangyang Basin, they <b>extrude</b> <b>to</b> the west and to the east respectively. During Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, there was a compressive environment causing the uplift of Huangling massif and folding in Huangling Complex. The exhumation of Huangling massif and formation of recumbent folds plus vertical crustal shortening occurred at the same time. After the uplift of Huangling dome during Triassic, the environment changed to extensional. Brittle deformation forming rifts and grabens followed. High-angle normal faulting can be found in Yuanan Graben and Jingmen Graben {{on the east side of}} Huangling Complex.|$|E

Methods: Macrophage cells were obtained from Swiss mice after peritoneal lavage. Chelators were diluted in distilled water obtaining 12 concentrations, and MTT assay identified the concentrations, per group, displaying the highest cell viability (analysis of variance, p 0. 01), Tetraclean and EDTA (p > 0. 01), and EDTA and Smear Clear (p > 0. 01).

40|$|The enigmatic Ina {{feature on}} the Moon was {{recently}} interpreted to represent extrusive basaltic volcanic activity {{within the past}} 100 m. y. of lunar history, an extremely young age for volcanism on the Moon. Ina is a 2 × 3 km D-shaped depression that consists {{of a host of}} unusual bleb-like mounds surrounded by a relatively optically fresh hummocky and blocky floor. Documentation of magmatic-volcanic processes from shield volcano summit pit craters in Hawai’i and new insights into shield-building and dike evolution processes on the Moon provide important perspectives on the origin of Ina. We show that the size, location, morphology, topography, and optical maturity of Ina are consistent with an origin as a subsided summit pit crater lava lake on top of a broad ~ 22 -km-diameter, ~ 3. 5 -b. y. -old shield volcano. New theoretical treatments of lunar shield-building magmatic dike events predict that waning-stage summit activity was characterized by the production of magmatic foam in the dike and lake; the final stages of dike stress relaxation and closure cause the magmatic foam to <b>extrude</b> <b>to</b> the surface through cracks in the lava lake crust to produce the mounds. The high porosity of the extruded foams (> 75 %) altered the nature of subsequent impact craters (the aerogel effect), causing them to be significantly smaller in diameter, which could bias the crater-derived model ages. Accounting for this effect allows for significantly older model ages, to ~ 3. 5 b. y., contemporaneous with the underlying shield volcano. Thus extremely young volcanic eruptions are not required to explain the unusual nature of Ina...|$|E
40|$|Mud volcanoes are {{a poorly}} {{understood}} phenomenon whereby overpressured, fine-grained sediments <b>extrude</b> <b>to</b> the surface from depths {{of up to}} several kilometres. They are observed worldwide, usually in areas of tectonic compression and thick, rapidly-deposited sedimentary sequences. This research is aimed at achieving {{a better understanding of}} the type of sediment behaviour leading to mud volcanoes. The study combines a geological investigation of the origin of mud volcanoes with a geotechnical investigation of their behaviour. As part of the geological study, the mud volcano examples around the world are described, and possible mechanisms of overpressuring and extrusion are investigated. Particular attention is paid to the field description and the subsurface geology of the mud volcano areas visited in South Trinidad and Southwest Taiwan. The results of laboratory analyses on the muds sampled in the field, mineralogy, particle size and shapes, Atterberg limits and, where possible, micropalaeontology, are presented. These are aimed at understanding the origin of the clay and establishing any characteristics unique to mud volcanoes. The geotechnical investigation concentrates on the undrained shear behaviour of mud volcano clays, which originate in an environment where thick, low permeability sedimentary sequences are subjected to tectonic compression. The experiments were conducted in a high pressure triaxial cell, using confining pressures of 5 to 50 MPa. Particular attention is paid to the effects of consolidation path, stress magnitude and material properties on the behaviour of mud volcano clays. The results of the experiments are discussed in the light of the geological study, and equivalent testing results from low pressure soil mechanics studies. The discussion concentrates on the role of tectonic activity in the formation of mud volcanoes...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis focuses on computational modelling of human vocal folds and vocal tract functions using {{finite element method}} (FEM). Human voice is crucial in human communication. Therefore {{one of the main}} targets of current medicine is creation of artificial vocal folds, which would substitute the original vocal folds. The computational modelling can be used to understand principles of voice production, determination of parameters that the artificial vocal folds have to meet and verification of their functionality. First part of this thesis focuses on modelling of human voice creation by whisper. Influence of intraglottal gap on eigenvalues distribution for individual vowels was analysed using FEM vocal tract and trachea model. Further there is presented two-dimensional (2 D) finite element model of the flow-induced self-oscillation of the human vocal folds in interaction with acoustic spaces of the vocal tract. The 2 D vocal tract model was created on the basis of converting the data from magnetic resonance images (MRI). Explicit coupling scheme with separated solvers for structure and fluid domain was used for modelling of the fluid-structure interaction. Created computational model comprises: large deformations of the vocal folds tissue, contact between vocal folds, fluid-structure interaction, morphing the fluid mesh according to the vocal-fold motion (Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach), unsteady viscous compressible or incompressible airflow described by the Navier-Stokes equations and airflow separation during glottis closure. This model is used to analyse the influence of stiffness and damping changes in individual vocal fold tissue layers (in particular in superficial lamina propria). Part of this computational analysis is also comparison of vocal folds behaviour for compressible and incompressible flow model. Videokymograms (VKG) are subsequently created from obtained results of FEM calculations which enable to compare individual variants between themselves and with motion of real human vocal folds. In next part of this thesis is presented three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model of the flow-induced self-oscillation of the human vocal folds. This 3 D model was created from a previous 2 D model by <b>extrude</b> <b>to</b> the third direction. Using this model was again compared influence of compressible and incompressible flow model on vocal folds motion and generated sound by using videokymograms and acoustic spectra. The last part of this thesis focuses on the possibility to replace missing natural source voice in form reed-based element. Behaviour of reed-based element was analysed using computational modelling and using measurements on experimental physical model. The physical model enables changes in setting gap between reed and reed stop and performing acoustical and optical measurements...|$|E

30|$|The final {{requirement}} for appropriate technology status is {{access to the}} raw materials to print with. Fortunately, recyclebot technology has been developed that enables users to turn plastic waste into 3 -D printing filament with lower costs and less environmental impact (Baechler et al. 2013; Kreiger et al. 2013, 2014; Zhong et al. 2017; Woern et al. 2018). Polymer waste, often from food and drink containers, is common in many developing communities (Muttamara et al. 1994) and e-waste is becoming more predominant that {{can also be used}} as a feedstock (Zhong and Pearce 2018). Informal waste recycling is already conducted as an economic activity (Zia et al. 2008) and now recyclebot technology enables the potential for fair trade filament or social plastic (Feeley et al. 2014). Already the non-profit Plastic Bank in South America and business Protoprint in India are using waste pickers to recycle plastic into 3 -D filament, and there is significant interest in the technical development community (Birtchnell and Hoyle 2014). Preliminary work has already begun to determine the number of cycles a polymer can withstand the print, recycle, filament extrude loop (Sanchez et al. 2015, 2017). Advanced flexible materials (Woern and Pearce 2017) as well as waste composites (Pringle et al. 2018) have also been recycled successfully following this approach, and an untethered solar-powered recyclebots have been developed (Zhong et al. 2017). As expanded resin identification codes are adopted, this activity can expand (Hunt et al. 2015). It should be noted that this design focused on PLA-based printing, and that the overall print time of the device will be limited by the polymer selected. High temperature polymer feedstocks will entail some redesign of the RepRap. For example, nylon is a strong, durable, and versatile 3 -D printing material, which is both flexible when thin, but has high inter-layer adhesion, which enables it to be used for functional parts such as those needed in a bicycle. However, nylon requires temperatures above 240  °C to <b>extrude.</b> <b>To</b> handle these higher temperatures, the MOST delta RepRaps can be upgraded with an all-metal hot end, and the end effector would need to be redesigned in order to print with materials such as nylon. In addition, with some materials, a heated printer bed is recommended and can be accommodated by the existing Melzi Arduino-based microcontroller. However, this upgrade comes with significant energy penalties as the recommended printer settings for nylon involve extruder temperature from 240 to 260  °C, hot bed temperatures 70 – 80  °C with a PVA-based glue on glass, print speeds of 30 – 60  mm/s and 0.2 – 0.4  mm layer heights (Taylor 2014). Such relatively slow print speeds, with a high temperature hot end and a heated bed will significantly increase energy consumption and thus decrease print time with the system developed here. Future work is needed to improve the size of PV and storage system to accommodate this more energy-intensive type of printing with comparable print volumes/times.|$|E

However, their therapeutic use may be hindered due to their rapid clearance from blood and their inefficiency at crossing cell membranes. Cationic liposome complexes have been used to enhance the intracellular delivery of asODN in vitro; however, this type of carrier has unfavorable pharmacokinetics for most in vivo applications. Significant therapeutic activity of cationic liposomal asODN following systemic administration has not been demonstrated. In an effort to develop improved liposomal carriers for asODN for in vivo applications, we have evaluated the physical characteristics of two formulations which represent alternatives to cationic liposome–asODN complexes: asODN passively entrapped within neutral liposomes (PELA) and asODN formulated in a novel coated cationic liposomal formulation (CCL).
