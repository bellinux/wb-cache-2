25|$|The Russians {{proceeded}} to bombard Grozny with artillery, tank, and rocket fire {{as the rest}} of the battle centered on new tactics in which the Russians {{proceeded to}} destroy the city block by block. White phosphorus rounds and <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosive</b> Shmel rockets were used by the Russian forces. They would then send in small groups of men sometimes spearheaded by special forces, making effective use of sniper teams. Two long weeks of costly bitter fighting ensued as the Russians moved to take the Presidential Palace.|$|E
25|$|The {{explosive}} mechanism was a gas-enhanced device {{consisting of}} compressed butane in canisters employed with pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) {{to create a}} <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosive.</b> The bomb was carried on a layer of concrete covered with a slab of marble to direct the blast upward. Despite the lack of sophistication and wide availability of its component parts, a gas-enhanced device can be a lethal weapon. These devices were similar to fuel-air or thermobaric weapons, explaining the large blast and damage. An after-action forensic investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that the bomb was so powerful that {{it probably would have}} brought down the building even if the sentries had managed to stop the truck between the gate and the building.|$|E
500|$|The {{deployment}} of Gravel mines and the Wide-Area Anti-Personnel Mine System became integral {{parts of the}} operation. Other weapons were specifically developed or otherwise became associated with the campaign as well. These notably included the BLU-31/B and Mk 36 air-dropped mines, BLU-43/B and BLU-44/B landmine system (Dragontooth), the BLU-72/B <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosive</b> (Pave Pat), and the BLU-52/A chemical bomb (filled with bulk CS-2 powder). [...] Anti-vehicle operations in support of Muscle Shoals/Igloo White were designated Mud River, while anti-personnel operations received the codename Dump Truck.|$|E
50|$|Other terms {{used for}} this family of weapons are high-impulse thermobaric weapons (HITs), heat and {{pressure}} weapons, vacuum bombs, or <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosives</b> (FAE or FAX).|$|R

50|$|<b>Fuel-air</b> <b>explosives</b> {{were first}} {{developed}}, {{and used in}} Vietnam, by the United States. Soviet scientists, however, quickly developed their own FAE weapons, which were reportedly used against China in the Sino-Soviet border conflict and in Afghanistan.

2500|$|In {{the late}} evening of 11 September 2007 the <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosive</b> AVBPM or [...] "Father of all bombs" [...] was {{successfully}} field-tested. According to the Russian military, the new weapon will replace several smaller types of nuclear bombs in its arsenal.|$|E
2500|$|Some defense analysts {{question}} {{both the}} yield {{of the bomb}} and whether it could be deployed by a Tupolev Tu-160 bomber. A report by Wired says photos and the video of the event {{suggest that it is}} designed to be deployed from the rear of a slow moving cargo plane, and they note that the bomb-test video released by the Russians never shows both the bomb and the bomber in the same camera shot. There are also questions on what type of explosives it used. They quoted Tom Burky, a senior research scientist at Battelle, saying [...] "It's not even clear what kind of weapon the Russians tested." [...] He questions if it was what some experts call a <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosive</b> or if it was a thermobaric weapon. [...] "Fuel-air and thermobaric bombs differ in usefulness". Burky says that the weapon depicted in the video appears to be a <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosive,</b> based on its shape.|$|E
50|$|According to Russian {{government}} sources, on 11 September 2007, a Tu-160 deployed {{a massive}} <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosive</b> device, the Father of All Bombs, {{for its first}} field test. Some military analysts expressed skepticism that the weapon was actually delivered by a Tu-160.|$|E
50|$|Thermobaric and <b>fuel-air</b> <b>{{explosive}}s</b> {{have been}} used in guerrilla warfare since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing in Lebanon, which used a gas-enhanced explosive mechanism, probably propane, butane or acetylene. The explosive used by the bombers in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in the US incorporated the FAE principle, using three tanks of bottled hydrogen gas to enhance the blast. Jemaah Islamiyah bombers used a shock-dispersed solid fuel charge, based on the thermobaric principle, to attack the Sari nightclub in the 2002 Bali bombings.|$|R
50|$|Early on December 15, NATO {{aircraft}} {{attacked a}} Taliban command {{post in the}} area, using laser-guided bombs, rockets, and <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosives</b> to blast apart the makeshift fortress the Taliban had constructed out of stone, concrete, and sheet metal. The same day, aircraft began dropping three sets of leaflets over the region, the first warning {{the population of the}} impending conflict, the next a plea for locals to turn their backs on the Taliban and support NATO, and the third consisting of an image of a Taliban fighter with a large X through it to warn Taliban fighters to either leave the area, or face NATO.|$|R
50|$|Post-Soviet Russia heavily {{bombed the}} Chechen capital of Grozny {{from the air}} with mostly unguided munitions (including <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosives)</b> as well as bombarding it with a massive {{artillery}} barrages (1994-1995, 1996 and 1999-2000), killing thousands of people (some estimates say 27,000 civilians were killed during the 1994-1995 siege alone) including civilians during the First and Second Chechen Wars. Although the Russian pilots and soldiers were ordered to attack designated targets only, such as the Presidential Palace, due to their inexperience and lack of training, Russian soldiers and pilots bombed and shelled random targets inside the city. In 2003, the UN still called Grozny the most destroyed city on earth.|$|R
50|$|Specialized warheads are {{available}} for illumination, smoke, tear gas, and white phosphorus. Russia, China, and many former Warsaw Pact nations have also developed a <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosive</b> (thermobaric) warhead.

5000|$|As {{resistance}} to the invaders stiffened, Russian artillery and airstrikes came into action. This conflict saw the first use of aerially delivered <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosives</b> (FAEs) against populated areas, notably on the village of Tando by the federal forces. The rebels were stalled by the ferocity of the bombardments: their supply lines were cut and scattered with remotely detonating mines. This gave Moscow time to assemble a counter-attack under Colonel-General Viktor Kazantsev, commander of the North Caucasus Military District. On August 23 the Basaev and Khattab announced they were withdrawing from Botlikhsky District to [...] "redeploy" [...] and begin a [...] "new phase" [...] in their operations. The war also saw the first use of the T-90 tank. In the Kadar zone, a group of 8 to 12 T-90S tanks pushed through stubborn resistance. One of the tanks was hit by 7 RPG rockets, and remained in action.|$|R
5000|$|A {{study by}} the Foreign Military Studies Office evaluated: [...] "In a {{surprising}} and threatening move, the federal forces relied heavily on <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosives</b> and tactical missiles (SCUD and SCARAB). (...) Such strikes were designed for maximum psychological pressure—to demonstrate the hopelessness of further resistance against a foe that could strike with impunity and that was invulnerable to countermeasures." [...] Major General Vladimir Shamanov, Russia's commander in Chechnya, said the decision to attack was made {{at the highest level}} ("the very top" [...] and [...] "the highest chief"), meaning at least knowledge by Vladimir Putin and President Yeltsin. The same opinion was voiced by the president of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev. According to Aushev, a retired Red Army general and a veteran of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, in all probability the missiles had been fired {{from the base of the}} 58th Army near the village of Tarskoye in North Ossetia.|$|R

For the same reason, diesel engines are immune to vapor lock.|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} this thesis {{is a study}} of gas explosions in complex {{geometries}} and presentation and validation of a method for simulating flame acceleration and deflagration to detonation transition. The thesis includes {{a description of the}} mechanisms of flame acceleration and DDT that need to be modeled when simulating all stages of gas explosions. These mechanisms are flame acceleration due to instabilities that occur in fluid flow and reactive systems, shock propagation, deflagration to detonation transition and propagating detonations. The method presented uses the FLIC-scheme for solving the conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy, species and a turbulence model. A reaction rate model that includes both turbulent combustion rates and chemical kinetics to handle turbulence-flame interactions and reactions due to gas compression is designed for simulations of turbulent flames and detonations. Simulation results of gas explosions shows that the presented method can simulate different flame propagation regimes in channels with repeated obstacles like fast deflagrations, quasi-detonation and CJ-detonations. The simulations show the important effects seen in experiments like detonation initiation from shock focusing and flame acceleration from fluid instabilities. Blast waves from high <b>explosives</b> and <b>fuel-air</b> <b>explosives</b> are simulated and results are compared with experimental data. The comparison shows that the numerical solver capture the important waves and that the method can re-produce experimental pressures and impulses with satisfying accuracy. Different tests of the method show that the most significant error sources are numerical diffusion, accuracy of the simplified chemical kinetics and thermodynamic models. The most important points of further research to improve the accuracy of the method is addressed. </p...|$|R
50|$|Poland was {{the site}} of one of the last major {{accidents}} involving aircraft from Maine's Cold War air bases. A United States Navy patrol bomber from Naval Air Station Brunswick Patrol Squadron 8 (VP-8) disintegrated over Poland on September 22, 1978. An over-pressurized fuel tank caused the port wing of the Lockheed P-3 Orion to separate at the outboard engine. The detached wing sheared off part of the tail; and aerodynamic forces caused the remaining engines and starboard wing to detach from the fuselage. Debris rained down over a wide area near the Tripp Corner intersection on Route 11 shortly after noon. No homes were hit, but an <b>explosive</b> <b>fuel-air</b> fire following impact broke some windows. There were no survivors from the plane's eight-man crew.|$|R
50|$|The CBU-55 had two variations.

The SUU-49/B dispenser could be carried only by helicopters or low-speed aircraft, whereas the SUU-49A/B was redesigned with a strongback and folding tailfins, {{so that they}} could also be delivered by high-speed aircraft as well.|$|E
50|$|The road-mobile Iskander was {{the second}} attempt to replace the Scud missile. The first attempt, the OTR-23 Oka, was {{eliminated}} under the INF Treaty.

40|$|The {{most devastating}} {{aircraft}} fuel related fires occur {{when there is}} a catastrophic failure of an aircraft wing or jet fuel tank {{as a result of a}} ground crash. The cause of these intense fires is the rapid atomization of fuel that produces a highly flammable, extremely <b>explosive</b> <b>fuel-air</b> mixture in the presence of an ignition source, and it is these intense fires that greatly reduce post crash survivability. In our efforts to develop fire safe fuels, a series of additives to jet fuel has been chosen that rely significantly on their chemical structure and composition to reduce fuel flammability by increasing droplet size during a wing tank failure. This presentation will discuss the methods utilized to evaluate the effect that specific chemical additives have on reducing the mist flammability characteristics of jet fuel and the influence of additive concentration on fuel drop size and fuel stability...|$|R

50|$|In 1964 a Russian {{scientist}} {{proposed that}} a shaped charge originally developed for piercing thick steel armor {{be adapted to}} the task of accelerating shock waves.

When the shaped charge detonates, most of its energy is focused on the steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A 66-pound shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length.
