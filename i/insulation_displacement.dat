5000|$|<b>Insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> {{contacts}} (IDCs) allow {{a ribbon}} cable {{to be forced}} onto sharp tines {{on the back of}} the contacts; this action pierces the insulation of all the wires simultaneously. This is a very quick means of assembly whether done by hand or machine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> {{connectors}} {{are usually}} used with small conductors for signal purposes and at low voltage. Power conductors carrying {{more than a}} few amperes are more reliably terminated with other means, though [...] "hot tap" [...] press-on connectors find some use in automotive applications for additions to existing wiring.|$|E
40|$|Pacemaker-induced extracardiac {{stimulation}} {{may involve}} the diaphragm, the pectoral or the intercostal muscles. The common causes are unipolar lead, electrode <b>insulation</b> defects, lead <b>displacement</b> and connector problems. We reported {{a case of}} twitching on the pacemaker pocket and discussed the reasons of pacemaker pocket stimulation. After evaluation of the patient we detected an insulation defect on the pacemaker lead {{that the cause of}} stimulation on pacemaker pocket...|$|R
50|$|A 110 {{block is}} a type of punch block used to {{terminate}} runs of on-premises wiring in a structured cabling system. The designation 110 is also used to describe a type of <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> contact (IDC) connector used to terminate twisted pair cables, which uses a punch-down tool similar to the older 66 block.|$|E
50|$|If required, such dual socket-outlets now can be {{obtained}} (at additional cost) utilizing <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> {{as a means of}} connecting to the supply conductors, {{as can be seen in}} the illustration - below right. The benefits claimed for their use in these applications include up to 50 percent faster installation, due to the reduction in the stripping, twisting and screwing down processes.|$|E
50|$|When a {{cable is}} {{terminated}} by a connector, the various wires {{in the cable}} are connected to contacts (pins) in the connector. The most common methods of connecting pins to individual wires are soldering, <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement,</b> insulation piercing, screw clamping, axial screw termination, cage clamping, crimping, press-in termination, and wire wrapping. Some of these wiring methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors to a cable much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.|$|E
50|$|The {{connector}} {{contains two}} parallel rows of contacts within a shielded case having a characteristic D-shape {{similar to that}} used in D-subminiature connectors. The contacts are not pins, but small flat bands of metal, called ribbon contacts. The connectors are manufactured in many capacities, including 14-, 24-, 36-, 50-, 64-, and 100- pin varieties. They may be mounted on boards, panels, or may terminate cables. Wires are attached by means of solder, crimping or <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement.</b> Female connectors have bail locks for a sturdy connection to the male connector. Screws may also be employed to secure connections.|$|E
50|$|The early ribbon cables {{were used}} in the {{mainframe}} computer industry, on card readers, card punching machines, and tape machines. Subsequently ribbon cables were manufactured by a number of different companies, including 3M. Methods and materials were developed to simplify and reduce the cost of ribbon cables, by standardizing the design and spacing of the wires, and the thickness of the insulation, so that they could be easily terminated through the use of <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> connectors (IDC). The simplicity of the cables, their low profile (compared to contemporary alternatives), and low cost due to standardization, meant ribbon cables were long used in computers, printers, and many electronic devices.|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{contacts}} have sharp prongs that when crimped, pierce the insulation and {{connect with the}} wire conductor, a mechanism known as <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement.</b> Ethernet cables, in particular, may have solid or stranded wire conductors and the sharp prongs are different in the 8P8C connectors made {{for each type of}} wire. A modular plug for solid (single strand) wire often has three slightly splayed prongs on each contact to securely surround and grip the conductor. Modular plugs for stranded or tinsel wire have prongs that are designed to connect to multiple wire strands. Connector plugs are designed for either solid or stranded wire; a plug for one wire type might not make reliable contact when crimped to a cable with wires of the other type.|$|E
50|$|A 66 {{block is}} a type of punchdown block used to connect sets of wires in a {{telephone}} system. They have been manufactured in three sizes, A, B, and M. A and B have six clips in each row while M has only 4. The A blocks spaced the rows farther apart, and has been obsolete for many years. The B style is used mainly in distribution panels where several destinations (often 1A2 key telephones) need to connect to the same source. The M blocks are often used to connect a single instrument to such a distribution block. 66 blocks are designed to terminate 22 through 26 AWG solid copper wire. The 66 series connecting block, introduced in the Bell System in 1962, was the first terminating device with <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> connector technology. The term 66 block reflects its Western Electric model number.|$|E
50|$|Since {{stripping}} the insulation from wires is time-consuming, many connectors intended for rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors so that insulation {{need not be}} removed from the wire. These generally {{take the form of a}} fork-shaped opening in the terminal, into which the insulated wire is pressed and which cut through the insulation to contact the conductor within. To make these connections reliably on a production line, special tools are used which accurately control the forces applied during assembly. If properly assembled, the resulting terminations are gas-tight and will last the life of the product. A common example is the multi-conductor flat ribbon cable used in computer disk drives; to terminate each of the many (approximately 40) wires individually would be slow and error-prone, but an <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> connector can terminate all the wires in (literally) one stroke. Another very common use is so-called punch-down blocks used for terminating telephone wiring.|$|E
5000|$|MIL-DTL-24308 (formerly MIL-C-24308 and MIL-PRF-24308) {{describes}} non-environmental, polarized shell, miniature, {{rack and}} panel connectors having pin and socket, crimp (removable), solder (non-removable), or <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> (non-removable) contacts with rigid or float mounting, designed for -55 째C to +125 째C operating temperature range. Also called [...] D-subminiature or D-sub connectors, {{they are designed}} primarily for applications where space and weight are of major importance while accommodating {{a large number of}} circuits in proportion to their size which makes them well suited for aircraft, missiles and related ground support systems. Although MIL-DTL-24308 connectors are primarily designed for rack and panel applications, these connectors can also be adapted for other cabling requirements by addition of accessories and integral clamps. These connectors are intended for general military use as follows: (i) Classes G and N connectors are intended for use in applications where the operating temperature range of -55째 to +125 째C is experienced; Class N connectors are used in applications where the presence of residual magnetism must be held to low levels; (iii) Class H receptacles are used where atmospheric pressures must be contained across the wall or panels on which the connectors are mounted; and (iv) Classes D, K, and M connectors are for high-reliability space applications. The insert arrangements are provided in the specification.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{theoretical}} studies of heat-shielding {{properties of the}} angle of external wall a residential building are presented. The brick wall thickness of 510 mm was considered. The studies were performed for the I-st temperature zone of Ukraine. Heat insulation was located on the external side of enclosure. Thermal protection problems of the angle are consideration {{of the impact of}} heat-conductive inclusion on adjusted heat transfer resistance of enclosure. Conductive inclusion on the external angle area is its configuration. An additional layer of insulation in the angle area is necessary to use for bringing the level of thermal protection of angle area to the standards. The results of calculations of two-dimensional temperature fields were used for the analysis of thermal protection. Two options for additional insulation were studied. The first option: continuous strip insulation covering the external wall angle. Another one provides division of additional insulation layer into two parts and displacement them from the angle within the design scheme. Studies were performed for different thickness of additional insulation. There was additionally taking into account the value of <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> from the angle for the second option. The optimal location and size of additional insulation were determined. The minimum amount of additional insulation under which the thermal protection requirements are performed was accepted like optimality criterion...|$|E
