5|$|Historically, Salukis {{were used}} for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry {{included}} the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride close to their quarry on a camel holding a Saluki, which would be thrown towards the prey while at speed to give the dog a running start. Gazelle hunters also used hawks to <b>gouge</b> out {{the eyes of the}} prey so that a Saluki could then bring down the blinded animal.|$|E

Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C. Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to <b>gouge</b> fans. After Pearl Jam’s testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jam’s manager said he was gratified that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the belief}} that de <b>Gouges</b> {{was the center of}} a Royalist {{conspiracy}} stemmed from her involvement with multiple wealthy aristocrats and her desires to rid herself of her provincial accent. Upon posting her note demanding the plebiscite, the Jacobins discovered a partially complete play written by de <b>Gouges</b> parodying the Revolution - the play begins with the Revolutionaries (including de <b>Gouges)</b> demanding rights; the only Act completed, Act I, ends with de <b>Gouges</b> lecturing Marie Antoinette and teaching her ways to govern. The Jacobins, in an effort to find evidence that de <b>Gouges</b> was treasonous, fabricated a conspiracy surrounding this play and the Declaration that de <b>Gouges,</b> in fact, was desiring to overthrow the Revolution.|$|R
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{very fond}} of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali. Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to <b>gouge</b> and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.|$|E
5|$|Ninety {{seconds after}} Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' {{players and coaches}} were huddled at midcourt, {{attempting}} to calm down Wallace (Tayshaun Prince was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Artest {{was lying on the}} table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him in the chest. Artest jumped off the table, ran into the stands, and grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle stood up to try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a <b>gouge</b> on his head. Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who was not dressed for the game due to injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones. More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and <b>gouge</b> their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E

50|$|Sidehill gougers are herbivorous mammals who {{dwell in}} {{hillside}} burrows, and are occasionally depicted as laying eggs. There are usually 6 to 8 pups to a litter. Since the <b>gouger</b> is footed for hillsides, it cannot {{stand up on}} level ground. If by accident a <b>gouger</b> falls from a hill, it can easily be captured or starve to death. When a clockwise <b>gouger</b> meets a counter-clockwise <b>gouger,</b> they have {{to fight to the}} death since they can only go in one direction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gouger</b> was {{the fifth}} son of nine {{children}} of George <b>Gouger</b> (1763-1802), who was a prosperous city merchant, and his wife Anne, née Sibley. Robert was educated at Nottingham, England, and on leaving school he entered his father's office. He became friendly with Robert Owen of Lanark and, influenced by him, began taking an interest in social issues. In 1829 <b>Gouger</b> became associated with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and assisted him in advocating his colonization schemes. In this year Wakefield published A Letter from Sydney which appeared as edited by Robert <b>Gouger.</b> In the same year <b>Gouger</b> forwarded Wakefield's pamphlet, a Sketch of a Proposal for Colonizing Australia, to the colonial office, but received no encouragement.|$|R

50|$|Seabed <b>gouging</b> by ice is an eminently {{discreet}} phenomenon: {{little sign}} {{of it can}} be observed from above the water surface - the odd evidence includes sea floor sediments incorporated into the ice. Information of interest on these <b>gouges</b> includes: depth, width, length and orientation. <b>Gouging</b> frequency - the number of <b>gouges</b> produced at a given location per unit time - is another important parameter. This kind of information has been gathered by means of seabed mapping with ship-borne instrumentation, typically a fathometer: echo sounding devices such as a side-scan and a multi-beam sonar systems. Repetitive mapping involves repeating these surveys a number of times, at an interval ranging from a few to several years, {{as a means of}} estimating <b>gouging</b> frequency.|$|R

40|$|A <b>gouging</b> {{phenomenon}} with a hypervelocity sliding {{electrical contact}} in railgun not only shortens the rail lifetime but also affects the interior ballistic performance. In this paper, a 3 -D numerical model {{was introduced to}} simulate and analyze the generation mechanism and evolution of the rail <b>gouging</b> phenomenon. The results show that a rail surface bulge {{is an important factor}} to induce <b>gouging.</b> High density and high pressure material flow on the contact surface, obliquely extruded into the rail when accelerating the armature to a high velocity, can produce <b>gouging.</b> Both controlling the bulge size to a certain range and selecting suitable materials for rail surface coating will suppress the formation of <b>gouging.</b> The numerical simulation had a good agreement with experiments, which validated the computing model and methodology are reliable...|$|R
25|$|G-ADDR, {{the fifth}} Scion II, was {{retained}} by Shorts as an experimental testbed aircraft, {{and it was}} on this aircraft (temporarily designated M.3) that a scale wooden model of the slender wings (with <b>Gouge</b> flaps) for the later Empire boats was tested, the first flight in this configuration being conducted by Lankester Parker on 6 August 1935. With these flaps fitted it was tested at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which found that the <b>Gouge</b> flap decreased distance to take-off and stalling speed, among other improvements. Further work with standard wings was carried out; one flight from Rochester Airport, with experimental full-span flaps incorporating retractable spoilers instead of ailerons, was made on 22 July 1936; this idea proved unworkable, Lankester Parker having to draw on his considerable experience to coax the aircraft around on a single circuit before landing safely. The standard wing was refitted and the aircraft continued with Shorts in this configuration until it was impressed into military service in 1940, an operational usage experienced by 14 of the 22 Scion/Scion II aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Sarafand was a six-engined biplane {{flying boat}} with equal span wings. Due {{to the high}} wing end loads, <b>Gouge</b> {{specified}} corrugated steel spars for both upper and lower wings. The six engines, in tractor/pusher pairs, were housed in monocoque nacelles mounted between the wings on integral girders; the central nacelle was further supported by two pairs of splayed struts to the lower wing-roots. The hull, largely constructed of anodised Alclad, had a stainless-steel planing bottom. It had a monoplane tail unit with one large fin and two small auxiliary fins on the tailplane.|$|E
25|$|The Sarafand {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Oswald Short in 1928 as an enlarged {{development of the}} Singapore II, to provide transatlantic range capabilitity. Short managed to persuade first his chief designer Arthur <b>Gouge</b> and then the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Hugh Trenchard (later Viscount Trenchard) of the feasibility of such a large aircraft and Air Ministry specification R.6/28 was drawn up to define the project. It was conducted as a public/private joint venture, the Air Ministry funding it with £60,000 and Short Brothers providing the rest. The aircraft was originally designated the Short R6/28 before being named the Sarafand.|$|E
50|$|After her death, says Olivier Blanc, her son General Pierre Aubry de <b>Gouges</b> went to Guyana {{with his}} wife and five children. He died in 1802, after which his widow {{attempted}} to return to France, but died aboard the ship during her return. In Guadeloupe, the two young daughters were married, Marie Hyacinthe Geneviève de <b>Gouges</b> to an English officer (Captain William Wood), who subsequently settled in Tasmania, and Charlotte de <b>Gouges</b> to American politician Robert Selden Garnett, a member of the United States Congress who had plantations in Virginia. Hence, many Australian and American families have Olympe de <b>Gouges</b> as an ancestor (per Olivier Blanc).|$|R
30|$|Questions remain, however, {{whether the}} high {{magnetic}} susceptibility fault <b>gouges</b> were formed by one earthquake; whether the fault <b>gouges</b> of different depths, such as surface outcrop and the drilling core, {{are of a}} similar nature; and why the magnetic susceptibility of some fault <b>gouges</b> does not display a significant anomaly. The rock magnetic properties of the WFSD- 1 core for different rock types and fault zones will be addressed in future studies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gouger</b> has an honoured {{place among}} the founders of South Australia. Wakefield was the {{controlling}} mind, but <b>Gouger</b> was his able and hard-working representative {{at a time when}} it was impossible for Wakefield to take any prominent part in affairs.

25|$|The {{increased}} use of more freely available credit changed the American economy, but not without creating some backlash. Consumer advocates complained that some issuers were using late fees of $5 or $10, charged if a single month's payment was even one day overdue, to <b>gouge</b> extra profits from customers who might otherwise be borrowing and spending responsibly. Laws in some states limited those fees, yet companies and banks continued to charge above those limits, claiming the late fees were a form of interest and thus {{not subject to the}} laws of those states {{as long as they were}} headquartered elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|In {{the years}} between 1830 and 1834 various {{colonization}} schemes were brought forward and <b>Gouger</b> was active in their promulgation. Some of these schemes were intended to be money-making, but the South Australian Association, founded in December 1833 with <b>Gouger</b> as honorary secretary, was principally philanthropic in its objects. <b>Gouger</b> worked untiringly with Wakefield, many obstacles had to be surmounted and many compromises made, but in August 1834 the act {{for the establishment of}} South Australia became law. In May 1835 <b>Gouger</b> applied for the position of colonial secretary for South Australia. He disagreed strongly with Wakefield about the price to be asked for land in the new colony and they became estranged in June 1835. <b>Gouger</b> was given the appointment of colonial secretary at a salary of £400 a year and sailed in the Africaine on 30 June 1836. He had been married to Harriet Jackson on 22 October 1835. They landed in South Australia on 10 November 1836.

25|$|The Escarpment of {{that time}} was more {{gradually}} sloped than it is now, with much loose rock from its uplift. Sometime between 100,000 and 300,000 years ago, the Illinoian glaciation swept through the region. This had two impacts on the Escarpment. Not only did it scour and steepen its slopes, leaving the many bare cliffs found today, it carved out both Platte and Kaaterskill cloves from the narrower, shorter and shallower valleys of smaller streams. In the latter, the <b>gouge</b> in the Escarpment was so deep it resulted in stream capture, as the outflow streams from North-South Lake, the headwaters of what would eventually be named Schoharie Creek instead flowed down into the new gorge. This both created Kaaterskill Falls, one of the Catskills' early tourist attractions, and relocated {{the source of the}} Schoharie to its present location.|$|E
