5|$|Geologist Barbara J. Sivertsen {{seeks to}} {{establish}} {{a link between the}} eruption of Santorini (c. 1600 BCE) and the <b>Exodus</b> <b>of</b> the Israelites from Egypt in the Bible, which was also suggested in the books: The Exodus Enigma, by lan Wilson (1985) and Return to Sodom and Gomorrah, by Charles Pellegrino (1994).|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{changes to the}} ethnic {{composition}} of Slavonian counties occurred between censuses conducted in 1991 and 2001. The 1991 census recorded a heterogenous population consisting mostly of Croats and Serbs—at 72 percent and 17 {{percent of the total}} population respectively. The Croatian War of Independence, and the ethnic fracturing of Yugoslavia that preceded it, caused an <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> the Croat population followed by an <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> Serbs. The return of refugees since the end of hostilities is not complete—a majority of Croat refugees returned, while fewer Serbs did. In addition, ethnic Croats moved to Slavonia from Bosnia and Herzegovina and from Serbia.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> several {{manufacturing}} companies, the area's {{industrial economy}} {{began to decline}} during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the Great Depression, led {{to the collapse of}} the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and precision mechanics. This decline would continue into the later half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Massachusetts residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000. The 1969 closure of the Springfield Armory, in particular, spurred an <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Scholars argue {{regarding}} how much <b>of</b> <b>Exodus</b> {{is attributable to}} J {{and how much to}} E, as beginning in Exodus 3 the E source also refers to God as Yahweh. J provides much of the material <b>of</b> <b>Exodus</b> 1-5 but is closely intertwined with E. Thus, {{it is difficult to determine}} what portion <b>of</b> <b>Exodus</b> 1-15 is J and what is E; however, it is easy to see the parallel P strand, which also gives an account of Israel's bondage and the <b>Exodus</b> miracles <b>of</b> its own.|$|R
5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> oil industries. Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, {{was one of the}} hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, Marine {{intelligence}} {{began to}} note an <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> NVA units from the Khe Sanh sector. The 325C Divisional Headquarters {{was the first}} to leave, followed by the 95C and 101D Regiments, all of which relocated to the west. At the same time, the 304th Division withdrew to the southwest. That did not mean, however that battle was over. On 22 March over 1,000 North Vietnamese rounds fell on the base, and, once again, the ammunition dump was detonated.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{continued}} to experience modest growth {{during the first}} half of the 20th century. The University of Hong Kong was established in 1911 as the territory's first higher education institute. While there had been an <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> 60,000 residents for fear of a German attack on the British colony during the First World War, Hong Kong remained unscathed. Its population increased from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925 and reached 1.6 million by 1941.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Machen {{and other}} conservatives founded the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. A year later, the General Assembly {{declared}} the Independent Board unconstitutional {{and demanded that}} all church members cut ties with it. Machen refused to obey, and his ordination was suspended in 1936. Afterwards, Machen led an <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> conservatives to form what would be later known as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1894 that Stroma gained its first {{artificial}} landing point, a pier built from Portland cement near Nethertown {{at a cost of}} £800. In 1955, Caithness County Council constructed a new harbour on the south coast of the island at the then great cost of £28,500. Although it was intended to help stem the <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> people from the island, Stroma was abandoned only a few years after the harbour's completion.|$|E
5|$|Non-governmental organisations {{began to}} move back into the country, but the {{international}} community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime, and most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E
50|$|At {{its peak}} Exodus {{included}} over 250 local ministries in the United States and Canada and over 150 ministries in 17 other countries. Although Exodus was formally an interdenominational Christian entity, {{it was most}} closely associated with Protestant and evangelical denominations. The Exodus Global Alliance was formed out <b>of</b> <b>Exodus</b> International in 1995 and continues to operate in support <b>of</b> <b>Exodus</b> networks outside <b>of</b> the United States.|$|R

5|$|The Clal Center {{enjoyed a}} high {{occupancy}} rate from government offices, businesses, and private companies until the mid-1980s. The construction of Malha Mall and government facilities at Givat Ram precipitated the <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> many private and government {{firms in the}} 1990s, leaving entire floors of the office tower unoccupied. Stores on the commercial level also began closing {{due to lack of}} customers; as of 2010, many stores were being used as storerooms by Mahane Yehuda Market merchants.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch {{released}} {{reports of}} German soldiers in disguise {{to the international}} news agencies. This caused a fifth column scare, especially in Belgium and France. However, unlike the situation later on in those two countries, in the Netherlands there was no mass <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> civilian refugees, clogging the roads. Generally German soldiers behaved in a civilised manner towards the Dutch population, forming neat queues at the shops to buy goods rationed in Germany, such as chocolate.|$|E
5|$|The French {{departure}} {{prompted a}} mass <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> the American militia, significantly shrinking the American force. On 24 August, Sullivan was alerted by General George Washington that Clinton was assembling a relief force in New York. That evening his council {{made the decision}} to withdraw to positions on {{the northern part of the}} island. Sullivan continued to seek French assistance, dispatching Lafayette to Boston to negotiate further with d'Estaing.|$|E

The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events, from the fall of Afghanistan's monarchy through the Soviet military intervention, the <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> refugees to Pakistan and the United States, {{and the rise of the}} Taliban regime.|$|E
5|$|With Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops {{launched}} a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful, {{but during the}} course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in infighting between the Baluba and Bena Lulua ethnic groups. As a result, the ANC perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. Around 3,000 were killed. The violence of the advance caused an <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> thousands of Baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|Following an {{alliance}} contracted in 1912, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia {{declared war on}} the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their goal was to definitely expel Turks from Europe. The First Balkan War started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October. The Turkish forces had left the city the day before. The Serbian annexation led to the <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> many Turks: 725 Turkish families left the city on 27 January 1913. The same year, the city population was evaluated at 37,000 by the Serbian authorities.|$|E
5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{claimed that}} {{there was no mention of}} the case in police records held by {{archives}} in Adelaide, but that instead, the incident had been related to him by residents of the district who had known Brown. He also placed it as having occurred between 1860 and 1870. Foster et al. note that this date is highly unlikely, as frontier violence in the district began when squatters arrived in 1843, and was tapering off by 1848 when the murders occurred. By the 1860s, Aboriginal labour was highly sought after by pastoralists in the district due to the <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> white labourers to the Victorian gold rush.|$|E
