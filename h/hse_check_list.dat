40|$|In a {{clinical}} trial of two antirheumatic agents two methods of collection of side effects were used, one with and the other without a <b>check</b> <b>list</b> of possible symptoms.

Each <b>check</b> <b>list</b> includes questions on the design, conduct, analysis, and presentation of studies, and answers to these contribute to the overall statistical evaluation.

The <b>check</b> <b>list</b> was used to examine 141 reports of therapeutic trials published in four British non-specialist journals {{in the first six months}} of 1966 and of 1969.
