40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} the examination of effectiveness of lime dose in order to stabilization of sewage sludge and comparison of lime stabilized sludge reuse with aerobic digested sludge reuse. Lime and aerobic stabilization were carried out in two laboratory reactor with 40 L capacity. The sludge samples were taken from the return activated sludge line in four times. Lime was used at various ratios and the mixture was stabilized for 30 days. During the lime hydrated stabilization pH values were significantly increased from 7 to 12. 5. Also, aerobic digester was loaded with raw sludge and mixed by sufficient amount of air for 30 days. The results indicate that the lime addition with the dose of 0. 4 g Ca(OH) 2 g - 1 DS could completely inactive a high amount of fecal coliforms within 1 h and in all of the times was lower than 1000 MPN g - 1 DS after 30 days (p< 0. 01). But after 30 days, fecal coliforms density in aerobic digested sludge could not achieve to Class A of USEPA category. In two stabilization methods, density of viable helminths ova could not reduce to 1 ova/ 4 g DS and could not achieve to Class A of USEPA category. Therefore, these methods could be achieved the reduction requirement set by USEPA for class B (p< 0. 01) and the products could be well used as a landfill cover or a soil conditioner. Finally, our study confirmed that lime sludge stabilization has a higher <b>hygienic</b> <b>effect</b> and more cost-effective than aerobic stabilization, specially, when such sludge is used to dung and modify acid soils...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine biochemical alterations of liver function among paint manufacturers and sprayers associated with exposure to organic solvents. Two paint manufacturing factories and 22 various kinds of spray painting factories (16 car painting, two aircraft painting, three video terminal painting; and one trailer painting) were included. Air concentrations of organic solvents were collected by personal samplers and analysed by gas chromatography. A total of 180 workers were given a comprehensive physical examination, a questionnaire, a liver function test, and a test for hepatitis B surface antigen. The questionnaire contained questions regarding detailed personal medical history, intake of alcohol, and use of medicine. Mixtures of solvents were used throughout the factories, and xylene and toluene were the major components found in almost all air samples with average contents of 46 % and 29 % on a weight basis of 67 air samples. No strong hepatotoxic solvents were detected. Workers were classified according to the different exposure patterns and different air concentrations of breathing zones as: high (eight hour time weighted average (8 h TWA) <b>hygienic</b> <b>effects</b> of solvents 0. 25 - 9. 83, median 1. 66), short term high (8 h TWA <b>hygienic</b> <b>effects</b> of solvents 0 - 3. 38, median 0. 12), and low (8 h TWA <b>hygienic</b> <b>effects</b> of solvents all below 0. 38). After applying a multivariate model to control the non-occupational factors (alcohol, medication, age, and hepatitis B viral infection), increase in gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity was found to be associated with severity of exposure to the mixture of solvents. Because the possible effects on GGT activity of non-occupational factors were controlled for, it is concluded that increased GGT activity among exposed workers may be due to a higher exposure to the mixture of solvents...|$|R

Resulting shea butters of each variation was analyzed and the ANOVA test performed on characteristics to evaluate variations effects. The peroxide index increased continuously (2. 79 ± 0. 05 to 10. 30 ± 0. 05 mEg O 2 /kg) from the first week to the fourth sun drying week, while unsapnifiable matter decreased (17. 60 ± 0. 05 to 1. 55 ± 0. 05 %). Both peroxide and acid index were higher after five minutes of roasting than they were before; and shea butter conserved in sterile wrapper was germs free, compared to other wrappers. Moreover, the process taking into account all these optimal conditions conduced to shea butter with moisture (0. 15 %), acid (11. 94 mg KOH/g), peroxide (2. 79 ± 0. 05 mEg O 2 /kg), saponifiable (196. 10 ± 0. 15 mg KOH/g), refractive (1. 465 ± 0. 005) index and melting point (35. 0 ± 0. 1 °C) conforming to international standard.

In this study, {{the influence of}} sugar dusting treatments on hygienic behavior was evaluated in 44 strong honey bee colonies. Three doses of pulverized sugar, 20, 30 and 40 g, each applied at three-, seven- and fourteen-day intervals were tested. The percentage of cleaned cells (PCC) in {{the total number of}} those with pin-killed brood served as a measure of the <b>hygienic</b> potential. The <b>effect</b> was dependent on the frequency of treatments: all doses applied every third and seventh day significantly (p< 0. 001) decreased the PCC in comparison with the untreated control colonies. Nevertheless, sugar did not threaten the hygienic potential, as PPC values remained above 94 % following all treatments. Thus, it can be concluded that the tested sugar treatments are safe and can be justifiably implemented into integrated pest management strategies to control Varroa destructor...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Agricultural {{activity}} in Varamin plain has been faced with many challenges in recent years, due to vicinity to Tehran {{the capital of}} Iran (competition for Latian dam reservoir), and competition with Tehran south network in allocation of Mamlou dam reservoir and treated wastewater of south wastewater treatment plant. Mamlou and Latian dam reservoirs, due to increase of population and industry sectors, allocated to urban utilization of Tehran. Based on national policy, the treated wastewater should be replaced with Latian dam reservoir water to supply water demand of agricultural sector. High volume transmission of wastewater to Varamin plain, will be have economical, environmental, and social effects. Several factors effect on wastewater management and success of utilization plans and any change in these factors may have various feedbacks on the other elements of wastewater use system. Hence, development of a model with capability of simulation of all factors, aspects and interactions that affect wastewater utilization is very necessary. The main objective of present study was development of water integrated model to study long-term effects of irrigation with Tehran treated wastewater, using system dynamics modeling (SD) approach. Materials and Methods: Varamin Plain {{is one of the}} most important agricultural production centers of the country due to nearness to the large consumer market of Tehran and having fertile soil and knowledge of agriculture. The total agricultural irrigated land in Varamin Plain is 53486 hectares containing 17274 hectares of barley, 16926 hectares of wheat, 3866 hectares of tomato, 3521 hectares of vegetables, 3556 hectares of alfalfa, 2518 hectares of silage maize, 1771 hectares of melon, 1642 hectares of cotton, 1121 hectares of cucumber and 1291 hectares of other crops. In 2006 the irrigation requirement of the crop pattern was about 690 MCM and the actual agriculture water consumption was about 620 MCM (supplying 90 percent of the demand), 368 MCM of which was supplied through groundwater and 252 MCM was supplied by surface water. In recent years supplying water from Latyan Dam to the agriculture in Varamin Plain due to water supply of Tehran and the recent droughts has been reduced to lower than half (the average 68. 8 MCM). On the other hand, shortage of surface water resources has caused an additional pressure to the groundwater resources of the Plain. Excessive groundwater withdrawal and use of brackish reused waters in the southern parts of the plain has caused the quality loss in groundwater resources, so that groundwater salinity has increased about 0. 5 dS/m from the year 2000 to 2011. Obviously, by continuing the present situation, in less than two decades the groundwater resources in Varamin will be either quite destroyed or unable to be used due to inappropriate quality. Another source of surface water is allocated to the Varamin Plain is treated wastewater produced from Tehran Wastewater Treatment Plant. Utilizing the phases 1 to 4 of this treatment plant, about 80 MCM (2. 5 up to 4 m 3 /s) of wastewater is annually transferred to Varamin Plain. According to the projections, it is assumed that wastewater will be used in near future as the most important water resource to Varamin Plain. In this study, SD was applied as the system analysis method for the Varamin wastewater management. The spatial boundary of the SD model for Varamin model was the whole Varamin area, which is 1584 km 2. The historical review period was from 2001 to 2011, the simulated period was from 2011 to 2036, and the simulation time interval was one year. The most important scenarios evaluated consisted of four wastewater allocation scenarios [(i) keeping the excising condition, (ii) complete allocation of Latian dam reservoir water to Tehran domestic use, allocation of 200 MCM treated wastewater during growing season to agricultural sector and 40 MCM to artificial aquifer recharge during non-growing season starting year 2016, (iii) similar to scenario number two w/o artificial aquifer recharge and (iv) similar to scenario number two plus allocating 50 MCM starting year 2021]. Mass flow or convection method by considering surface adsorption of solute was used to survey movement and adsorption of elements in soil. Adsorption isotherms delineated and determined by field and experimental measurement. Results and Discussion: The result indicated that if raw wastewater be used till 2031, Cadmium and Copeer concentration will be outstanding and will have harmful effects on farmer’s health. Utilization of treated wastewater will be safe and will have not harmful effects on farmer’s health by heavy metals, to about 150 future years. Also, simulating result showed that Nitrate concentration in groundwater will exceed from allowable limitation for potable water in all scenarios to 2031. Application of scenarios (iv) and (iii) lead to the lowest and the highest Nitrate concentration, respectively. Conclusion: In this model a systems system dynamics approach was applied to understand how various factors related to operation of wastewater and water sustainability interrelate. The developed model is capable to simulation of all factors, aspects and interactions that affect wastewater utilization. Result of this study demonstrated that SD is a useful decision support tool for sustainable wastewater management. By considering severe water shortage problems in the study area, and safe utilization of treated wastewater, treated wastewater transmission of Tehran plant to Varamin Plain can help to solve water shortage problems. Increase of treated wastewater allocation lead to decrease of raw sewage and hereby decreasing <b>hygienic</b> harmful <b>effects...</b>|$|R
