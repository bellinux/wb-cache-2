40|$|The {{topic of}} my thesis was to {{evaluate}} radiation doses {{to patients with}} lung skigrafii. The impetus {{for the treatment of}} this topic was that even though the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic (Věštník MZ ČR 9 / 2011) recommends the use of classic hard skigrafii lung imaging technique, a number of radiodiagnostic workplaces still uses the technique of low voltage, although the patient is exposed to a higher dose. Skigrafie lung examination is among the low-dose exposure, but it is the most commonly performed tests. Since the risks of radiation from various sources of radiation during their lives constantly in the body are added, it is necessary to try to make at least a medical exposures are minimized as much as possible. In the theoretical part I tried to arrange the all important information on x-rays, skiagrafii, lung anatomy, imaging techniques, radiation protection and legislative framework that deals radiodiagnostika. Department of Radiology in the Czech Republic have at their disposal guidelines and recommendations for proper X-ray examinations, called. National Radiological standards that ensure optimum image quality while minimizing the radiation dose for the patient. For physicians who indicate radiodiagnostic examinations is crucial document "Indication criteria for imaging", which sets criteria so that all examinations imaging methods were <b>duly</b> <b>substantiated,</b> and their indications regulated. Practical work is focused on comparing the radiation burden of two imaging techniques for the examination of the lungs, namely imaging technique compared with low (ie. Soft) and high (ie. Hard) exposure voltage. The main part is based on the processing of results and input values falling surface kerma, which were measured for X-ray work by a water phantom ionization chamber using two exposure techniques. Based oriented values and using tabulated values I calculated the dose for each imaging technique. The effective dose for soft imaging technique was almost three times higher than the technique hard. Also interesting is the result of secondary radiation, the soft technique is almost five times exceeds the emerging secondary radiation hard imaging technique. Another important part of this work was to compare the effective doses for the two groups of selected patients with radiographic examination of the lungs, were divided according to the used imaging technique. The first group of patients who were imaged {{in the first quarter of}} 2014 equipment with voltage 125 kV, in the second group were patients from the first quarter of 2011 the average radiography exposure voltage 57. 2 kV. From both groups were selected only patients with a weight of 60 - 80 kg, which approximates the patient's usual layout, with whom works legislation Ministry of Health. The effective dose for hard imaging technique for the examination is 0. 0085 mSv, for a soft technique is effective dose equal to 0. 0304 mSv. It follows that the effective dose for hard skigrafické imaging technique for examination of the lungs during soft imaging technique is 3. 5 times higher than in the technique hard. In terms of radiation protection is also interesting, as shown in the calculation of benefits program PCXMC that the dose to the gonads when skigrafické examination of the lungs almost zero, therefore the use of protective equipment in the genitals during the examination pointless and rather plays a psychological role. The aim of this thesis was to demonstrate that the advised the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic on the transition from soft to hard imaging technique technique is justified. On the basis of unmeasured values and progressive processing of results I could confirm my hypothesis: Using hard imaging technique at skigrafii lungs is reduced patient radiation dose...|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, Okazaki, {{along with many}} Japanese, was interned for six months. (Note: This is alleged, but not <b>substantiated</b> through FOIA <b>requests</b> to the U.S. Government. It is {{possible}} {{that he was only}} held under arrest and not placed in an internment camp.) He was released relatively quickly because of the intervention of Curley Freedman who used his FBI contacts to aid in Okazaki's release. Curley was the first tile contractor in Honolulu, and installed tile in the homes and businesses of many Japanese. Because of his craftsmanship, he was well liked and widely known. The FBI asked his assistance in identifying Japanese Fishing Sanpans that may have been contacting Japanese Subs and relaying US Naval Pearl Harbor activity. The FBI would also ask Bud Estes, who worked for Curley in the tile business, to assist in identifying drug dealers on another island during the harvest period. As Bud had knowledge of the island from his Salvation Army missionary days, he agreed and assisted the FBI until his cover was revealed.|$|R
50|$|Prime Minister Purnananda Burhagohain {{knew that}} a well-trained, fully armed and {{regularly}} paid standing army is very essential to maintain order in the country. During {{the reign of the}} previous monarch, Gaurinath Singha, he had witnessed how a small group of disciplined, well-armed and well-trained British troop had defeated large groups of Moamoria rebels. Therefore, remodeling of Ahom army in the line of British troops began during the reign of Gaurinath Singha, which was continued and extended during the reign of Kamaleswar Singha. In 1803 CE, Purnananda Burhagohain dispatched an embassy, consisting of Baloram Khangia Phukan, Bhudhar Chaliha Changkakati, Madhuram Bora, Govindram Sarma Khound and Tanusyam Sarma Khound under the leadership of his son Orekhanath Dhekial Phukan to the Governor-General of British India, Lord Wellesley with formal request to supply a quota of well-trained sepoys and large quantity of arms and weapons The Ahom envoys made over to the Governor-General 2000 gold mohurs (coins) and 10,000 silver rupees as present from the Ahom government to <b>substantiate</b> the <b>request.</b> The supplies solicited by Purnananda Burhagohain were readily granted; and with their help the Ahom army was organised on up-do-date lines. Local Assamese people from Bacha and Dayang regions were recruited in the army and were trained in modern methods of weaponry and warfare with the help of these sepoys from British army. The army was divided into eighteen companies of one hundred soldiers each. Chandra Gohain, a relation of the Premier, was appointed Captain, and he was subsequently raised to the rank of a Major and then Colonel. The commander had under him a gradation of Subedars and Jamadars. Later, detachments of the new force were garrisoned at Guwahati, Jorhat, Sadiya and Mahang.|$|R
40|$|Glioblastoma is {{the most}} common and most {{aggressive}} primary brain tumour. Standard of care consists of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and concomitant and maintenance temozolomide (temozolomide/radiotherapy→temozolomide). Corticosteroids are commonly used perioperatively to control cerebral oedema and are frequently continued throughout subsequent treatment, notably radiotherapy, for amelioration of side effects. The effects of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone on cell growth in glioma models and on patient survival have remained controversial. We performed a retrospective analysis of glioblastoma patient cohorts to determine the prognostic role of steroid administration. A disease-relevant mouse model of glioblastoma was used to characterize the effects of dexamethasone on tumour cell proliferation and death, and to identify gene signatures associated with these effects. A murine anti-VEGFA antibody was used in parallel as an alternative for oedema control. We applied the dexamethasone-induced gene signature to The Cancer Genome Atlas glioblastoma dataset to explore the association of dexamethasone exposure with outcome. Mouse experiments were used to validate the effects of dexamethasone on survival in vivo Retrospective clinical analyses identified corticosteroid use during radiotherapy as an independent indicator of shorter survival in three independent patient cohorts. A dexamethasone-associated gene expression signature correlated with shorter survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas patient dataset. In glioma-bearing mice, dexamethasone pretreatment decreased tumour cell proliferation without affecting tumour cell viability, but reduced survival when combined with radiotherapy. Conversely, anti-VEGFA antibody decreased proliferation and increased tumour cell death, but did not affect survival when combined with radiotherapy. Clinical and mouse experimental data suggest that corticosteroids may decrease the effectiveness of treatment and shorten survival in glioblastoma. Dexamethasone-induced anti-proliferative effects may confer protection from radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced genotoxic stress. This study highlights the importance of identifying alternative agents such as vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists for managing oedema in glioblastoma patients. Beyond the established adverse effect profile of protracted corticosteroid use, this analysis <b>substantiates</b> the <b>request</b> for prudent and restricted use of corticosteroids in glioblastoma...|$|R
