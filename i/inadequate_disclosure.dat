The Federal Reserve was criticized for not properly monitoring the quality of mortgage originations. Once the crisis hit its critical stage in September 2008, the regulators did not consistently apply remedies available to them, thereby increasing uncertainty.

50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Romanian {{legislation}} {{in the field of}} media ownership transparency is formally aligned with the European standards (both the European Commission and the Council of Europe standards are incorporated in the national legal framework), in practice, there are some major problems.

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to explore}} {{the impact of the}} {{transition}} to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on Greek listed companies' financial statements with a focus on net profit, shareholders' equity, gearing and liquidity. It also seeks to examine any differences in the impact across the sub-samples of companies with Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditors. Design/methodology/approach – In line with recent literature, the paper employs Gray's comparability index. The sample consists of 238 Greek companies, representing 75 per cent of the companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange at the end of March 2006. Findings – Implementation of IFRS {{had a significant impact on}} financial position and reported performance as well as on gearing and liquidity ratios. On average, impact on shareholders' equity and net income was positive while impact on gearing and liquidity was negative. Only companies with non-Big 4 auditors faced significant impact on net profit and liquidity. They also faced a significantly greater impact on gearing than companies with Big 4 auditors. A large number of companies with material negative changes is identified, suggesting that transition to IFRS and the fair value option does not necessarily result in higher shareholders' equity figures. Many companies provided <b>inadequate</b> transitional <b>disclosures.</b> This is significantly related to auditor size. Practical implications – The findings suggest that reporting quality has improved under the new accounting regime, especially for companies with non-Big 4 auditors. Originality/value – Prior literature indicates that the impact revealed in companies' reconciliation statements can have significant effects on users' decision making. On that basis, the study can stimulate future research and is relevant to standard setters and regulators. Accounting, Auditors, Greece, Standards...|$|R

Second, using the recent Argentine crisis as an illustration, {{we argue that}} systemic risks may exert an overwhelming impact on market behavior, overshadowing {{the link between the}} latter and bank fundamentals. Thus, market discipline, while missing in the traditional sense, may be indeed quite robust once systemic risks are factored in. We conclude that in emerging economies the analysis of market discipline should take into account the importance of institutional and systemic factors. ...|$|E

40|$|Aims: Ensuring that {{patients}} {{have a positive}} experience of care {{has been identified as}} one of the five high-level outcome domains for the NHS in England. To provide baseline data on contemporary experiences of UK end of life care, a systematic review was performed to identify all literature on end of life care experiences between 1997 and 2010 in the UK. Results relating to information disclosure, communication and decision-making involvement in end of life care are presented here. Method: Six databases - AMED, EMBASE, OVID MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsyInfo, BNI (1997 - 2007) were searched. Inclusion criteria were primary UK studies on patients’ and/or carers’ perspectives; published between 1997 and 2010; concerned with experiences of health and social care services in end of life, palliative, terminal or hospice care by adult patients; findings relate to information disclosure, communication and decision-making. Results: 25 of 4558 citations met inclusion criteria. Patients and carers were often given inaccurate information and had limited understanding of their or their relatives’ illness. They also reported <b>inadequate</b> information <b>disclosure</b> and poor access to information. Most patients and carers had had an end of life discussion. Though the discussion was helpful in death preparation, not all patients and carers welcomed it. Open, honest communication and staff with positive personal attributes were identified as two factors facilitating end of life discussion. Involvement in end of life care planning was low but patients varied greatly in their desire to be involved in planning their care. Conclusions: Findings suggest room for improvement in communication with patients and families in UK end of life care. Patients and carers varied in their preference for information delivery, amount of information disclosure, emotional response to end of life discussion and degree of involvement in care planning.

30|$|Valuation in {{initial public}} offerings (IPO) of firms has always {{received}} much academic attention. Scholars generally employ theories such as signaling theory under the asymmetric information to explain it. Grossman and Stiglitz ([1980]) suggest that the <b>inadequate</b> or unauthentic <b>disclosure</b> of information in an imperfect market and the different capabilities to acquire, perceive, and understand information of market participants will affect their decision making and the risk premium by holding different {{quantity and quality of}} information. Only information of price is offered in the stock market, and other information about a listed firm is highly asymmetric. Information asymmetry exists between regulatory authorities and listed companies, between listed companies and investors, as well as between institutional investors and individual investors. Greenwald and Stiglitz ([1993]) point out that information is the foundation of financial market operations, and hence, such information asymmetry would cause many problems for the market. For instance, due to prior information asymmetry, products with bad quality will drive out those with good quality because of adverse selection, which will eventually result in the whole quality decline of the products traded in the market.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} Thai managers' {{perceptions}} {{of the nature of}} corporate governance in Thailand since the Asian financial crisis of 1997. It contributes to the agency theory literature by identifying relations between families, boards and corporate governance. Thailand, like most economies based on private enterprise has had serious company failures. Since 1997, many of these have been attributed to the Asian financial crisis, but further investigation has shown that the underlying weaknesses of Thai corporate structures made them highly exposed to such crises. Prior to the Asian financial crisis, Thai corporate governance practices were characterised by ineffective boards of directors, weak internal controls, unreliable financial reporting and <b>disclosure,</b> <b>inadequate</b> protection of minority shareholder rights, poor audits and generally lacked enforcement to ensure regulatory compliance. Additionally, the dominance of family control over business operations was prevalent. The international corporate governance system assumes a separation of ownership and control, a questionable assumption in the Thai context. The important issue pursued in this paper is whether corporate governance in Thailand has improved since the Asian financial crisis. The results show that Thai companies are now characterised by the presence of independent directors on their boards, and that Thai boards are active, engaged, and take their responsibilities very seriously...|$|R
