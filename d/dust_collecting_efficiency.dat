40|$|Future human {{missions}} to Mars {{will require the}} utilization of local resources for oxygen, fuel. and water. The In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) project is an active research endeavor at NASA to develop technologies that can enable cost effective ways to live off the land. The extraction of oxygen from the Martian atmosphere. composed primarily of carbon dioxide, {{is one of the}} most important goals of the Mars ISRU project. The main obstacle is the relatively large amount of dust present in the Martian atmosphere. This dust must be efficiently removed from atmospheric gas intakes for ISRU processing chambers. A common technique to achieve this removal on earth is by electrostatic precipitation, where large electrostatic fields are established in a localized region to precipitate and <b>collect</b> previously charged <b>dust</b> particles. This technique is difficult to adapt to the Martian environment, with an atmospheric pressure of about one-hundredth of the terrestrial atmosphere. At these low pressures. the corona discharges required to implant an electrostatic charge to the particles to be collected is extremely difficult to sustain and the corona easily becomes biopolar. which is unsuitable for particle charging. In this paper, we report on our successful efforts to establish a stable corona under Martian simulated conditions. We also present results on <b>dust</b> <b>collecting</b> <b>efficiencies</b> with an electrostatic precipitator prototype that could be effectively used on a future mission to the red plane...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a new <b>dust</b> <b>collecting</b> system {{equipped}} with an activated carbon (A. C.) coated electrode. Before fabrica-tion, pre-treatment of A. C. was performed to remove metal ions within the A. C. to enlarge its specific surface area. Then, pre-treated A. C., black carbon, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), and methanol were mixed to make a gel compound, which was coated onto aluminum plates to fabricate electrodes. The optimal mixing ratio of A. C., black carbon, PVAc, and methanol was found to be 10 g: 2 g: 3 g: 20 mL. After fabrication, the electrodes were used in the batch-type experiment for NH 3 and H 2 S removal. The reduction rates of the gases were high at the beginning and slowly reduced with time. Dust collection experiments were conducted in continuous flow, with various voltages applied. Compared to 5 kV, dust removal efficiency was 1. 5 times higher when 10 kV was applied. Increasing the number of electrodes applied also increased the <b>collecting</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The correlation coefficient between actual <b>collecting</b> <b>efficiency</b> and trend line was higher than 99 %. Consequently, the novel dust collection system equipped with A. C. coated electrode appears to be a promising substitute for existing dust-control devices...|$|R

The US EPA and state environmental agencies developed and implemented a reporting system for the amount of particulate (PM 10) derived from various sources including gravel roads. Although numerous techniques are used in attempts to control the dust generated from gravel roads, all have limitations and the search for more effective means of reducing dust levels from gravel roads continues. Geotextile separators offer the potential to reduce dust while providing enhanced driving characteristics and reduced maintenance of the roads. A field demonstration program was initiated to quantitatively document the dust suppression effect of geotextile separators on unpaved, gravel-surfaced roads. Six sampling events were taken {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} using geotextiles as a dust suppressant. Results indicated that the <b>dust</b> <b>collected</b> on the downwind side were always significantly higher than the <b>dust</b> <b>collected</b> on the upwind side. Initially, <b>dust</b> <b>collected</b> on the control section was 70 to 80 % less than the pre-geotextile dust levels, for the downwind side...|$|R

40|$|Weekly average {{atmospheric}} 210 Pb flux {{data collected}} between March 1989 and February 2001 {{are used to}} construct a record of Australian dust incursions onto the west coast, South Island, New Zealand. <b>Dusts</b> <b>collected</b> from New Zealand glaciers were found to contain a mixture of local New Zealand and long range Australian material, based on novel binary and tertiary mixing models of their ultra trace element chemistries. Trace element characteristics further allowed determination of the provenance of the long range dust component within Australia to better than 200 km resolution. 210 Pb analyses of these chemically characterised dust samples show that activity {{is related to the}} percentage of Australian dust in a linear fashion. However, 210 Pb activity of Australian <b>dusts</b> <b>collected</b> in New Zealand is orders of magnitude greater than that measured in the alluvial sediments of the provenance areas. Australian <b>dusts</b> <b>collected</b> in New Zealand are also highly enriched in 210 Pb compared to <b>dusts</b> <b>collected</b> in Australia. This shows that dust scavenges atmospheric 210 Pb which can therefore be used as an effective tracer of long range dust transport. Previously obtained average atmospheric 210 Pb flux data can thus be converted into the first record of long range Australian dust flux in New Zealand. Results show that the average atmospheric concentration of Australian dust in New Zealand is 5. 3 μg m- 3. There is a clear seasonality with the highest concentrations occurring in autumn-winter, preceding Australia 2 ̆ 7 s major dust storm season, which occurs in winter-spring. We propose that while meteorological factors control the occurrence of major dust storms, the availability of sediment in source areas is a major control on Australian dust flux in New Zealand. Dust flux is greatest after seasonal river flows when transport of extremely fine grained dust occurs. This is followed by transport of larger particles in the more spectacular winter-spring dust storms. Our results provide information on the characteristics and seasonality of dust transport in the Australian region, which had previously been difficult to quantify by other methods (e. g., satellite imagery). Results also attest to the effectiveness of 210 Pb as a tracer in this region. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
