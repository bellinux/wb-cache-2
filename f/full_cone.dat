The three most common nozzles are the <b>full</b> <b>cone,</b> hollow cone, and flat stream.There are two types of air-gun spraying processes. In a manual operation method the air-gun sprayer is held by a skilled operator, about 6 to(-) 10 in from the object, and moved back and forth over the surface, each stroke overlapping the previous to ensure a continuous coat. In an automatic process the gun head is attached to a mounting block and delivers the stream of paint from that position.

50|$|Selecting {{a nozzle}} {{based on the}} pattern and other spray {{characteristics}} that are required generally yields good results. Since spray nozzles are designed to perform under many different spraying conditions, more than one nozzle may meet the requirements for a given application. Surfaces may be sprayed with any pattern shape. Results are fairly predictable, {{depending on the type}} of spray pattern specified. If the surface is stationary, the preferred nozzle is usually some type of <b>full</b> <b>cone</b> nozzle, since its pattern will cover a larger area than the other styles. Spatial applications, in which the objective is not primarily to spray onto a surface, are more likely to require specialized spray characteristics. Success in these applications is often completely dependent on factors such as drop size and spray velocity. Evaporation, cooling rates for gases and solids, and cleaning efficiency are examples of process characteristics that may depend largely on spray qualities.|$|E

The pressure range tested is representative of those expected during cryogenic fluid transfer operations in space. The droplet sizes from the flat spray nozzles were greater than those from the <b>full</b> <b>cone</b> nozzle.

The values of a were - 0. 36 for the flat spray and - 0. 87 for the <b>full</b> <b>cone.</b> The reduced dependence of the flat spray SMD on the delta P was probably because of: (1) the absence of a swirler that generates a turbulence within the nozzle to enhance atomization, and (2) a possible increase in shearing stress resulting from the delayed atomization due to the absence of turbulence. The nitrogen quality, up to 1. 5 percent is based on isenthalpic expansion, did not have a distinct and measurable effect on the spray SMD. Both bimodal and monomodal droplet size population distributions were measured. In the bimodal distribution, the frequency of the first mode was much greater than the frequency of the second mode.

The resolution and probe current {{that can be}} obtained from a carbon nanotube emitter in a low-voltage scanning electron microscope are calculated and compared to {{the state of the art}} using Schottky electron sources. Many analytical equations for probe-size versus probe-current relations in different parameter regimes are obtained. It is shown that for most carbon nanotube emitters, the gun lens aberrations are larger than the emitters’ virtual source size and thus restrict the microscope’s performance. The result is that the advantages of the higher brightness of nanotube emitters are limited unless the angular emission current is increased over present day values or the gun lens aberrations are decreased. For some nanotubes with a closed cap, it is known that the emitted electron beam is coherent over the <b>full</b> emission <b>cone.</b> We argue that for such emitters the parameter “brightness” becomes meaningless.
