60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> directly, rather forlornly, {{proud of}} her praise.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened his}} mouth, and understood. Then <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> directly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> A princess wasn't half {{so terrible}} after all.|$|E
60|$|Slone evidently {{controlled}} his temper, {{though his}} face remained white. <b>He</b> even <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{remembered how}} sadly <b>he</b> had <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{over the top}} of his paper.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> back <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> The reawakening of {{her sense}} of humour was something.|$|R
60|$|He saw {{the tears}} {{gathering}} in her eyes, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> encouragingly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> quick {{adaptation}} {{of his professional}} slang, but shook his head.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sympathetically. Speech seemed {{somehow to}} lessen the tension between them.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> across <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> His {{words were}} words of courteous badinage, but Lady Cynthia was {{conscious}} of a strange little sense of pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jo {{wanted me}} to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did," [...] {{answered}} Laurie, without turning his eyes upon <b>her,</b> though <b>he</b> half <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> maternal tone.|$|R
60|$|She sat {{among her}} {{cushions}} smiling upon him. She was half ironical, half sincere. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> back <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{his dark eyes}} full of trembling hope, and pleasure, and pride.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and Eleanor felt {{again that}} vague fear {{stirring}} in her heart.|$|E
60|$|Gently {{she took}} his hand, and at the act <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> very weakly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in {{a knowing}} manner, and Jeanne looked away {{to hide her}} disgust.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{continued}} to <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{as she stepped}} forward to take the car.|$|R
6000|$|Siegmund lay still, {{looking up}} <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> The changes in him were deeper, like {{alteration}} in his tissue. His new buds came slowly, and {{were of a}} fresh type. <b>He</b> lay <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>At</b> last <b>he</b> said: ...|$|R
60|$|The conductor, when he {{came through}} the next time, eyed her closely and smiled broadly. She did not {{understand}} why <b>he</b> should <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> After <b>he</b> had been through the car several times he came and sat down by her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with upraised eyebrows. There {{were times}} when he seemed to her like a boy.|$|E
60|$|She {{glanced at}} Austen's face, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> gently, {{as though he}} divined {{something}} of her thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> kindly enough, but {{he shook}} his head. [...] "It doesn't alter the fact that you're expensive. You've cost me already--!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Haven't you {{a message}} for me?" [...] he asked. [...] "You were sent to {{denounce}} my folly--and you can't do it. If you trusted your own impulses you would give me your benediction instead." [...] <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> down <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{was always}} a faint {{animosity}} in her bearing towards Siegmund. <b>He</b> understood, and <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> enmity, for the two were really good friends.|$|R
6000|$|With a queer little {{twinge of}} infringed proprietorship, the doctor saw Sir Richmond step {{up on the}} {{prostrate}} megalith and stand beside her, the better to appreciate her point of view. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> down <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Now {{why do you think}} they came in THERE?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> reassuringly. [...] "Something they didn't find! Something," [...] he added, after {{a slight}} pause, [...] "which they never will find!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and {{presently}} found himself, {{as a kind}} {{of consequence}} of communion with her, talking her own language. [...] "It's a very wonderful experience." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> childish look of bewilderment. [...] "I've been {{painfully aware}} of it for some time back. I've been {{suffering}} for food while you slept." ...|$|E
6000|$|The young man, in {{his actual}} mood, could have smiled again-- <b>smiled</b> delicately, as <b>he</b> had then <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Has it been his motive in letting me have you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Columbine {{watched that}} quiet face, while her heart throbbed and swelled with {{emotions}} wholly beyond her control and understanding. When at last Wilson opened his eyes, fluttering at first, and then wide, {{she felt a}} surge that shook her whole body. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> wanly <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>at</b> Wade, and then his gaze lifted to Belllounds.|$|R
6000|$|When she bustled in {{with the}} tea <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "This is awfully nice!" [...] For the first time, he was not fencing; he was quietly and {{securely}} friendly; and friendly and quiet was her answer: [...] "It's {{nice to have you}} here. You were so kind, helping me to find this little home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{guess there}} won't be any trouble about that, {{if you think}} they can put up with our way of living.' <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> over his spectacles.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> benevolently and {{followed}} Susan upstairs. On their way they met Jane, who stole {{a glance at}} him, {{and was about to}} pass by, when he said: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{across the}} table. She was very pretty with her fair hair and dark eyes, very Parisian, and yet with a shade of graceful {{seriousness}} about {{her eyes and}} mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "An errand boy," [...] he replied. [...] "Somebody had to come, so {{they chose}} me. Incidentally," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>smiling</b> down <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "it {{is a part}} of my education." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold {{said not}} a word in defence of her or of himself; but when I asked whether she had been of any use, <b>he</b> said, <b>smiling</b> affectionately <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "Wasn't she?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} based in a remote village in the mountainous area of Guangxi.http://yule.sohu.com/7/1103/36/column215873685.shtml The story begins after the {{takeover}} of the Communists with Jia Kuan's father (Feng Enhe) accidentally triggering his gun, thus blinding himself permanently. The village boys see a stranger, Yu Chen (Dong Jie), and they believe {{she is the one}} who caused his injury, so they raise an alarm and pursue her. She runs through the fields of barley, and finds herself face to face with Jia Kuan (Liu Ye). Jia Kuan's demeanor is friendly and <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> The village boys catch up and start yelling to Jia Kuan that this girl harmed his father. Yu Chen cannot defend herself, as she is a mute. Luckily Jia Kuan doesn't believe them, so they all go to Jia Kuan's house to confirm it with Jia Kuan's father, who inevitably confirms that he had hurt himself by accident.|$|R
