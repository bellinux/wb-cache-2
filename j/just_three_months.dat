5|$|Originally, {{the light}} had a fifth-order Fresnel lens, but a fourth-order Fresnel lens was {{installed}} in May 1902, <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> into its operation. The light characteristic was a fixed white light with a red flash every 15 seconds. In 1972, the light was automated and the Fresnel lens was replaced with a modern optic.

5|$|He was {{appointed}} as Notts County manager in May 1957, controversially replacing caretaker-manager Frank Broome. Broome, who had steered the club {{away from being}} relegated from the Second Division, was installed as his assistant manager. He found it tedious in making new signings due to financial constraints {{on the part of}} the club. He did though take on forwards Jeff Astle and Tony Hateley as apprentices, who would both go on to have long careers in the First Division. Lawton agreed to go without his wages for six months so as to improve the club's finances. County were though relegated at the end of the 1957–58 season, finishing one point short of safety, and Lawton was sacked. He received a total of <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> pay for his time at the club, having only a verbal offer of a three-year contract to fall back on, and nothing in writing.|$|E

5|$|Martín de Ursúa {{had little}} {{interest}} in administering the newly conquered territory and delegated its control to military officers who he did very little to support, either militarily or financially. With Nojpetén safely {{in the hands of the}} Spanish, Ursúa returned to Mérida, leaving Kan Ek' and other high-ranking members of his family as prisoners of the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, isolated among the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, accompanied by mixed-race ladino civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp. The settlers brought disease with them, which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through the indigenous population. The Guatemalans stayed <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> before returning to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the captive Itza king with them, together with his son and two of his cousins. The cousins died on the long journey to Santiago; Ajaw Kan Ek' and his son spent the rest of their lives under house arrest in the colonial capital.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Battle of Richmond on August 29, 1862, David Waller Chenault, a Confederate sympathizer from Madison County, came to Richmond {{to raise a}} Confederate regiment. On September 10, 1862, Chenault was {{commissioned}} as a colonel and given command of the regiment, dubbed the 11th Kentucky Cavalry. McCreary joined the regiment and was commissioned as a major, {{the only one in}} the unit. The 11th Kentucky Cavalry was pressed into immediate service, conducting reconnaissance and fighting bushwhackers. <b>Just</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after its muster, they helped the Confederate Army secure a victory at the Battle of Hartsville. In 1863, the unit joined John Hunt Morgan for his raid into Ohio. Colonel Chenault was killed as the Confederates tried to capture the Green River Bridge at the July 4, 1863, Battle of Tebbs Bend. McCreary assumed command of the unit after Chenault's death. Following the battle, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel on the recommendation of John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{broke out}} in 1914, when {{military}} opinions on the utility of Calshot Castle had shifted considerably. The decision was taken to rely primarily on gun batteries at the two entrances to the Solent, rather than at Calshot and Southampton Water. At the start of conflict the boom was removed and replaced by anti-submarine nets further up the coast' two of Calshot's guns were removed the following year to protect the new nets. The airbase was used for training purposes until 1916, when it took on anti-submarine patrols over the Channel, where the German raids had started to inflict critical damage. Almost 3,500 hours were flown by aircraft from Calshot that year, with over 3,500 being flown in 1917 and over 9,000 in <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of 1918. Subordinate air stations were created in Bembridge, Newhaven, Polegate and Portland. A cabin was built {{on top of the}} keep to oversee air operations, the Castle Yacht Club was taken over for use as the officers' mess and the air station spread out across Calshot Spit, including occupying the 1895 battery. Calshot's remaining guns were removed and probably dispatched to the front line in France.|$|E

5|$|The NFLPA went {{on strike}} for a month in 1987 upon the {{expiration}} of the 1982 CBA; the league's free-agent policy was the major matter in dispute. This time, however, the strike only canceled one week of the season. For three weeks, the NFL staged games with hastily assembled replacement teams, made up principally of players cut during training camp and players left out of work from {{the closure of the}} United States Football League two years prior (along with, to a lesser extent, the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL, who had folded <b>just</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> prior to the strike).

5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated the deficit in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to the rate of inflation, and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s debt level to the all-province average. <b>Just</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices. On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that the deficit would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi {{arrived on}} the western shore of lake Petén Itzá with his {{soldiers}} in February 1697, and once there built a galeota, a large and heavily armed oar-powered attack boat. The Itza capital fell in a bloody waterborne assault on 13 March 1697. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss {{of life on the}} island; many Itza Maya who fled to swim across the lake were killed in the water. After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town. The Itza and Kowoj kings (Ajaw Kan Ek' and Aj Kowoj) were soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With Nojpetén safely {{in the hands of the}} Spanish, Ursúa returned to Campeche; he left a small garrison on the island, isolated amongst the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. Nojpetén was renamed by the Spanish as Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza"). The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Guatemala, accompanied by mixed-race ladino civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp.
