40|$|The {{present study}} {{suggests}} that the idea that Stroop interference originates from multiple components may gain theoretically from integrating two independent frameworks. The first framework {{is represented by the}} well-known notion of semantic gradient of interference and the second one is the distinction between two types of conflict – the task and the informational conflict – giving rise to the interference (Goldfarb & Henik, 2007; McLeod & MacDonald, 2000). The proposed integration led to the conclusion that two (i. e., orthographic and lexical components) of the four theoretically distinct components represent task conflict, and the other two (i. e., indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>informational</b> conflict components) represent informational conflict. The four components were independently estimated in a series of experiments. The results confirmed the contribution of task conflict (estimated by a robust orthographic component) and of informational conflict (estimated by a strong <b>direct</b> <b>informational</b> conflict component) to Stroop interference. However, the performed critical review of the relevant literature (see General Discussion), as well as the results of the experiments reported, showed that the other two components expressing each type of conflict (i. e., the lexical component of task conflict and the indirect informational conflict) were small, and unstable. The present analysis refines our knowledge of the origins of Stroop interference by providing evidence that each type of conflict has its major and minor contributions. The implications for cognitive control of an automatic reading process are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a formal {{framework}} to model rational agents. We distinguish four levels where aspects of agency are situated, viz. the <b>informational,</b> <b>action,</b> motivational and social level. On these levels we consider concepts like knowledge and belief of agents, opportunities for, and results of actions that they may perform, preferences, goals, intentions and commitments, and speech acts. The language describing these concepts is a multi-modal one, and the models used to interpret this language are Kripke-style possible worlds models. Both the language and the models are defined in a rigorously formal way, while the actual semantics are only sketched. We conclude this paper with a brief comparison with related work on the formalisation of rational agents.

The free energy principle is accordingly rephrased as that for autopoietic reasons all viable organisms attempt to minimize the sensory uncertainty about the unpredictable environment over a temporal horizon. By varying the <b>informational</b> <b>action,</b> we derive the brain's recognition dynamics which conducts the adaptive inference of the external causes of sensory data with addressing only canonical positions and momenta of the brain's representations of the dynamical world. To manifest the utility of our theory, we provide how the neural computation may be implemented biophysically at a single-cell level and subsequently be scaled up to a large-scale functional architecture of the brain.

We present a number of examples to illustrate the subtleties involved in interpreting the effects of our extended action models on temporal Kripke models.

40|$|This paper focuses {{upon the}} {{challenge}} {{posed by the}} concept of ‘information’ to the new materialisms, viewed {{with reference to the}} multifaceted worldly phenomenon of informational conflict. ‘Informational conflict’ is a broad term designed to encompass the hi-tech ‘cyber’ operations of inter-state warfare as well as the <b>informational</b> <b>actions</b> of non-state actors, and is contingent not upon information technologies, as commonly understood, but upon ‘information’. Informational conflicts can be viewed as sociotechnical assemblages of humans and non-humans although information is a problematic component of these assemblages, on account of its uncertain ontological status. This paper addresses the ontology of information and asks how the new materialisms might respond in the various ontological registers described. Drawing upon the natural sciences—especially physics—and the emerging ‘philosophy of information’ to outline the metaphysics of information and the differences that exist in its ontological characterisation, the paper outlines informational challenges to materialist perspectives. It concludes by examining two examples of how information and materiality are addressed in International Relations with respect to informational conflict. It concludes by noting the positive contributions the new materialisms can make to the study of information and informational conflict, but challenges them by asking: Information matters for conflict; does it matter for materialism...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem for ecological and cognitive psychology alike is {{to explain how}} agents are situated, that is, functionally coupled to their environments so as to facilitate adaptive actions. Herbert Simon (1969 / 1996) argued that such coupling is artifactual (rule governed), being mediated by symbol functions and necessarily in-volving information processing. An alternative to this computational approach is of-fered by James Gibson’s (1979 / 1986) view that the interface is natural (law gov-erned), being a <b>direct</b> <b>informational</b> coupling rather than a symbolically mediated one. This latter view necessarily involves the agent’s awareness, whereas the former, being mechanistic, does not. I review the coupling problem from historical, logical, and semantic perspectives.

Collective control strategies, such as those used by synergistic biological systems composed {{of large numbers of}} identical parts like the human nervous system, provide a novel and alternative approach for the design of fault-tolerant, adaptable robotic systems that have traditionally relied on centralized control. In this research, a robotic arm composed of multiple identical segments in a collective computational architecture was tested for its ability to produce adaptive pointing and reaching behavior. The movement rules for these robotic arm segments were based on the concepts of the "reflex arc" and the "action system" in the human nervous system. Robotic arms of three to seven encapsulated segments were tested. These arms received no central directions and used no <b>direct</b> <b>informational</b> exchange. The arms were sensor-driven at their distal, or leading, outstretched ends to maximize pointing accuracy on a two-dimensional target plane. The remaining non-distal segments in the arms were moved in a sequential order using sensed locally-available movement information about neighboring segments. Successful pointing and reaching behavior was observed in situations with and without movement obstacles. This led to the conclusion that because such behavior was not specified within each segment, the overall arm behavior emerged due to the interaction and coordination of all segments, rather than due to any single segment, centrally-controlled influence, or explicit inter-segmental method of communication...|$|R

Athletic administrators {{can play an}} important role in a high school student athlete???s career by addressing the importance of injury prevention. The athletic administrator???s role is to bridge the gap between the knowledge of healthcare providers and that of high school athletic coaches, parents and student athletes. This project focuses on the leadership strategies and duties of an athletic administrator for implementation of programs that optimize the health and potential of student athletes. The model program within this project addresses the causes, recovery, and prevention of ACL injuries. The program was developed with the assistance of an athletic trainer and feedback from high school athletic administrators. A program consisting of six exercises was created for administrators to have their coaching staff implement into their practice schedule. The model ACL injury prevention program was sent to high school athletic administrators along with a survey to gain feedback about whether their school currently has any injury prevention programs, whether they consider using this one, and how they would implement it with their coaching staff. Using the feedback, a plan was created for athletic administrators on how to carry out this program at their school. The administrative plan for this project uses a <b>Direct</b> <b>Informational</b> Approach for educational leadership, which involves eliciting the coaches??? opinions and participation. This program gives the administration the guidance of how to implement the program with the coaching staff by using the expertise of healthcare providers or athletic trainers. Athletic administrators would then take the steps to share the importance of this program with student athletes and their parents. CSU, Chic...|$|R

40|$|As {{the injured}} athlete's primary and most {{frequent}} contact within the sport injury rehabilitation process, the physiotherapist is {{in a unique}} position to influence the athlete's psychological rehabilitation alongside the physical recovery (Barefield & McCallister, 1997). The important question of whether or not athletes expect physiotherapists to address their psychological issues, however, has not yet been investigated in detail. Moreover, scales that measure athletes’ expectations of physiotherapy are also scarce and available only in the English language. Therefore, the purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to adapt the Expectation About Athletic Training (EAAT) questionnaire into Finnish and 2) to examine Finnish athletes’ expectations of physiotherapy. The EAAT questionnaire that measures athletes’ expectations about sport injury rehabilitation and physiotherapy was translated into Finnish and administrated to a sample of 247 Finnish athletes. The psychometrics of the instrument was examined using principal component analysis and expectations of different groups of Finnish athletes were examined using independent sample t-test and one-way ANOVA. Results found that the previously hypothesized second order 3 -factor model of the EAAT questionnaire was not confirmed in the Finnish sample. Although some items formed similar constructs as with the original 17 scales, and thus were used to form 11 new factors for the purpose of this study, confirmatory factor analysis is suggested for future research. Finnish athletes reported highest expectations for <b>direct</b> <b>informational</b> support and expertise from the physiotherapist. Athletes also had moderate expectations for the physiotherapist to have facilitative characteristics, such as genuineness. Furthermore, athletes had moderate expectations to be personally responsible and committed in physiotherapy. Gender, injury type, competition level, and previous experience in mental skills training were identified as potential moderators of athletes’ expectations of physiotherapy. It is noteworthy that athletes demonstrated neutral to high expectations for all 11 dimensions of client expectations. These research findings support and magnify the significance of physiotherapists in rehabilitation. Physiotherapists should be aware of athletes’ expectations and prepare to meet their various physical and psychological needs. Psychological education can potentially assist physiotherapists in meeting athletes’ needs...|$|R

One of those challenges {{is developing a}} robust and sufficiently large network {{of people who can}} provide advice about a variety of everyday situations. In this dissertation, I investigate ways of supporting adolescents with high functioning autism in navigating their everyday life through specializing social networking services (SNSs). A series of studies were conducted to identify opportunities for the design and use of a specialized SNS to foster the independence. The results demonstrates SNS can support some adolescents and adults with autism in increasing the independence by 1) facilitating the asking of a variety of online networks beyond a primary caregiver; and 2) allowing acquisition of rapid, <b>direct,</b> and <b>informational</b> advice with crowdsourcing. Drawing on several formative studies and investigations, I synthesized design guidelines for inquir. us, a specialized hybrid social question-and-answer (Q&A) platform with features for scaffolding question creation and crowdsourcing answers.

This article investigates {{the effect of}} affordance perception on the time taken to initiate and perform an action. In particular it focuses on how action timing varies {{as a function of}} a continuum of afforded action, that is, around an action-boundary. In Experiment 1, participants made judgments regarding whether they could fit a small ball through a series of different size apertures. Judgments were quick and accurate at the extremes of the affordance scale; however, at the perceived action-boundary longer, more variable initiation times (ITs) were observed. Trials repeated over 3 consecutive days revealed a systematic change in the IT distribution and demonstrated that IT is highly sensitive to changes in location of the perceived action-boundary. In Experiment 2 effects of action-scaling were observed on IT and movement time of afforded actions: around the perceived action-boundary the afforded action took longer to be both perceived and acted upon. The results highlight that affordance perception influences not only action selection and preparation but also the action itself.

Of the 6, Three participants with morphing fears described a direct learning experience, the same proportion reported an occasion when they received threatening information, and one provided {{an example of a}} vicarious learning event. Conclusion Contact contamination tends to precede mental contamination and is associated with specific incidents. Mental contamination precedent events often involved immoral acts in which the person was the victim or perpetrator. This study is limited by a small sample size and retrospective method but provides an initial understanding of the origins of mental contamination...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is to examine market {{segmentation}} factors, as well as, bank customer atti-tudes and beliefs towards housing loans. The Greek mortgage market has experienced great devel-opments in the latest years with high annual growth rates. Quantitative research was carried out by means of structured questionnaires with 20 items at a sample of 183 respondents in the area of Athens. Research found out that respondents are well-disposed towards house loans in order to purchase primary residence and half in order to purchase land. The required provision of informa-tion is searched through personal contacts with bank specialized staff. The primary criterion for bank selection is the existing cooperation with the bank, while recommendations by brokers, real estate contractors and lawyers are taken into consideration. Younger people are more well-disposed towards receiving financing for primary residence and land, while women are more posi-tive towards buying land. Employees and existing clients, mainly higher education graduates, could be easily approached through <b>direct</b> mail techniques. <b>Informational</b> brochures could contain reference on the advantages of investing in real estate and the possibilities offered on financing for purchasing secondary residence...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the types of}} 2 ̆ 2 social 2 ̆ 2 influence processes underlying the impact of minority and majority factions. Six-person mock juries composed of members holding an initial 4 : 2 (majority:minority) ratio of opinions deliberated a civil lawsuit. Participants individually completed pre- and post-discussion measures of their direct and indirect attitudes toward the case. Jury deliberations were coded for statements reflecting informational influence, normative influence, interpersonal influence, or 2 ̆ 2 other 2 ̆ 2 processes. Final group verdicts and individuals 2 ̆ 7 attitude change occurred {{in the direction of}} the faction holding the 2 ̆ 2 not liable 2 ̆ 2 position. In addition, minority members changed their attitude more toward the majority 2 ̆ 7 s position on the direct measure than on the indirect measure, and majority members changed toward the minority 2 ̆ 7 s position on both measures. Content analysis of the jury deliberations revealed that, as expected, minorities contributed more informational and interpersonal influence than majorities, and, contrary to expectations, majorities contributed less normative influence than minorities contributed. Regression analyses provided only partial support for traditional writings about the social influence processes underlying minority and majority influence. Specifically, the minority 2 ̆ 7 s use of informational influence was predictive of majority members 2 ̆ 7 indirect attitude change; however, the majority 2 ̆ 7 s use of normative influence pressures was not predictive of minority members 2 ̆ 7 direct attitude change. Results contradict previous assumptions in the literature that normative pressures to adhere to group norms and values underlie attitude change on <b>direct</b> measures. <b>Informational</b> influence, instead, was highly predictive of minority and majority members 2 ̆ 7 direct attitude change. Furthermore, the results indicate that influence pressures from members of one 2 ̆ 7 s own faction and members of the opposing faction are both extremely important in predicting attitude change. A more complex view of the influence processes involved in freely interacting groups than has been previously explored in the minority influence literature is discussed. ...|$|R
