Immediately behind the cockpit are low observable intakes. All-moving canard surfaces with pronounced dihedral are placed behind the intakes, followed by leading edge extensions merging into delta wing with forward-swept trailing edges. The aft section features twin, outward canted all-moving fins, short but deep ventral strakes, and conventional round <b>engine</b> <b>exhausts.</b>|$|E

This viewing was heavily restricted, and guests {{were not allowed to}} see the rear of the B-2. However, Aviation Week editors found that there were no airspace restrictions above the presentation area and took photographs of the aircraft's then-secret rear section with suppressed <b>engine</b> <b>exhausts</b> from the air, to the USAF's disappointment. The B-2's (s/n 82-1066 / AV-1) first public flight was on 17 July 1989 from Palmdale to Edwards AFB.|$|E
25|$|When the {{decision}} was taken to utilise helium instead of hydrogen back in 1922, Shenandoah was fitted {{with a set of}} condensers to allow the collection of water vapour from her <b>engine</b> <b>exhausts</b> to be used to create ballast and manage the ship's buoyancy. In most airship designs this would have been accomplished simply by venting gas as fuel was burned, but because helium was so expensive to produce (approximately $55 per 1000ft3 in 1923), and Shenandoah had required approximately 2.1m ft3 to fill its gas cells, {{the decision}} was taken to not routinely vent the valuable gas, and instead collect water vapour. The Akron-class required three times more gas to fill the cells, which made the collection of water more important, in spite of the increased availability of helium through improvements in production, transport and storage. The condensers appeared as black strips on the ship's envelope directly above each propeller.|$|E

40|$|The main sources {{dominating}} the far-field noise of a G. A. piston engine propeller aircraft {{have been identified}} to be the propeller and the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust.</b> Therefore, the noise received on the ground during the flyover of such airplanes results from the superposition of the individual propeller and <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> sound waves. Although the individual waveforms of both the propeller and the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> signals received change very little when the aircraft is passing overhead, the combined waveform (superposition) of these two signals - as observed on the ground - changes quite dramatically. A computational study has been condicted where simulated <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> and propeller sound signals were combined at different phase shifts. The phase angle differences actually correspond to different locations of the aircraft moving along a horizontal flight path relative to an observer on the ground...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasingly}} prominent problem regarding rapid economy {{development and the}} gradually serious environmental pollution, the waste heat recovery and waste gas pollution processing have received significant attention. Z 12 V 190 diesel engine has high fuel consumption and low thermal efficiency and releases large amounts of exhaust gas and waste heat into the atmosphere, causing serious problems of energy waste and environmental pollution. In this work, the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas components are analysed and the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> emission rates and exhaust gas waste heat rates are calculated.

40|$|Major air {{pollution}} problem contributed by Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) has a noxious effect {{on human health}} and environment. Implementation of stringent regulation of NOx emission has greatly increased interest {{in the development of}} new effective pollution control technology. Non-Thermal Plasma (NTP) utilizing electrical discharge has been recognized as a promising technology for the removal of pollutant gases from diesel <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust.</b> In this research, cascaded pulsed streamer discharge plasma reactor was designed to investigate the removal of NOx from diesel <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust.</b> A simulation study consists of flow analysis of cascaded pulsed streamer discharge plasma reactor was conducted using Commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to evaluate the performance of the discharge plasma chamber on the removal of NOx from diesel <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> together with <b>engine</b> performance. Several parameters including gap spacing, chamber length and number of stages were varied to investigate their effects on system performance. The results from simulation study show that the cascaded pulsed streamer discharge plasma reactor with three stages of treatment process provides more effective performance on the removal of NOx pollutant from diesel <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> without affecting <b>engine</b> performance. This is in line with the initial assumption that three stages cascaded chamber will effectively remove the NOx from diesel <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust.</b> A mathematical modelling by using dimensional analysis has been developed that is appropriate in investigating the relation of the electrical and physical parameters on the removal of NOx concentration from diesel <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust.</b> To verify the viability of the analysis, results obtained from the dimensional analysis were compared with the experimental results reported in previous research.
