25|$|Buddhism understands life {{as being}} pervaded by Dukkha, as {{unsatisfactory}} and stressful. Ending one's life to escape present suffering {{is seen as}} futile because one will just be reborn again, and again. One of the three forms of craving is craving for annihilation (vibhava tanha), and this form of craving <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> future suffering. Dying with an unwholesome and agitated state of mind is seen as leading to a bad rebirth, so suicide is seen as creating negative karma. Ending one's life is also seen as throwing away the precious opportunity to generate positive karma. While suicide {{does not seem to}} be interpreted as a breaking of the first precept (not killing other beings) it is still seen as a grave and unwholesome action.|$|E
25|$|Thinking theoretically, Kirchhoff went {{a little}} further, and pointed out that this implied that the {{spectral}} radiance, {{as a function of}} radiative frequency, of any such cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium must be a unique universal function of temperature. He postulated an ideal black body that interfaced with its surrounds in just {{such a way as to}} absorb all the radiation that falls on it. By the Helmholtz reciprocity principle, radiation from the interior of such a body would pass unimpeded, directly to its surrounds without reflection at the interface. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the thermal radiation emitted from such a body would have that unique universal spectral radiance as a function of temperature. This insight <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation.|$|E
25|$|The other protein, TAS1R3, {{is present}} and {{identical}} {{to that of other}} animals, and the relevant taste buds are still present but inactive. Such a genetic marker found in the entire family and not other animals must be the result of a mutation in an early ancestor; as a deletion mutation it could not revert, and thus would be inherited by all descendants, as the evolutionary tree branched out. Some scientists now believe this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> the cat family's extremely specialized evolutionary niche as a hunter and carnivore. Their modified sense of taste would cause them to some degree to ignore plants, a large part of whose taste appeal derives from their high sugar content, in favor of a high-protein carnivorous diet, which would still stimulate their remaining taste receptors.|$|E

25|$|The UK was {{a primary}} {{destination}} for Caribbean people looking to emigrate {{as early as}} the 1950s. Because of this, Caribbean music in the United Kingdom, including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Most notable of these is lovers rock, but this fusion of Jamaican music into English culture was seminal in the formation of other musical forms like drum and bass and dubstep. The UK became the base from which many Jamaican artists toured Europe and due to the large number of Jamaican musicians emigrating there, the UK <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> the larger European scene that exists today.

500|$|Although natural wonders are {{celebrated in}} the Psalms and the Book of Job, {{wilderness}} portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially {{in the works of}} the Romantic movement. British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. William Wordsworth's poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture. This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis, the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature. As David Rothenburg writes, [...] "The beautiful <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".|$|E

Nonetheless, he praised the compilation for highlighting [...] "the sheer athleticism and skill that propelled Carey’s early work. She took very simple songs—both in terms of arrangements and theme—rooted in pop, gospel, and R and turned them into feats of strength, granting them dynamism and drama with a voice that juggled power, clarity, and agility with ease".|$|E
500|$|Phagocytosis {{is common}} and {{probably}} appeared early in evolution, [...] evolving first in unicellular eukaryotes. Amoebae are unicellular protists that {{separated from the}} tree leading to metazoa shortly after the divergence of plants, and they share many specific functions with mammalian phagocytic cells. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum, for example, is an amoeba that lives in the soil and feeds on bacteria. Like animal phagocytes, it engulfs bacteria by phagocytosis mainly through Toll-like receptors, and it has other biological functions in common with macrophages. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum is social; it aggregates when starved to form a migrating pseudoplasmodium or slug. This multicellular organism eventually will produce a fruiting body with spores that are resistant to environmental dangers. Before the formation of fruiting bodies, the cells will migrate as a slug-like organism for several days. During this time, exposure to toxins or bacterial pathogens {{has the potential to}} compromise survival of the species by limiting spore production. Some of the amoebae engulf bacteria and absorb toxins while circulating within the slug, and these amoebae eventually die. They are genetically identical to the other amoebae in the slug; their self-sacrifice to protect the other amoebae from bacteria is similar to the self-sacrifice of phagocytes seen in the immune system of higher vertebrates. This ancient immune function in social amoebae suggests an evolutionarily conserved cellular foraging mechanism that might have been adapted to defense functions well before the diversification of amoebae into higher forms. However, a common ancestry with mammalian phagocytes has not been proven. Phagocytes occur throughout the animal kingdom, from marine sponges to insects and lower and higher vertebrates. The ability of amoebae to distinguish between self and non-self is a pivotal one, and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> the immune system of many species of amoeba.|$|E
