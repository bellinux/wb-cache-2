40|$|<b>Dance</b> <b>and</b> {{movement}} {{therapy is}} a form of psychotherapy that uses the body, <b>dance,</b> <b>and</b> movement as the primary mediums for the therapeutic process. Dance is a fundamental art form that involves the body as an instrument of self-expression; movement is a universal means of learning <b>and</b> communicating. <b>Dance</b> <b>and</b> movement therapy is the psychotherapeutic use of movement as a process that furthers the emotional, cognitive, and physical integration of the individual. The American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) supports and promotes this young profession by establishing and maintaining high standards of professional training and practice. The ADTA provides a registry process, a code of ethics for the profession, and a program approval process for graduate programs in <b>dance</b> <b>and</b> movement therapy. Education <b>and</b> training for <b>dance</b> <b>and</b> movement therapy is compatible with programs in counseling <b>and</b> psychology. Increasingly, <b>dance</b> <b>and</b> movement therapists are becoming certified and licensed as counselors, psychologists, and social workers.

25|$|Hope {{worked as}} a butcher's {{assistant}} and a lineman in his teens and early twenties. He also had a brief stint at Chandler Motor Car Company.

25|$|It was {{eventually}} embraced, {{or at least}} accepted, by go-go fans both young and not so young. In a city that considers “swing” go-go the soundtrack of its story, this was no tiny feat. Even old-timers who deny the appeal of bounce beat understand why it exists. The brash style not only changed the way people <b>danced</b> <b>and</b> partied but became the music for {{a new chapter in}} D.C.’s story. If the swing sound carried a generation of Washingtonians through the rough ’70s and ’80s, a time when funk, jazz, and soul was a much-needed salve, bounce grounded them in the ’00s and ’10s, helped them keep their bearings at a time of shifting city demographics, when go-go’s epicenter realigned as the sound of black Washington, at least from the ’70s onward, was pushed to the suburbs. With its pummeling tone and tempo, bounce beat remains a perfect musical metaphor for what young people have experienced as they’ve watched their city be slowly replaced by something unrecognizable.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} this can be seen in Sierra Leone, Africa where young girls are {{mutilated}} every year. The number of girls mutilated in Africa per year has risen to 3 million. Rugiatu Turay, founder of the Amazonian Initiative Movement, protects young girls from being circumcised by other women in secret societies like Sande and other female practitioners who still engage in the ceremonial tradition today. Girls as young as the age of five assist in the mutilation of other young girls in the country. At the age of 12, Turay was snatched by female family members, held down and had her clitoris cut off with a knife. She was beaten, forced to walk, and had hot pepper water poured in her eyes. As she was mutilated, the women sang, <b>danced,</b> <b>and</b> clap ceremoniously. According to these women, Turay had become a woman. However, females are generally mutilated under the age of 15. Girls who are trained to assist in this ceremony are trained as young as five years old. Turay has convinced 400 practitioners to stop the practice of female mutilation, but 97 million females have been mutilated within the country and the numbers remain constant, even increasing. The practice has been enforced by politicians within the country and locals refer to the practice as a ceremony that initiates womanhood, prepares females for marriage, and restricts their sexual conduct.|$|E
