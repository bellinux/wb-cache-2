30|$|The {{controller}} module {{is composed}} of coprocessor and main controller to monitor the analog signal and digital signal of the sensor and to control {{the operation of the}} motor. The coprocessor uses a series of Macro STC 12 C 2052 AD single-chip computers, including CPU SRAM and flash, 15 common I/O ports with 8 -bit precision ADC. The speed of the ADC conversion is as high as 250  k/s. The controller module, as the primary processing module of the level signal, can send the processed level signal to the PLC master controller in the way of switch quantity. The main controller adopts the Japanese Mitsubishi PLC controller, FX 3 U- 32 M, 32 I/O input and output points; supports the RS 485 interface; and meets the communication interface requirement of the whole system. The memory capacity of RAM is 64  kg/basic instruction and the processing speed is 0.065  μs. It supports the function of three-axis linkage positioning. The driving motor selected is Wade DS series servo motor. The specific model is 60 ST-M 00630, and the model of the servo driver is the Wade WD- 15 B 020 A driver. According to the working steps of the conveying system, the automatic conveying system of vegetable bowl and seedling needs to control the continuous coordination of three motors, and the controller can meet the control requirements. The monitoring data of all kinds of sensors are transmitted through I/O to the main controller of PLC, and the PLC controller communicates with the microcomputer through the RS 485 interface to realize the function of system monitoring and man-machine interaction [16].

40|$|Annualy, {{at least}} 4 - 5 {{accidents}} with acute exposure to chlorine gas in swimming pools {{take place in}} the Netherlands. The National Poisons Control Centre (NVIC), a department of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), has the monitoring task of registering information requests on the health effects and treatment of acute exposure to chlorine gas. This report is intended to update the 1988 report on this subject. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to gain more insight into the cause of chlorine gas accidents in swimming pools. Most chlorine gas accidents are due to the malfunctioning of the circulatory system, ranging from electronic defects in the monitoring and dosing equipment to inadequate water drains. It is recommended that additional detectors should be installed especially at hypochlorite and acid inlets. This would facilitate a feedback mechanism with the dosing equipment. Also the circulation pumps should have a shutdown mechanism that activates on interruption of the circulation. <b>Installation</b> <b>diagrams</b> might come in handy when tracking down the cause of a malfunction. The health effects and first-aid treatment of acute chlorine gas exposure are also discussed. Administration of corticosteroids after the inhalation of chlorine gas is not advised because there is as yet no proper clinical support for this...|$|R

Notes on Painting asks how can the texture of everyday life, its ever changing pace and rhythm, be embodied through the materiality of an artwork? This is addressed through <b>installation,</b> text, <b>diagrams,</b> painting, photography and moving image. The works represented economise and dispense with the formal definition of ‘painting’, questioning its construction and modes of making. Translated through various material manipulations, the exhibition urges us to consider that painting requires actual experience...|$|R

40|$|The article studies {{functioning}} of the scheme of transformation power through the converter wind-power installations during emergency operation. The main types of emergencies for this converter are considered. An approach to the calculation of short-circuit current of a synchronous generator and short-circuit current of an LC-circuit is presented. Protection elements (voltage limiters, fuses, fast current sensors) are given for circuit protection and the reliability in emergency conditions is offered. Unlike classic circuit <b>diagrams</b> for wind-power <b>installations,</b> the circuit <b>diagrams</b> without multiplying gear for turbo-generator wind-рower installations have a self-stabilization effect of electromechanical system under optimal conditions {{in a wide range}} of a wind flow. In order to improve its effectiveness and implement an offline mode, you need to use converters to match the frequency of the generator voltage and that the frequency of network. Circuit diagrams of such converters have a complex structure, they contain a number of power supplies and rectifiers, capacitive storages, pulse converters and multi-level inverters...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. F. A.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2007. "Invisible Wall", an installation. {{digitally}} {{captured and}} projected a live scenario {{of what would}} normally be blocked from view. A wall no longer obstructs view but becomes an illusory digital window {{through the use of}} digital technology. The visual environment {{on either side of the}} wall is accessible and understandable. This information consisted of video containing images about the duality of man and nature, as well as any live scenario created by viewers during their presence in the installation. These videos cinematically created another Illusion about the coexistence between man and nature in harmony when in fact recent society's lifestyle contradicts this. The metaphysical illusion questions the nature of reality versus our perceived reality. Three 8 ft wide walls created a rectangular shape installation. They were placed consecutively in a row In the gallery (see diagram 1). The middle wall had projections on both sides of the wall. The two outside walls only had projections on the side facing the middle wall (see diagrams 2 & 3). Cameras inside the center wall were connected to projectors which projected live video in on the <b>Installation</b> (see <b>diagrams</b> 2 & 3). The projections on the two outside walls contained video imagery of contemporary human society on one wall. and a macroscopic view of undisturbed nature on the other. Clips for the nature sequence came from the film Microcosmos: Le peuple de I'herbe (motion picture, 1996; Christophe Barratier, Yvette Mallet, Jacques Perrin, Producers; Claude Nuridsany, Marie Perennou, Directors; France: Pais de Origem). This French-made film documents insects in their daily lives. Directors Christophe Barratier and Yvette Mallet, capture imagery in a way that allows humans to relate to insects in their busy lives. The macro lens and camera speed capture stunning images that allow a microscopic world to appear monumental, or more human scale. The images of humanity and technology were clips taken from the film Koyaanisqatsi Life out of Balance (motion picture, 1983; Francis Ford Coppola, Producer; Godfrey Reggio, Director; Santa Monica: MGM). In this movie, director Godfrey Reggio used clever cinematography and time-lapse to create stunning imagery of mankind's modem lifestyles. These images present society's requirements for sustainability and technological growth. The images selected from this film present mankind as a large graceful machine where anyone person seems very insignificant...|$|R
