5|$|Some of Escher's many {{tessellation}} drawings {{were inspired}} by conversations with the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter on hyperbolic geometry. Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The Platonic solids—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in Order and Chaos and Four Regular Solids. These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.|$|E
5|$|That the {{cultural}} {{representations of the}} Eastern world that Orientalism purveys are intellectually suspect, and cannot be accepted as faithful, true, and accurate representations of the peoples and things of the Orient; {{that the history of}} European colonial rule and political domination of Asian civilizations, <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> writing of even the most knowledgeable, well-meaning, and culturally sympathetic Orientalist.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E

5|$|Since the RCL {{is still}} covalently {{attached}} to the protease via the ester bond, the S to R transition pulls protease from the top {{to the bottom of}} the serpin and <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> catalytic triad. The distorted protease can only hydrolyse the acyl enzyme intermediate extremely slowly and so the protease remains covalently attached for days to weeks. Serpins are classed as irreversible inhibitors and as suicide inhibitors since each serpin protein permanently inactivates a single protease, and can only function once.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the comets}} seen {{close to the}} Sun seem to have reached their current {{positions}} through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's tidal force deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to {{the gravity of the}} Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis directed toward the galactic centre and compress it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun. The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.|$|E

25|$|Zeno Cosini, {{the narrator}} of Italo Svevo's Zeno's Conscience, is a typical example of {{unreliable}} narrator: in fact the novel {{is presented as a}} diary of Zeno himself, who unintentionally <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> facts to justify his faults. His psychiatrist, who publishes the diary, claims in the introduction that it's a mix of truths and lies.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic {{exposure}} in small children <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> ratio of T helper cells (CD4) to cytotoxic T cells (CD8), which {{are responsible for}} immunodepression. In addition, arsenic also increases the number of inflammatory molecules being secreted through macrophages. The excess amount of granulocytes and monocytes lead to a chronic state of inflammation, which might result in cancer development.|$|E
25|$|Better {{governmental}} {{regulation and}} enforcement, rather than voluntary measures, are {{an alternative to}} CSR that moves decision-making and resource allocation from public to private bodies. However, critics claim that effective CSR must be voluntary as mandatory social responsibility programs regulated by the government interferes with people's own plans and preferences, <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> allocation of resources, and {{increases the likelihood of}} irresponsible decisions.|$|E

25|$|The British {{historian}} Dominic Lieven {{wrote that}} much of the historiography about the campaign for various reasons <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> story of the Russian war against France in 1812-14. The number of Western historians who are fluent in French and/or German vastly outnumbers those who are fluent in Russian, which has the effect that many Western historians simply ignore Russian language sources when writing about the campaign because they cannot read them.|$|E
25|$|The {{exemption}} of employer-sponsored {{health benefits}} from federal income and payroll taxes <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> health care market. The U.S. government, unlike some other countries, does not treat employer funded {{health care benefits}} as a taxable benefit in kind to the employee. The value of the lost tax revenue from a benefits in kind tax is an estimated $150billion a year. Some regard this as being disadvantageous {{to people who have}} to buy insurance in the individual market which must be paid from income received after tax.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, The X Factor has {{attracted}} heavy criticism. Recurring allegations include: that the excessive commercialism {{of the show}} detracts from its supposed purpose of unearthing musical talent and even actively damages and <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> UK music industry; that auditionees at mass auditions are shabbily treated; that controversy is deliberately courted and orchestrated, and supposedly spontaneous scenes are staged and scripted; that problems with phone lines leave {{members of the public}} unable to vote for their favourite acts; and that contestants are manipulated and unfairly edited.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{do not see}} {{the case}} as setting a precedent because the unique circumstances surrounding the Trail smelter have been articulated and discussed multiple times, therefore the arguments that arise for transboundary international law are divorced from the context they are derived from; this <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> decisions made in cases like the Trail Arbitration. For the arbitration, the decisions that appear to be the focus of literature on transboundary international law precedents are sub-articles 2 and 4 from Article 3 of the International Joint Commission's (IJC) recommendations.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch (1998) {{notes that}} the popular image of Cape Breton Island as a last bastion of Scottish Highland and {{specifically}} Gaelic culture <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> complex history of the island since the 16th century. The original Micmac inhabitants, Acadian French, Lowland Scots, Irish, Loyalists from New England, and English have all contributed to a history which has included cultural, religious, and political conflict as well as cooperation and synthesis. The Highland Scots became the largest community in the early 19th century, and their heritage has survived in diminished form.|$|E
25|$|Many issues {{damage the}} {{relationship}} of science {{to the media and}} the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the mass media frequently <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> scientific understanding by the public. Examples in the United Kingdom include the controversy over the MMR inoculation, and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie, for revealing the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella.|$|E

25|$|When TBP binds to a TATA box {{within the}} DNA, it <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> DNA by {{inserting}} amino acid side-chains between base pairs, partially unwinding the helix, and doubly kinking it. The distortion is accomplished through {{a great amount}} of surface contact between the protein and DNA. TBP binds with the negatively charged phosphates in the DNA backbone through positively charged lysine and arginine amino acid residues. The sharp bend in the DNA is produced through projection of four bulky phenylalanine residues into the minor groove. As the DNA bends, its contact with TBP increases, thus enhancing the DNA-protein interaction.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Semitism, {{like all}} forms of racism, <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> truth {{in order to put}} a whole race of people in a bad light. This film does nothing of the sort. It draws out from the {{historical}} objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never be any more violence against any other human being.|$|E
25|$|Like {{traditional}} physical watermarks, digital watermarks {{are often}} only perceptible under certain conditions, i.e. after using some algorithm. If a digital watermark <b>distorts</b> <b>the</b> carrier signal {{in a way}} that it becomes easily perceivable, it may be considered less effective depending on its purpose. Traditional watermarks may be applied to visible media (like images or video), whereas in digital watermarking, the signal may be audio, pictures, video, texts or 3D models. A signal may carry several different watermarks at the same time. Unlike metadata that is added to the carrier signal, a digital watermark does not change the size of the carrier signal.|$|E
