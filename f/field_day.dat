25|$|Devil-Goat Day is {{an annual}} <b>field</b> <b>day</b> {{competition}} among students whose graduating classes fall on even years ("goats") and odd years ("devils"). The tradition began in 1926 when Eileen Kramer Dodd, an education professor, encouraged the junior class she sponsored {{to come up}} with a symbol to represent themselves. They decided on the Green Goats and in response, the senior class established themselves as the Red Devils. While this event used to consist of a week-long prank rivalry between the Devils and the Goats, it is now a one-day event held on the last Thursday of classes where students line-up for free T-shirts, food, and games.|$|E

Shoaib {{finished}} with six for 47, including twenty runs conceded due to no-balls - while Monty Panesar and Jason Brown rescued the hosts to 299 with a last-wicket stand of 62.

25|$|Between 1952-54, Wairuna cattle {{were used}} {{for a study of}} {{comparative}} live weights and carcase weights and grades of beef using Brahman cross and British steers carried out by the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock (Dept A). As the four economic drivers of beef production in northern Australia are: survival, reproduction, weight gain, and carcass and meat quality, this trial was a quantitative test of three aspects of the suitability of Brahman type cattle for the north Australian cattle industry. The final weighing of the steers in the 2½ year-long weight trial took place during the first <b>field</b> <b>day</b> for north Queensland cattlemen, organised by the Mount Garnet branch of the Graziers' Association in co-operation with the Dept A, and held at Wairuna Homestead, in 1955. The study quantitatively showed the advantages of Brahman-cross beef compared with European breeds.|$|E

25|$|In 1916 after Casement's {{conviction}} for treason, the British government circulated alleged photographs {{of pages of}} the diary to individuals who were urging commutation of Casement's death sentence. At a time of strong conservatism, not least among Irish Catholics, publicising the Black Diaries and his alleged homosexuality undermined support for Casement. The {{question of whether the}} diaries are genuine or forgeries has been much debated. The diaries were declassified for limited inspection (by persons approved by the Home Office) in August 1959. The original diaries may be seen at the British National Archives in Kew. Historians and biographers of Casement's life have taken opposing views. Roger McHugh (in 1976) and Angus Mitchell (in 2000 and later) have argued that the diaries were forged. In 2012, Mitchell published several articles in the <b>Field</b> <b>Day</b> Review of Notre Dame University.|$|E
25|$|Packer {{was often}} the centre of controversy. One of the {{earliest}} incidents occurred on 7 June 1960, {{when his father was}} trying to take over the Anglican Press, a small publisher run by Francis James. According to author Richard Neville, Frank Packer was angered by James' refusal to sell the Anglican Press, so he sent Kerry and some burly friends to pressure him into selling. They forced their way in and reportedly began vandalising the premises, but James was able to barricade himself in his office and call his friend Rupert Murdoch, Packer's most powerful rival. Murdoch quickly dispatched his own team of 'heavies', who threw Kerry and friends out. Not surprisingly, the Murdoch press had a <b>field</b> <b>day</b> with the news that the son of Australia's biggest media tycoon had been caught brawling in the street.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Abbey was the {{dominant}} influence in theatre in Ireland across the 20th century. Beckett's example {{has been almost}} entirely ignored, although his plays are regularly performed on the Irish stage. Behan, in his use of song and direct address to the audience, was influenced by Bertolt Brecht and Denis Johnston used modernist techniques including found texts and collage, but their works had little impact on the dramatists who came after them. In the 1970s and 1980s, {{a number of companies}} emerged to challenge the Abbey's dominance and introduce different styles and approaches. These included Focus Theatre, The Passion Machine, The Children's T Company, the Project Theatre Company, Red Kettle, Druid Theatre, TEAM and <b>Field</b> <b>Day.</b> These companies nurtured a number of writers, actors, and directors who went on to be successful in London, Broadway and Hollywood or in other literary fields. These include Enda Walsh, Joe O Byrne, Peter Sheridan, Brian Friel, Stephen Rea, Garry Hynes, Martin McDonagh, Conor McPherson, Marina Carr, Jimmy Murphy, Billy Roche and Gabriel Byrne. In 1974 Siamsa Tíre, the National Folk Theatre of Ireland, was founded in Tralee, County Kerry, by Pat Ahern.|$|E
