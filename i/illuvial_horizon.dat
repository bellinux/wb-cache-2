Abstract approved: Kermit Cromack, Jr. Podzolization, {{the dominant}} soil forming process in coniferous forests of southeast Alaska, {{appears to be}} associated with declining forest productivity. The following hypothesis was tested: Podzolization limits the supply of nutrients available for tree growth, but windthrow-caused soil disturbance counteracts the effect of podzolization and promotes sustained productivity. In three Tsuga heterophylla-Picea sitchensis stands in southeast Alaska, I used stand reconstruction methods to identify and date soil surfaces disturbed 50 to 500 years-ago by uprooted trees. With this soil chronosequence, I studied the rate of soil development and associated changes in soil carbon and nutrient dynamics, soil biology, and stand productivity.

40|$|The boreal biome {{consists}} of coniferous forests that cover {{much of the}} northern hemisphere, and constitute an important natural resource for the forest industry, but has also gained attention {{in the light of}} global warming in acting as potential sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Both forest production and carbon sequestration are closely connected to the activities of soil microorganisms, which play major roles in nutrient cycling and decomposition of plant biomass. Boreal forest soils are commonly classified as podzols, which are characterized by their clear horizon development with depth. Ecological surveys of soil biota commonly focus on the topsoil. The aim of this experiment was to examine if the organic, eluvial and <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizons</b> of a Swedish boreal forest podzol harboured distinct communities of fungi, bacteria and archaea, and further if roots of Scots pine seedlings, through input of rhizodeposition, would induce shifts in microbial communities in the different soil categories. The study was conducted as a microcosm experiment in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting of phylogenetic marker sequences, ITS rDNA for fungi and 16 S rDNA for archaea and bacteria. Soil sampled at the time of experimental set-up served as control for community shifts caused by incubation time alone. All soil horizons harboured distinct communities of fungi, bacteria and archaea. Fungi and bacteria displayed complex community profiles for all soil samples, but richness for both groups tended to be highest in the organic soil. The archaeal community profiles were relatively simple for all soil samples, though their richness appeared to be highest in the eluvial soil. Fungi was the microbial group that displayed the strongest response to the presence of Scots pine seedling roots, and ectomycorrhizas were observed in all microcosms with seedling, although the organic, eluvial and <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizons</b> harboured distinct morphotypes. In contrast, neither bacteria nor archaea responded much to the presence of Scots pine seedlings, but the bacterial communities underwent a clear shift in composition during the incubation period, especially in the organic soil. These results highlight the importance of including all layers in a soil profile to obtain a holistic view on the ecology of soil microorganisms and their roles in ecosystem functioning...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{analysis}} of the monitoring data of an offshore sand mining area in the Pear River estuary, the submarine geomorphy of the mining area can be classified into four types, namely shore, coarse sand mining pit, smooth sand mining pit and semi-deep terrain. From the sub-bottom profiles, it can be found that the four types represent four stage processes of sand mining, of which the most direct impact is the change of water depth, geomorphy and shallow sediment. Coarse granule sediments of autochthonous deposit cause strong reflection in the seabed surface and reduce the penetrating power of seismic wave. However, fine particles like clay and silt become suspended solids and gradually deposit, forming a smooth sediment surface of weak reflection and an <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizon</b> that can be penetrated by the seismic wave of shallow stratum section plotter, after being away from the sand mining center in a certain distance.

Even though the soil-forming factors appear similar, the soils differ at the order level. Two pedons, one belonging to the Payson polypedons and the other belonging to the Trenton polypedon, have been described and sampled by genetic horizons. Both pedons have essentially the same climate, slope, age, elevation, and are developed on the parent material of Lake Bonneville sediments. The differences in physical, chemical and mineralogical properties among the horizons in the same pedon and between the Payson and Trenton pedons is due to differences in deposition as alluvium or lacustrine sediments during different periods. The high amount of exchangeable sodium in both pedons reflects the development of texture in natric horizons and helps the movement of fine clay and organic matter from the eluvial to the <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizons.</b> The light color of the surface of the Payson pedon is related to high amounts of calcium carbonate in the Al horizon, bleaching of soil particles within the structural units by sodium, and the presence of large amounts of light-colored minerals in the epipedon of the Payson soil...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the conductive and steam-diffusive heat transfer constituents in the soil. Based on the solution of differential equation system of heat and mass transfer, the method to determine the conductive and steam-diffusive heat transfer constituents in wet soils was developed. To measure the thermophysical properties in laboratory setting, a pulse method of a two-dimensional heat source was used. The method takes into account the patterns of temperature field equalization in an unbounded medium after the heat source termination. A feature of this process is the occurrence of peak temperature at the investigated point of the medium at a given instant. In this experiment, the temperature was controlled not only at the investigated point of the medium, but also at the soil-heater interface. The proposed method was used to study the thermophysical indices of the chernozems of the Altai Region’s Priobye area (the Ob River area). The chernozem under study is of light-loamy particle-size composition; the <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizon</b> В is enriched by a sand fraction. It has been found that the soil conductive thermal diffusivity is reduced with increasing moisture content. The steam-diffusive thermal diffusivity has the extremum at the moisture close to the discontinuous capillary moisture. In humus horizons it plays a smaller role than in the mineral horizons. The thermal diffusivity determined by the steam molecule motion in the pore space of the soil exceeds the conductive thermal diffusivity two or three times. At the same time thermal steam diffusivity is more than ten time lower than the conductive constituent. Eventually, the stem molecules though dramatically accelerating the processes of heat transfer in the soil profile conduct a small amount of heat and make a weak contribution to soil thermal accumulation...|$|E

The clay fractions(< 2 μ) were separated from the soil samples after treatment with H_ 2 O_ 2 to remove organic matter, and were examined by the x-ray, thermal, chemical, electron microscopic, and glycol retention methods on the calcium or sodium clays. It is concluded that (a) the predominant minerals were montmorillonoid and illite in the Mera profile which was derived from the shales and sandstones of the Tertiary origin, (b) the Tani profile developed on the weathered andesite had hydrated halloysite, allophone, hallysite, and gibbsite, (c) vermiculite, illite, hydrated halloysite, halloysite, and quartz occurred in the Fukuma profile derived from diluvial deposits.

The results of experimental modeling indicate significant changes in the chemical parameters of groundwater, which are obtained by passing water with phosphogypsum particles on a model soil profile, which makes it easy to track the input data. In {{the upper part of the}} profile after 1 000 hours and for the first speed of the infiltration process, the constant moisture level was 25, 6 %, after the second speed of infiltration, it rose to 29. 1 %. Noted that the highest concentration of biogenic elements (calcium, sulfur, potassium) was found in lysimetric solutions obtained from the humus and eluvial horizons. In addition, it is determined that iron is present up to 5 %, nickel – within the range of 1 – 3 %, and copper – up to 1 %. It should be noted that the biochemical transformations of silicon influence the fractional distribution of heavy metals, which can be fixed by sorption-sedimentation mechanisms in silica, oligo and polysilicon compounds, as well as in crystalline lattice structures of clay minerals, quartz, etc. The model of soil and geochemical situation was formed according to the soil profile under the influence of the phosphogypsum within the three-dimensional surface, developed with the help of the stochastic reconstructions based on the images of the scan electron microscopes...|$|E
40|$|Podzolation is the {{dominant}} soil forming process in chemical poor sandy soils. It iswell studied howiron concentrations of podzols are effected by translocation of active iron fromeluvial to <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizons</b> and leaching to the aquifer. Iron stocks of Podzols, in contrasts, have not been widely studied for comparison purposes of individual soil horizons or between soils. In this study we provide {{an analysis of the}} iron stocks for two buried Podzols developed in Late-Glacial aeolian coversands. Chemical analyses of the active and immobile iron fractions in each of the horizons in both profiles showthatmore iron has been involved in the podzolation process, than the amount which can be derived by chemicalweathering ofminerals in the overlying soil horizons. This deficit in endogenic iron therefore requires exogenic enrichment to explain the observed iron concentrations during podzolation. The contribution of exogenic iron was studied using micrometeorites as a proxy for atmospheric deposition. These particles of cosmic origins are part of a continuous flux of iron-rich materials into the Earth's atmosphere and they are deposited over time on every square meter of land surface. Their extraction from ectorganic F horizon of initial Podzols helped illustrate that atmospheric deposition in the form of aerosol and aeolian (e. g. Sahara) dust, micrometeorites and other hydrolysable particles are a relevant iron contribution in soil development. The requisite active iron for podzolation can therefore be derived from chemical weathering of atmospheric iron sources in the acidic soil environment...|$|R
40|$|Stable iron isotope ratios {{in three}} soils (two Podzols and one Cambisol) were {{measured}} by MC-ICPMS to investigate iron isotope fractionation during pedogenic iron transformation and translocation processes under oxic conditions. Podzolization is a soil forming {{process in which}} iron oxides are dissolved and iron is translocated and enriched in the subsoil {{under the influence of}} organic ligands. The Cambisol was studied for comparison, representing a soil formed by chemical weathering without significant translocation of iron. A three-step sequential extraction procedure was used to separate operationally-defined iron mineral pools (i. e., poorly-crystalline iron oxides, crystalline iron oxides, silicate-bound iron) from the soil samples. Iron isotope ratios of total soil digests were compared with those of the separated iron mineral pools. Mass balance calculations demonstrated excellent agreement between results of sequential extractions and total soil digestions. Systematic variations in the iron isotope signature were found in the Podzol profiles. An enrichment of light iron isotopes of about 0. 6 ‰ in δ 57 Fe was found in total soil digests of the <b>illuvial</b> Bh <b>horizons</b> which can be explained by preferential translocation of light iron isotopes. The separated iron mineral pools revealed a wide range of δ 57 Fe values spanning more than 3 ‰ in the Podzol profiles. Strong enrichments of heavy iron isotopes in silicate-bound iron constituting the residue of weathering processes, indicated the preferential transformation of light iron isotopes during weathering. Iron isotope fractionation during podzolization is probably linked to the ligand-controlled iron translocation processes. Comparison of iron isotope data from eluvial and <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizons</b> of the Podzol profiles revealed that some iron must have been leached out of the profile. However, uncertainties in the initial iron content and iron isotopic composition of the parent materials prevented thorough mass balance calculations of iron fluxes within the profiles. In contrast to the Podzol profiles, the Cambisol profile displayed uniform δ 57 Fe values across soil depth and showed only a small enrichment of light iron isotopes of about 0. 4 ‰ in the poorly-crystalline iron oxide pool extracted by 0. 5 M HCl. This work demonstrates that significant iron isotope fractionations can occur during pedogenesis in oxic environments under the influence of organic ligands. Our findings provide new insights into fractionation mechanisms of iron isotopes and will help in the development of stable iron isotopes as tracers for biogeochemical iron cycling in nature. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The consequences of surface waterlogging on pedological processes (especially the geochemical behaviour of iron and aluminium) were also investigated. The results show that rutted areas have: (1) a significant decrease of total porosity in the eluvial upper layers of the soil (0 - 30 cm depth), associated with an important lowering of the transmission pore volume {{and a decrease in}} macroporosity to about 6 % of the total soil volume, i. e. to less than the current threshold value for root viability (10 %); (2) a reduction of macropore space to about 9. 5 % in the lower <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizons</b> (30 - 50 cm depth); (3) a decrease of redox potential due to temporary waterlogging, inducing (a) the occurrence of reduced forms of iron, (b) a strong leaching of iron oxyhydroxides from the E(g) to the B(1 g) horizon, (c) an increase of organically complexed iron forms in both the Es and B(tg) horizons, and (d) high solubility of Goethite and even of ferromagnesium minerals in the eluvial horizons; (4) an increase of clay dispersibility in both the E(g) and B(tg) horizons. These results provide clear evidence that on loessic materials soil compaction due to logging operations leads to rapid soil degradation through active hydromorphic processes.

40|$|Hydromorphic Podzol soils in the Amazon Basin {{generally}} support low-stature forests {{with some}} of the lowest amounts of aboveground net primary production (NPP) in the region. However, they can also exhibit large values of belowground NPP that can contribute significantly to the total annual inputs of organic matter into the soil. These hydromorphic Podzol soils also exhibit a horizon rich in organic matter at around 1 – 2 m depth, presumably as a result of eluviation of dissolved organic matter and sesquioxides of Fe and Al. Therefore, it is likely that these ecosystems store large quantities of carbon by (1) large amounts of C inputs to soils dominated by their high levels of fine-root production, (2) stabilization of organic matter in an illuviation horizon due to significant vertical transfers of C. To assess these ideas we studied soil carbon dynamics using radiocarbon in two adjacent Amazon forests growing on contrasting soils: a hydromorphic Podzol and a well-drained Alisol supporting a high-stature terra firme forest. Our measurements showed similar concentrations of C and radiocarbon in the litter layer and the first 5 cm of the mineral soil for both sites. This result is consistent with the idea that the hydromorphic Podzol soil has similar soil C storage and cycling rates compared to the well-drained Alisol that supports a more opulent vegetation. However, we found important differences in carbon dynamics and transfers along the vertical profile. At both soils, we found similar radiocarbon concentrations in the subsoil, but the carbon released after incubating soil samples presented radiocarbon concentrations of recent origin in the Alisol, but not in the Podzol. There were no indications of incorporation of C fixed after 1950 in the <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizon</b> of the Podzol. With the aid of a simulation model, we predicted that only a minor fraction (1. 7 %) of the labile carbon decomposed in the topsoil is transferred to the subsoil of the Podzol, while this proportional transfer is about 30 % in the Alisol. Furthermore, our estimates were 8 times lower than previous estimations of vertical C transfers in Amazon Podzols, and question the validity of these previous estimations for all Podzols within the Amazon Basin. Our results also challenge our previous ideas about the genesis of these particular soils and suggest that either they are not true Podzols or the podzolization processes had already stoppe...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the level}} of heavy metals (Zn, Mn, Fe, Pb, Co, Ni, Cd) and characteristics of their transportation through the water of minor rivers in Rivne region, Ukraine. The levels of Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co {{in the waters of}} these fisheries exceeded the maximum permissible concentration limit in different months. We found that the concentration of Pb and Cd did not exceed the permissible concentration limit in the waters of the fisheries during the year of research, while {{the level of}} other metals exceeded the permissible levels by 1. 1 to 151. 0 times. This research confirms that the surface waters of Rivne region are characterized by high concentrations of iron, manganese, zinc, and nickel. The level of iron exceeded the maximum permissible concentration limit by 1. 1 to 5. 0 times, the level of zinc by 1. 5 to 15. 0 times, that of manganese by 1. 3 to 6. 7 times and the nickel level by 1. 3 to 151. 0 times in the fishery waters. In principle, the increase in the level of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co) is connected with the lithological composition of reservoirs in the water-collecting areas of the investigated rivers, and besides with the significant influence of the anthropogenic load (fuel combustion, aqueous wastes of factory units, agricultural effluent, etc.), and with the increase in aquatic vegetation, pH balance, temperature change and so on. The appearance of iron-manganese compounds can be explained by natural causes such as reformation of the source minerals into secondary minerals in the conditions of pH level recession in water, which causes the release of these molecular entities; leaching of iron from the iron-manganese septarian nodules, a substantial amount of which is contained in the <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizon.</b> The increase in the level of zinc and nickel in the river water is connected with the leaching of these elements from subsurface rocks, soil and forest leaf litter. Atmospheric condensation is a significant source of the presence of nickel in the surface water. For the investigated rivers, the most significant factors in the water’s chemical composition are physiographic (foremost, the character of the soil cover, intensivity of erosion, extent of forest and swamp cover) and anthropogenous impact. In the rivers of Rivne region high concentrations of heavy metals are the consequence of the long-term aggradation of abiotic and biotic substances of the water ecosystem. There is a tendency for a reduction in the concentration of most metals in the abiotic substances of the water reservoir during the vegetative season and an increase after the end of this season. This research shows that the high level of contamination of the water of Rivne region’s minor rivers by the investigated heavy metal components is caused primarily by anthropogenic factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{deposition}} of mineral dust {{is an integral}} component of terrestrial and marine biogeochemical cycles. Dust is recognised as an important rejuvenator by supplying nutrients and unweathered mineral material to ecosystems. While deposition rates have been regularly quantified for terrestrial environments in the past, the rejuvenating effect of dust on soils and terrestrial ecosystems and the accessional processes have been rarely studied. This thesis addresses this gap by combining two environmental gradients, a dust-free chronosequence (170 to 6500 y) and a dust accumulation gradient on a 6500 y old surface (28 g m⁻² y⁻¹ to zero), located on the super-humid West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand. Across both gradients, soils were analysed for indicators of pedogenesis pathways (soil morphology, fractionation of pedogenic oxides, phosphorus (P) and particle sizes), and ecosystem fertility was evaluated by describing vegetation communities and foliar nutrient concentrations. Across the chronosequence, pedogenesis is characterised by rapid podsolisation including formation of distinct eluvial and <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizons,</b> high leaching losses of nutrients (Ca, K, Na, apatite P) and a rapid increase of secondary P fractions. This is followed by declining rates of change after the formation of Spodosols by 1000 y of pedogenesis. This soil fertility pattern {{is reflected in the}} vegetation by the presence of fertility-demanding species until the 1000 y old surface followed by a more persistent and less diverse species composition on the older surfaces. Foliar phosphorus concentrations decline rapidly within 2000 y towards levels similar to very old surfaces. The chronosequence is in agreement with progressive pedogenesis and ecosystem evolution driven by declining edaphic fertility. The pedogenesis response to increasing dust flux along the dust gradient is characterised by enhanced podsolisation as a result of upbuilding pedogenesis, which constantly resupplies the acidic topsoil with weatherable materials and forms upwardly growing <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizons.</b> As a result, pedogenic oxides and soil organic carbon increase with dust flux. Chemically, all dust-affected soils along the gradient follow a strongly progressive pedogenesis vector (Spodosols). Soil morphology, however, indicates regressive pedogenesis under the maximal dust flux rate where an Inceptisol has formed, indicating that soils can contain characteristics of both pedogenesis pathways, progressive and regressive, depending on the chosen soil property. As a result of burial by dust increments, the original, unweathered and nutrient-rich parent material becomes increasingly decoupled from the soil processes. This causes a decline of primary, apatite P (~ 50 to 3 g m⁻² 50 cm⁻¹) as the majority of mineral, dust-derived P is rapidly assimilated by the biota after deposition on the biologically and chemically most active topsoil. This is ultimately returned to the soil as organic P and then stored in the upper, most reactive and leached part of the soil, which raises the P content in these increments when compared to dust-free Spodosols (95 vs. 60 g m⁻² 30 cm⁻¹). The increase of ecosystem fertility in correlation with these processes is reflected by an increase of fertility-demanding species with dust flux, which is, however, not capable of maintaining vegetation suites characteristic of earlier stages of dust-free succession. Also, foliar P responds positively to the dust flux by an increase of up to 100 % under the highest flux rate. When compared to the chronosequence, this concentration is equivalent to those of a ~ 90 % younger chronosequence surface. The rejuvenation process by dust deposition is fundamentally different to nutrient accession by subsoil advection in dust-free soils and more effective, as dust is added directly to the part of the soil with the highest nutrient demand. The increase of a more stable, yet plantaccessible organic P pool may have significance in maintaining a higher long-term fertility after dust deposition has ceased. Dust significantly rejuvenates and fertilises soils and ecosystems in the study area but does not act equivalent to a backwards arrow in time. It instead induces characteristic accession processes and soil and ecosystem properties...|$|R
40|$|By {{providing}} the largest {{part of the}} reactive surface area of soils, secondary minerals {{play a major role}} in terrestrial biogeochemical processes. The understanding of the mechanisms governing neo(trans-) formation of pedogenic clay minerals in soils is therefore of the utmost importance to learn how soils evolve and impact the chemistry of elements in terrestrial environments. Soil-forming processes governing the evolution of secondary aluminosilicates in Podzols are however still not fully understood. The evolution of silicon (Si) isotope signature in the clay fraction of a podzolic soil chronosequence can provide new insight into these processes, enabling to trace the source of Si in secondary aluminosilicates during podzol-forming processes characterized by the mobilization, transport and precipitation of carbon, metals and Si. The Si isotope compositions in the clay fraction (comprised of primary and secondary minerals) document an increasing light 28 Si enrichment and depletion with soil age, respectively in <b>illuvial</b> B <b>horizons</b> and eluvial E horizon. The mass balance approach demonstrates that secondary minerals in the topsoil eluvial E horizons are isotopically heavier with δ 30 Si values increasing from - 0. 39 to + 0. 64 ‰ in c. a. 200 years, while secondary minerals in the <b>illuvial</b> Bhs <b>horizon</b> are isotopically lighter (δ 30 Si=- 2. 31 ‰), compared to the original "unweathered" secondary minerals in BC horizon (δ 30 Si=- 1. 40 ‰). The evolution of Si isotope signatures is explained by the dissolution of pedogenic clay minerals in the topsoil, which is a source of light 28 Si for the re-precipitation of new clay minerals in the subsoil. This provides consistent evidence that in strong weathering environment such as encountered in Podzols, Si released from secondary minerals is partially used to form "tertiary clay minerals" over very short time scales (ca. 300 years). Our dataset demonstrates the usefulness to measure Si isotope signatures in the clay fraction to discern clay mineral changes (e. g., neoformation versus solid state transformation) during soil evolution. This offers new opportunity to better understand clay mineral genesis under environmental changes, and the short-term impact of the dissolution and re-precipitation of pedogenic clay minerals on soil fertility, soil carbon budget and elemental cycles in soil-plant systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.

Bh horizons of Podzols {{formed from}} regoliths of sandstones, granites and gneisses in the Sudety Mountains are dark in colour, rich in organic substance, {{strongly}} acidic and slightly saturated with basic cations. They are also significantly enriched with organic and amorphous compounds {{of iron and}} aluminium. They meet all the morphological and physicochemical requirements of <b>illuvial</b> spodic <b>horizons.</b> Despite the evidence of lithological stratification of slope covers and possible polygenesis of B horizons, it is justifiable to classify these soils as Podzols, as adequately describing their morphology, basic properties and tendencies for present development. The soil cover of the Sudety Mountains is abundant in Cambisols [1], but favourable geological, climatic and biotic conditions facilitate {{the development of the}} podzolization processes [18]. Podzols have been identified, with regard to their morphological features and physicochemical properties, in almost every range of the Sudety Mountains [6, 10]. However, the genesis of Podzols in mountainous regions is controversial, due to lithological stratification of slope covers, and especially due to the occurrence of the upper slope cover (theta), which according to Kowalkowski [9] possesses the features of a master E horizon throughout th...|$|R

The saturation degree of a layer with humus material, {{depending on the}} temperature, correlates well with magnetic susceptibility and different types of magnetization of deposits (Tang et al., 2003, Bosak&Pruner, 2011). On the base of rockmagnetic measurements of soil-containing samples, collected from sections at Biyuk-Karasu-XIX (Piedmont Crimea) and Emine-Bair-Khosar Cave (lower plateau of Chatyrdag mountain massive in Crimea) (Ridush et al., 2013), correlation of sediments done {{in the context of}} common climate changes in the region during Holocene. The process of sediments accumulation in the sections covers roughly the same period. The loess soil section Biyuk-Karasu-XIX contains findings of hand shaped pottery and flintstones. The section structure has characteristic features of Holocene soil formation for which received a definite chronological anchor. The section of cave deposits in the Emine-Bair-Khosar Cave was dated by radiocarbon and paleomagnetic methods (Ridush et al., 2013). For saiga bone from the depth of 2. 0  m radiocarbon (14 C) date 10, 490 +/- 170 (Ki- 13063) obtained. At - 1. 1 m deep the paleomagnetic excursion, dated 2. 8 kyr BP, was recorded (Bondar, Ridush, 2010). Sediments of both sections are horizontally-layered. They contain darker units, which color is controlled by organic material, and lighter units of loess-like loam. Section Biyuk-Karasu-XIX consists of the following lithofacial units: 1, 2 - hlb 2 – meadow alkaline chernozem, where unit 1 - horizon Hegl, unit 2 - horizon Hp, Pikgl, Pkgl; 3, 4 - hlb 1 - the soil has features of grey or sod-calcareous soil forming, unit 3 combines horizons He and Eh, unit 4 – <b>illuvial</b> <b>horizons</b> Ihp and Pigl; 5 - pc-bg? - silty-sandy light loam. Lithofacial units are named according to “Stratigraphic scheme of Quaternary deposits of Ukraine” (Veklich et al., 1993), soil horizons are named according to Dokuchaev soil classification (Dokuchaev, 1883). Section of unconsolidated sediments in the Emine-Bair-Khosar Cave consists of the following lithofacial units: unit A - dark gray, loose, structureless, moist, light-loamy texture, contains much of organic matter. Unit B - sequence, which consists of eight packs of clay+clastic layer, reddish-brown in color, size of limestone rubbles in clastic layers increases from 1 - 2 mm at the top of unit, to 1 cm at the bottom. Unit C is light, fawn, homogeneous clay, with a low content of clastic material.
