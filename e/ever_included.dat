5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Skaboy JFK, Perry already began announcing plans for the Daddies' next studio album, {{revealing}} the band would be returning to swing music for their first all-swing album since Zoot Suit Riot. Initial production on the album, titled White Teeth, Black Thoughts, began in March 2011, though lasted infrequently throughout the year as the Daddies continued to carry out several more successful international tours, including two separate sold-out tours of Australia in 2011 and 2012.
