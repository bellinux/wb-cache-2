5|$|Bloom {{says that}} some of the {{characters}} have not stood the test of time, writing that modern readers are uncomfortable with the anti-semitic treatment of Cohn's character and the romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> qualities: its prose and style.|$|E

5|$|Tyler did {{not approve}} the opening until his listed {{improvements}} were completed, although slate trains and unofficial passenger trains were running in 1865. During November of that 1866, Tyler returned to Tywyn and re-inspected the railway following which, subject to some further minor improvements, he approved <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> opening for passenger service. The first public passenger timetable was issued in December 1866, and the first purpose-built, steam-worked, narrow gauge public railway in Britain opened for service.|$|E

The event resulted in approximately forty deaths and ended after Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa became the Emir of Bahrain in 1999. He instituted elections for parliament, gave women {{the right to}} vote, and released all political prisoners. A referendum on 14–15 February 2001 massively supported the National Action Charter.

5|$|Because Bath is unparished, {{there is}} no longer a city council (or parish council) — Bath City Council having ended in 1996 with the {{abolition}} of the district of Bath. The City of Bath's ceremonial functions, including <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> status as a city, its twinning arrangements, the mayoralty of Bath– which can be traced back to 1230– and control of the city's coat of arms, are maintained by the charter trustees of the City of Bath. The councillors elected by the electoral wards that cover Bath (see below) are the trustees, and they elect one of their number as mayor.|$|E

5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society {{would be better for}} it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Company {{was accused}} of mismanagement, and Bombay reverted to the British Crown. On 2 August 1858, the British Parliament began {{abolition}} of the Company and asserted full, direct Crown authority over India. The execution was slow. The Company for purposes of liquidation maintained <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> existence until 1874. India was thereafter directly ruled by the Crown as a colony of the United Kingdom, and officially known as the Empire of India after 1876. India consisted of some regions referred to as British India that were directly administered by the British and other regions called the Princely States that were ruled by Indian rulers.|$|E
5|$|In late May 1988, amid rising {{nationalist}} tensions from glasnost and perestroika, Armenia's new Communist {{party leader}} allowed the banned tricolour of the DRA {{to fly in}} Yerevan {{for the first time}} in over sixty years. A year later, following a Nagorno-Karabakh-themed mass demonstration where the tricolour was flown, he urged its official recognition. This came on August 24, 1990, a day after the Armenian Supreme Soviet declared the republic's sovereignty and renamed the country the Republic of Armenia. At that point, just over a year before Armenia declared <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> independence from the USSR, the tricolour replaced the 1952 flag.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} institutions, the Parliament's seat {{was not yet}} fixed. The {{provisional}} arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing {{to be closer to}} these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s {{also saw}} an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain {{recovered}} from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats. An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At {{the end of the}} day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by gravity. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s. The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.|$|E
5|$|The Cyrus Cylinder {{has been}} {{displayed}} in the British Museum since <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> acquisition in 1880.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the temple was completed ten days ahead of schedule, allowing for more non-member guests to visit the temple before the dedication. The King of Tonga was given a private tour of the temple by previous Tongan mission president John Groberg to explain {{the purposes of the}} building. Before <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> dedication, over 50 percent of the Tongan population had toured the temple. The church's Nuku'alofa Tonga Temple was dedicated in 1983 by Gordon B. Hinckley as Kimball was ill and could not attend the dedication. There were seven dedicatory sessions held, most of which took place in the Liahona School gymnasium. 15,000 people were in attendance of these sessions.|$|E
5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the party discipline inspection system mirrors that of the MOS, with the CCDI responsible for cases involving breaches of party discipline and state law by party members. Like the MOS, the CCDI lacks judicial authority and is limited to investigating allegations of corruption and breaches of party discipline. Since the CCDI {{does not have the}} power to prosecute, it is supposed to transfer cases (after investigation) to the Supreme People's Procuratorate or the Supreme People's Court. Despite this, <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> jurisdiction is loosely defined. The CDI's ability to begin investigations and administer party sanctions has often led to the slow transfer (or sometimes no transfer) of cases to the Supreme People's Procuratorate.|$|E
5|$|The mansion at Wappocomo {{is unique}} among the {{historic}} residences along the South Branch Potomac River, in that <b>its</b> <b>formal</b> façade faces {{toward the road}} and the western flanks of South Branch Mountain rather than toward the river. The original 1774 portion of the mansion is a square two-story Georgian-style structure, an architectural style prevalent in Virginia at the time of Wappocomo's construction. The bricks used to build the 1774 structure were manufactured in England, and used as ballast to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the James River. The interior of the 1774 structure contains a grand stairway in the center hall and all the original handmade woodworking. A stone addition to the mansion with two stories of deep verandas was completed in 1861. The principal passenger depot for the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad, Wappocomo Station, is located at the farm.|$|E
