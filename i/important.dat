5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify <b>important</b> cutting-edge problems in mathematics. Some of her most <b>important</b> results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students {{formed the basis for}} several <b>important</b> textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E

5|$|Examples of biologically <b>important</b> {{fatty acids}} include the eicosanoids, derived {{primarily}} from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid is also <b>important</b> in biological systems, particularly {{with respect to}} sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include <b>important</b> biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, this {{metabolic}} pathway is <b>important</b> in beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline, as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases.

5|$|Many {{species of}} birds are {{economically}} <b>important</b> as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds (poultry and game) being <b>important</b> sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested {{for use as a}} fertiliser. Birds prominently figure throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an <b>important</b> part of the ecotourism industry.|$|E

5|$|Research is <b>important</b> in 4X {{games because}} {{technological}} progress is an engine for conquest. Battles are often won by superior military technology or greater numbers, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. In contrast, military upgrades in non-4X games are sometimes small enough that technologically basic units remain <b>important</b> throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|Southampton was an <b>important</b> trading port in the 12th century, {{with trade}} routes to Normandy, the Levant and Gascony. The castle played an <b>important</b> {{role in this}} trade, in part forming a {{warehouse}} for the king's imports, this process being managed by a Crown Bailiff. Royal purchases of wine were particularly <b>important</b> for the castle, being stored and distributed to royal properties across the south of England. The former castle hall {{was turned into a}} subterranean vault in the 13th century, probably for storing wine.|$|E

5|$|Southampton's town walls {{remained}} an <b>important</b> defensive feature during the 15th century, the gatehouses sometimes {{being used as}} <b>important</b> civic facilities, including acting as the town's guildhall and housing the town's gaol. From {{the end of the}} 17th century their importance steadily declined and the walls were slowly demolished or adapted for other uses throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. This process continued into the early 20th century until, in the post-war years, the walls were recognised as an <b>important</b> historical feature of Southampton. Conservation projects have since occurred and the walls are now promoted as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two <b>important</b> skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual is an <b>important</b> skill in establishing reference. The {{ability to identify}} intention is <b>important</b> in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is <b>important</b> for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development {{and the ability to}} take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E
