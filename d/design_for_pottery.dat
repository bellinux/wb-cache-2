5000|$|Scandinavian {{design was}} very {{influential}} at this time, with a style characterized by simplicity, democratic design and natural shapes. Glassware (Iittala - Finland), ceramics (Arabia - Finland), tableware (Georg Jensen - Denmark), lighting (Poul Henningsen - Denmark), and furniture (Danish modern) {{were some of}} the genres for the products created. In America, east of the Mississippi, the American-born Russell Wright, <b>designing</b> <b>for</b> Steubenville <b>Pottery,</b> and Hungarian-born Eva Zeisel <b>designing</b> <b>for</b> Red Wing <b>Pottery</b> and later Hall China created free-flowing ceramic designs that were much admired and heralded in the trend of smooth, flowing contours in dinnerware. On the West Coast of America the industrial designer and potter Edith Heath (1911 - 2005) founded Heath Ceramics in 1948. The company was one of the originally numerous California pottery manufacturers that had their heyday in post-war USA, and produced Mid-Century modern ceramic dish-ware. Edith Heath's [...] "Coupe" [...] line remains in demand and has been in constant production since 1948, with only periodic changes to the texture and color of the glazes.|$|R

By the 1890s, the company had shifted from retail to wholesale operations and started working on <b>design</b> improvements <b>for</b> the <b>pottery</b> and porcelain ware, which had become one third of its business. By 1899, all of the pottery and porcelain decorating factories in Tokyo and Kyoto had been consolidated in Nagoya, and the company started research on creating European style hard white porcelain in Japan.|$|R
50|$|Gottfried and Thekla Zielke (born 1929 and 1928 in Germany) are ceramicists {{based in}} Venezuela.

While Thekla studied ceramics design, Gottfried learned the technical aspects of the craft, with an emphasis on enamel. After attaining his Bachelor's degree, Gottfried apprenticed for three years in two ceramics workshops, where he gained further knowledge of ceramics technique, theory, and chemistry. This led to later scientific studies of the medium, such as Organic chemistry, Mineralogy, and Geology.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the first}} persons {{to be hired}} by the Woodwards {{to assist with the}} new pottery program were the potters. Unlike the artists who created and carved the <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Pottery,</b> the potters were all men, as it was {{believed}} that a [...] "male potter would be needed to work the clay, throw the pots, fire the kiln and handle the glazing." [...] The first potter hired was Jules Garby in 1895. He was followed by one of Newcomb Pottery's most recognized potters, Joseph Meyer, in 1896. Notably, George Ohr was hired as a potter at approximately the same time as Joseph Meyer, but Ohr left Newcomb to work on his own sometime in 1897. [...] Meyer's cipher is found on more pieces of Newcomb College Pottery than any other person. [...] Meyer won awards for his work at Newcomb at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo and the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Centennial Exposition. [...] Meyer stayed with the Pottery until his retirement in 1927. He was replaced by Jonathan Hunt in 1927 and later Kenneth Smith in 1929. After Hunt left the Pottery in 1933, he was replaced by Francis Ford. Both Smith and Ford stayed with the Newcomb Pottery program through its termination in 1940.|$|R

5000|$|Traditionally, Zuni {{women made}} <b>pottery</b> <b>for</b> {{food and water}} storage. They used symbols of their clans <b>for</b> <b>designs.</b> Clay <b>for</b> the <b>pottery</b> is sourced locally. Prior to its extraction, the women give thanks to the Earth Mother (Awidelin Tsitda) {{according}} to ritual. The clay is ground, and then sifted and mixed with water. After the clay is rolled into a coil and shaped into a vessel or other design, it will be scraped smooth with a scraper. A thin layer of finer clay, called slip, {{is applied to the}} surface for extra smoothness and color. The vessel is polished with a stone after it dries. It is painted with home-made organic dyes, using a traditional yucca brush. The intended function of the pottery dictates its shape and images painted on its surface. To fire the pottery, the Zuni used animal dung in traditional kilns. Today Zuni potters might use electric kilns. While the firing of the pottery was usually a community enterprise, silence or communication in low voices was considered essential {{in order to maintain the}} original [...] "voice" [...] of the [...] "being" [...] of the clay, and the purpose of the end product. Sales of pottery and traditional arts provide a major source of income for many Zuni people today. An artisan may be the sole financial support for her immediate family as well as others. Many women make pottery or, less frequently, clothing or baskets.|$|R
40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{interconnected}} challenges of population loss, vacant lands, and economic disinvestment, citizens of legacy cities like Detroit increasingly seek opportunities to manufacture their own social, economic, and ecolog - ical revitalization. This master’s project offers {{a case study}} exploration {{of the potential for}} arts-based revitalization through a campus landscape <b>design</b> <b>for</b> Pewabic <b>Pottery,</b> one of the last surviving pottery studios of the early 20 th cen - tury Arts and Crafts era and a widely-appreciated Detroit arts institution. The medium for this exploration is Pewabic’s current 1. 5 -acre campus, which in - cludes a half-acre of vacant land once occupied by neighboring businesses. The project also considers multiple future scenarios considering purchase of adjacent parcels both vacant and occupied. We adopted a process-orient - ed approach to advance revitalization efforts by drawing connections be - tween arts-based revitalization literature and the slate of participatory design practices used across multiple design disciplines. Methods used to engage Pewabic’s community of stakeholders included a series of design workshops, event tabling, and surveys. With the information gathered from these activi - ties, we developed three concepts for the site: 1) Hospitality, 2) Fusion, and 3) Minimalism. Each concept considers alternative design variables regarding location of a new education studio, relationship with the historic Water Works Park, expansion of Pewabic’s campus to include additional adjacent parcels, and, finally, garden design styles. We developed these design concepts {{in the hope that the}} redevelopment of the campus landscape will contribute towards revitalization of other nearby neighborhood spaces by serving as an aesthetic catalyst <b>for</b> ecological <b>design</b> principles, and by enhancing Pewabic’s capacity to attract and engage visitors along the East Jefferson Avenue corridor...|$|R

While abroad he {{applied to the}} Royal Academy for a grant after the bankruptcy of his father. Two years later, he returned to Britain by way of Vienna and Dresden. He began instructing Reinagle’s daughter Jane in drawing and married her in 1803. Together they had four daughters and three sons. From 1806 they lived at 50 Newman Street, Westminster, until his death.In the 1790s Howard painted and drew a variety of subjects from literature, portraits, and drawings of sculpture. In 1795 and 1796, he submitted five such pictures to the Royal Academy, including a sketch from Milton’s Paradise Lost. He illustrated Sharpe’s British Essayists and Du Roveray’s edition of Alexander Pope’s translation of Homer. He also contributed <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> Josiah Wedgwood's <b>pottery.</b> Between 1799 and 1802, he {{made a series of}} drawings of sculpture.
