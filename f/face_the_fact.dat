By the time Great Britain realised it, the position had worsened; Bush decided that outside help for the Manhattan Project was no longer needed. The Military Policy Committee (MPC) supported Bush's arguments and restricted access to the classified information which Britain could utilise to develop its atomic weapons programme, even if it slowed down the American efforts.|$|E

500|$|Yet the United Kingdom did {{not have}} the {{manpower}} or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it. Britain was spending around £430,000 per year on research and development, and Metropolitan-Vickers was building gaseous diffusion units for uranium enrichment worth £150,000; but the Manhattan Project was spending £8,750,000 on research and development, and had let construction contracts worth £100,000,000 at the fixed wartime rate of four dollars to the pound. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised [...] the prime minister, Winston Churchill, that: [...] "We must <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that... pioneering work... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped.

500|$|The British and Americans {{exchanged}} nuclear {{information but}} did not initially combine their efforts. Britain rebuffed attempts by Bush and Conant in 1941 to strengthen cooperation with its own project, codenamed Tube Alloys, because it was reluctant to share its technological lead and help the United States develop its own atomic bomb. An American scientist who brought a personal letter from Roosevelt to Churchill offering {{to pay for all}} research and development in an Anglo-American project was poorly treated, and Churchill did not reply to the letter. The United States as a result decided as early as April 1942 that if its offer was rejected, they should proceed alone. The British, who had made significant contributions early in the war, did not have the resources to carry through such a research program while fighting for their survival. As a result, Tube Alloys soon fell behind its American counterpart. and on 30 July 1942, Sir John Anderson, the minister responsible for Tube Alloys, advised Churchill that: [...] "We must <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that... pioneering work... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none." [...] That month Churchill and Roosevelt made an informal, unwritten agreement for atomic collaboration.|$|E
500|$|In {{the essay}} [...] "Hamlet Made Simple", David P. Gontar turns {{the tables on}} the psychoanalysts by {{suggesting}} that Claudius is not a symbolic father figure but actually Prince Hamlet's biological father. [...] The hesitation in killing Claudius results from an unwillingness on Hamlet's part to slay his real father. [...] If Hamlet is the biological son of Claudius, that explains many things. [...] Hamlet doesn't become King of Denmark {{on the occasion of}} the King's death inasmuch as it is an open secret in court that he is Claudius's biological son, and as such he is merely a court bastard not in the line of succession. [...] He is angry with his mother because of her long standing affair with a man Hamlet hates, and Hamlet must <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he has been sired by the man he loathes. [...] That point overturns T. S. Eliot's complaint that the play is a failure for not furnishing an [...] "objective correlative" [...] to account for Hamlet's rage at his mother. [...] Gontar suggests that if the reader assumes that Hamlet is not who he seems to be, the objective correlative becomes apparent. [...] Hamlet is suicidal in the first soliloquy not because his mother quickly remarries but because of her adulterous affair with the despised Claudius which makes Hamlet his son. [...] Finally, the ghost's confirmation of an alternative fatherhood for Hamlet is a fabrication that gives the prince a motive for revenge.|$|E

2500|$|A {{challenge}} for the modern archaeologist is to consider whether [...] in-situ preservation, or recovery and conservation on land is the preferable option; or to <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that preservation in any form, other than as an archaeological record is not feasible. A site that has been discovered has typically been subjected to disturbance of the very factors that caused its survival in the first place, for example, when a covering of sediment has been removed by storms or the action of man. Active monitoring and deliberate protection may mitigate [...] further rapid destruction making in situ preservation an option, but long-term survival can never be guaranteed. For very many sites, the costs are too great for either active measures to ensure in situ preservation or to provide for satisfactory conservation on recovery. Even the cost of proper and complete archaeological investigation may be too great to enable this to occur within a timescale that ensures that an archaeological record is made before data is inevitably lost.|$|E

2500|$|Peter {{claims that}} the reason {{why he was so}} {{successful}} on the badminton court was because of his studies of Bushido, an ancient Japanese philosophy and his mentor, Miyamoto Musashi, a great samurai. Miyamoto Musashi began his “warrior’s pilgrimage” at age 13 when he began to train as a swordsmen and as a practicing Bushido Warrior. Legend claims that he killed his first opponent at age 14 in one of the 60 duels he fought over his lifetime. It is said that he was never defeated, both in single combat and during the 6 wars, in which he took part. At age 35, Musashi sheathed his sword to become a mentor, an artist and finally a writer, who penned one of Japan’s most influential pieces of literature – “The Book of the Five Rings.” Rasmussen had to <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of losing before he can entertain the thought of winning.

When a person like that gets out to vote, I'm convinced they don't have the slightest clue who it is they're really voting for. Democracy makes sense only when you've got an economically independent and well informed voter, someone who has the information and is capable of thinking. Simply counting up the votes without really knowing what's behind them is stupidity. I'm sorry, but in Serbs we have the same people that elected Slobodan Milošević on multiple occasions. Big electoral numbers do not impress me at all".|$|E
