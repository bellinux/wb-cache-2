5|$|A new note in Coutances' {{administration}} was his custom of issuing writs not in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name,</b> as {{had previously been}} the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that his decisions were made with the advice and consent {{of many of the}} leading nobles of the realm, as well as the barons of the Exchequer. This was a reaction against Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Fitzgerald in 1978, Flanagan then {{attracted}} {{praise for}} the elegance of his playing, which was principally in trio settings when under his own leadership. In his 45-year recording career, he recorded more than three dozen albums under <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> and more than 200 as a sideman. By {{the time of his}} death, {{he was one of the}} most widely admired jazz pianists and had influenced both his contemporaries and later generations of players.|$|E
5|$|After more lineup changes, Stockdale {{stopped using}} the Wolfmother name in 2013 and {{released}} {{a collection of}} recent recordings under <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> as Keep Moving. The band returned shortly after the album's release, however, and later released their third album New Crown in March 2014, which reached number 160 on the Billboard 200. The band released their fourth studio album Victorious in February 2016, which reached number 17 on the Australian Albums Chart.|$|E
5|$|His first efforts, {{published}} under {{a variety}} of pseudonyms, were cheaply printed potboiler novels. In 1829 he finally released a novel under <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name,</b> titled Les Chouans; it was a minor success, though it did not earn the author enough money to relieve his considerable debt. He found fame soon afterwards with a series of novels including La Physiologie du mariage (1829), Sarrasine (1830), and La Peau de chagrin (1831).|$|E
5000|$|He {{started his}} career as a drum player in the early 1960s when he was 13. In the mid 1960s at the age of 17, he formed a band of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>named</b> [...] "Rebells".|$|R

5|$|Through his {{critical}} writings, published under <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name,</b> Heseltine made {{a pioneering}} {{contribution to the}} scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards {{the end of his}} life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.|$|E
5000|$|After Boyer's death, {{his widow}} Mary {{was taken in}} by his close friend, Thomas Leforge. When <b>his</b> <b>own</b> wife died, Leforge married Mary and adopted her children.

50|$|One {{hundred years}} later, the Bargellini {{reaction}} itself {{was used for}} the condensation of coumarins, an ironic twist to the history of the reaction since this was Bargellini's primary compound of interest and <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>named</b> reaction produced it.|$|R

5|$|When Æthelred made a {{grant to}} Berkeley Abbey in 883, {{he did it with}} the {{approval}} of King Alfred, thus acknowledging Alfred's lordship. Thereafter he usually acted with Alfred's permission, but issued some charters in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> without reference to Alfred, such as at a meeting in Risborough in Buckinghamshire in 884, showing that English Mercia extended quite far south-east towards London.|$|E
5|$|Beiderbecke's most {{influential}} recordings date from {{his time with}} Goldkette and Whiteman, although they were generally recorded under <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> or Trumbauer's. The Whiteman period also marked a precipitous decline in Beiderbecke's health, {{brought on by the}} demand of the bandleader's relentless touring and recording schedule in combination with Beiderbecke's persistent alcoholism. A few stints in rehabilitation centers, as well as the support of Whiteman and the Beiderbecke family in Davenport, did not check Beiderbecke's decline in health. He left the Whiteman band in 1930 and the following summer died in his Queens apartment at the age of 28.|$|E
5|$|During her term at the university, Massaquoi {{succeeded in}} {{overcoming}} {{the requirement that}} students should adopt foreign names rather than keeping those of their indigenous families. In connection with this, when she married Ernest Freeman on 26 July 1948, Massaquoi adopted his tribal name Fahnbulleh, calling herself Fatima Massaquoi-Fahnbulleh. Her husband also changed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> back to Fahnbulleh. To further contribute to the cultural and social development of Liberia, she organized a seminar through the African Studies Program in 1962 to promote the standardization of the Vai script.|$|E

5|$|Forced labourers for the Eastern Railway were {{eventually}} {{kept in a}} separate closed camp, where conditions were {{a little better than}} at the main camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal prepared architectural drawings for Adolf Kohlrautz, the senior inspector, who submitted them under <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name.</b> To obtain contracts, construction companies paid bribes to Kohlrautz, who shared some of the money with Wiesenthal. He was able to pass along further information about the railroads to the underground and occasionally left the compound to obtain supplies, even clandestinely obtaining weapons for the Armia Krajowa and two pistols for himself, which he took along when he escaped in autumn 1943.|$|E
5|$|He {{published}} for {{the first}} time under <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> in 1829. Les Chouans, a novel about royalist forces in Brittany, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles. He achieved a major success later the same year when he published La Physiologie du mariage, a treatise on the institution of marriage. Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and La Mode. He thus made connections in the publishing industry that later helped him to obtain reviews of his novels.|$|E
5|$|In his 50-year career, Waldron {{recorded}} {{more than}} 100 albums under <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name</b> {{and more than}} 70 for other band leaders. He also wrote for modern ballet, and composed the scores of several feature films. As a pianist, Waldron's roots lay chiefly in the hard bop and post-bop genres of the New York club scene of the 1950s, but with time he gravitated more towards free jazz. He {{is known for his}} dissonant chord voicings and distinctive later playing style, which featured repetition of notes and motifs.|$|E

5|$|Johns was {{a popular}} member of the cast of The Footy Show, and played several {{characters}} for the show. He further developed the Reg Reagan character as a beer-swilling rugby league fan, and the character became hugely popular. He also appeared as Trent, a gay flight attendant. In 2004, Johns recorded a novelty song and wrote a book, This Is My Life in character as Reg Reagan, and produced a DVD featuring both characters.

In 2008, he wrote a second book, From the Sheds, under <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name.</b> He also became assistant coach of the Melbourne Storm NRL team.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the writers}} who most enchanted Hańska was the French novelist Honoré de Balzac. After laboring in pseudonymous obscurity for ten years, Balzac {{published}} Les Chouans (The Chouans) in 1829. A tale of star-crossed love amidst a royalist uprising in Brittany, {{it was the first}} work to which he signed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name.</b> Hańska was intrigued by the glowing portrayal of the female protagonist, driven by true love to protect the object of her desire. She also enjoyed Balzac's Physiologie du mariage (The Physiology of Marriage), also published in 1829, which heaps satirical scorn on husbands and celebrates the virtue of married women.|$|E
5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to the doctrine of privity. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from the insurer of the driver at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>name,</b> but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the doctrine of privity.|$|E
