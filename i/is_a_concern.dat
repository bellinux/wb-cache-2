5|$|Although not {{permitted}} under the US National Electric Code, it is technically {{possible to have}} a “plug and play” PV microinverter. A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. There are several companies selling plug and play solar systems available on the web, but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> that if people install their own it will reduce the enormous employment advantage solar has over fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|However, stool {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in those with blood in the stool, those {{who might have been}} exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> about severe dehydration.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive {{methods such as}} the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
30|$|Group I are {{combined}} exposures that <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> because {{one or more}} individual chemicals <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> (dose or concentration {{of one or more}} chemicals exceed the corresponding reference value (RV)).|$|R

5|$|Population {{numbers for}} the Castillonnais are quite low. The {{majority}} of breeders are located in Castillon-en-Couserans, in Ariège, but a few {{can be found in}} Brittany and Provence. In November 2005, there were only around 260 existing Castillonnais, and a goal was created by the breed association to double the number of purebred mares between 2005 and 2014. Inbreeding <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> due to low population numbers, and the national stud farm at Tarbes and Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (National Institute of Agronomic Research) have been brought in to help safeguard the genetic resources of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The Castillonnais {{probably}} descends {{from the}} horses {{that inspired the}} Magdalenian-era paintings found, for example, at the Cave of Niaux, with Oriental and Iberian blood added later. Originally bred as a multipurpose breed used for cavalry, agriculture and driving, the breed declined in population during the 20th century, and almost became extinct. In 1980, a group of supporters began to work to save the breed, and a breed association, now called the Association Nationale du Cheval Castillonnais d'Ariège Pyrénées (ANCCAP), was formed in 1992. The breed was officially recognized by the French Ministry of Agriculture in 1996. The French government, breed association and a regional conservation group all now share {{an interest in the}} preservation of the breed. Population numbers are still quite low, and inbreeding <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} cull {{vampire bat}} populations in areas where human-wildlife {{conflict}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern.</b> Vampire bats are captured with mist nets and coated {{with a combination of}} petroleum jelly and warfarin. The bat returns to its roost {{and other members of the}} roost become poisoned as well by ingesting the warfarin after reciprocal grooming. Suspected vampire bat roosts may also be coated in the warfarin solution, though this kills other bat species and remains in the environment for years. The efficacy of killing vampire bats to reduce rabies transmission is questionable, however; a study in Peru showed that culling programs did not lead to lower transmission rates of rabies to livestock and humans.|$|E

25|$|Solar roof ponds {{are unique}} solar {{heating and cooling}} systems {{developed}} by Harold Hay in the 1960s. A basic system consists of a roof-mounted water bladder with a movable insulating cover. This system can control heat exchange between interior and exterior environments by covering and uncovering the bladder between night and day. When heating <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> the bladder is uncovered during the day allowing sunlight to warm the water bladder and store heat for evening use. When cooling <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> the covered bladder draws heat from the building's interior {{during the day and}} is uncovered at night to radiate heat to the cooler atmosphere. The Skytherm house in Atascadero, California uses a prototype roof pond for heating and cooling.|$|E
25|$|Occupational safety <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> {{on fishing}} trawlers. For example, a United States {{cooperative}} which operates {{a fleet of}} 24 bottom trawlers in Alaskan water reported 25 fatalities over the period 2001–2012. The risk of a fatal injury was 41 {{times higher than the}} average for workers in the United States.|$|E

25|$|For {{the average}} user, UV {{radiation}} from indoor lights {{does not appear}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern.</b> For those with skin sensitivity long term indoor exposure may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern,</b> in which case they may want to use a bulb with lower UV radiation output. There seems to be more variability within bulb types than between them, but the best option is shielded CFLs.|$|R
25|$|Another issue {{arises when}} the sample for {{detection}} {{is a relatively}} large molecule, such as DNA or protein. In the application for large molecule, clogging <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> because {{the small size of}} the nanochannel makes it easy to happen. A low friction coating at inner surface of the channel is desired to avoid blocking of fluid channels in this application.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} with antibiotics taken by mouth, such as cephalexin, amoxicillin, or cloxacillin. In {{those who are}} seriously allergic to penicillin, erythromycin or clindamycin may be used. When methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern,</b> doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may, in addition, be recommended. Concern {{is related to the}} presence of pus or previous MRSA infections. Elevating the infected area may be useful, as may pain killers.|$|E

25|$|Homework is {{problematic}} when teachers' observations from the independent phase are not employed when determining {{how much and}} what kinds of expectations will be placed on students to accomplish for the next class.

This is extremely problematic since it takes even more time to unlearn misconceptions and misunderstandings.|$|E
25|$|In warmer regions, where overripening <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern,</b> the {{opposite}} process of rehydration and acidification is used. This {{is used in}} jurisdictions such as areas of California, where if the must has excess sugar for normal fermentation, water may be added to lower the concentration. In acidification, tartaric acid {{is added to the}} must to compensate for the high levels of sugar and low levels of acid naturally found in ripe grapes.|$|E
25|$|According to Denbigh, the {{property}} of hotness <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> of thermodynamics that should be defined {{without reference to the}} concept of heat. Consideration of hotness leads to the concept of empirical temperature. All physical systems are capable of heating or cooling others. This does not require that they have thermodynamic temperatures. With reference to hotness, the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined by the rule that heat flows from the hotter body to the colder.|$|E
