5|$|In 1743 the Cameronians {{established}} {{themselves as}} the Reformed Presbyterian Church, remaining largely separate from religious and political debate. Of independent churches from England that were established {{in the seventeenth century}} only the Quakers managed to endure in to the eighteenth century. Baptist chapels were re-established {{in the middle of the}} century and, although Scotland initially appeared <b>fertile</b> <b>ground</b> for Methodism, it failed to expand as quickly as elsewhere in the Great Britain and Ireland. A number of minor Scottish sects developed, such as the Bereans, Buchanites, Daleites and Glassites.|$|E
5|$|Most of Thistle's {{residents}} were railroad employees sent {{to live in}} the town, but there were some who had settled before the railroads arrived. The first Europeans were part of the Mormon migration to Utah, and the first of these was the Pace family, who migrated from Nauvoo, Illinois, reaching Thistle in 1848. Fifth-generation descendants of the Pace settlers continued to operate a family-owned cattle ranch until the town was evacuated. Other settlers included Mormons who originally settled elsewhere in Utah but subsequently arrived to homestead <b>fertile</b> <b>ground</b> on Billies Mountain, on the north wall of the canyon. Among them was the mountain's presumed namesake, William Johnson. Homesteading was practiced in Thistle until the early 1900s. Until the arrival of the railroads, the town's economy was based mainly on farming and ranching, although there was also some mining activity in the region, including a vein of asphaltum that was mined between 1892 and 1914.|$|E

He is given a vision {{which is the same}} one both he and Elika shared much earlier that shows her father's deal with Ahriman to revive her. When they shared the vision at that time she told the Prince that visions come from Ormazd, not Ahriman. The vision (just like the main debate throughout the game between Elika and the Prince was all about Destiny vs Free Will) is all about choice. The Prince re-creates the deal made by Elika's father. He destroys the four <b>Fertile</b> <b>Grounds</b> around the Temple and returns inside. He cuts down the Tree of Life and takes the light power Elika used to heal the Tree. The Prince returns the Light to Elika's body, and she returns to life. The game ends with the Prince carrying Elika across the desert while Ahriman's darkness envelops the world.|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, and {{throughout}} the 19th, Milan was an important centre for intellectual discussion and literary creativity.

In Mullá Husayn's hometown of Boshruyeh, a group of 60 active Bábís had emerged, with thousands turning out to attend Mullá Husayn's sermons or pray with him.

25|$|The Christian {{population}} is mostly composed of Roman Catholics and Protestants. Among Protestants, {{the large number}} of Lutherans and Moravians points to the German past of the country, while the number of Anglicans point to the British history of Tanganyika.

Many priests were badly educated, and spiritual Church doctrines were often disregarded. Many priests did not live in celibacy but in concubinage.
