5|$|Among other reforms was the Codex Theresianus, {{begun in}} 1752 and {{finished}} in 1766, that defined civil rights. In 1776, Austria outlawed witch burnings and torture. It was later reintroduced, but the liberal {{nature of these}} reforms remains noted. Much unlike Joseph, but {{with the support of}} religious authorities, Maria Theresa was opposed to the abolition of torture. Born and raised between Baroque and Rococo eras, she found it hard to fit into the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> only slowly followed humanitarian reforms on the continent.|$|E
5|$|In another vision Scully lies on a {{table and}} is visited by her {{deceased}} father. Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he likes the both of them, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell), Pam (Jenna Fischer), and Ryan (B. J. Novak) are {{struggling}} {{to adjust to the}} work environment of the new Michael Scott Paper Company. The office space used to be a closet; water pipes run through the room, so they can hear the toilets flush from the Dunder Mifflin bathrooms above them. Ryan openly goofs off in front of Pam and Michael and insults both of them in their presence during phone conversations. Pam and Ryan bicker over who is responsible for making copies until Michael separates them into corners. Pam, who joined the company as a saleswoman, is given the corner where the photocopier sits. She is concerned that Michael will force her to be the receptionist, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> quit Dunder Mifflin in the first place. She goes upstairs and asks Charles Miner (Idris Elba) for her job back, but Charles has already given the job to a new employee, Kelly Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who ends up going by her middle name—Erin—to avoid confusion with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling).|$|E
25|$|The third {{explanation}} {{is in the}} Fifth Doctor audio story The Chaos Pool by Peter Anghelides, which states that the creators of the Key to Time re-disguised its final segment as Romana, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> changed and why she chose Astra's form.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Betty Dodson, {{who is also}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of the}} leaders of the early 1980s pro-sex feminist movement, expressed that she considers herself a fourth wave feminist. Dodson expressed that the previous waves of feminist were banal and anti-sexual, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> has chosen to look at a new stance of feminism, fourth wave feminism. In 2014, Dodson worked with women to discover their sexual desires through masturbation. Dodson says her work has gained a fresh lease of life with a new audience of young, successful women who have never had an orgasm. This includes fourth-wave feminists - those rejecting the anti-pleasure stance they believe third-wave feminists stand for.|$|E

25|$|Murphy sold some {{properties}} {{she owned}} in San Patricio County {{and used the}} funds to purchase space on the East Side of San Antonio {{to be used as}} a school for African Americans. The lot itself was purchased on October 14, 1887 for the price of $2,800. There was opposition from residents of the area, which was at the time white only. In addition, difficult laws demanding strict segregation of white and black people obstructed progress in sourcing supplies to build the school. San Antonio already had a reputation for aggressively opposing schools for black children. However, Murphy was determined to force San Antonians to pay attention to racial issues, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> chose the white neighborhood for the school.|$|E
25|$|Like former label mate Han Geng, Zhang {{holds an}} E-6 (Entertainment industry) passport, for foreigners in South Korea. Foreign artists {{carrying}} out promotional activities have limitations {{in terms of}} location and other factors. Han's passport only allowed him to work under SBS and KBS, while Zhang's allows her to work only with SBS and MBC, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> only performs on the two stages. On August 1, 2008, the South Korean government's law of restrictions on foreigners were lifted, and foreign entertainers are now allowed to perform in every station in the country. However, Zhang was unable to perform on MBC due to the channel's conflict with S.M. Entertainment. As of late 2008, MBC has removed the ban of S.M. Entertainment's artists on their channel.|$|E
25|$|Mary and Cathleen {{return home}} from their {{drive to the}} drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to {{purchase}} her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E
5000|$|Rowling has {{commented on}} her {{economic}} situation before {{the success of}} Harry Potter as being [...] "poor as {{it is possible to}} be in modern Britain, without being homeless" [...] and said that this <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> drawn to writing about poverty.|$|R

25|$|Home Life of Great Authors, {{published}} in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses {{of their home}} life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, Wordsworth, Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Poe, Eliot, Burns, De Quincey, North, Irving, Carlyle, Macaulay, Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, Bryant, Hugo, Lytton, Longfellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view {{of men and women}} well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young readers of this volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable them to know people; they need to have some personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had such a hard time {{when she was a girl}} getting any picture in her mind of the great people about whom she read, that she determined to make it easier for other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> wrote The Home Life of Great Authors.|$|E
500|$|Sable {{went on with}} Bass making Bass do all of her dirty work. Sable {{continued}} to hold the championship for almost six months, but on May 10, 1999, Debra [...] "won" [...] the Women's Championship from Sable in an Evening Gown match. Normally in an Evening Gown match, the winner is the woman who forcibly removes her opponent's dress, which Sable did. As part of the storyline, WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, ruled that {{the woman who had}} lost her dress was the winner, making Debra the new Women's Champion. [...] Off-screen, Sable was in a dispute with the WWF, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was stripped of the title on-screen. Sable at this time was also very unpopular backstage, to the extent that Sean Waltman has since admitted to playing a nasty practical joke on her last day with the WWF.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{producers}} of House, Stacy was brought into the show to give viewers some insight into House. The writers chose to start off Stacy's story arc [...] "very subtly", but to end it with a [...] "big blowout". Shore explained that he wanted Ward for the part {{because it was the}} first person the writing staff of House came up with, adding that she acts in a [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "convincing way". Initially, Ward was not interested in portraying the character, because, after the cancellation of Once and Again, she wanted to spend more time with her kids, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> had also turned down earlier roles on [...] and Desperate Housewives. However, she changed her mind when she saw tapes of the show, because as she watched she realized that House [...] "would be fun to be a part of".|$|E

500|$|One night, {{when the}} trio is almost at Duloc, Fiona shelters in a windmill. Donkey hears strange noises {{from within and}} investigates, finding Fiona {{transformed}} into an ogre. She explains that she was cursed during childhood to transform every night, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was locked away, and that only her true love's kiss will return her to her [...] "love's true form". Meanwhile Shrek, about to confess his feelings for Fiona, partly overhears them, and is heartbroken as he mistakes her disgust with her transformation to an [...] "ugly beast" [...] as disgust with him. At Donkey's suggestion, Fiona vows to tell Shrek about her curse, but dawn breaks before she can, and she turns back into a human. She finds that Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad to the windmill during the night. Fiona accepts Farquaad's proposal, requesting that they be married before night falls. The couple return to Duloc, while a hurt and angry Shrek abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp.|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{released}} two {{highly successful}} albums, Mariah Carey and Emotions (1991), the singer {{had yet to}} embark on world tour because of stage-fright and the possible negative effects of singing vocally strenuous songs every night. Many critics were unconvinced with her reasoning, and accused her of manipulating her vocals in the studio. In response, Carey appeared on MTV Unplugged to perform a small selection of her songs live in 1992. For her rendition of [...] "Someday", she altered the arrangement and stripped it back {{to give it a}} rawer sound. This version was produced by Carey and Afanasieff and recorded live at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City on March 16, 1992. In the liner notes of #1 to Infinity, Carey expressed her dislike toward the original studio version on Mariah Carey and stated that she wished she could [...] "delete some of the overproduction," [...] which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> decided to include the MTV Unplugged version on the compilation instead. In addition to MTV Unplugged, the song was included on the set-list of Carey's Las Vegas residency show, Number 1 to Infinity (2015–17).|$|E
500|$|Shelley's stated aim in Rambles is {{to raise}} {{awareness}} of the political situation in Italy and to convince readers to aid the revolutionaries in their fight for independence. She addresses her readers as English citizens, arguing that they in particular [...] "ought to sympathise in [...] struggles; for the aspiration for free institutions all over the world has its source in England". On a general level, she articulates an [...] "opposition to monarchical government, disapproval of class distinction, abhorrence of slavery and war and their concomitant cruelties" [...] similar to that in her historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830). The central theme of the second journey is [...] "the tyranny of Austrian and French imperialism, and the abuses of papal and priestly authority". The solution to Italy's problems, according to Shelley, is neither [...] "subjugation" [...] nor [...] "revolution" [...] but rather [...] "peaceful mediation". Ultimately, it is the lessons learned from history that Shelley feels are the most important, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> compares the past and present. Rambles articulates the [...] "Whiggish ideology of political gradualism", and is similar to Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) in that it argues that [...] "a reformation of culture is necessary to reform oppressive and degrading power relations".|$|E
50|$|Before its {{inclusion}} on The Essential Cyndi Lauper in 2003, {{the song}} {{did not appear}} on any of Lauper's albums or the 1994 compilation Twelve Deadly Cyns...and Then Some.

500|$|After this point, {{the story}} {{continues}} differently {{depending on the}} Hero's alignment. If it is [...] "law", the Law Hero gets killed in a battle with the Chaos Hero, while the Hero and the Heroine go to the basement. On their way they have to kill the Chaos Hero and fight Yuriko, who {{turns out to be}} the demon Lilith in disguise; she calls the Hero [...] "Adam", and says she wanted to create a new age and live with him forever, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> tried to execute the Heroine. After defeating her in battle, the Hero and the Heroine reach the basement and kill the demon Asura-ou; they then go to the cathedral's roof, where they are thanked by a messenger from God. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "chaos", he and the Heroine must go to the top floor and kill the archangel Michael, and on their way kill the Law Hero; the Chaos Hero dies, too, because of the magical ring he has been wearing. On the roof, they meet Lucifer, who says that a new era will begin, where both demons and humans are free; he also warns them that God still is alive. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "neutral", he and the Heroine must kill the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, Asura-ou, and Michael, and fight Yuriko. On the roof, they meet Taishang Laojun, who thanks them and says that balance is needed to achieve happiness; he asks the Hero and the Heroine to lead humanity to a future that doesn't rely on gods or demons. The game ends with the Heroine saying that those who have died will be reborn, and that it is time for creation and rebuilding.|$|E
2500|$|She hates {{anything}} {{cold and}} wet, even snow, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> initially hated {{to live in}} Forks.

As a vampire, she also dislikes the idea of feeding on humans, but is glad to have found the strength she needed to protect her loved ones.|$|E
