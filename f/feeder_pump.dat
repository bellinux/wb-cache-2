50|$|Later {{in their}} career nine {{locomotives}} (350-358) received tenders from HSM 600 series locomotives (601-605 and 609-612) when these units entered service in 1895 and 1896. These new tenders had larger water and coal capacity {{and were more}} suitable for fast-train service. Numbers 1614, 1633, 1636, 1636 and 1646 did get a superheater installed in 1921. Due to poor results, the planned application to the other units was cancelled. The locomotives were withdrawn from service starting from 1936 to 1949. Unit 1614, withdrawn from service in 1938, was used a stationary boiler in Zwolle. In 1940, the locomotive re-entered service, with its superheater elements being shorted.

Calibrating these pumps helps control and optimize feeding rates, which in turn provides better water quality at a lower cost. This Tech Brief discusses how to calibrate liquid feed pumps. By Zane Satterfield, P. E., NESC Engineering Scientist What is a liquid feed pump? A liquid feed pump is a mechanical device that injects a chemical solution into a water-line, tank, or well. These pumps are used at various points in the treatment process, including adding coagulants and disinfec-tants. Because water treatment requires specific amounts of these chemicals, {{it is important that}} the <b>feeder</b> <b>pumps</b> be correctly calibrated so the doses are precise...|$|R

25|$|On June 20, 2009, {{a filter}} pump on Bahari River malfunctioned, sending twenty-four guests and {{employees}} to the hospital. At 6:25 pm, the pump, which was turned off at the time, was turned back on. The pump surged, forcing a stronger than usual concentration of liquid bleach and hydrochloric acid into the water. Twenty-four people, including park staff and medical personnel, complained of troubled breathing and nausea. They were given oxygen at the park before being transported to Jasper Memorial Hospital for treatment. All were treated and released that evening.

50|$|Mussels are filter <b>feeders</b> that <b>pump</b> {{water through}} their siphons to collect food {{particles}} from the water. They gather essential nutrients and remove unwanted toxins from the water. Depending on the state, many organizations and conservationists, are making attempts {{to recover the}} pink mucket. Protection {{and management of the}} pink mucket is clearly related to managing the habitat and the water quality of the large rivers it depends upon. For instance, some landowners report mussel poaching by calling their local conservation agents. Others have already taken steps to recover the pink mucket. The state of Kentucky, where the pink mucket is endangered, has created the Kentucky’s Wildlife Action Plan. This plan was developed by the state to help create priority conservation actions for the aquatic and wildlife that have become threatened and endangered species. In July 2007, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources reared pink mucket mussels at the Center for Mollusk Conservation and released eleven hundred pink muckets in the Green River. The state will continue to work on the endangered species for the next several years in order to increase and even augment the current populations of mussels. The states of Tennessee and Alabama have designated mussel sanctuaries in parts of the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers and have also successfully reproduced populations at these locations. The recovery of the pink mucket is expected to improve over the years.|$|R
40|$|The "VacuSIP ” is a {{simplification}} of the SIP system {{developed by}} Yahel et al. (2007), {{and it is}} considerably cheaper and adapted for SCUBA base work. The system was originally designed after Wright and Stephens (1978) and Riisgård (1991) for direct in situ sampling of the rates and efficiencies by which suspension feeders remove (or discharge) substances from (to) the water they filter. Nevertheless, VacuSIPs can be used wherever a controlled and clean, point-source water sample is required. A simple valve operation or needle piercing by a SCUBA diver allows the external water pressure to force the sampled water into an evacuated sample container. The small ID of the tubing (usually 20 - 50 μm PEEK) insures controlled suction rate during the sampling (see below) and a negligible dead volume. Fig. 1. A pair of VacuSIPs is used for simultaneous sampling of the water inhaled and exhaled by a solitary ascidian (Micrcosmus exasperatus). East Mediterranean, 10 m depth.

40|$|The HIsarna is a coal-based {{smelting}} reduction process for ironmaking to drastically reduce CO 2 emission {{and is one}} of the most promising alternative ironmaking processes under development in the world. The furnace consists of two inter-connected reactors: i) a smelting cyclone, ii) a {{smelting reduction}} vessel. The smelting cyclone is expected to provide about 20 % pre-reduction degree through thermal decomposition and reduction. However, as a new technology still at its development stage, the iron ore behaviour in the smelting cyclone is not well studied. Three HIsarna pilot plant campaigns have been conducted successfully during the years of 2011 - 2013 at the Tata Steel site in IJmuiden, the Netherlands. The laboratory study has been carried out in the same period at Delft University of Technology as part of the research programme of the Matrials innovation institute M 2 i, to focus on the thermal decomposition and reduction kinetics of individual particles in the smelting cyclone of the HIsarna, forming the main part of this thesis. In this study, a special experimental set-up has been designed and commissioned: the high temperature drop tube furnace (HTDF). The HTDF was used to investigate the reduction mechanism at high temperature of individual ore particles without agglomeration. The reaction gas is a mixture of CO, CO 2, H 2 and N 2, and the composition is controlled with mass flow controllers. The gases are firstly guided into a gas mixing station and form a flow of gas mixture. And then the gas mixture is split up into two flows. A small flow of the gas mixture enters the syringe <b>pump</b> <b>feeder</b> as particle carrier gas. The other flow is preheated to 773 K through a pre-heat furnace before entering the electrically heated furnace. The particle feed rate is controlled by a syringe <b>pump</b> <b>feeder.</b> The individual iron ore particles from the syringe <b>pump</b> <b>feeder</b> pass through a water-cooled injection probe before entering the hot zone. The iron ore reduction takes place during the flying time of the particle in the hot zone. The off-gas and the partially reduced particles are received by a water-cooled sampling probe. Finally, the iron ore particles are collected by a sample collector. The study of the thermal decomposition behaviour of hematite ore started with a theoretical evaluation. The experimental study has been conducted with the TGA-DSC analyser and in a high temperature horizontal furnace at a steady state. The individual particle thermal decomposition behaviour has been investigated in the HDTF under different conditions. The theoretical evaluation shows that, in the inert gas environment, the lowest start thermal decomposition temperature of Fe 2 O 3 could be room temperature when the partial pressure of oxygen is close to zero bar. The thermal decomposition of Fe 2 O 3 can be accelerated when the temperature is higher than 1473 K. The thermal decomposition of pure Fe 3 O 4 can also take place at room temperature when the partial pressure of oxygen is close to zero bar and the thermal decomposition can be accelerated when the temperature is higher than 1673 K. These results have been confirmed by the following experimental studies. From the TGA-DSC analysis, it was found that a sharp weight loss in a short time appears on the TG curve. However, the weight loss is quite small during the time elapsed after the sharp weight loss stage. The experimental study in the horizontal furnace provided accurate results of the thermal decomposition degree of hematite ore at different temperatures and holding times by chemical titration. The thermal decomposition degree of iron ore increases with the increase of temperature. At the same temperature, the thermal decomposition degree of iron ore increases slowly with the increase of holding time (1 h, 2 h and 3 h). In addition, no significant difference was observed between the results at 1673 K and 1773 K. Furthermore, whether the sharp weight loss stage occurs and how much of the thermal decomposition degree could be achieved in the smelting cyclone has been further tested with the HTDF. The effects of different inert gases: N 2, Ar, CO 2 (CO 2 is the primary gas in the pilot plant besides CO), temperature, residence time, and particle size on the final thermal decomposition degree were studied. It was found that the sharp weight loss stage observed in the TGA-DSC experiments can be mostly achieved in the HTDF in the CO 2 gas rather than N 2 and Ar. For example, at 1750 K in CO 2 gas, the thermal decomposition degree of iron ore in the HTDF is around 10. 8 % which is slightly lower than the value of 12. 6 % obtained in the horizontal furnace. This is because the fine iron ore particles could be heated up faster in CO 2 gas than in N 2 and Ar gas due to the strong radiation properties (emission and absorption) of CO 2 gas. Temperature plays an important role in determining the iron ore thermal decomposition which dramatically goes up with the increase of temperature. However, there is no significant influence of particle size and residence time on the thermal decomposition degree observed, when the particle diameter is smaller than 250 µm. It indicates that the thermal decomposition of iron ore quickly takes place in the first 210 ms. Based on the results of thermal decomposition of iron ore particles, the individual particle reduction mechanism of hematite ore in the smelting cyclone has been investigated with the HTDF. Under the studied experimental conditions, the maximum reduction degree of iron ore particle is in the range of 23 - 30 %. Before reaching the reduction equilibrium state, the reduction degree of iron ore goes up with the increase of residence time and temperature, and decreases with the increase of Post Combustion Ratio (CO 2 + H 2 O) /(CO + CO 2 + H 2 + H 2 O). The gas-solid particle reaction takes place in all the studied residence times at 1550 K and 1600 K, and at 1650 K in the residence times of 210 - 970 ms. The 100 % gas-molten particle reduction takes place at 1700 K in the residence times of 700 - 2020 ms and in all the studied residence times at 1750 K. The reduction degree of iron ore in the first 210 ms is the combined result of reduction and thermal decomposition. During the reduction process, quantities of micro pores were formed due to the different crystal structures of hematite, magnetite and w?stite. The micro pores could accelerate the reduction process. The reaction mechanism of iron ore reduction at high temperature has been revealed through the kinetic analysis. The kinetic model was determined by microscopic examination. The unreacted shrinking core model was applied to both gas-solid particle reaction and gas-molten particle reaction. The rate controlling step of gas-solid particle reduction was obtained by the model-fitting method and confirmed by the model-free method, and the rate controlling step of gas-molten particle reduction and mixed reduction was obtained by the model-fitting method. The reaction rate controlling step was found to be the chemical control for gas-solid particle reduction, mixed reduction and gas-molten particle reduction from a macrokinetics point of view. Through further study, the rate controlling step of gas-solid particle reduction was found to be mass transport of cations and electrons inside the matrix along the interfaces from a microkinetics point of view. The most typical operating conditions of the smelting cyclone of the HIsarna process have been studied in this study and the fundamental understanding of the reduction kinetics of the individual iron ore particle is presented in this thesis. At the same time, new questions about the reactions and the reactor systems have been raised like the reduction mechanism of bigger particle size, reduction behaviour of ‘particle swarms’, the particles’ collision behaviour and so on. The further laboratory study seems significant for future development of the HIsarna process. Materials Science & EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
