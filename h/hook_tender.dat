5000|$|The {{division}} of labor in lumber camps led to several specialized jobs on logging crews, such as whistle punk, chaser, and high climber. [...] The whistle punk's job was to sound a whistle (usually at the Steam donkey) as {{a signal to the}} yarder operator controlling the movement of logs. He also had to act as a safety lookout. A good whistle punk had to be alert and think fast as the safety of the others depended on him. The high climber (also known as a tree topper) used iron climbing hooks and rope to ascend a tall tree in the landing area of the logging site, where he would chop off limbs as he climbed, chop {{off the top of the}} tree, and finally attach pulleys and rigging to the tree so it could be used as a spar so logs could be skidded into the landing. High climbers and whistle punks were both phased out in the 1960s to early 1970's when portable steel towers replaced spar trees and radio equipment replaced steam whistles for communication. The choker setters attached steel cables (or chokers) to downed logs so they could be dragged into the landing by the yarder. The chasers removed the chokers once the logs were at the landing. Choker setters and chasers were often entry-level positions on logging crews, with more experienced loggers seeking to move up to more skill-intensive positions such as yarder operator and high climber, or supervisory positions such as <b>hook</b> <b>tender.</b> Despite the common perception that all loggers cut trees, the actual felling and bucking of trees were also specialized job positions done by fallers and buckers. Faller and bucker were once two separate job titles but are now combined.|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{consists}} of two interrelated projects. The first analyzes legal and aesthetic testimony in Atom Egoyan’s film The Sweet Hereafter. “But From My Lie This Did Come True” is an extended meditation on falling: literal accident, communal loss, ethical lapse, and imagistic and linguistic vertigo. Falling is this film’s instigating event, but falling is also a figure for trauma, and its capacity to make reference itself fall. By definition, a trauma exceeds our ability to contain and communicate what we have witnessed or survived. How then can {{it be possible to}} testify to a traumatic event and its effects? In dialogue with Paul de Man, Jean Luc Nancy, Sigmund Freud, and Cathy Caruth, I argue that The Sweet Hereafter reveals how one fall can powerfully reference another. My aim is not simply to apply theory to a film, but also to explore how the film reconfigures the theory. Just as Egoyan’s work adapts a novel to the cinema, my project adapts film to the essay form. The second part of my thesis excerpts <b>Hook</b> <b>Tender,</b> a novel inspired by archival research and oral history, including travels to BC logging camps and Canada’s Arctic. <b>Hook</b> <b>Tender</b> explores falling through the actual labour and visceral experience of felling trees. Set in an immigrant logging camp on Canada’s West Coast, the narrative also dramatizes falling in the ethical and psychological dimensions addressed in my essay. An accidental fall causes Eva to lose a child through still birth, and this loss instigates an emotional crisis and moral lapse as she begins an adulterous involvement with Charlie, an Inuit logger who communicates injustices survived by Indigenous communities. So both sections of my thesis offer a sustained reflection on falling: its broken narratives, questionable bearing of testimony, and the incalculable power of its emotional charge. ...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{managers}} {{in recent years}} have begun to re-examine the possibilities of using uneven-age silvicultural systems in the Oregon Coast Range. This increasing interest is being driven by a variety of forest resource nianagement concerns, including wildlife habitat diversity, visual aesthetics, and long-term sustained yield. In an effort to begin systematic exploration of coastal uneven-age silvicultural techniques, Oregon State University (OStJ) researchers have established a demonstration site at Forest Peak on OSU's Dunn Forest. This case study involving a single treatment at a single site reports on the design, performance, and cost of the skyline logging operation during Septeither and October 1992 which was designed to achieve the goals of an uneven-age management prescription prepared by OSU silvicultural and wildlife specialists. The operation harvested 13. 9 MBF of 23 -inch average dbh Douglas-fir and grand fir timber. The study tracked the time spent in planning and laying out the logging system. Field and office planning and layout procedures took 93. 75 hours to conplete at a cost of 6. 47 /MBF. The project also involved detailed time studies and shiftlevel analyses of both the felling/bucking and the yarding phases of the logging operation. A two-nan felling crew produced 6. 44 MBF/Hr at a cost of 1 O. 44 /MBF. Cutting cycle time averaged 9. 22 minutes per tree, with nixnther of logs per tree, cutting method (wedges or no wedges), percent ground slope, and base dianeter the most influential factors affecting cutting cycle time. The six-man yarding crew using a Thunderbird TTY 5 O yarder and small Danebo MSP carriage yarded 4. 7 MBF/Hr at a cost of 58. 51 /MBF. Yarding cycle time averaged 5. 73 minutes per turn, with corridor yarding distance, lateral yarding distance, choker setting method (pre-set or hot-set), and number of logs per turn the most influential factors affecting yrding cycle time. The six-man crew plus the <b>hook</b> <b>tender</b> averaged 1. 82 hours for each change of yarding corridors. Corridor changes involved moving all rigging from one corridor to the next and repositioning the yarder if necessary. The <b>hook</b> <b>tender</b> alone spent an additional 1. 31 hours per corridor pre-rigging tail trees, anchors, etc. Total logging cost including planning and layout, felling and bucking, yarding, loading, and equipment move-in was 104. 03 /MBF...|$|E

Clark burnishes her first collection, Stray Home, with {{exquisite}} understatement and formal control.

Stray Home cuts deeply to discover the buried emotions and insights universal to all suffering and compassionate human beings. “Clark is able to imbue our small, usually overlooked moments with unexpected grandeur. A quiet humor is employed in service of her twin gifts, imagination and metaphor. This is an accomplished, deft, and important debut. ”—Beth Ann Fennelly, author of <b>Tender</b> <b>Hooks</b> and judg...|$|R
