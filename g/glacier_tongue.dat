5|$|The Aurora {{arrived at}} Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east {{along the coast}} {{as far as the}} Mertz <b>Glacier</b> <b>tongue,</b> searching for the party. Finding no sign and {{reaching}} the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the Aurora was recalled by wireless radio, but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh's party, {{which left}} the ship {{on the morning}} of 3 January, {{consisted}} of Mackintosh and three sailors, with a sledge containing supplies and a large mailbag. Two sailors quickly returned to the ship, while Mackintosh and one companion went forward. They camped on the ice that evening, only to find next day that the whole area around them had broken up. After a desperate dash over the moving floes, they managed to reach a small <b>glacier</b> <b>tongue.</b> They camped there, and waited for several days for their snow-blindness to subside. When their vision returned, they found that Cape Royds was in sight but inaccessible, as the sea-ice leading to it had gone, leaving a stretch of open water. They {{had little choice but to}} make for the hut by land, a dangerous undertaking without appropriate equipment and experience.|$|E
500|$|Stenhouse first {{attempted}} to anchor the ship {{on the north}} side of <b>Glacier</b> <b>Tongue</b> itself. Disaster was only narrowly avoided when a change in the wind direction threatened to imprison Aurora between the Tongue and the advancing pack ice. With other options considered and rejected, Stenhouse finally decided to anchor at Cape Evans, site of Captain Scott's 1911 Terra Nova headquarters, some six nautical miles (11km) north of <b>Glacier</b> <b>Tongue.</b> On 14 March, after numerous failed attempts, Stenhouse manoeuvred Aurora into position, stern-first towards the shore at Cape Evans, where two large anchors had been sunk and cemented into the ground. Cables and hawsers, together with a heavy chain, attached these to the ship's stern. Two bower anchors were also dropped. By 14 March the ship was settling into the shore ice with, according to second officer Leslie Thompson, [...] "enough hawsers and anchors to hold a battleship".|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the above, all {{concluded}} that the only plausible sequence of events is that increased thinning of the terminus regions, of marine-terminating outlet glaciers, ungrounded the <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> and subsequently allowed acceleration, retreat and further thinning.|$|R
40|$|Multitemporal space imagery from 1962 (Corona KH- 4), 1992 (Landsat TM), 2001 and 2005 (Terra ASTER) {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the glacier changes in the Khumbu Himal, Nepal. The ice coverage in the investigation area decreased by about 5 % between 1962 and 2005, with the highest retreat rates occurring between 1992 and 2001. The debris coverage increased concomitantly with the decrease in total glacier area. The clean-ice area decreased by > 10 %. Digital terrain model (DTM) generation from the early Corona KH- 4 stereo data in this high-relief terrain is time-consuming, and the results still contain some elevation errors. However, these are minor in the snow-free areas with gentle slopes. Thus comparison of the surfaces of the debris-covered <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> based on the Corona DTM and an ASTER DTM is feasible and shows the downwasting of the debris-covered glaciers. The highest downwasting rates, more than 20 m (> 0. 5 ma− 1), can be found near the transition zone between the active and the stagnant glacier parts of the debris-covered <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues.</b> The downwasting is lower, but still evident, in the active ice areas and at the snout with thick debris cover. All investigated debriscovered glaciers {{in the study area}} show similar behaviour. The estimated volume loss for the investigated debris-covered <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> is 0. 19 km 3...|$|R
50|$|Ice loss {{may have}} {{internal}} feedback processes, as melting of ice over land can cause eustatic sea level rise, potentially causing instability of ice shelves and inundating coastal ice masses, such as <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues.</b> Further, a potential feedback cycle exists due to earthquakes caused by isostatic rebound further destabilising ice shelves, glaciers and ice caps.|$|R
500|$|Overall, glaciers in the Greater Himalayan {{region that}} have been studied are {{retreating}} an average of between [...] annually. The only region in the Greater Himalaya that has seen glacial advances is in the Karakoram Range and only in the highest elevation glaciers, but this has been attributed possibly increased precipitation {{as well as to}} the correlating glacial surges, where the <b>glacier</b> <b>tongue</b> advances due to pressure build up from snow and ice accumulation further up the glacier. Between the years 1997 and 2001, [...] long Biafo Glacier thickened [...] mid-glacier, however it did not advance.|$|E
500|$|When Mackintosh {{departed}} on 25 January 1915 to {{lead the}} depot-laying parties he left the Aurora {{under the command of}} First Officer Joseph Stenhouse. The priority task for Stenhouse was to find a winter anchorage in accordance with Shackleton's instructions not to attempt to anchor south of the <b>Glacier</b> <b>Tongue,</b> an icy protrusion [...] midway between Cape Evans and Hut Point. This search proved a long and hazardous process. [...] Stenhouse manoeuvred in the Sound for several weeks before eventually deciding to winter close to the Cape Evans shore headquarters. [...] After a final visit to Hut Point on 11 March to pick up four early returners from the depot-laying parties, he brought the ship to Cape Evans and made it fast with anchors and hawsers, thereafter allowing it to become frozen into the shore ice.|$|E
500|$|The {{only known}} safe winter {{anchorage}} in McMurdo Sound was Scott's original Discovery Expedition headquarters from 1901–03, at Hut Point, {{south of the}} projection known as <b>Glacier</b> <b>Tongue</b> which divided the Sound into two sectors. However, Scott's ship had been frozen in the ice for two years, and had needed two rescue ships and several explosive charges to release her. Shackleton was determined to avoid this, and had given Mackintosh [...] instructions, relayed to Stenhouse, to winter Aurora north of the Tongue. No ship had previously wintered in the exposed northern section of the Sound, and the wisdom of doing this was questioned by the experienced seamen Ernest Joyce and James Paton in their private journals. After the expedition was over, John King Davis, who was to lead the Ross Sea party relief mission, wrote that Shackleton's instruction should have been ignored and that Stenhouse should have taken Aurora {{to the safety of}} Hut Point, even at the risk of becoming frozen in.|$|E
5000|$|At 2102 km2, {{it is one}} of {{the largest}} {{national}} parks in Norway. It is also one of the most varied, since it includes both alpine mountain formations with <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues,</b> as well as gently sloping mountain plateaus and forested valleys. The national park encompasses parts of the Saltfjellet mountain range. The Svartisen glacier is a central part of the park. There are also many Sami cultural landmarks within the park.|$|R
50|$|Very {{few large}} lakes are {{found within the}} body of the Alps, but a number are {{situated}} around the edge, particularly in areas formerly covered by <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues.</b> These include Lake Geneva on the northern side of the alps, on the French/Swiss border, Lago Maggiore, Lake Como and Lake Garda on the southern side of the Alps in Italy, and the lakes of Switzerland, southern Germany and the Austrian Salzkammergut in the north.|$|R

500|$|Their food worries {{were now}} resolved, {{but they still}} {{had to get back}} to Hut Point before 1 March deadline. The final leg of their march was {{interrupted}} by a blizzard, which held them in camp for 24hours. On 27 February, when they were still [...] from safety, Marshall collapsed. Shackleton then decided that he and Wild would make a dash for Hut Point in hopes of finding the ship and holding her until the other two could be rescued. They reached the hut late on 28 February. Hoping that the ship was nearby, they sought to attract its attention by setting fire to a small wooden hut used for magnetic observations. Shortly afterwards Nimrod, which had been anchored at the <b>Glacier</b> <b>Tongue,</b> came into view: [...] "No happier sight ever met the eyes of man", wrote Wild later. It was a further three days before Adams and Marshall could be picked up from the Barrier, but by 4 March the whole southern party was aboard and Shackleton was able to order full steam towards the north.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two ships}} slowly sailed to the West, {{skirting}} walls of ice, and on 22 January, just before 9 in the evening, {{some members of}} the crew disembarked on the north-westernmost and highest islet of the rocky group of Dumoulin Islands, at 500–600 m from the icy coast of the Astrolabe <b>Glacier</b> <b>Tongue</b> of the time, today about 4km north from the glacier extremity near Cape Geodesie, and hoisted the French tricolour. [...] Dumont named the archipelago Pointe Géologie and the land beyond, Terre Adélie [...] The map of the coast drawn under sail by the hydrographer [...] is remarkably accurate given the means of the time.|$|E

50|$|A further {{prerequisite}} for glaciers extending into to the Alpine foreland are high mountains. East of the Salzach, <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> hardly reached {{the edge of}} the Alps, because the mountains of the Low Tauern, unlike those of the High Tauern did not produce enough ice. So the alpentore were found mainly in the Bavarian Alpine Foreland. One of the few examples at the southern edge of the Alps was the comparatively small alpentor of today's Tagliamento valley.|$|R

30|$|Earthquakes often {{compromise}} {{the stability of}} glaciers and moraine dams. But they also damage the geotechnical stability of rocks and generate loose materials on valley floors and sides, providing the material source for GLOF mudslide formations. The steep slopes of <b>glaciers</b> and <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> contribute to ice body advances and collapses, causing surges and potentially destroying moraine dams. Narrow terminal moraine dam crests and their low stability, high lateral moraine ridges and slopes, and large longitudinal slopes of downstream valleys are also important terrain conditions {{for the formation of}} GLOFs or debris flows.|$|R
40|$|Antarctica is {{surrounded}} by a variety of large, medium and small sized ice shelves, <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> and coastal areas without offshore floating ice masses. We used the mosaic of the Radarsat- 1 Antarctica Mapping Project (RAMP) Antarctic Mapping Mission 1 (AMM) to classify the coastline of Antarctica in terms of surface structure patterns close to the calving front. With the aid of an automated edge detection method, complemented by manual control, the surface structures of all ice shelves and <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> around Antarctica were mapped. We found dense and less dense patterns of surface structures unevenly distributed over the ice shelves and ice tongues. Dense surface patterns are frequent on fast flowing ice masses (ice streams), whereas most ice shelves show a dense surface pattern only close to the grounding line. Flow line analyses on ten ice shelves reveal that the time of residence of the ice along a flow path and—associated with it—the healing of surface crevasses can explain the different surface structure distribution close to the grounding line and the calving front on many ice shelves. Based on the surface structures relative to the calving front within a 15 km-wide seaward strip, the ice shelf fronts can be separated into three classes. The resulting map of the classified calving fronts around Antarctica and their description provide a detailed picture of crevasse formation and the observed dominant iceberg shapes...|$|R
40|$|The {{multipart}} Riffeltal rock glacier, {{located in}} a tributary valley of the Kaunertal, Tyrol, Austria is investigated to enlarge the knowledge about spatial and temporal development of rock glaciers in and {{at the margins of}} pro-glacial areas and to get a better understanding of glacier–rock glacier interactions. The subject of interest consists of a complex system of two adjacent rock <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> and various superposed lobes with differing ages, origin and root zones, and therefore diverse development. To determine the reasons for their diverging development, the internal structure and permafrost occurrence on and in the surrounding area of the rock glacier were studied by application of geomorphological mapping, geophysical methods and measurement of the basal temperature of the winter snow cover (BTS). Permafrost modelling was performed on the basis of BTS data and land surface parameters derived from a high resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) digital elevation model (DEM). Additionally, the ALS data were used to measure vertical and horizontal changes of the rock glacier surface between 2006 and 2012. Glacier–rock glacier interactions during and since the Little Ice Age (LIA) are evident {{for the development of the}} studied rock glacier. A geomorphic map gives important information about the connection between glacial advance or retreat and permafrost or ground ice occurrence.

40|$|The glacier {{coverage}} in the Caucasus Mountains underwent considerable changes during the last decades. In some regions, the observed reduction in glacier area is comparable {{to those in the}} European Alps and the extent of supra-glacial debris increased on many glaciers. Only a few glaciers in the Caucasus are monitored on a regular basis, while for most areas no continuous field measurements are available. In this study, regional differences of the conditions for glacier melt with a special focus on debris covered <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> in the well-studied Adyl-su basin on the northern slope of the Caucasus Mountains (Russia) is compared with the Zopkhito basin which has similar characteristics but is located on the southern slope in Georgia. The paper focuses on the effect of supra-glacial debris cover on glacier summer melt. There are systematic differences in the distribution and increase of the debris cover on the glaciers of the two basins. In the Adyl-su basin an extensive debris cover on the <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> is common, however, only those <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> that are positioned at the lowest elevations in the Zopkhito basin show a considerable extent of supra-glacial debris. The observed increase in debris cover is considerably stronger in the north. Field experiments show that thermal resistance of the debris cover in both basins is somewhat higher than in other glaciated regions of the world, {{but there is also a}} significant difference between the two regions. A simple ablation model accounting for the effect of debris cover on ice melt shows that melt rates are considerably higher in the northern basin despite a wider debris distribution. This difference between the two regions can be attributed to different meteorological conditions which are characterised by more frequent cloud cover and precipitation in the south. Furthermore ablation is strongly influenced by the occurrence of supra-glacial debris cover in both basins, reducing the total amount of melt on the studied glaciers by about 25 %. This effect mitigates glacier retreat in the lower sectors of the ablation zones considerably. The sensitivity to moderate changes in the debris cover, however, is rather small which implies only gradual changes of the melt regime due to debris cover dynamics during the near future. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{large-scale}} {{remote sensing}} {{studies have shown}} that glacier mass loss in south-eastern Tibet, specifically in the eastern Nyainqêntanglha Range exceeds the average in High Asia. However, detailed studies at individual glaciers are scarce and the drivers behind the observed changes are poorly constrained to date. Employing feature tracking techniques on TerraSAR-X data for the periods 2008 / 2009, 2012 / 2013 and 2013 / 2014 we found measurable surface velocities through to the glacier terminus positions of five debris-covered <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues.</b> This is contrary to debris-covered glaciers in other parts of High Asia, where stagnant <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> are common. Our feature tracking results for the 2013 / 2014 period suggest an average deceleration of 51 % when compared with published Landsat velocities for the period 1999 / 2003. Further, we estimated surface elevation changes for the five glaciers from recently released one arc second resolution elevation data obtained during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in 2000 and an interferometrical derived TanDEM-X elevation model for the year 2014. With an average rate of − 0. 83 ± 0. 57 m a^- 1 we confirm strong surface lowering in the region, despite the widely discussed insulation effect of debris cover. Beside the influence of thermokarst processes and delayed response times of debris-covered glaciers, we highlight that abundant monsoonal summer rainfall might contribute significantly to the pronounced negative mass balances in the study region...|$|R

40|$|The {{floating}} ice shelves and <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues</b> which fringe the Antarctic continent {{are important because}} they help buttress ice flow from the ice sheet interior. Dynamic feedbacks associated with glacier calving {{have the potential to}} reduce buttressing and subsequently increase ice flow into the ocean. However, there are few high temporal resolution studies on glacier calving, especially in East Antarctica. Here we use remote sensing to investigate monthly glacier terminus change across six marine-terminating outlet glaciers in Porpoise Bay (− 76 ° S, 128 ° E), Wilkes Land (East Antarctica), between November 2002 and March 2012. This reveals a large simultaneous calving event in January 2007, resulting in a total of ~ 2900 km 2 of ice being removed from <b>glacier</b> <b>tongues.</b> Our observations suggest that sea-ice must be removed from glacier termini for any form of calving to take place, and we link this major calving event to a rapid break-up of the multi-year sea-ice which usually occupies Porpoise Bay. Using sea-ice concentrations as a proxy for glacier calving, and by analysing available satellite imagery stretching back to 1963, we reconstruct the long-term calving activity of the largest glacier in Porpoise Bay: Holmes (West) Glacier. This reveals that its present-day velocity (~ 1450 m a− 1) is approximately 50 % faster than between 1963 and 1973 (~ 900 m a− 1). We also observed the start of a large calving event in Porpoise Bay in March 2016 that is consistent with our reconstructions of the periodicity of major calving events. These results highlight the importance of sea-ice in modulating outlet glacier calving and velocity in East Antarctica...|$|R
