40|$|The {{production}} of walnut nursery plants {{is a complex}} process, being dependent upon a range of factors that affect graft-take success and behaviour of walnut plants in the nursery. The experiment included two parts. Three different treatments {{were used in the}} heated room under controlled air temperature and humidity conditions: Treatment 1 -grafting without paraffin treatment of the scion and graft union, coupled with covering the graft with sawdust {{up to the top of}} the scion; Treatment 2 -grafting involving paraffin treatment of the scion and graft union, coupled with covering the graft with sawdust up to the top of the scion; and Treatment 3 -grafting involving paraffin treatment of the scion and graft union, coupled with covering the graft with both sawdust up to the top of the scion and polyethylene foil. The treatments were evaluated for their effect on graft-take success. Graft planting in the nursery was followed by two treatments: treatment without <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisation</b> and treatment with <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisation.</b> Under controlled conditions, treatment 3 induced a higher graft-take success as compared to the other two treatments, whereas <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisation</b> in the nursery had a positive effect on the survival, {{production of}} class 1 plants and vegetative growth of walnut plants...|$|E

40|$|Background and aims. Although <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisation</b> using liquid {{forms of}} {{phosphorus}} (P) {{is not a}} new concept, its adoption has been hindered by a limited understanding of the variability in performance of fluid forms of foliar P applied to broadacre crops. There is a need to identify how the surface structure of leaves influences the absorption and subsequent translocation of foliar-applied P in above ground plant parts. Methods. This study examined the surface properties of wheat leaves using scanning electron microscopy and measured the recovery of foliar-applied fertiliser that was labelled with either 32 P or 33 P from both the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) leaf sides into untreated plant parts. Results. We found that the adaxial leaf surface absorbed and translocated more foliar-applied P away from the treated leaf than the abaxial surface, likely related to the higher abundance of trichomes and stomata present {{on that side of the}} leaf. The recovery of the foliar-applied fertiliser varied with rate and timing of application; ranging from < 30 %to as much as 80 % of the adaxial-applied fertiliser translocated from the treated leaf into the wheat ear. Conclusions. This study demonstrated that the differences in surface morphological features between leaf sides influenced the combined absorption and subsequent translocation of foliar-applied P in the above ground plant parts. This is due to a direct effect on the foliar pathway and/or due to differences in wettability affecting both the leaf coverage and drying time of fertilisers on the leaves. Although <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisation</b> in this study contributed less than 10 % of the total P in the plant, it provided a more efficient pathway for P fertilisation than soil-applied P. C. A.

40|$|Magnesium {{deficiencies}} {{have been}} shown to be particularly dangerous to short cycled crops, both on sandy and clay soils. Such deficiencies may be corrected by <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisations,</b> but in French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) no experimental data may be found to support this hypothesis. Therefore this paper was aimed at studying the effect of foliar Mg-applications (56, 112 and 224 g ha- 1 in single application at flowering or splitted half dose at 4 -leaf stage and half at flowering) alone and with Zn (200 g ha- 1) on yield and quality of two French bean genotypes (Bronco, Cadillac). Foliar Mg-applications significantly increased pod yield and, considering the highest rate with respect to the untreated, such an increase was 78 % and 32 % for Bronco and Cadillac, respectively. Split applications were also more effective, with yield increases of 109 % and 50 % for the two genotypes. Concerning quality, foliar Mg applications showed a significant effect particularly on sugars, calcium, phosphate, sulphate and Mg contents in pods. On the other hand, a significant effect on the accumulation of nitrates was noted, especially with split applications (144 % increase vs. unfertilised) and, in some cases, an antagonistic effect on K content (10 - 20 % decrease on average). <b>Foliar</b> Mg <b>fertilisation</b> of French bean seemed to be a promising practice with reference to human health and nutrition, tough some care is needed to avoid the accumulation of nitrates in pods. Split applications seemed to be more effective, while the addition of Zn to the fertiliser mix did not give any relevant effect...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{interest}} in reducing nitrate levels in ground water has stimulated a re-examination {{of the potential}} use of foliar applications of urea on citrus trees. We examined the penetration characteristics of urea through isolated cuticles {{in relation to their}} thickness and surface wax content in citrus (Citrus paradisi Macf.) leaves using a finite dose-diffusion system. Isolated cuticles with the greatest integrity were mounted on diffusion half-cells with the inner morphological surface in contact with citrate buffer solution. 14 C-urea in citrate buffer was applied to the outer wax-rich morphological surface and the penetration of urea was monitored by repeated sampling of the receiver solution. Urea penetration through cuticles exhibited an asymptotic curve characterised by an initial lag phase of about 10 min, a quasi-linear phase of maximum penetration rate, averaging 2 % of the urea applied h– 1, occurred about 40 min after urea application, followed by a plateau phase during which the rate of penetration approached zero at 144 h. Total urea penetration averaged approx. 35 % and tended to decrease with increased cuticle weight until the cuticles were 6 months-old. Re-hydration of the urea deposit, with water, stimulated additional penetration of about 1 %; however, this was not significant. Epicuticular wax occurred as platelets that increased with leaf age. Dewaxing the cuticles significantly enhanced the maximum penetration rates by 30 % of the amount applied h– 1 and increased total penetration by 64 %. This study provides valuable details on the transport of urea through isolated cuticles which is important in fine-tuning <b>foliar</b> urea <b>fertilisation</b> in citrus trees...|$|R
40|$|Water-limited {{conditions}} in early growth stages negatively affect germination and seedling growth, often leading to suboptimal plant population and poor stand establishment. Germination and seedling growth of ten local wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes {{in response to}} induced water stress conditions and supplemental <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisation</b> with macronutrients (NPK) were investigated. In two laboratory experiments, the observed germination parameters and calculated stress indices were used as screening criteria for drought tolerance. In one glasshouse experiment, the dose and combinations of N, P, and K for foliar spray were optimised. Germination parameters viz. germination percentage, germination index, promptness index, and germination stress tolerance index declined {{in response to the}} increasing polyethylene glycol induced stress levels. Water stress conditions imposed by withholding irrigation at seedling stage reduced plant height stress tolerance index and dry matter stress tolerance index but increased root length stress tolerance index and root to shoot ratio. Based on the results of germination attributes and stress indices, Bhakkar- 02 was the most drought tolerant genotype and Shafaq- 06 was the most drought sensitive genotype among all tested genotypes. Supplemental <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisation</b> of macronutrients (N, P, and K), alone or in different combinations improved the water relations, gas exchange characteristics and nutrient contents in both contrasting genotypes, Bhakkar- 02 and Shafaq- 06. Foliar spray NPK in combination was the most effective treatment in improving plant growth under both wellwatered and water-deficit conditions. Subsequently, the best combination of foliar NPK was tested in wire house and field conditions to evaluate the most appropriate growth stage for supplemental fertilisation. In wire house experiment foliar application of NPK spray improved the water relations, gas exchange characteristics (i. e. through accumulation of soluble sugars), total free amino acid, and proline. The antioxidant activity was also improved with foliar NPK spray at anthesis stage. In field experiments foliar application of NPK in combination improved the number of grains per spikelet and 1000 -grain weight, which ultimately increased the grain yield at anthesis stage in normally irrigated plants as well as under water stress conditions at anthesis stage in both wheat genotypes. The water shortage at anthesis stage decreased the yield and its components more severely as compared to tillering stage. The drought tolerant Bhakkar- 02 performed well under water stress. So, foliar application of NPK at anthesis stage under water stress conditions gave better results as compared to tillering stage...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Leaf {{analysis}} {{is widely used}} to study the nutritional status of plants, {{based on the fact}} of there being a direct correlation between rate of growth and the nutrient levels in leaf tissue. This study was carried out on a commercial crop of Golden THB papaya, in the north of the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, to determine the spatial variability of nutrients in the petiole of leaf samples collected when carrying out sexing in a regular grid of 129 georeferenced points. Harvesting was carried out manually 270 - 365 days after transplanting. All the characteristics displayed a strong spatial dependence, the spherical and exponential semivariograms being adjusted for the data. The greatest and smallest ranges were found for the micronutrients Mn and Zn respectively. Mean productivity was considered to be low at 13. 6 Mg ha- 1. Geostatistical analysis of the data aided in the preparation of thematic maps showing the different areas of productivity and foliar application of fertiliser in the papaya. However, the largest regions in the area were displayed by those classes which included the mean value for an attribute, indicating the use of the mean values in the recommendation of <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisation,</b> with the exception of P and K...|$|E
40|$|The Wollemi pine was {{discovered}} in 1994 {{at the base of}} a deep rainforest canyon in the Wollemi National Park, southeastern Australia. Only three populations have been found, comprising less than 100 adult trees. We investigated vegetative propagation methods, focussing on rooting of cuttings with different amounts of foliar pruning, irradiance or fertiliser application, and we compared anatomy and rooting of cuttings at two different stages of stem development. We related root production to levels of photoinhibition experienced during the propagation phase, quantifying photoinhibition by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence. Maximum photochemical efficiency (FV/FM) of cuttings declined during daily stress periods, particularly after many weeks without roots in the propagation environment, but these declines did not inhibit root formation. Mean percentage of cuttings that formed roots was usually high (79. 4 â 94. 0 %). Treatments that alleviated photoinhibition, such as low irradiance or <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisation,</b> did not increase rooting percentages. Other treatments that did not alleviate photoinhibition, such as incorporation of fertiliser in the medium or no pruning, did accelerate formation of an extensive root system. Soft cuttings had a less-developed sclerenchyma ring in their cortex compared with firm cuttings, but both cutting types provided high rooting percentages. Our results showed that cuttings under mist irrigation can be prone to long periods of moderate photoinhibition and yet remain highly capable of root production...|$|E
40|$|Selenium (Se) is an {{essential}} micronutrient for human and animal health, with antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-viral properties, and wheat is a major dietary source of Se. Field trials on two soil types in South Australia showed that grain Se concentration increased progressively with applied Se, whether soil- or foliar-applied. Soil-applied Se increased grain Se concentration by 20 - to 133 -fold, and foliar by 6 - to 20 -fold. A maximal grain Se concentration of 12 mg kg- 1 was achieved, which equates to a 10 % recovery of applied Se. Grain yield and protein were not affected by applied Se ranging from 4 - 120 g ha- 1. In another trial, a relatively low rate of 30 kg ha- 1 of S applied to the soil reduced grain Se concentration by 16 %. It {{may be necessary to}} add Se to gypsum and high-S fertilisers, which are widely used in Australia, to maintain food crop Se concentrations. These trials did not reveal a significant effect of variety on grain Se concentration, perhaps because of the extreme variability in available soil Se concentration, that varied more than 100 -fold between sites. Grain yield was not affected by variety or by the application of Se, S or N. Grain protein and S, but not Se, concentrations were increased by late-applied <b>foliar</b> urea. <b>Fertilisation</b> with sodium selenate is an inexpensive, practical method to produce wheat that contains concentrations of Se high enough to provide likely health benefits to consumers, including reduced cancer risk.

40|$|Worldwide, {{many people}} are zinc (Zn) -deficient. Dietary Zn intake can be {{increased}} by producing crops with higher concentrations of Zn in their edible portions. This {{can be achieved by}} applying Zn-fertilisers to varieties with an increased ability to acquire Zn and to accumulate Zn in their edible portions. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is an important food crop and is, therefore, a target for bio-fortification with Zn. Field trials incorporating a core collection of 23 potato genotypes, performed over 4 years (2006 – 2009), indicated significant genotypic effects on tuber Zn concentration and suggested that tuber Zn concentration was influenced by environmental effects, but also found that genotype environment (G E) interactions were not significant. Tuber Zn concentrations averaged 10. 8 mg kg– 1 dry matter (DM), and the ratio between the lowest and the highest varietal tuber Zn-concentration averaged 1. 76. Tuber Zn concentrations could be increased by foliar Zn-fertilisation. Tuber yields of ‘Maris Piper’ were unaffected by foliar applications of < 1. 08 g Zn plant– 1. The relationship between tuber Zn concentration and foliar Zn application followed a saturation curve, reaching a maximum at approx. 30 mg Zn kg– 1 DM at a foliar Zn application rate of 1. 08 g plant– 1. Despite a 40 -fold increase in shoot Zn concentration compared to the unfertilised controls following <b>foliar</b> Zn <b>fertilisation</b> with 2. 16 g Zn plant– 1, only a doubling in tuber Zn concentration was observed. This suggests that the biofortification of tubers with Zn was restricted by the limited mobility of Zn in the phloem. A significant positive linear relationship between tuber Zn concentration and tuber N concentration supported the hypothesis of co-transport of Zn and N-compounds in the phloem...|$|R
40|$|Gooding, M. (2005). <b>Foliar</b> Urea <b>Fertilisation</b> and the Management of Yield and Quality in Wheat. International Fertiliser Society. The {{effects of}} urea {{solutions}} targeted at the foliage of cereals are reviewed with particular reference to {{effects on the}} yield and quality of wheat. Nitrogen from foliar urea can enter through the leaves of cereals, and if the majority does so, the adoption of foliar urea may help reduce the nitrogen losses due to denitrification, leaching and immobilisation, often associated with application of nitrogen fertilisers to the soil. However, much nitrogen from foliar urea applied at timings targeted at increasing grain yield can reach the soil, either because of poor spray interception, or because urea is washed from the leaves by rain. Foliar urea-N is at risk of loss via volatilisation, particularly if it reaches the soil, and large application of urea-N to the foliage can suppress yield if it also causes large amounts of leaf damage. Leaf damage appears more likely in conditions conducive to rapid nitrogen uptake and is associated with high urea concentrations within leaves. Urea applied to the foliage may be particularly useful at improving nitrogen uptake when the primary aim is to increase grain protein concentration. Such applications are most effective at anthesis or during milk development, and can sometimes, but not always, lead to higher recoveries of fertiliser N than applications to the soil at these times. However, although actual recoveries of urea-N in the grain may be above 50 %, apparent fertiliser recoveries are often lower than 20 %, when previous nitrogen applications are sufficient to optimise yield. The implication is that late foliar urea reduces the recovery of N from other sources. Nitrogen from late foliar urea-N appears as effective at improving loaf quality as N from earlier applications applied to the soil, but are more reliable if N:S ratios are maintained...|$|R
40|$|The {{nutritive value}} and {{wholesomeness}} of carrot are highly appreciated owing to such biologically active compounds as carotenoids, vitamin C and mineral compounds found in its roots. In 2007 - 2009, field experiments {{were performed on}} the effect of <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisation</b> of carrot with magnesium sulphate during its vegetative growth on selected nutrients (to-tal carotenoids, vitamin C, mineral magnesium). The field experiment was set up in a split-plot design with three replications on light soil, of slightly acid reaction, low in available P and K forms and very low in Mg. Magnesium was applied in rates of 0, 45 and 90 kg MgO ha– 1 by spraying carrot plants with a 3 % solution during their intensive growth in the vegetative season, accompanied by constant N, P, K fertilisation. The experiment involved five carrot cultivars: medium-late Berjo, and late Flacoro, Karotan, Koral and Perfekcja, all characterized by good storage life. The content of selected nutrients in carrot roots was determined immediately after harvest and after six-month storage in a traditional earthen mound. Foliar application of magnesium significantly increased the nutritive value of roots of the carrot cultivars after harvest, raising the content of total carotenoids, vitamin C and magnesium in edible parts. The rate of 45 kg MgO ha– 1 was most favourable. The six-month root storage led to a decrease in the biologically active compounds. The recorded loss (mean for cultivars and fertilisation) reached 20 % of carotenoids, 50 % of vitamin...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objectives}} in soil management research combine {{a number of}} issues: soil fertility, production, fruit quality, growth regulation, prevention of night frost damage, leaf decomposition (scab) and practical feasibility. This will result in different regimes of weed control, <b>fertilisation,</b> <b>foliar</b> feeding and watering for each plot. The evaluation criteria remain particularly difficult to assess. The proposed revised edition of the soil book (LF 39) is combined with the final publication of the regulation project which appeared in de winter of 2003 as a hand-book “Biologische Appels en Peren – teeltmaatregelen voor kwaliteitsfruit-” (Organic apples and pears – cultivation measures for quality fruit) (LF 75, ed. Joke Bloksma). Time after time our research shows that good crop regulation {{is the basis for}} a quality crop. This applies to all varieties, but Elstar requires special attention because of its susceptibility to biennialism. This last year lime sulphur was available for controlling scab. This enabled us to benefit from the side effects of blossom thinning. Trials are still being run internationally on new thinning agents for organic growing. To date however there is no prospect of a more efficacious agent than lime sulphur without the undesirable side effects. This begs the question of how much more energy should be spent on this research. We take the view that there are other areas to be developed which are essential to good crop regulation. There is scope for further development of an adapted pruning method which very specifically anticipates the prospects for the coming year. Pruning also seems to be important for the new variety Topaz, while we still need to ensure that we get sufficient fruit on the tree. Many trials in which we monitor flowering and bearing rates show time and again that Elstar trees with slightly excessive growth levels have much poorer flowering rates in the following year, even where there is no excessive vigour. Thus much attention still needs to be paid to growth regulation. LaMi is running a project in Utrecht province in which demonstration trials are being carried out to encourage the use of calcium hydroxide in conventional fruit growing. As advisor the LBI contributed its experience from the projects in previous years. Infection of a fruit by fungi or disease depends among other things on the resistance of the fruit. The resistance of a product to fungi, pests and diseases is a parameter for the quality of the product. The Louis Bolk Institute is attempting to develop a test for the evaluation of the natural resistance of the fruit, in which the apple can demonstrate how well or poorly a fruit rot fungus (Botrytis c.) can spread in the flesh of the fruit. The LBI has previous experience with self-disintegration tests. The problems here were the replicability and the unknown sources of infection. Fruit quality is an increasingly important aspect of fruit production. The supermarkets in particular continually raise the standards required for (external) product quality. Using organic growing methods it may not always be possible to meet the high standards for external quality. This means that the internal quality will become increasingly important. LBI is currently running 2 projects on apple quality: “Classy Apples in the Chain” (2001 - 2004) which involves monitoring and working with partners in the chain to reduce the quality gap between supply and demand and also reduce the distance between the start and end of the chain. The second project, “Parameters for Fruit Quality” (2001 - 2003) addresses more fundamental issues about suitable quality parameters for organic production. (See also 2002 report) ...|$|R
