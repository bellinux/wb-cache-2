Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, I {{want you to understand}} that it is not to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E

500|$|West {{is known}} outside umpiring as a singer–songwriter. His {{involvement}} in country music and his demeanor {{on the field}} have earned him the nickname [...] "Cowboy Joe." [...] West has described his music as [...] "two chords and the truth. ... It's simple. It tells a story." [...] In 2009, West said of his music pursuits, [...] "I was lucky. You know, the dues {{you have to pay}} to <b>get</b> <b>here</b> as an umpire are long and tedious, but the music business, because I was already in the major leagues, kind of opened a lot of doors I normally wouldn't have been able to open." ...|$|E

In the 200-meter breaststroke, Soni upset the heavily favored Jones, winning the gold medal and breaking Jones's world record {{with a time of}} 2:20.22. [...] Jones finished second with a time of 2:22.05. After the race, Soni said, [...] "It's been a long road to <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> I can't believe what just happened."

The following year, Hewson {{said that}} {{being part of}} a much larger corporation gave them research and development resources that they previously lacked and a more focused approach to marketing. She added, [...] "It took us much longer to <b>get</b> <b>here</b> than we anticipated. But we still have very big ambitions for the brand to go much farther." [...] Hewson herself has pale skin and very dark hair, wears little jewellery, and has eschewed cosmetic surgery.

He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... But when you <b>get</b> <b>here</b> to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel it in front of you and you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E
500|$|Pauline Kael of The New Yorker said [...] "The James Bond {{series has}} had its bummers, but nothing before {{in the class of}} A View to a Kill. You go to a Bond picture expecting some style or, at least, some flash, some lift; you don't expect the dumb police-car crashes you <b>get</b> <b>here.</b> You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded {{together}} and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for." [...] Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. [...] "Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)" ...|$|E
