5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> forearm seven times, while others wrap <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> upper arm an additional time before wrapping <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E

5|$|Burtt {{had visited}} Niagara Falls in 1987 {{and used his}} {{recordings}} from his trip for the sounds of wind. He ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record the sandstorm though. For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling shopping carts, Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart. They crashed <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> parking lot and then let it tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs.|$|E

5|$|Local {{residents}} have {{developed their own}} style in clothing and jewellery, using local products, such as shells. Giving somebody a shell necklace and placing <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> recipients neck is a goodwill and love gesture. They make a type of sarong, called a pareu, which is typically brightly coloured. Like the other islands of Melanesia such as Fiji and Samoa, the Cook Islanders {{are known for their}} hand-painted and silk-screened dress fabrics. An important practice among women is tivaevae, a type of quilting.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{announced}} on February 21, 2006 that New Super Mario Bros. would launch for the Nintendo DS on May 7, 2006. The game's new power-ups were also introduced {{at the same}} time, including the Blue Koopa Shell and the Mega Mushroom. Nintendo further mentioned that the game would be played in 2D but use 3D models to create a 2.5D look and feel. The May 7 release was later delayed towards May 21, but the game's release date was eventually pushed back slightly to May 15; Nintendo also planned to release <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{same time that the}} Nintendo DS Lite launched, on June 11, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the reign}} of Edward IV (r. 1461–1470, 1471–1483), monarchs {{presented}} the diseased with a gold medal known as touch piece and hung <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> subject's neck. The reverse of the medal depicted a ship, while the obverse showed the archangel Michael slaying a dragon, {{which led to the}} medal being popularly referred to as an Angel. The diseased were instructed to wear the medal constantly to ensure the success of the treatment. Not all people embraced the notion of the royal touch and miraculous medals; many were simply eager to obtain the medal, which was then sold on the market.|$|E

5|$|After {{production}} wrapped on Chalk in 1997, Moffat {{announced to}} the cast that he was marrying Vertue. When she eventually asked him for a sitcom, he decided to base <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> evolution of their own relationship. Coupling was first broadcast on BBC2 in 2000, with his wife producing for Hartswood Films. The series proved to be highly successful, running until 2004 and producing four series and twenty-eight episodes, all written by Moffat. He also wrote the original, unbroadcast pilot episode for the U.S. version, also titled Coupling, although this was less successful and was cancelled after four episodes on the NBC network. Moffat has blamed its failure on an unprecedented level of network interference.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, in {{the form}} of leaves from the willow tree, has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium {{salicylate}} with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. In {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it. In 1897, scientists at Bayer began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had named the drug Aspirin and was selling <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations.|$|E
5|$|Having {{reached the}} floor of the Hudson Valley, NY23 assumes a southeast-trending route through the town of Cairo. It comes close to the hamlet of Cairo, but {{bypasses}} it on a four-lane divided highway that takes <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> northern fringe of the community. As it runs around Cairo, the route connects to NY145 and briefly overlaps NY32, the major northsouth state route {{on the west side of}} the Hudson River. NY23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill, where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill, the county seat of Greene County. NY23 bypasses this community as well, connecting to U.S. Route9W (US9W) and NY385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.|$|E

5|$|In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated acetyl {{chloride}} with sodium salicylate to produce acetylsalicylic acid {{for the first}} time; {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis.

By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries.

5|$|In 1996 an {{exoplanet}} (47 UMa b) {{was announced}} in orbit around 47 Ursae Majoris by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. The discovery was made by observing the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum corresponding {{to changes in the}} star's radial velocity as the planet's gravity pulled <b>it</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> planet was the first long-period extrasolar planet discovered. Unlike the majority of known such planets, it has a low-eccentricity orbit. The planet is at least 2.53 times the mass of Jupiter and takes 1,078 days or 2.95 years to orbit its star. If it were to be located in the Solar System, it would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Hassinger still {{owned the}} rights to The Electric Prunes's name, and was {{encouraged}} {{by the success of}} Mass in F Minor, which prompted him to assemble a new line-up. He was steered toward the Colorado group, Climax, by Rich Fifield. Fifield had worked in fellow Colorado band, Hardwater (previously the surf rock band The Astronauts), which was managed by Poncher, and produced an album with Axelrod. The new Electric Prunes line-up included Climax members Richard Whetstone (vocals, guitar), John Herron (organ), and Mark Kincaid (guitar) with Brett Wade (bass guitar), who was recommended by The Collectors. With the group restructured, Axelrod, again, composed all the material for their next album, in the same vein as the previous effort, and centered <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Jewish prayer, Kol Nidre. The album, titled Release of an Oath, utilized several session musicians including Howard Roberts, Carol Kaye, and Earl Palmer, and saw Whetstone as the only band member to contribute to the recordings. Although the album was considered more cohesive and progressive than its predecessor, it failed to chart upon its release in November 1968. Afterwards, Axelrod returned to his past position at Capitol Records, and The Electric Prunes toured as a supporting act for bands such as Steppenwolf, Canned Heat, and New Buffalo Springfield.|$|E

5|$|One Canadian auto {{trail was}} routed through the UP as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, {{but there was}} no highway to carry <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to {{continue}} along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans-Canada Highway name.|$|E
