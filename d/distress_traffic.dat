5000|$|International {{refinements}} {{for the use}} of 500 kHz were {{specified in}} later agreements, including the 1932 Madrid Radio Conference. In later years, except for <b>distress</b> <b>traffic,</b> stations shifted to nearby [...] "working frequencies" [...] to exchange messages once contact was established. 425, 454, 468, 480, and 512 kHz were used by ships while the coast stations had their own individual working frequencies. Twice each hour, all stations operating on 500 kHz were required to maintain a strictly enforced three-minute silent period, starting at 15 and 45 minutes past the hour.As a visual memory aid, a typical clock in a ship's radio room would have the silence periods marked by shading the sectors between h+15 to h+18 and h+45 to h+48 in RED. Similar sectors between h+00 to H+03 and h+30 to h+33 are marked in GREEN which is the corresponding silence period for the 2182 kHz voice communications distress signals. In addition, during this silent period all coastal and ship stations were required to monitor the frequency, listening for any distress signals. All large ships at sea had to monitor 500 kHz at all times, either with a licensed radio operator or with equipment that automatically detected an SOS alarm signal. [...] Shore stations throughout the world operated on this frequency to exchange messages with ships and to issue warning about weather and other navigational warnings. At night, transmission ranges of 3,000-4,000 miles (4,500-6,500 kilometers) were typical. Daytime ranges were much shorter, on the order of 300-1500 miles (500-2,500 kilometers). Terman's Radio Engineering Handbook (1948) shows the maximum distance for 1 kW over salt water to be 1,500 miles, and this distance was routinely covered by ships at sea, where signals from ships and nearby coastal stations would cause congestion, covering up distant and weaker signals. During the silence, a distress signal could more easily be heard at great distances.|$|E
40|$|Transportation {{departments}} worldwide {{have usually}} allocated resources for building new infrastructures; recently, {{the focus has}} instead moved towards maintaining and preserving existing assets and allocating funding in a more effective way. Several studies have already determined that carrying out maintenance on pavements retaining high performance effectively results in savings from both cost and performance perspectives: a preventive maintenance approach. Indeed, maintenance, if applied {{at the right time}} using the right treatment, is able to extend the service life of a pavement; acting proactively on pavement deterioration therefore represents a key role for optimizing maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. Although several references discuss the advantages of a preventive maintenance approach, a very small amount of data on its short and long-term effectiveness is available. In common practice, pre-established treatments are therefore often applied regardless of the type of <b>distress,</b> <b>traffic,</b> and timing of the intervention, thus wasting resources without guaranteeing any substantial improvement in pavement performance. The present paper aims to analyze and quantify the benefits of adopting a preventive maintenance approach. A considerable amount of pavement sections were analyzed in the state of Virginia (USA) and the effectiveness of various preventive maintenance treatments was evaluated in order to quantify the extension of life provided to pavements. Post-treatment deterioration curves were developed according to the experimental data gathered. Since effectiveness of treatments was also found to be affected by traffic levels and structural capacity of pavements, several deterioration models were plotted. Research findings can be exported and generalized to be applied to a variety of pavement maintenance situations encountered by road agencies...|$|E

40|$|Research was {{performed}} to analyze {{the performance of the}} crack, seat, and overlay (CS 2 ̆ 6 O) roadway rehabilitation technique in the Central Coast and Northern regions of California. This technique was evaluated through literature review to determine the state of practice and their conclusions. California highway sections rehabilitated using CS 2 ̆ 6 O were selected for evaluation based on age and location. Pavement <b>distresses</b> and <b>traffic</b> data for these sections were collected and analyzed. Prior to beginning analysis this data was checked for errors, outliers, and omissions. The analysis consisted of checking the data for correlations among distresses and regions. The focus of this research is to develop performance prediction models for pavement distresses in CS 2 ̆ 6 O sections. Using data collected from Caltrans’ Pavement Condition Reporting Software, performance models were developed based on dependent (distress) variables: alligator cracking, transverse cracking, longitudinal cracking, and International Roughness Index (IRI). And independent (explanatory) variables: age, traffic in the form of equivalent single axle load (ESAL), thickness of hot mix asphalt (HMA), thickness of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC), and cumulative traffic in the form of cumulative ESAL. Prediction models were then analyzed for preciseness and sensitivity to the variables included in each model...|$|R
40|$|Performance that {{a railway}} should provide users, in a {{perspective}} of market competition for new passenger and freight services, requires {{the infrastructure manager}} to a particular focus on processes of rail track degradation generated by traffic during seasonal weather conditions. In particular {{the study of the}} distress evolution over time, taking into account rutting and fatigue processes in track formation, provides the indicator to forecast the service life and, therefore, to plan its maintenance. This paper deals with a method to assess the railway structural <b>distress</b> produced by <b>traffic</b> loads and to calculate maintenance work costs. In Europe, liberalization of the railway sector results in increasing traffic load due to new competitors. Depending on the forecast distress evolution in the service life and on the budget available, the maintenance plan to keep the railway infrastructure to the desired level of service may be defined. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} team recognized {{the value of}} network-level Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) testing to evaluate the structural condition trends of flexible pavements. However, practical limitations due {{to the cost of}} testing, traffic control and safety concerns and the ability to test a large network may discourage some agencies from conducting the network-level FWD testing. For this reason, the surrogate measure of the Structural Condition Index (SCI) is suggested for use. The main purpose of the research presented in this paper is to investigate data mining strategies and to develop a prediction method of the structural condition trends for network-level applications which does not require FWD testing. The {{research team}} first evaluated the existing and historical pavement condition, <b>distress,</b> ride, <b>traffic</b> and other data attributes in the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Pavement Maintenance Information System (PMIS), applied data mining strategies to the data, discovered useful patterns and knowledge for SCI value prediction, and finally provided a reasonable measure of pavement structural condition which is correlated to the SCI. To evaluate the performance of the developed prediction approach, a case study was conducted using the SCI data calculated from the FWD data collected on flexible pavements over a 5 -year period (2005 – 09) from 354 PMIS sections representing 37 pavement sections on the Texas highway system. The preliminary study results showed that the proposed approach {{can be used as a}} supportive pavement structural index in the event when FWD deflection data is not available and help pavement managers identify the timing and appropriate treatment level of preventive maintenance activities...|$|R
40|$|In {{the passing}} decades, the {{monitoring}} of pavements and passing vehicles was developed vigorously {{with the growth}} of information and sensing technology. Pavement monitoring {{is an essential part of}} pavement research and plays an important role in transportation system. At the same time, the monitoring system about the traffic, such as Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) system and traffic classification system, also attracted lots of attention because of their importance in traffic statistics and management. The monitoring system in this dissertation combines the monitoring for pavements and traffic together with the same sensing network. For pavement health monitoring purpose, the modulus of the asphalt layer can be back-calculated based on the collected mechanical responses under corresponding environmental conditions. At the same time, the actually strain and stress in pavements induced by each passing vehicle are also used for pavement <b>distress</b> prediction. For <b>traffic</b> monitoring purpose, the horizontal strain traces are analyzed with a Gaussian model to estimate the speed, wandering position, weight and classification of each passing vehicle. The whole system, including th...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the extent of {{pavement}} <b>distress</b> impact on <b>traffic</b> capacity of uninterrupted road link sections. A capacity estimation method based on extrapolation from a fundamental diagram representing the relationship between traffic flow and density was used. This method assumes that density is a result of speed and flow on sections of the road link at capacity, and hence is not directly affected by road surface distress. This implies that the capacity shifts are entirely the result of speed changes. In a 'without and with' distress study at selected sites in Nigeria, the impact of road surface distress was estimated for one direction of the road link section. Capacities of the road section were estimated for three sections ('without distress', 'transition' and 'with distress') of the road link and it was found that capacities on 'without distress' and 'with distress' sections differed significantly. The paper concludes that a significant decrease in capacity of about 30 % was found, and is attributable to road pavement distress...|$|R
40|$|Automated {{pavement}} {{performance data}} collection {{is a method}} that uses advanced technology to collect detailed road surface <b>distress</b> information at <b>traffic</b> speed. Agencies are driven to use automated survey techniques to enhance or replace their current manual distress survey because {{of the advantages of}} objective measurements, safety benefits, and reduced measurement time. As agencies move toward the transition to fully automated data collection methods, there are common concerns regarding how the output of the new method will match the current manual survey ratings and how they will be adopted into the existing Pavement Management System (PMS). This study evaluates the newly implemented automated distress survey technique and its implementation into the Nebraska Pavement Management System (NPMS). To meet the objectives, a user-friendly program was developed to convert the automated distress ratings into the current manual distress ratings format. Then, a data set that includes more than 7, 000 miles of distress data collected by the automated method was converted to the manual data format and compared to the most recent manual rating data of those sections to assess the agreement between the two data formats after the conversion process. The results show that the automated pavement survey slightly overrates bituminous pavement distresses with only a few distress types that could not be properly detected. Finally, a regression analysis of a core pavement performance indicator, NSI, was conducted to examine how the new automated performance measurement system will ultimately affect NPMS decisions if implemented into Nebraska’s pavement management system...|$|R
40|$|A {{pavement}} {{maintenance and}} rehabilitation (M&R) project normally extends over 2 - 10 mile long roadway segment. At the M&R planning stage, these projects are called pavement management sections, {{which are often}} comprised of multiple data collection sections. The fact that a management section is comprised of multiple data collection sections introduces variability into {{the condition of the}} pavement within each M&R project. Also, variability is often found in the cost of M&R projects of the same M&R type. These variability are poorly understood and qualified in the pavement management literature. Accounting for these uncertainties in pre-treatment pavement condition and in the M&R treatment cost is essential for obtaining realistic estimate of needed funding. This research addresses this knowledge gap by a) developing probability density functions for pavement pre-treatment condition indicators and M&R unit cost, and b) developing a novel probabilistic methodology for estimating M&R funding needs for pavement networks that accounts for these uncertainties. Data was obtained from the Bryan district pavement management plan for 2012 and from the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Pavement Management Information System (PMIS). Probability distribution functions were fitted for distress score, ride score, and unit cost using the @Risk software. Also, a simplified decision tree was developed to help simulate the maintenance and rehabilitation treatment selection process. This decision tree considers ride score, <b>distress</b> score, and <b>traffic</b> volume. After fitting the probability distributions of pavement condition indicators and unit cost, the impact of uncertainty in them on funding needs estimate was investigated using Monte Carlo simulation, The analysis shows that the needs estimate produced by TxDOT for the studied projects falls within the 90 percent confidence interval of the simulated need estimate...|$|R
