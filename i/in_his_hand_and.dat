5|$|In {{the last}} {{variation}} of the ayudhapurusha iconography, he/she holds the associated weapon. Common examples are the Sudarshana Chakra, the Shankha-purusha and Kaumodaki, mostly found in Uttar Pradesh and Bengal art. Sharanga with the bow <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> Nandaka with the sword as in Deogarh are other examples.|$|E
5|$|Other portraits {{include one}} by William Nicholson dating from 1814 in which Bewick sits {{with a pencil}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a dog beside his chair; the one at his birthplace; and the {{full-length}} seated portrait of 1827 by Thomas Sword Good (see above). Another painting by Sword in the National Portrait Gallery is now no longer thought to be of Bewick. An unsigned painting supposedly {{of him in the}} Yale Center for British Art is equally dubious.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E

5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
5|$|The chancel {{contains}} memorials to the Lords Stanley of Alderley. The {{memorial to}} John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley contains his effigy dressed in peer's robes lying under a canopy {{with his hand}} on a book, dated 1856 and by Richard Westmacott. On {{the other side of the}} chancel is a memorial to his son Edward Stanley, his effigy holding a scroll <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> with a dog at his feet. Engraved in brass on the side of the memorial are the figures of his widow and children. Lady Stanley is seated in the middle with their four surviving sons on her right, five surviving daughters on her left and three children who had died at a young age at her knee and on her lap. A memorial tablet to John Constantine Stanley, who died in 1878, is by Joseph Boehm. The chancel contains a monument to Rev.Edward Shipton, rector of the church from 1625 to 1630.|$|E
5|$|Alliance {{with his}} father-in-law, Władysław I the Elbow-high, King of Poland, became a {{permanent}} element of Charles's {{foreign policy in}} the 1320s. After being defeated by the united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia, WładysławI sent his son and heir, Casimir, to Visegrád in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles. During his stay in Charles's court, the nineteen-year-old Casimir seduced Claire Záh, who was a lady-in-waiting of Charles's wife, Elisabeth of Poland, according to an Italian writer. On 17April 1330, the young lady's father, Felician Záh, stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> attacked the royal family. Záh wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons, Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him. Charles's revenge was brutal: with the exception of Claire, Felician Záh's children were tortured to death; Claire's lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns; all of Felician's other relatives within the third degree of kinship (including his sons-in-law and sisters) were executed, and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual serfdom.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E
25|$|During the lockout, {{while playing}} for Modo Hockey, Forsberg had surgery after dislocating his left wrist and {{breaking}} a bone <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{because of a}} bursa sac removal.|$|E

25|$|In 1932 Mus was {{responsible}} for the Saint-Vincent war memorial. The work, modelled in clay and then cast in bronze in Milan, was of an Alpino holding a weapon <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> with a fallen comrade across his knees. No trace of this monument remains: it was melted down in 1940 when its metal was needed for the war effort.|$|E
25|$|Indra {{has many}} epithets in the Indian religions, notably Śakra (शक्र, {{powerful}} one), Vṛṣan (वृषन्, mighty), Vṛtrahan (वृत्रहन्, slayer of Vṛtra), Meghavāhana (मेघवाहन, he whose cloud is vehicle), Devarāja (देवराज, king of deities), Devendra (देवेन्द्र, {{the lord of}} deities), Surendra (सुरेन्द्र, chief of deities), Svargapati (स्वर्गपति, the lord of heaven), Vajrapāṇī (वज्रपाणि, he who has thunderbolt (Vajra) <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand)</b> <b>and</b> Vāsava (वासव, lord of Vasus).|$|E

He must know by heart the Hermetic astrological books, which are four in number. Of these, one is about {{the arrangement of the}} fixed stars that are visible; one on the positions of the sun and moon and five planets; one on the conjunctions and phases of the sun and moon; and one concerns their risings.|$|E

25|$|A warrior figure, the Bharhut Yavana, {{appeared}} prominently on a {{high relief}} on the railings of the stupa of Bharhut circa 100 BC. The warrior has the flowing head band of a Greek king, a northern tunic with Hellenistic pleats, he hold a grape <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> has a Buddhist triratana symbol on his sword. He has {{the role of a}} dvarapala, a Guardian of the entrance of the Stupa. The warrior {{has been described as a}} Greek, Some have suggested that he might even represent king Menander.|$|E
25|$|This is principally {{shown by}} their sacred ceremonial. For first {{advances}} the Singer, bearing some {{one of the}} symbols of music. For they say that he must learn two of the books of Hermes, the one of which contains the hymns of the gods, the second the regulations for the king's life. And after the Singer advances the Astrologer, with a horologe <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> a palm, the symbols of astrology. He must have the astrological books of Hermes, which are four in number, always in his mouth.|$|E
25|$|Thor was {{the most}} {{powerful}} god and ruled over thunder and lightning, wind and rain, sunshine and crops. He sat in the centre with a hammer (Mjolnir) <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> on each side were Odin, the god of war, in full armour and Frey, the god of peace and love, attributed with an enormous erect phallus. All the pagan gods have their priests who offer them the people's sacrifices. If there is disease or famine, they sacrifice to Thor, if war to Odin and if weddings to Frey.|$|E

He goes to awaken Lyra, but discovers she is missing and her guardian witches {{have been killed by}} spectres. Will finds her alethiometer and refuses to go with the angels until he finds Lyra.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the group was called Grandpa. The other koledari {{gathered}} at his house {{on the eve of}} koleda, and at midnight they all went out and started their activities. Walking through the streets of the village they shouted and made noise with their bells and ratchets. Most were armed with sabers or clubs. One of them, called Bride, was masked and costumed as a pregnant woman. He held a distaff <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> spun hemp fibers. The koledari teased and joked with Bride, which gave a comic note to the koleda. Some of them were called alosniks, the men possessed by the demon ala. There could have been other named characters in the group.|$|E
25|$|Jesus' arrest. Eight statues {{tell the}} story of Jesus' arrest. First, we have a helmeted guard in armour who holds a rope <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> to his left is Saint Peter brandishing the sword with which he has cut off Malchus' ear. Then we see Jesus and Judas and at their feet Malchus who has fallen {{backward}} to the ground after being struck by Saint Peter and has dropped the lantern he was carrying. He tries to steady himself by holding on Jesus' arm. Judas stands close to Jesus holding the purse no doubt containing the reward for his treachery. He has either kissed Jesus or is about to do so. Then we have three other guards who will make the arrest. The one in the middle holds a sword. Jesus is then led before Caiaphas who is seated and holds a sceptre and wears a crown, symbols of his power.|$|E
60|$|But Peter {{issued from}} the powder {{magazine}} with the shell <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> calmly flung it overboard.|$|R
