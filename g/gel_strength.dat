Chitosan/GP has shown success in vitro, but the addition of polylysine is needed to enhance nerve cell attachment. Polylysine was covalently bonded to chitosan in order to prevent it from diffusing away. Polylysine was selected because of its positive nature and high hydrophilicity, which promotes neurite growth.

Jinma company of Liaohe oilfield has carried out weak gel flooding in-depth in block Hai 1 and achieved good effect. But {{in the process}} of profile and flooding, problems of gelation fluctuating and gelling rate declining seriously affected the implementation effect of the profile control and flooding project. It is researched that one of main factors affecting gelling effect of profile and flooding system is the {{dissolved oxygen}}. Aiming at this problem, this paper studies critical value affecting gelling in combination with the actual situation of polymer displacement in block Hai 1. The experimental results show that, content of dissolved oxygen affects both <b>gelling</b> <b>strength</b> and <b>gelling</b> time of weak gel in the way that when dissolved oxygen content is between 0 mg/L and 3 mg/L, low <b>gelling</b> <b>strength</b> and long <b>gelling</b> time are obtained, while in the range of 4 mg/L- 10 mg/L, gelling effect is good.

Agarose gel has lower resolving power than polyacrylamide gel for DNA but has a greater range of separation, and is therefore used for DNA fragments of usually 50-20,000 bp in size. The limit of resolution for standard agarose gel electrophoresis is around 750 kb, but resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to screen starches recovered from the corn accessions used in the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) project for unusual thermal properties and paste and gel behaviors, so that they could be exploited in corn breeding programs to enhance traits important to corn utilization. In general, the values for gelatinization temperatures and peak height indices were greater, but heat of gelatinization values were less for the starches recovered from the GEM accessions (particularly BRA 052051 (SE 32)) than for starches from commercial Dent corn hybrids (11. 3 vs. 13. 6 J/g). Generally, retrogradation properties were similar among the GEM accessions, although there were specific accessions (particularly Lima 13) that possessed modestly lower percentage retrogradation (34 vs. 42 %). Generally, peak viscosities, cold paste viscosities, and viscosity breakdowns were greater for the starches of the GEM accessions (particularly ARZM 01150, Antiqua 3, and URZM 01089, respectively) than for the starches of commercial hybrids. Pasting temperatures were about the same for all starches.

Merr.; SPI), pea (Pisum sativum L.; PPI) and sweet lupine (Lupinus albus L.; LPI) were evaluated. In aqueous systems, protein cross-linking by microbial transglutaminase (MTG) was significantly improved when NaCl (1 - 2 g hg- 1) was added, but respective doses of CaCl 2 reduced <b>gel</b> <b>strengths.</b> As shown by emulsion model systems of PPI and SPI with oil/protein ratios of 1 and 2 g g- 1, emulsification of corn oil into aqueous protein suspensions prior to enzymatic cross-linking enhanced gel formation depending on the emulsification technique. The impact of NaCl and oil varied among the protein isolates as to obtainable maximum <b>gel</b> <b>strengths</b> and optimum doses of these ingredients. The applicability of MTG to leguminous proteins in complex plant foodstuffs was finally deduced from their performance in complex food models of the liquid (thickened s oup), foamed (mousse) and solid (sausage-like substitute) type, respectively. The sensory characteristics of the latter were evaluated by trained panellists relative to their milk-, gelatin- and meat-based counterparts. Texture was appealing in the foamed and solid food models, but the liquid soup model suffered from unfavourable grittiness. Without masking their beany off-flavour, the food models containing leguminous proteins deviated from the reference products. On the whole, MTG-catalysed cross-linking rendered the leguminous proteins suitable for the food applications in terms of visual appearance, texture and colour. Especially, the gels representing mousse-type foams and cuttable sausage-like vegetarian substitutes were very promising...|$|R
