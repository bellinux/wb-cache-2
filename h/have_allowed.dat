5|$|The {{long neck}} of Dinocephalosaurus {{probably}} served a functional role. In particular, {{the length of}} the neck places a long distance between the head and the remainder of the body.

5|$|According to {{the creator}} of BackupHDDVD, he or she first set out to {{circumvent}} AACS to bypass a restriction in software HD DVD players which reduced the quality of AACS restricted 1080p high definition video to that of standard definition DVD video or refused to play outright unless an HDCP compliant chain of video hardware was present. At the time only a few computer monitors and video cards supported HDCP. As a result, configurations that would <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> high-definition HD DVD viewing in software players were exceptionally rare.|$|E
5|$|Although Star Trek {{has been}} off the air since 2005, CBS and Paramount {{pictures}} <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> fan-produced shows to be created. While not officially part of the Star Trek universe, several veteran Star Trek actors, actresses, and writers have contributed their talents to many of these productions. While none of these films have been created for profit, several fan productions have turned to crowdfunding from sites, such as Kickstarter to help with production costs.|$|E
5|$|Although U.S. {{copyright}} law would <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> him {{to produce an}} unauthorized adaptation, Mansfield secured the American and British stage rights. Performing in Boston, he asked a local friend, Thomas Russell Sullivan, to write a script. Sullivan had previously only written {{in his spare time}} while working as a clerk for Lee, Higginson & Co., a Boston investment bank. Although he doubted that the novella would make a good play, he agreed to help Mansfield with the project, and they worked quickly to complete the adaptation before other, unauthorized versions could be staged.|$|E

Improvements in digital technology <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden was {{appointed}} to the United States Senate in 1842, filling the vacancy caused by Clay's resignation. In January 1843, he was elected to a full term over Richard Mentor Johnson. The Whigs' feud with President Tyler continued unabated, and some even talked of impeaching him, but Crittenden condemned that course of action. During the 27th and 28th Congresses, he served on the Committee on Military Affairs. He was an advocate of moderate protective tariffs and federal internal improvements. He opposed giving states the option to forgo apportionment, which would <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> them to elect their congressmen at-large.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E
