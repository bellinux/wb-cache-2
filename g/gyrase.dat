The most common toxic activity is the protein acting as an endonuclease, also known as an interferase.|$|E
25|$|Three {{mechanisms}} of resistance are known. Some types of efflux pumps can act to decrease intracellular quinolone concentration.

40|$|Background: Fluoroquinolones are a {{class of}} {{antibacterial}} agents used for leprosy treatment. Some new fluoroquinolones have been attracting interest due to their remarkable potency that is reportedly better than that of ofloxacin, the fluoroquinolone currently recommended for treatment of leprosy. For example, DC- 159 a, a recently developed 8 -methoxy fluoroquinolone, {{has been found to}} be highly potent against various bacterial species. Nonetheless, the efficacy of DC- 159 a against Mycobacterium leprae is yet to be examined. Methodology/Principal Findings: To gather data that can support highly effective fluoroquinolones as candidates for new remedies for leprosy treatment, we conducted in vitro assays to assess and compare the inhibitory activities of DC- 159 a and two fluoroquinolones that are already known to be more effective against M. leprae than ofloxacin. The fluoroquinolone-inhibited DNA supercoiling assay using recombinant DNA <b>gyrases</b> of wild type and ofloxacin-resistant M. leprae revealed that inhibitory activities of DC- 159 a and sitafloxacin were at most 9. 8 -and 11. 9 -fold higher than moxifloxacin. Also the fluoroquinolone-mediated cleavage assay showed that potencies of those drugs were at most 13. 5 -and 9. 8 -fold higher than moxifloxacin. In addition, these two drugs retained their inhibitory activities even against DNA <b>gyrases</b> of ofloxacin-resistant M. leprae. Conclusions/Significance: The results indicated that DC- 159 a and sitafloxacin are more effective against wild type and mutant M. leprae DNA <b>gyrases</b> than moxifloxacin, suggesting that these antibacterial drugs can be good candidates that may supersede current fluoroquinolone remedies. DC- 159 a in particular is very promising because it is classified in a subgroup of fluoroquinolones that is known to be less likely to cause adverse effects. Our results implied that DC- 159 a is well worth further investigation to ascertain its in vivo effectiveness and clinical safety for humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} activity of DU- 6859 a, a new fluoroquinolone, against {{a wide variety}} of clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of tosufloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. DU- 6859 a showed potent broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacte-ria, and its activity was greater than those of the control quinolones. By comparison of MICs at which 90 % of strains are inhibited, DU- 6859 a had potent activity against bacteria resistant to the control quinolones. The time-killing curves of quinolones showed that the number of viable cells decreased rapidly during 2 to 4 h of incubation, and regrowth was not seen even after 8 h of incubation. At a concentration of four times the MIC, the frequencies of appearance of spontaneous mutants of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudo-monas aeruginosa resistant to DU- 6859 a were % 4. 0 3 1029 to 1. 9 3 1028. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of DU- 6859 a were 0. 86 and 1. 05 mg/ml for the supercoiling activities of DNA <b>gyrases</b> isolated from E. coli and P. aeruginosa, respectively.

25|$|Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} that {{is active}} against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

With the DNA not being separated, the process is stopped, and the bacterium cannot divide.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that local {{denaturation}} {{can be a}} natural consequence of supercoiling, even in environments where base pairing of linear DNA is energetically favored. Any change in the molecular total twist from its unstressed value is partitioned between local denaturation and smooth twisting in both the native and coil regions so as to minimize the total conformational free energy involved. Threshold degrees of torsional deformation are found {{for the existence of}} stable, locally melted conformations. As these thresholds are surpassed, the number of denatured bases increase smoothly from zero. Existing experimental evidence regarding denaturation in supercoiled DNA is in good agreement with the predictions of this theory. In addition, from existing data one can estimate the partitioning of superhelicity between twisting and writhing. Possible consequences of stress-induced strand separation on the accessibility of the DNA to enzyme attack are discussed.

40|$|Quinolones are {{antibacterial}} {{drugs that}} are thought to bind preferentially to disturbed regions of DNA. They do not fall into the classical categories of intercalators, groove binders or electrostatic binders to the backbone. We solved the 3 D structure of the DNA duplex (ACGCGU-NA) 2, where NA denotes a nalidixic acid residue covalently linked to the 2 ′-position of 2 ′-amino- 2 ′-deoxyuridine, by NMR and restrained torsion angle molecular dynamics (MD). In the complex, the quinolones stack on G:C base pairs of the core tetramer and disrupt the terminal A:U base pair. The displaced dA residues can stack on the quinolones, while the uracil rings bind in the minor groove. The duplex-bridging interactions of the drugs and the contacts of the displaced nucleotides explain the high UV-melting temperature for d(ACGCGU-NA) 2 of up to 53 °C. Further, non-covalently linked complexes between quinolones and DNA of the sequence ACGCGT can be generated via MD using constraints obtained for d(ACGCGU-NA) 2. This is demonstrated for unconjugated nalidixic acid and its 6 -fluoro derivative.

The growth of 824 (pGROE 1) was inhibited up to 85 % less by a butanol challenge than that of the control strain, 824 (pSOS 95 del). Overexpression of groESL resulted in increased final solvent titers 40 % and 33 % higher than those of the wild type and plasmid control strains, respectively. Active metabolism lasted two and one half times longer in 824 (pGROE 1) than in the wild type.
