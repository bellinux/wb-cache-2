40|$|Session 07 : Wireless and opticalInternational audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} replica {{selection}} scheme for parallel and multi-wavelength <b>downloading</b> in optical grid networks. In optical grid networks, files replicated at multiple sites are <b>downloaded</b> in parallel to reduce <b>downloading</b> time. Furthermore, each replica is <b>downloaded</b> with multiple wavelengths. Although parallel and multi-wavelength <b>downloading</b> can reduce <b>downloading</b> time, they raise blocking probability of file <b>downloading.</b> To resolve this problem, the proposed scheme selects replicas and establishes lightpaths based on wavelength availability.
