40|$|Abstract — In {{this work}} we report about {{our efforts to}} equip service robots {{with the ability to}} robustly operate {{articulated}} containers such as refrigerators and drawers in kitchen environments. We identified three important aspects for such systems: (1) the ability to detect fixtures on an articulated object, (2) to robustly open and close them and (3) to store and retrieve information about these objects in the map. In particular, we detect grasping fixtures such as <b>handles</b> <b>and</b> <b>knobs</b> in 3 D point clouds using a RANSAC-based plane detection and subsequent clustering approach. Further, we developed two types of controllers to operate articulated objects: the first controller is model-free and incrementally opens articulated models. The second controller is model-based and estimates both the kinematic structure and the kinematic parameters. Finally, we store the inferred articulation models into our knowledge processing system KnowRob readily available for later interactions. All software components have been tested on two PR 2 (Personal Robot 2) robots located at TUM and Bosch and are freely available on ros. org. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the acquisition of}} 3 D functional object maps for indoor household environments, in particular kitchens, out of 3 D point cloud data. By modeling the static objects in the world into hierarchical classes in the map, such as cupboards, tables, drawers, and kitchen appliances, we create a library of objects which a household robotic assistant can use while performing its tasks. Our method takes a complete 3 D point cloud model as input, and computes an object model for it. The objects have states (such as open and closed), and the resulted model is accurate enough {{to use it in}} physics-based simulations, where the doors can be opened based on their hinge position. The model is built through a series of geometrical reasoning steps, namely: planar segmentation, cuboid decomposition, fixture recognition and interpretation (e. g. <b>handles</b> <b>and</b> <b>knobs),</b> and object classification based on object state information.

5000|$|The Wright & Ditsons Lajoie {{baseball}} bat. This bat had {{a normal}} size barrel but had two knobs on the handle. The lowest knob {{was at the}} bottom of the <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> the other <b>knob</b> was roughly two inches above the lowest knob. This was designed to have better spacing between the hands due to the knob being in the middle of the grip. This also gave batters an advantage when they choked up on the bat, because the second knob provided a better grip.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work was to {{evaluate}} the significance of food safety in domestic environments. In this study, several points in 15 houses (handles of doors, refrigerators and dishwashers, cooking stove knobs, surfaces of preparation of foods, taps and kitchen towels, {{as well as from}} domestic animals' feet that usually have access to the kitchen area, <b>and</b> WC <b>knobs</b> <b>and</b> taps) were sampled and tested for detection and quantification of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus coagulase-positive, Escherichia coli, Listeria spp. and Campylobacter spp. A questionnaire was also prepared and administered to the person responsible for domestic tasks in order to evaluate their experience of hygienic practices. The results showed a total of 125 Enterobacteriaceae spp. isolates, 86 Staphylococcus coagulase-positive isolates, 5 Listeria spp., 13 E. coli isolates and no Campylobacter spp. was found. Most of the isolates were found distributed by the entire house, with <b>handles,</b> <b>knobs</b> <b>and</b> domestic animals' feet being the points more contaminated. Also, there was no relation between the answers to the questionnaires administered and the microbiological results obtained. These results revealed the need to develop some education campaigns designed to educate consumers in good hygiene practices at home...|$|R

40|$|With a {{projected}} {{rise in the}} number of elderly, most of whom have also relied primarily on the private automobile for their mobility, it is likely that future adaptations in vehicle design will be linked in some part to the physical infirmities often faced by the elderly. This paper offers a bridge between medical research on the physical impairments of the elderly and automobile design and driving safety. We describe recent findings on the driving-related physical and cognitive impairments faced by the elderly. We then propose two major types of vehicle design and infrastructure adaptations: (1) modifications for private vehicles, and (2) intelligent technology and support services for private vehicles, which can help to minimize the driving-related effects of these impairments. For example, we present a range of modest vehicle design adaptations for components such as seats <b>and</b> doorways, <b>handles,</b> <b>knobs,</b> <b>and</b> steering wheels, and seat belts. We find that many of these improvements can be made to standard passenger vehicles with little additional design effort, and that the adaptations should also increase overall vehicle marketability. Finally, we argue that while most, if not all, of our proposed adaptations would be made to largely benefit the elderly, they will nevertheless support and improve driving across all age groups. elderly, vehicle, design, driving, constraints...|$|R

At {{the end of this}} analysis, we reduce an 11 -dimensional space to a 3 -dimensional space for monitors and a 6 -dimensional space to a 3 -dimensional space for knobs. This reduction shows the potential and highlights the need for a realistic methodology to help identify such minimum set of monitors <b>and</b> <b>knobs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an underactuated gripper designed to unlatch doors <b>knobs</b> <b>and</b> <b>handles.</b> The challenge was to create a mechanism that could manipulate a variety of door <b>knobs</b> <b>and</b> <b>handles</b> while using only one motor {{in order to create a}} low cost device. The final design evolved by exploring the limitations in the performance of an initial gripper prototype. In this paper, the cause of failure for the first prototype is discussed along with rationale for the changes made in the second design. The final design was capable of twisting door <b>knobs</b> <b>and</b> <b>handles</b> in clockwise <b>and</b> counter-clockwise directions. It had a collet-cone shape for compliance gripping and centering, and it utilized one motor for both gripping and twisting actions. The discussed gripper was developed for the assistive technology domain; however, this gripper mechanism could be utilized in a wide variety of robotic domains that exist today. 1...|$|R
