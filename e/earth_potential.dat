25|$|Strictly speaking, {{the terms}} {{grounding}} or earthing {{are meant to}} refer to an electrical connection to ground/earth. Bonding is the practice of intentionally electrically connecting metallic items not designed to carry electricity.

25|$|A {{particular}} concern in design of electrical substations is <b>earth</b> <b>potential</b> rise. When very large fault currents are {{injected into the}} earth, {{the area around the}} point of injection may rise to a high potential with respect to distant points. This is due to the limited finite conductivity of the layers of soil in the earth. The gradient of the voltage (changing voltage within a distance) may be so high that two points on the ground may be at significantly different potentials, creating a hazard to anyone standing {{on the ground in the}} area. Pipes, rails, or communication wires entering a substation may see different ground potentials inside and outside the substation, creating a dangerous touch voltage.|$|E

These coefficients reflect the spectral composition of the <b>Earth</b> gravitational <b>potential</b> in the whole space, but they cannot reflect the spectral composition in a local area. In this study, the <b>Earth</b> gravitational <b>potential</b> was projected on spherical harmonics in a local area using a window function introduced to facilitate the mathematical expressions.

The model can reflect the signal strength of any gravity-field spectrum component in the local area, which adds information for the description of the gravity field of the Earth, and which has great significance for Earth-sciences research and satellite gravity measurements. Taking the third-degree coefficients, for example, the signal-strength distributions of potential coefficients were computed. The data show that the signal-strength distributions of third-degree coefficients on the sphere surface are independent of the longitude. Among the third-degree coefficients, the zero-order, first-order and second-order coefficients are stronger near the two poles of the Earth, while the third-order coefficient is stronger near the equator. </p...|$|R
25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to <b>earth</b> <b>potential,</b> usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|E
2500|$|Since that time, {{the term}} “stray voltage” has {{had at least}} two very {{different}} definitions. This situation is cause for confusion among utilities, regulators, and the public. [...] The term [...] "stray voltage" [...] is commonly used for all unwanted electrical leakage, by both {{the general public and}} many electrical utility professionals. [...] Other more esoteric phenomenon that also result in elevated voltages on normally non-energized surfaces, are also referred to as “stray voltage.” Examples are voltage due to capacitive coupling, current induced by power lines, EMF, lightning, <b>earth</b> <b>potential</b> rise, and problems stemming from open (disconnected) neutrals.|$|E
2500|$|For {{measurement}} purposes, the Earth {{serves as}} a (reasonably) constant potential reference against which other potentials can be measured.

In electronic circuit theory, a [...] "ground" [...] is usually idealized as an infinite source or sink for charge, which can absorb an unlimited amount of current without changing its potential. Where a real ground connection has a significant resistance, the approximation of zero potential is no longer valid. Stray voltages or <b>earth</b> <b>potential</b> rise effects will occur, which may create noise in signals or if large enough will produce an electric shock hazard.|$|E

2500|$|Where the {{building}} wiring system defines a [...] "neutral" [...] conductor that {{is close to}} <b>earth</b> <b>potential,</b> it is an advantage for appliance designers to preserve that distinction. For example, appliances may ensure single-pole switches interrupt the line side of the circuit, or ensure that screw-base lampholder shells {{are connected to the}} neutral side of the supply, minimizing the chance of contact with live parts. This requires a plug that can only be connected in one way to the socket, so that the energised and neutral conductors are not interchanged. In most designs, such [...] "polarized" [...] plugs cannot be mated with non-polarized sockets. Wiring systems where both circuit conductors have a significant potential with respect to earth do not benefit from polarized plugs.|$|E
2500|$|RCDs {{are usually}} {{testable}} and resettable devices. Commonly {{they include a}} button that when pressed, safely creates a small leakage condition, and a switch that reconnects the conductors when a fault condition has been cleared.

2500|$|Space-based {{solar power}} (SBSP) {{is the concept}} of {{collecting}} solar power in outer space and distributing it to <b>Earth.</b> <b>Potential</b> advantages of collecting solar energy in space include a higher collection rate and a longer collection period {{due to the lack of}} a diffusing atmosphere, and the possibility of placing a solar collector in an orbiting location where there is no night. A considerable fraction of incoming solar energy (55–60%) is lost on its way through the Earth's atmosphere by the effects of reflection and absorption. Space-based solar power systems convert sunlight to microwaves outside the atmosphere, avoiding these losses, and the downtime due to the Earth's rotation, but at great cost due to the expense of launching material into orbit. SBSP is considered a form of sustainable or green energy, renewable energy, and is occasionally considered among climate engineering proposals.

In SST and SGG, discrete scalar {{data of the}} first and the second radial derivative of the <b>earth's</b> gravitational <b>potential,</b> respectively, are given on the satellite orbit. The determination of the gravitational potential on and outside the earth's surface from these data is an exponentially ill-posed problem. In this thesis, we investigate the reconstruction of the <b>earth's</b> gravitational <b>potential</b> from such data with two different approaches, using splines, wavelets, regularization techniques, and a domain decomposition method. These methods are based on space-localizing structures and allow global reconstructions, as well as local reconstructions of the potential from only locally given data. The numerical simulations in this thesis are carried out with data corresponding to a frequency band of EGM 96 (Earth Gravitational Model 96). In the first approach, we compute a smoothing spline from the gravitational data. This smoothing spline is an approximation of the <b>earth's</b> gravitational <b>potential.</b> Here, spline smoothing compensates for the ill-posedness of the problem. Scaling functions and wavelets yield a multiresolution analysis of the potential. In the second approach, we approximate the (first or second order) radial derivative of the potential on the satellite orbit {{with the help of a}} spline. Then regularization scaling functions and regularization wavelets are applied to reconstruct the gravitational potential on and outside the earth's surface in a multiscale representation. A central feature in both approaches is the computation of an approximating spline from a large data set. This demands the solution of a linear system with a positive definite, symmetric N...|$|R

The nightly television satellite weather picture, the intercontinental telecommunications of television transmissions and telephone conversations, and the establishrnent of educational programs in remote regions on Earth are constant reminders of the presence of these satellites. As used here, the term 'geo­ stationary' must be taken loosely because, in the long run, the satellites will not remain 'stationary' with respect to an Earth-fixed reference frame. This results from the fact that these satellites, as is true for all satellites, are incessantly subject to perturbations other than the central-body attraction of the Earth. Among the more predominant pertur­ bations are: the ellipticity of the Earth's equator, the Sun and Moon, and solar radiation pressure.
