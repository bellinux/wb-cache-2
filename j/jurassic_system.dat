5000|$|Saudi Arabia {{covers a}} large part of the Arabian Basin which is the primary {{producer}} of oil and gas.The basement structures beneath the Arabian Basin have controlled sediment deposition and structural growth of the basin. The main petroleum system of the Safaniya reservoir is the Mesozoic Petroleum System. The Mesozoic Petroleum System can be divided into two smaller petroleum <b>systems,</b> the <b>Jurassic</b> Petroleum <b>System</b> and Cretaceous Petroleum System. These small systems have generated hydrocarbons from the Jurassic to Cretaceous time period and largely contributed to the oil and gas production in the world's largest offshore field in Saudi Arabia the Safaniya Fields. The <b>Jurassic</b> Petroleum <b>System</b> consists of the Tuwaiq Mountain and Hanifa formations which are thick laminated organic rich lime mudstone units from the Jurassic period and contain a type II kerogen that has excellent source rock potential. The carbon isotope ratios between the oils (avg. δ 13C = - 26.6‰) and the kerogen (avg. δ 13C = - 26.4‰) and bitumen (avg. δ 13C = - 27.1‰) [...] The typical seal rock in the Mesozoic petroleum system that separates the Jurassic oils from mixing with the Cretaceous oils is a permeable evaporites anhydrite with a thickness reaching up to 287 m. The seal is not well developed along the eastern and northeastern part of Saudi Arabia. This allows Jurassic oils to mix with Cretaceous oils and causes the production of Cretaceous oils with a Jurassic oils to be limited to the eastern and northeastern part of Saudi Arabia. The Cretaceous Petroleum System consists of the main reservoir in the Safaniya fields, the Safaniya member. The Safaniya member is a thick sequence of sandstone, siltstone and shale with thin intervals of limestone, coal and varying amounts of ironstone. The Mauddud Formation is intra-formational shales and tight carbonates that seals the reservoirs within the Safaniya Formation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The Thiel Mountains {{are part}} of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) and occupy a {{strategic}} position close to the East-West Antarctic boundary. They occur in a region of relatively subdued topography distal from high topography and high relief of most of the TAM adjacent to the West Antarctic rift system. Low-temperature thermochronology on samples collected from the Reed Ridge granite on the north flank of the Thiel Mountains constrain the thermal and hence tectonic history. Apatite fission track data plus thermal models indicate cooling from ca. 165 - 150 Ma. In conjunction with 40 Ar/ 39 Ar K-feldspar data, the results indicate cooling was due to relatively slow erosional denudation, and not thermal relaxation following Jurassic tholeiitic magmatism. Denudation was most likely associated with the formation of the <b>Jurassic</b> rift <b>system</b> across Antarctica that marked the initial breakup of Gondwana.

This rift activity led to northward separation of the Falkland Plateau, and formation of the WeddellSea by sea floor spreading. Atypically, the Jurassic passive margin of Gondwana shows evidence for coeval extension in two directions and a large volume of interpreted magmatic material. This is consistent with initial doming above a mantle plume and we suggest that this resulted in the formation of atriplejunction. Magnetic anomalies indicate a series of faults perpendicular to igneous intrusions and extrusions with outlines that range in shape from lozenges to parallel ridges. They show remarkably good spatial correlation with free air gravity anomalies, even in areas of sea ice. We base a structural elements map and timing sequence for the events in the WSE during early Gondwana breakup on anomaly cross-cutting relationships...|$|R

40|$|The {{hydrocarbon}} {{systems of}} the Mesozoic, inverted West Netherlands Basin have been analyzed using 2 -D forward modelling. Three source rocks are considered in the modelling: Lower Jurassic oil-prone shales, Westphalian gas-prone coal deposits, and Lower Namurian oil-prone shales. The Lower Namurian hydrocarbon system of the basin is discussed for the first time. According to the modelling results of the Early <b>Jurassic</b> oil <b>system,</b> the oil accumulations were filled just after the main inversion event. Their predicted locations are in agreement with exploration results. Modelling results of the Westphalian gas system, however, show smaller and larger sized accumulations at unexplored locations. The gas reservoirs were filled during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous rifting phase. Results of modelling of the Lower Namurian oil system indicate that gas formed by secondary cracking of the oils can have mixed with the Westphalian coal-derived gas. Such a mixing is inferred from geochemical analyses. The existence of a Lower Namurian hydrocarbon system in the West Netherlands Basin implies that hydrocarbons are possibly trapped in the Westphalian and Namurian successions.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} reservoir geochemical protocols to a study of oil-field and regional petroleum compositional variations in the major fields in the Tampen Spur area. The Tampen Spur high {{is located in the}} middle of several oil-mature to gas-mature source-rock kitchens and most of the structures might receive petroleum from several different directions. Based on the definition of several different petroleum populations within the Tampen Spur area, we define five major petroleum charging systems. Correlating the petroleum population variations with geological information allows us to derive likely migration/fill scenarios for many of the oil-fields and requires us to invoke a new Upper <b>Jurassic</b> cartier <b>system</b> in parts of the area connecting Brent Group reservoirs across major faults. Based on this hypothesis, two exploration wells were drilled on structures to test this cartier and petroleum was found in one of the structures. An understanding of the migration pathways and petroleum drainage fficiency of the basins is of great economic interest, because most of the smaller sub-structures are marginally economic. Thus, it is important to provide an effective risk analysis and ranking of the satellite prospects prior to drilling. This study has demonstrated that filling and migration in a geological province are controlled by a series of complex processes and that th...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{more than}} a decade of {{intensive}} coal seam gas exploration and development in the Surat Basin, fundamental aspects surrounding the sedimentary organisation of the Walloon Subgroup remain unresolved. While generally agreed to have been deposited on a waterlogged alluvial plain, contradictory paleogeographic models describe the Walloon Subgroup as an internally draining fluvio-lacustrine system or, alternatively, as a southeast-prograding distributive trunk drainage system. The former invokes a radially organised fluvial catchment feeding a basin depocentre, suggesting that rivers within the study area flowed from east to west. In contrast, a prograding trunk drainage system assumes an axial system flowing southeastward towards a distant paleocoastline. Without a unifying conceptual model describing the organisation of the <b>Jurassic</b> depositional <b>system,</b> predictions about the distribution of alluvial subenvironments within the Surat Basin are difficult. This study tests previous hypotheses surrounding the Walloon Subgroup 2 ̆ 7 s sedimentary organisation by reconstructing regional variations in alluvial architecture, fluvial styles and sediment dispersal patterns. The workflow integrates borehole image log interpretation, wireline log analysis, core description and numerical modelling to explore the character and occurrence of subenvironments throughout the basin.

40|$|Evolution of {{sedimentary}} basins {{took place}} in the Barmer, Jaisalmer and Bikaner regions during K-T (Cretaceous-Tertiary) time in western Rajasthan, India. These intra-cratonic rift basins developed under an extensional tectonic regime from early Jurassic to Tertiary time. Rift evolution resulted in alkaline magmatism at the rift margins. This magmatism is dated at 68. 5 Ma and has been considered to be an early phase of Deccan volcanism. Deccan volcanism, sedimentary basin development and the alkaline magmatism of western Rajasthan have thus been considered to be the products of Reunion plume activity. However, sedimentary basin evolution began in western Rajasthan prior to Deccan volcanism and K-T alkaline magmatism. Gondwanaland fragmentation during the Mesozoic caused the development of the rift basins of Gujarat and western Rajasthan. This resulted in the opening of the <b>Jurassic</b> rift <b>system</b> and mildly alkaline magmatism at ca. 120 Ma in western India. This event is pre-K-T and plume activity has not hypothesized for it.
