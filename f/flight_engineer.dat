5|$|First Officer John Rachuba, 30, {{was hired}} by Piedmont in 1989. At {{the time of the}} accident, company records {{indicate}} that he had accumulated approximately 4,507 flying hours, of which 29 hours were in the F28. Rachuba held a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> certificate with ratings for turbojet-powered aircraft and an expired instructor certificate issued on August 16, 1987. He also held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license for non-federal control towers. Previously, he had served as a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> on Boeing 737s and Boeing 727s.|$|E
5|$|For ease of {{training}} and fleet conversion, de Havilland designed the Comet's flight deck layout {{with a degree of}} similarity to the Lockheed Constellation, an aircraft that was popular at the time with key customers such as BOAC. The cockpit included full dual-controls for the captain and first officer, while a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> controlled various key systems, including fuel, air conditioning, and electrical systems. The navigator occupied a dedicated station with a table across from the <b>flight</b> <b>engineer.</b>|$|E

5|$|Soyuz TM-30 was {{the first}} spaceflight for flight {{commander}} Zalyotin, who became a cosmonaut in 1990 and completed his general training two years later in 1992. TM-30 was the third visit to space made by <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> Kaleri, who became a cosmonaut in 1984 and completed general training in 1986. He served as <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> aboard the Soyuz TM-14 and TM-24 missions to Mir in 1992 and 1996-7, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} CAB and included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB concluded that the momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> during takeoff, were most likely caused by a boost pump failure, and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 707 which had accumulated 26,319 airframe hours since its first flight in 1959. It was piloted by Captain Volney D. Matheny, 45, who had 18,753 hours of pilot time. The copilot was First Officer Ronald G. Reichardt, 26, with 1,629 total piloting hours, and the <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> was Robert D. Barron, 39, who had accumulated 11,182 hours as a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer.</b> The stewardesses were Janan Perkins, 21, Roswitha Neal, 25, Kathleen Fankhouser, 21, and Sara Muir, 25.|$|E

50|$|The Air Gunner's and <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer's</b> badge (Fliegerschützenabzeichen für Bordschützen und Bordmechaniker) was a German {{military}} decoration {{awarded to}} air gunners, mechanics (<b>flight</b> <b>engineers)</b> or aircrew meteorologists who {{were members of}} the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) after they completed two months training or had taken part in at least five operational flights. If one was wounded during an operational flight, the badge could be awarded earlier. For Luftwaffe members who were air gunners and mechanics (<b>flight</b> <b>engineers)</b> this badge replaced an earlier separate badge which had been introduced back in 1935. The qualifications for the two badges were the same for recipients.|$|R

5|$|The Douglas DC-7 serving Flight 663 {{made its}} first flight in 1958, and had {{subsequently}} accumulated a total of 18,500 hours of flight time. It was piloted by Captain Frederick R. Carson, 41, who had been employed by Eastern Air Lines for 19 years and who had accumulated 12,607 hours of flight time. His copilot, First Officer Edward R. Dunn, 41, a nine-year veteran of Eastern Airlines, had 8,550 hours of flight time. The <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> was Douglas C. Mitchell, 24, with two years' employment and 407 pilot hours and 141 hours <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> time. All had passed proficiency checks with the DC-7B aircraft. The two flight attendants aboard were Linda Lord and Judith Durkin.|$|E
5|$|As {{would emerge}} in later {{testimony}} at the post-crash hearing, this crewing combination led to {{confusion in the}} cockpit during the final flight segment, as to who was making the decisions and giving the orders as pilot in command, and who was operating the engine and fuel controls as <b>flight</b> <b>engineer.</b>|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1964 Fauquier {{traveled}} to Calgary, Alberta with the Minister of Defence Paul Hellyer, {{to observe the}} last official RCAF flight of an Avro Lancaster. This Lancaster, KB-976, was captained by F/L Lynn Garrison with F/L Ralph Langemann as his co-pilot. Other crew members were Captain E.J. McGoldrick, F/O Brian B. McKay, and Jimmy Sutherland, a wartime Lancaster <b>flight</b> <b>engineer.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Lockheed Constellation L-049, {{like many}} airliners of its era, was {{normally}} crewed by three individuals: a captain (or pilot in command) {{in the left}} seat, a first officer (also known as copilot) in the right seat, and a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> in the rear seat. The accident flight crewing was unusual in several respects.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight was}} manned by {{a crew of}} nine, {{including}} six flight attendants and three flight crewmen. The flight crew was captained by 51-year-old Laureano Caviedes with 28-year-old first officer Mauricio Klotz and 45-year-old <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> Matias Moyano. At {{the time of the}} crash, Captain Caviedes had been employed with Avianca for over 27 years and had logged over 16,000 hours of flight time, including over 1,500 in the 707. Caviedes had 478 hours of night flying experience in the 707 and had no record of any prior accidents. Copilot Klotz had been employed with Avianca for three years and had 1,837 hours of flight time. Klotz had transitioned to the 707 the previous October and had logged 64 flight hours in the airframe, including 13 at night. <b>Flight</b> <b>engineer</b> Moyano had been employed with Avianca for over 23 years and had over 10,000 hours of flight time, including over 3,000 hours in the 707 and over 1,000 hours of night flying in the same airframe.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 7:40pm, the 727 {{took off}} with only Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> H. E. Anderson aboard. Two F-106 fighter aircraft scrambled from nearby McChord Air Force Base followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view. A Lockheed T-33 trainer, diverted from an unrelated Air National Guard mission, also shadowed the 727 before running low on fuel and turning back near the Oregon–California state line.|$|E

5|$|Captain Walter Lux, 53, {{had been}} flying the DC-10 since its {{introduction}} eight years earlier. He had logged around 22,000 flying hours, of which about 3,000 {{were in a}} DC-10. He was also qualified to pilot 17 other aircraft, including the DC-6, DC-7, and Boeing 727. First Officer James Dillard, 49, and <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Alfred Udovich, 56, were also highly experienced: 9,275 hours and 15,000 hours respectively, and between them they had 1,830 hours flying experience in the DC-10.|$|E
5|$|The A320 {{retained}} the dark cockpit where an indicator is off when its system is running {{to draw attention}} on dysfunctions from the A310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler's son. All following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training; for Roger Béteille, former Airbus president, this choice {{was one of the}} most difficult he had ever made.|$|E
5|$|Captain Cliff Taylor and Acting First Officer John Hutchinson {{had managed}} to safely land their {{aircraft}} which, having lost an engine, was on fire carrying about 22,000 gallons of fuel, in the most testing of circumstances and almost certainly saved 121 lives. Taylor was recommended for an award by BOAC, but following {{the publication of the}} official inquiry report in August 1969, the decision was taken at ministerial level not to recognise any member of the flight crew. Both Taylor and Hutchinson received, along with First Officer Francis Kirkland and Check Captain Geoffrey Moss, but not <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Thomas Hicks, commendations from BOAC, and Captain Taylor was awarded the British Airline Pilots Association Gold Medal.|$|E

5|$|In July 1950, {{soon after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 Superfortress bombers to Guam as a deterrent to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, and possible future use in Korea. They were loaded with Mark 4 nuclear bombs, but without the fissile cores. Travis was one of twenty passengers and crewmen on board B-29 Superfortress 44-87651 when it commenced take off from Fairfield-Suisun at 2200 on 5 August 1950. The plane was piloted by Captain Eugene Q. Steffes, with First Lieutenant Carter W. Johnson as his co-pilot and Technical Sergeant Donald W. Moore as his <b>flight</b> <b>engineer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Comet was an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever monoplane {{powered by}} four jet engines; {{it had a}} four-place cockpit occupied by two pilots, a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer,</b> and a navigator. The clean, low-drag design of the aircraft featured many design elements that were fairly uncommon at the time, including a swept-wing leading edge, integral wing fuel tanks, and four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units designed by de Havilland. Two pairs of turbojet engines (on the Comet 1s, Halford H.2 Ghosts, subsequently known as de Havilland Ghost 50 Mk1s) were buried into the wings.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's No. 38 Squadron was {{selected}} to transport Australia's share of the bristles. This squadron was equipped with Douglas Dakota aircraft, and was responsible at the time for conducting regular flights from Australia to Japan carrying personnel and supplies for the Australian element of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. A detachment of three Dakotas led by No. 38 Squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader John Balfe, was sent from Australia to Hong Kong {{in preparation for the}} task. As flying conditions were expected to be difficult, each of these aircraft was manned by two highly experienced pilots as well as another airman who performed the duties of navigator, radio operator and <b>flight</b> <b>engineer.</b>|$|E
