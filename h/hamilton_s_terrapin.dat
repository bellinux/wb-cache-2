40|$|Alexander <b>Hamilton</b> <b>s</b> Report on Manufactures (1791) is {{a classic}} {{document}} of U. S. economic policy, but its fate in Congress is not well known. It is commonly believed that the report was never implemented. Although <b>Hamilton</b> <b>s</b> proposals for bounties (subsidies) failed to receive support, virtually every tariff recommendation was adopted by Congress in early 1792. These tariffs were not highly protectionist because Hamilton feared discouraging imports, which were the critical tax base on which he planned to fund the public debt. As a consequence, protectionist interests shifted their political support from the Federalists to the Jeffersonian Republicans during the 1790 s. ...|$|R

40|$|Alexander <b>Hamilton</b> <b>s</b> {{profound}} {{influence on}} American life is well-documented. Less well-appreciated {{is the story}} of how Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s works travelled abroad; leaders in Germany, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea came to keenly appreciate the relevance of <b>Hamilton</b> <b>s</b> works to the modernisation challenges facing their own nations. This book reveals East Asian leaders close association with Hamiltonian thought and practice, and shows that American and East Asian economies share common foundations of state activism that transcend political rhetoric. The latest Wall Street debacle of 2007 - 09 has grown into a global financial crisis. Yet, it is far from unique either in the level of unbridled speculation on display, or the pro-activist response of the federal government in intervening to prevent systemic failure. This book argues that the future prosperity of not only the USA, but also East Asia, will be defined not by the response to the financial crisis itself but the willingness or otherwise of the political leadership to embrace <b>Hamilton</b> <b>s</b> central intellectual insight: the state cannot abdicate its governance function and is obliged to harness financial market exuberance to enhance national life...|$|R
