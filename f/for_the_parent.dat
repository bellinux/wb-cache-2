5|$|Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic is an {{alternative}} version of Prince's 1999 studio album Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic. Unlike Prince's previous efforts, the album was not released commercially. Instead, an internet subscription service co-founded by Prince, NPG Music Club, issued the album via mail through the NPG Music Club. Due to this, Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic also {{was not able to}} chart anywhere. Recording sessions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> album took place in Prince's hometown of Chanhassen, Minnesota, at Paisley Park Studios, plus at Electric Lady Studios in California and O'Henry Sound Studios in New York City.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the role of the social context in <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> style of immigrant Chinese mothers and the maladaptive social behaviors in their preschool children. Participants included 78 first-generation immigrant Chinese mothers with preschool children residing in small co-ethnic communities in Maryland. Although no significant associations were found between the variables of interest, follow-up analyses revealed that spousal support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> role uniquely predicted less verbal hostility, whereas kin support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> role uniquely predicted less physical coercion. Non-kin support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> role did not predict <b>parenting</b> style. <b>The</b> findings demonstrated the distinct function of support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> role as opposed to the general support network and the significance of kin <b>for</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>parenting</b> behaviors of immigrant Chinese mothers. Findings can inform community agencies about the significance of spousal and kinship support for immigrant Chinese families...|$|R

25|$|In 1905, Sigmund Freud {{presented}} {{his theory of}} psychosexual development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the phallic stage, at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an Oedipus complex where they had sexual fantasies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> ascribed the opposite gender and hatred <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses. In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).|$|E

40|$|Background: Progress in {{perinatal}} medicine {{has made it}} possible to increase the survival of very or extremely low birthweight infants. Developmental outcomes of surviving preterm infants have been analysed at the paediatric, neurological, cognitive, and behavioural levels, and a series of perinatal and environmental risk factors have been identified. The threat to the child's survival and invasive medical procedures can be very traumatic <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> Few empirical reports have considered post-traumatic stress reactions of <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> as a possible variable affecting a child's outcome. Some studies have described sleeping and eating problems as related to prematurity; these problems are especially critical <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{algorithm}} maintains two values, alpha and beta, {{which represent}} the minimum score that the maximizing player is assured of and the maximum score that the minimizing player is assured of respectively. Initially alpha is negative infinity and beta is positive infinity, i.e. both players start with their worst possible score. It can happen that {{when choosing a}} certain branch of a certain node the maximum score that the minimizing player is assured of becomes less than the minimum score that the maximizing player is assured of (beta <= alpha). If this is the case, the parent node should not choose this node, because it will make the score <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> node worse. Therefore, the other branches of the node {{do not have to}} be explored.|$|E

She concluded that because of the timing of the vaccinations, the baby's reactions and other parents' stories it was the vaccine that killed him and not a genetic disease. She has since stated that there is a conspiracy with pharmaceutical companies and the medical community to cover-up vaccine related problems, because of financial incentives. She feels like she was lied to by the doctors and believes parents should have all the information about vaccinations in order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> to make good decisions.|$|E
25|$|Blue-footed booby {{parents are}} passive spectators of this intrabrood conflict. They do not {{intervene}} in their offspring's struggles, {{even at the}} point of siblicide. Booby parents even appear to facilitate the demise of the younger sibling by creating and maintaining the inequality between the two chicks. They reinforce the brood hierarchy by feeding the dominant chick more often than the subordinate one. Thus, they respond to the brood hierarchy and not to the level of begging when deciding which chick to feed, as both chicks beg in equal amounts. This level of passivity towards the very possible death of their younger offspring may be an indication that brood reduction is advantageous for the parents. The Insurance Egg Hypothesis views the second egg and resulting chick as insurance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> in case the first egg does not hatch, or if food levels are higher than expected.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea behind}} the {{pinewood}} derby is <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent,</b> usually the father, but sometimes the mother or grandparent, to spend time helping the child design, carve, paint, add weights, and tune the final car. However, it {{is often the case}} that the parent takes over the construction of the car, an aspect of the event that was lampooned in the 2005 film Down and Derby, and also in a 2009 episode of South Park. The quest for a fast car supports a cottage industry that supplies modified wheels, axles, and blocks as well as videos and instruction books. While a pinewood derby car kit costs around US$4, a set of modified wheels and axles can sell for more than ten times that amount. Each pack sets its own rules under the guidelines set forth by the BSA and their particular local district. The aftermarket items are legal under some Pack rules since the parts originally came from an official Boy Scouts of America (BSA) kit. Complete cars can be purchased on eBay and elsewhere for around $100 to $200, and PineCar, a subsidiary of Woodland Scenics, sells pre-cut or pre-made cars, as well as official kits. Although these cars violate the spirit of the event, if not the rules, enforcement can be difficult.|$|E
