Antifeminist Phyllis Schlafly wrote that Junos theme [...] "isn't love, romance, or respect for life, but the triumph of feminist ideology, i.e., the <b>irrelevancy</b> of men, especially fathers." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe concluded [...] "Juno serves cool, intelligent girls something they rarely see in a movie: themselves." [...] Cody said about writing the film, [...] "Women are clever, women are funny, women are sharp, and I wanted to show that these girls were human and not the stereotypical teenage girls that we often see in the media" [...] and [...] "There {{was a lack of}} authentic teen girl characters ... I saw writing this screenplay as an opportunity to create an iconic female." [...] Page praised the film for its positive depiction of teenage girls, describing Juno's character as [...] "really refreshing and allow for new possibilities in what young women can be" [...] and [...] "honest but original, completely devoid of stereotype", while also highlighting that [...] "Girls haven't had that sort of character before.

The critic also rated the band {{as one of}} [...] "the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era." [...] Stylus rated it A saying : [...] "It’s a wonderfully eclectic mixture of fingers-down-a-blackboard avant-punk (“Voices (On The Air),” “Eve White/Eve Black”), Creatures-esque tribal drum-worship (“Sunless”), majestic beauty (“Something Blue,” “Shooting Sun,” “Return”), amusing experimentation (“Slap Dash Snap,” “(There’s A) Planet In My Kitchen”), linguistic fun (“Mittageisen,” “Il Est Ne, Le Divin Enfant,” “El Dia De Los Muertos”) and, yes, playfully ‘dark’ tunes (“Something Wicked (This Way Comes),” “Are You Still Dying, Darling?”)." [...] Record Collector praised the box set for its [...] "remarkable diversity, spontaneity and playfulness", considering that there are [...] "No throwaway tracks". Critic Murray Chalmers noted: [...] ""Drop Dead/Celebration" [...] is still a wonderful explosion of bile aimed at their absconded guitarist and drummer, while Slap Dash Snap is prototype techno." [...] She underlined {{the diversity of the}} material: [...] "on more reflective tracks like Sea Of Light and Let Go you feel that here is a group who could go anywhere". She then stated: [...] "By CD2 they are firing on all cylinders, a pop group thrillingly ahead of the pack, CD3 is immaculate." [...] and considered the four tracks of The Thorn that end the box set as an [...] "orchestrated EP of ferocious intensity". Rock Sound shared a similar point of view and said: [...] "Whilst most bands regard the B-side as an <b>irrelevancy,</b> a dumping ground for throwaway tracks not deemed good enough for proper release, Siouxsie And The Banshees always treated it with respect, an excuse to have fun and experiment."

30|$|MPEG- 1 audio coding [1, 2] (including {{the popular}} Layer III {{also known as}} MP 3 audio coding), MPEG- 2 AAC (advanced audio coding) [3 – 5], and Dolby AC- 3 [6, 7] are some {{well-known}} audio coding methods for stereo and multichannel audio content. These methods mainly exploit the masking property of the human auditory system for shaping the quantization noise {{so that it will}} be inaudible. In addition to reducing the intrachannel redundancies and <b>irrelevancies,</b> these methods also include algorithms for exploring the interchannel redundancies, <b>irrelevancies,</b> more specifically mid/side coding [8], for frequencies below 2 [*]kHz, and intensity stereo coding [9] above 2 [*]kHz. M/S codes the sum and difference signals instead of the actual channels, operating in an approximate Karhunen-Loeve (K-L transform) manner. Intensity stereo is based on coding only the sum signal of the channels, as well as the time envelopes for each channel as side information, given that these envelopes are adequate for synthesizing the spatial image at the decoder. A useful introduction to several technologies for the more general area of audio compression can be found in [10]. More recently, exact KLT methods have been derived (e.g., [11]), while intensity stereo has been generalized for the entire frequency spectrum by MPEG Surround [12].|$|R

30|$|An audio {{fingerprint}} is {{a compact}} representation of an audio signal that extracts the most meaningful information of an audio excerpt. This representation, {{which is often}} restricted to binary values, {{has been used in}} different tasks [68 – 70] for several reasons: (1) the storage requirements of fingerprints are relatively small since binary values are employed, (2) the comparison of different fingerprints is efficient since perceptual <b>irrelevancies</b> have been removed, and (3) searching on fingerprint databases is efficient because the searching space is small [71] and almost all the operations are performed in a binary domain.|$|R

Yet, speech deteriorates with disease progression becoming “verbose and circuitous…empty and lacking meaningful content” (Appell et al. 1982). Vocabulary decreases and <b>irrelevancies</b> increase.
