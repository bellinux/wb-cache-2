40|$|Understanding {{the impacts}} of ever more severe and {{widespread}} drought events has become a central focus of recent ecological research. Accordingly, {{the objective of this}} study is to investigate fundamental mechanisms that control drought effects on climate sensitive ecosystems by regulating soil-plant interactions. Field experiments were conducted in high altitudinal grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau. Based on historical records, we simulated extreme drought events, intercepting water inputs in early (spring), mid (summer), and late (autumn) periods of the plant-growing season (PGS). We measured vegetation responses to changes in soil physical, chemical, and biological properties, examining how the interplay of abiotic and biotic processes regulate {{the impacts of}} drought above and below ground. Decreasing water input resulted in proportional increases in summer and autumn soil temperature, but reduced soil temperature during the spring drought. As a result, soil microbial biomass and available N and P concentrations remained stable during the early-PGS drought, while <b>enzymatic</b> activity, <b>decomposition</b> of organic materials, and nutrient release increased during the mid- and late-PGS. Concerted changes in microbial and plant activity determined seasonal fluctuations in carbon assimilation, microbial activity and nutrient dynamics, with varying degrees of resistance and resilience to drought stress observed at different PGS periods. Significant interactions were observed between plant productivity and microbial activity in response to moisture variability and associated changes in soil temperature, with the largest deleterious drought effects registered during the summer, when competition for limiting resources between plants and microorganisms was strongest...|$|R

During aquatic macrophytes decomposition, enzymes act mainly in the breakdown of lignocellulolytic matrix fibers (i. e. cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) that encompass the refractory fraction from organic matter. Considering the importance of enzymatic activities role in decomposition processes, this study aimed to describe the temporal changes of xylanase and cellulose activities during anaerobic decomposition of Ricciocarpus natans (freely-floating), Oxycaryum cubense (emergent) and Cabomba furcata (submersed). The aquatic macrophytes were collected in Óleo Lagoon, Luiz Antonio, São Paulo, Brazil and bioassays were accomplished. Decomposition chambers from each species (n = 10) were set up with dried macrophyte fragments and filtered Óleo Lagoon water. The chambers were incubated at 22. 5 oC, {{in the dark and}} under anaerobic conditions. Enzymatic activities and remaining organic matter were measured periodically during 90 days. The temporal variation of enzymes showed that C. furcata presented the highest decay and the highest maximum enzyme production.

50|$|Sulfenic acids are {{produced}} by the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>decomposition</b> of alliin and related compounds following tissue damage to garlic, onions, and other plants of the Allium genus. 1-Propenesulfenic acid, formed when onions are cut, is rapidly rearranged by a second enzyme, the lachrymatory factor synthase, giving syn-propanethial-S-oxide. 2-Propenesulfenic acid, formed from allicin, {{is thought to be}} responsible for garlic’s potent antioxidant activity. Mass spectrometry with a DART ion source were used to identify 2-propenesulfenic formed when garlic is cut or crushed and to demonstrate that this sulfenic acid has a lifetime of less than one second. The pharmacological activity of certain drugs, such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and prasugrel is proposed to involve sulfenic acid intermediates. Oxidation of cysteine residues in protein to the corresponding protein sulfenic acids is suggested to be important in redox-mediated signal transduction.|$|E
50|$|Lignin is {{resistant}} to breakdown and accumulates within the soil. It also reacts with amino acids, which further increases its resistance to decomposition, including <b>enzymatic</b> <b>decomposition</b> by microbes. Fats and waxes from plant matter have some resistance to decomposition and persist in soils for a while. Clay soils often have higher organic contents that persist longer than soils without clay as the organic molecules adhere to and are stabilised by the clay. Proteins normally decompose readily, but when bound to clay particles, {{they become more}} {{resistant to}} decomposition. Clay particles also absorb the enzymes exuded by microbes which would normally break down proteins. The addition of organic matter to clay soils can render that organic matter and any added nutrients inaccessible to plants and microbes for many years. High soil tannin (polyphenol) content can cause nitrogen to be sequestered in proteins or cause nitrogen immobilisation.|$|E

In {{this study we}} measured <b>enzymatic</b> activities, litter <b>decomposition</b> rates, carbon stocks and fungal and microbial biomasses in a boreal subarctic coniferous forest on a four age classes of non-stand replacing fire chronosequence (2, 42, 60 and 152 years after the fire). The results show that microbial activity recovered slowly after fire and the decomposition of new litter was affected by the disturbance. The percent mass loss of Scots pine litter increased with time from the last fire. Slow litter decomposition during the first post-fire years accelerates soil organic matter accumulation that {{is essential for the}} recovery of soil biological activities. Fire reduced the enzymatic activity across all the enzyme types measured. Carbon-degrading, chitin-degrading and phosphorus-dissolving enzymes showed different responses with the time elapsed since the fire disturbance. Microbial and enzymatic activity took decades before recovering to the levels observed in old forest stands. Our study demonstrates that slower post-fire litter decomposition has a pronounced impact on the recovery of soil organic matter following forest fires in northern boreal coniferous forests. 201...|$|R

These micro-organisms degrade leaf recalcitrant compounds like lignin, thereby enhancing {{the utilization of}} organic material by the microbial community. The main input of allochthonous organic matter in Mediterranean streams occurs during the autumn. In-stream breakdown processes can be affected by high physical abrasion during flooding but changes in stream water chemistry may also affect <b>decomposition</b> <b>enzymatic</b> activities of stream microorganisms. We measured two ligninolytic activities (phenol oxidase and peroxidase) and a cellulolytic activity (cellobiohydrolase) in leaves, branches, sand and gravel substrata in a reach of a Mediterranean stream. Highest ligninolytic activities were measured in biofilm developed on inorganic substrata (sand and gravel) where also accumulated the highest fungal biomass (ranging from 3. 3 x 10 - 4 to 7. 22 mg Ergosterol gAFDM- 1) especially in sand substrata. Conversely, cellulolytic activities were significantly higher in biofilm on organic substrata (leaves and branches). Physical and chemical factors, such as discharge and stream water nutrient concentration (Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen) were affecting enzymatic activities, particularly enhancing the phenol oxidase. Moreover, the chemical composition of the available OM (high cellulose in leaves, high lignin in detritic material) strongly influenced the decomposition activity in each biofilm. A precise description and quantification of the benthic substrata was used to obtain enzymatic activity values in terms of stream reach. Those results showed a temporal pattern in the decomposition activities in the reach, beginning with the decomposition of cellulose (October) followed by lignin compounds (November and December...|$|R

Furthermore, the application of media without organic nutrients makes it very probable that the volatiles emitted by moulds originated mostly from the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>decomposition</b> of the organic material and not from the metabolism of sugar which is usually in the media. Media were prepared in the shape of a slope (using 5  ml of medium) inside 20  ml sterile vials designed for headspace (HS) sampling. One type of medium used for cultivation of moulds was a modified version of Weary and Canby’s medium (W&C) [33, 34]. The second type of medium was a modified version of Czapek–Dox medium (Cz&D–BTL, Poland).|$|E

However, {{for a number of}} lignocellulosic substrates {{it has been shown that}} at increasing substrate concentration, the corresponding yield decreases in a fashion which can not be explained by current models and knowledge of enzyme-substrate interactions. This decrease in yield is undesirable as it offsets the advantages of working at high solids levels. The cause of the 'solids effect' has so far remained unknown. Results The decreasing conversion at increasing solids concentrations was found to be a generic or intrinsic effect, describing a linear correlation from 5 to 30 % initial total solids content (w/w). Insufficient mixing has previously been shown not to be involved in the effect. Hydrolysis experiments with filter paper showed that neither lignin content nor hemicellulose-derived inhibitors appear to be responsible for the decrease in yields. Product inhibition by glucose and in particular cellobiose (and ethanol in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation) at the increased concentrations at high solids loading plays a role but could not completely account for the decreasing conversion. Adsorption of cellulases was found to decrease at increasing solids concentrations. There was a strong correlation between the decreasing adsorption and conversion, indicating that the inhibition of cellulase adsorption to cellulose is causing the decrease in yield. Conclusion Inhibition of enzyme adsorption by hydrolysis products appear to be the main cause of the decreasing yields at increasing substrate concentrations in the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>decomposition</b> of cellulosic biomass. In order to facilitate high conversions at high solids concentrations, understanding of the mechanisms involved in high-solids product inhibition and adsorption inhibition must be improved. </p...|$|E
40|$|Enzyme-mediated {{decomposition}} of {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) is controlled, amongst other factors, by organic matter properties and by the microbial decomposer community present. Since microbial community composition and SOM properties are often interrelated and both change with soil depth, the drivers of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>decomposition</b> are hard to dissect. We investigated soils from three regions in the Siberian Arctic, where carbon rich topsoil material has been incorporated into the subsoil (cryoturbation). We took advantage of this subduction to test if SOM properties shape microbial community composition, and to identify controls of both on enzyme activities. We found that microbial community composition (estimated by phospholipid fatty acid analysis), was similar in cryoturbated material and in surrounding subsoil, although carbon and nitrogen contents were similar in cryoturbated material and topsoils. This suggests that the microbial community in cryoturbated material was not well adapted to SOM properties. We also measured three potential enzyme activities (cellobiohydrolase, leucine-amino-peptidase and phenoloxidase) and used structural equation models (SEMs) to identify direct and indirect drivers of the three enzyme activities. The models included microbial community composition, carbon and nitrogen contents, clay content, water content, and pH. Models for regular horizons, excluding cryoturbated material, showed that all enzyme activities were mainly controlled by carbon or nitrogen. Microbial community composition had no effect. In contrast, models for cryoturbated material showed that enzyme activities were also related to microbial community composition. The additional control of microbial community composition could have restrained enzyme activities and furthermore decomposition in general. The functional decoupling of SOM properties and microbial community composition might thus {{be one of the}} reasons for low decomposition rates and the persistence of 400 Gt carbon stored in cryoturbated material.
