40|$|Abstract-A {{system for}} {{interpretation}} {{of images of}} paper-based line drawings is described. Since a typical drawing contains both test strings and graphics, an algorithm has been developed to locate and separate text strings of various font size, style, and orientation. This is accom-plished by applying the Hough transform to the centroids of connected components in the image. The graphics in the segmented image is pro-cessed to represent thin entities by their core-lines and thick objects by their boundaries. The core-lines and boundaries are segmented into straight line segments and curved lines. The line segments and their interconnections are analyzed to locate minimum redundancy loops which are adequate to generate a succinct description of the graphics. Such a description includes the location and attributes of simple po-lygonal shapes, circles, and interconnecting lines, and {{a description of the}} spatial relationships and occlusions among them. Hatching and fill-ing patterns are also identified. The performance of the system is eval-uated using several test images and the results are presented. The su-periority of these algorithms in generating meaningful interpretations of graphics, compared to conventional data compression schemes, is clear from these results.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} nascent {{trends in}} forest conservation and regeneration within a Panamanian agricultural frontier previously characterised by forest <b>conversion.</b> <b>Drawing</b> upon household surveys, archival analysis, interviews, and satellite-image analysis, its {{focuses on the}} interactions amongst settlers concerned with agricultural livelihoods, community institutions concerned with forest conservation and restoration within watersheds, and corporate timber interest concerned with plantation reforestation. In this context, forest conservation and regeneration depends on the harmonious yet accidental convergence of lesser, self-interested forest-use trends amongst these agents of change. Where such harmonious convergence is impeded, neither conservation nor regeneration is possible, and the inertia of deforestation overtakes all gains in this respect. Opportunistic land sales by settlers and commercial reforestation incentives have promoted corporate timber interests to the fore of reforestation, yet a lack authority {{on the part of}} community institutions and high costs imposed by settlers have hindered forest restoration within community lands. Disharmonies limiting forest conservation and restoration reflect economic realities favouring household deforestation; yet their resolution requires institutional, rather than economic, intervention, such as tenure reform.

40|$|Recently, {{researchers}} {{have begun to}} recognize that, {{in order to establish}} neutral models for disease association and evolutionary genomics studies, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the genomic impact of nonallelic gene <b>conversion.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on previous successes in characterizing this phenomenon over protein-coding gene families, we undertook a computational analysis of neighboring Alu sequences in the genome scale. For this purpose, we developed adjusted comutation rate (aCMR), a novel statistical method measuring the excess number of identical point mutations shared by adjacent Alu sequences, vis-à-vis random pairs. Using aCMR, we uncovered a remarkable genome-wide sequence homogenization of neighboring Alus, with the strongest signal observed in the pseudoautosomal regions of the X and Y chromosomes. The magnitude of sequence homogenization between Alu pairs is greater with shorter interlocus distance, higher sequence identity, and parallel orientation. Moreover, shared substitutions show a strong directionality toward GC nucleotides, with multiple substitutions tending to cluster within the Alu sequence. Taken together, these observed recombination-associated sequence homogenization patterns are best explained by frequent ubiquitous gene conversion events between neighboring Alus. We believe that these observations help to illuminate the nature and impact of the enigmatic phenomenon of gene conversion...|$|R

40|$|Aerial {{oxidation}} of dopamine at concentrations {{as low as}} 50 mu M in {{the presence}} of ferrous ions in phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) led in the early stages (6 - 8 h) to the formation of the quinone of the neurotoxin B-hydroxydopamine, 2, followed (24 h) by a complex product pattern comprising main components norepinephrine (5), 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzaldehyde (4), and the neurotoxic alkaloid 6, 7 -dihydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroisoquinoline (3). Product formation required the assistance of metal ions such as Mn(II), Zn(II), and iron, in either the ferrous or ferric form. Product yields were shown to vary linearly with iron and dopamine concentration in the early phases of the reaction (2 h). Biologically relevant antioxidants, like glutathione and ascorbate, and metal chelators, e. g., 2, 2 '-bipyridyl, inhibited dopamine conversion to products 2 - 5, but not substrate consumption, while hydroxyl radical scavengers such as DMSO and mannitol did not alter the course of the reaction. On the contrary, mannitol increased product yields, an effect seen for other monosaccharides. Catalase exhibited a significant inhibitory effect particularly on the formation of 3 and 4. By using O- 18 (2), evidence was obtained for incorporation of the label into the carbonyl oxygen of 4, but not into the hydroxyl group of 5. On the basis of these and other results, a complete mechanistic picture of the oxidation is <b>drawn</b> involving <b>conversion</b> of dopamine to the corresponding o-quinone and its quinonemethide tautomer with concomitant reduction of Oa to H 2 O 2 Nucleophilic attack by H 2 O to the quinonemethide gives rise to 5, while H 2 O 2 addition leads to benzaldehyde 4 via a beta-amino-hydroperoxide intermediate. This latter reaction path also gives formaldehyde which yields the isoquinoline 3 by Pictet-Spengler condensation with dopamine. The quinone 2 results from H 2 O 2 attack at the 6 -position of dopamine o-quinone in agreement with previous studies. These results provide an insight into new routes of nonenzymatic conversion of dopamine to its metabolite norepinephrine and neurotoxic species which may become operative under conditions relevant to neurodegeneration...|$|R
40|$|Conversion {{is one of}} {{the very}} {{productive}} means of forming new words in English morphology. It is a derivational process that includes no overt marking; i. e. there is no difference in the form even though the lexical category of the word has changed from one class to another. The main goal of this thesis is to provide a critical and informative analysis of conversion in English throughout distinct time periods and try to explain the problems that are left unanswered regarding this topic. There are two main approaches {{that are going to be}} presented in this research, such as synchronic analysis on conversion in the first part, and then a historical perspective will be examined in the second part of the research. For the synchronic analysis, in addition to representing the types of conversion in Present-Day English in greater detail, many controversial questions raised on conversion in English will be thoroughly investigated with numerous examples explicated; there are four main problems that are raised in this linguistic field, namely the problem of directionality, the problem of definition of conversion, syntactic approach of conversion, and the issue of productivity. The purpose of this part of study is to outline a number of different linguistic theories that has been proposed on conversion. In addition to this, a historical perspective of conversion in English will be examined as a diachronic approach of analysis. The word formation process of conversion has been present for centuries in the language (Biese 1942). Little attention has been <b>drawn</b> on <b>conversion</b> historically. Apart from the fact that there have not been many studies in this linguistic area, the purposes of this diachronic study are to deliver instructive, unified and meticulous descriptions on conversion with a great deal of comprehensive historical exemplifications and also to be able to trace, with confidence, the practicable and more reliable explanations to the essential questions that arise. I will divide this part into four sub-sections, namely conversion in Old English, conversion in Middle English, and conversion in Early Modern English, and manipulate the instances of conversion in each period and find out how the morphological process; i. e. conversion, evolved which hopefully shed insights on rather practical and explicative answers to the problems of conversion...|$|R

A merchant of Meliapor being just ready to embark for Malacca, went to take his leave of him. In receiving his blessing, he begged of him some little token of his friendship. The Father, who was very poor, could find nothing to give him but the chaplet which was hanging at his neck: [...] "This chaplet,"[1] said he to the merchant, [...] "shall not be unprofitable to you, provided you repose your trust in the Virgin Mary." [...] The merchant went away in full assurance of the divine protection, and without fear of pirates, winds, or rocks; but God would make a trial of his faith. He had already almost crossed, without the least hazard, the great gulph which is betwixt Meliapor and Malacca, when suddenly there blew a furious storm, the sails were torn, the rudder broken, and the mast came by the board, and the vessel afterwards being driven against the rocks, was split: The greatest part of the seamen and passengers were drowned; some of them held upon the rocks, where they were cast away, and the merchant himself was of that number; but, being upon the wide sea, and not having wherewithal to supply nature, to avoid dying by hunger, they took a resolution which only despair could have inspired; having gathered up some floating planks of their wrecked vessel, and joining them together the best they could, they put themselves upon them, and abandoned their safety to the mercy of the waves, without other hope than of lighting on some current which might possibly carry them on shore.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} FPGA/NIOS {{implementation}} of an adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filter based on linear prediction to suppress {{radio frequency interference}} (RFI). This technique {{will be used for}} experiments that observe coherent radio emission from extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. These experiments are designed to make a detailed study of the development of the electromagnetic part of air showers. Therefore, these radio signals provide information that is complementary to that obtained by water-Cherenkov detectors which are predominantly sensitive to the particle content of an air shower at ground. The radio signals from air showers are caused by the coherent emission due to geomagnetic and charge-excess processes. These emissions can be observed in the frequency band between 10 - 100 MHz. However, this frequency range is significantly contaminated by narrow-band RFI and other human-made distortions. A FIR filter implemented in the FPGA logic segment of the front-end electronics of a radio sensor significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper we discuss an adaptive filter which is based on linear prediction. The coefficients for the linear predictor (LP) are dynamically refreshed and calculated in the embedded NIOS processor, which is implemented in the same FPGA chip. The Levinson recursion, used to obtain the filter coefficients, is also implemented in the NIOS and is partially supported by direct multiplication in the DSP blocks of the logic FPGA segment. Tests confirm that the LP can be an alternative to other methods involving multiple time-to-frequency domain conversions using an FFT procedure. These multiple <b>conversions</b> <b>draw</b> heavily on the power consumption of the FPGA and are avoided by the linear prediction approach. Minimization of the power consumption is an important issue because the final system will be powered by solar panels. The FIR filter has been successfully tested in the Altera development kits with the EP 4 CE 115 F 29 C 7 from the Cyclone IV family and the EP 3 C 120 F 780 C 7 from the Cyclone III family at a 170 MHz sampling rate, a 12 -bit I/O resolution, and an internal 30 -bit dynamic range. Most of the slow floating-point NIOS calculations have been moved to the FPGA logic segments as extended fixed-point operations, which significantly reduced the refreshing time of the coefficients used in the LP. We conclude that the LP is a viable alter-native to other methods such as non-adaptive methods involving digital notch filters or multiple time-to-frequency domain conversions using an FFT procedure. ...|$|R
40|$|The world faces a {{humanitarian}} crisis of massive proportions {{as millions of}} refugees move across national borders around the globe. Many of these refugees, however, eventually return to their nation of origin. The United Nations considers repatriation as the preferred outcome for refugees, and national governments also strongly support it. We have little knowledge, however, {{about what happens to}} refugees when they return home. My fieldwork project used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate one example of a repatriation movement: Liberian refugees returning from their exile in Ghana. I looked first at a Liberian refugee camp in Ghana, and later at refugees returning to Liberia itself. One of the aims of my study was not only to develop a detailed understanding of how repatriation occurred for this group, but to generate insights that could inform and improve policies being formulated in response to the current mass migrations. My research focuses particularly on the role of Pentecostal churches, since these churches were observed to be a major influence on the lives of refugees both in migration and when they return. Pentecostalism is the fastest growing religious movement in the world, and my informants used aspects of Pentecostalism to distance themselves from painful events in their past, even though they were not able to do this completely. A significant part of my research therefore focused on issues of continuity and discontinuity surrounding the practice of religious conversion, and became linked to some important theoretical questions and considerations. I found that refugees in Ghana were <b>drawn</b> to Pentecostal <b>conversions</b> because they facilitated a break with the past, which included not only the war, but also some long-standing Liberian cultural practices. When refugees returned to Liberia they once again noticed that they could not completely break with their past. Although the Pentecostal churches were important mechanisms for reintegration, tensions reemerged as returnees struggled to maintain their identity as Pentecostal believers while simultaneously confronting recent Liberian history, traditions, institutions and ethnic identities. As forced displacement transforms societies around the world, my findings suggest that refugees are not masses of culturally unchanging people, but actors who must constantly maneuver between different identities in ever-changing cultural environments. Anthropology?s approach affords us a finer and more nuanced understanding of why migrants behave as they do. This understanding, in turn, can lead to policies that are more appropriate to the lived realities of displaced people, especially with regards to the timings and outcomes of repatriation movements...|$|R
40|$|Australia is {{following}} international trends in individualising disability support funding {{as a means}} of offering greater choice and self-direction in how funds are used to purchase services. This approach is shaped by disability legislation and policy which reflects the human rights principles enshrined in Victoria&rsquo;s Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which Australia ratified in 2008. As well as choice and control, proponents also argue for the economic benefits of individualised funding arrangements, particularly as demographic changes place increased pressure on social support and care budgets. Australia&rsquo;s National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is based on individualised packages and when fully implemented in 2019 / 20 will have an expected 460, 000 participants at a projected annual cost of $ 22. 1 billion. But despite enthusiastic and bipartisan support, debates continue regarding core ideological and practical tensions. These relate to the conflict between the neoliberal individualism of the overarching personalisation narrative and the collective citizenship roots of disability rights values. There are also concerns about the speed of implementation in the absence of adequate empirical research. This study is located amidst these dichotomous debates. The emotional and economic investment in the NDIS requires that lessons from the local and international experience are used to inform critical thinking about implementation (van Toorn &amp; Soldatic, 2015; Duffy &amp; Williams, 2012). This study aimed to contribute by exploring the example of Victoria&rsquo;s Individualised Support Package (ISP) program from the perspectives of people using ISPs and service providers. The research sought to understand if, how, for whom, and under what conditions the ISP program fulfilled its rights promise of greater choice and self-determination. An emergent capabilities and rights based framework was used to analyse data from semi structured interviews with participants. Findings suggest that linking people with individualised resources does not produce choice {{in the absence of the}} social relations and structural conditions in which it can flourish. The relationship between individualised resources and meaningful opportunities was shown to be complex and contingent, shaped by a network of interdependent mechanisms and relationships which acted to expand or constrain everyday choice and self-determination. The concept of <b>conversion,</b> <b>drawn</b> from the capabilities framework, explained these dynamics and the conditions required to transform the latent potential of formal and natural resources into meaningful outcomes. Conversion factors related to fundamental program elements, personal and social characteristics and resources, service approaches, and structural and contextual conditions. A key finding was that ISP resourcing and planning typically underfunded and underplayed the factors responsible for conversion. There was insufficient recognition of the relational nature of choice and self-determination and the implications of this for planning and services. Instead, the real costs associated with the thinking, linking and bridging work of self-determination were frequently shifted to individuals, family carers, and services. This study has implications for policy, practice and future research centring on how individualised funding models can more effectively and equitably acknowledge, fund, and enable conversion of individualised resources and the relationships and mechanisms therein...|$|R
40|$|The American Academy of Microbiology {{convened a}} {{colloquium}} March 10 - 12, 2006, in San Francisco, California, {{to discuss the}} production of energy fuels by microbial conversions. The status of research into various microbial energy technologies, {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each of these approaches, research needs in the field, and education and training issues were examined, with the goal of identifying routes for producing biofuels that would both decrease the need for fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, the choices for providing energy are limited. Policy makers and the research community must begin to pursue a broader array of potential energy technologies. A diverse energy portfolio that includes an assortment of microbial energy choices will allow communities and consumers to select the best energy solution for their own particular needs. Funding agencies and governments alike need to prepare for future energy needs by investing both in the microbial energy technologies that work today and in the untested technologies that will serve the world’s needs tomorrow. More mature bioprocesses, such as ethanol production from starchy materials and methane from waste digestors, will find applications in the short term. However, innovative techniques for liquid fuel or biohydrogen production are among the longer term possibilities that should also be vigorously explored, starting now. Microorganisms can help meet human energy needs in any of a number of ways. In their most obvious role in energy conversion, microorganisms can generate fuels, including ethanol, hydrogen, methane, lipids, and butanol, which can be burned to produce energy. Alternatively, bacteria can be put to use in microbial fuel cells, where they carry out the direct conversion of biomass into electricity. Microorganisms may also be used some day to make oil and natural gas technologies more efficient by sequestering carbon or by assisting in the recovery of oil and natural gas from the subsurface. The participants discussed [...] key microbial conversion paths; overarching research issues; current funding models and microbial energy research; education, training, interdisciplinary cooperation and communication. Their recommendations are [...] Cellulose and lignocellulose are the preferred substrates for producing liquid transportation fuels, of which ethanol is the most commonly considered example. Generating fuels from these materials is still difficult and costly. A number of challenges need to be met in order to make the conversion of cellulose and lignocellulose to transportation fuels more cost-competitive. The design of hydrogen-producing bioreactors must be improved in order to more effectively manage hydrogen removal, oxygen exclusion, and, in the case of photobioreactors, to capture light energy more efficiently. Methane production may be optimized by fine-tuning methanogenic microbial communities. The ability to transfer electrons to an anode in a microbial fuel cell is probably very broadly distributed in the bacterial world. The scientific community needs a larger inventory of cultivated microorganisms from which to <b>draw</b> for energy <b>conversion</b> development. New and unusual organisms for manufacturing fuels and for use in fuel cells can be discovered using bioprospecting techniques. Particular emphasis should be placed on finding microbes, microbial communities, and enzymes that can enhance the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to usable sugars. Many of the microbial processes critical to energy conversion are carried out by complex communities of organisms, and there is a need to better understand the community interactions that make these transformations possible. Better understanding of microbial community structure, robustness, networks, homeostasis, and cell-to-cell signaling is also needed. A better understanding of the basic enzymology of microorganisms is needed in order to move forward more quickly with microbial energy production. Research should focus on the actions of enzymes and enzyme complexes within the context of the whole cell, how they’re regulated, where they’re placed, and what they interact with. Better modeling tools are needed to facilitate progress in microbial energy transformations. Models of metabolic dynamics, including levels of reductants and regulation of electron flow need to be improved. Global techno-economic models of microbial energy conversion systems, which seek to simultaneously describe the resource flows into and out of a system as well as its economics, are needed and should be made publicly available on the internet. More emphasis needs to be placed on multidisciplinary education and training and on cooperation between disciplines in order to make the most of microbial energy conversion technologies and to meet the research needs of the future...|$|R
