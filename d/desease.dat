40|$|With {{development}} of the fish culturing in the sea, the interest in their health also increased. The reason for this are diseases or rather mortality that occur in such controlled cultures and cause great economic losses. By growing large quantities of fish in rather small species, natural conditions are changed, so fish is more sensitive and prone to infection agents (viruses, bacteria, parasites). Besides, a large fish density in the cultural process accelerates spreading if the diseases, but also enables a better perception of them. In wild populations sick specimen very quickly become predator’s prey, witch {{makes it difficult to}} note any pathological changes in such fish. There are lots of articles on viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases nowdays, but this work deals exclusively with bacterial <b>deseases</b> that occur in the controlled sea cultures (vibriosis, furunculosis, pastherelosis, nocardiosis, mycobaceriosis, edwardsielosis, yersiniosis, <b>deseases</b> caused by bacteria of genera Flexibacter, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Streptococus and bacteria nephryithis).

To promote better {{treatment}} outcome, as well {{as economic}} benefit {{it is very important to}} find out patients with simultaneous occurrence of both aortic and arterial aneurysms. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the frequency and factors affecting femoropopliteal (F-P) segment aneurysms appearance in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Methods. This study included 70 patients who had underwent elective or urgent surgery of AAA from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2007. After ultrasonographic examination of F-P segment, all the patients were divided into two groups - those with adjunctive F-P segment aneurysm (n = 20) and the group of 50 patients with no adjunctive F-P segment aneurysm. In both groups demographic characteristics (gender, age), risk factors (diabetes mellitus, elevated serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, arterial hypertension, smoking, obesity) and cardiovascular comorbidity (cerebrovascular <b>desease,</b> ischemic heart <b>desease)</b> were investigated. Results. Twenty (28. 57 %) patients who had been operated on because of AAA, had adjunctive aneurysmal <b>desease</b> of F-P segment. Diabetes was no statistically significantly more present among the patients who, beside AAA, had adjunctive aneurismal <b>desease</b> of F-P segment (χ 2 = 0. 04; DF = 1; p > 0. 05). Also, in both groups there was no statistically significant difference in gender structure (χ 2 = 2. 05; DF = 2; p > 0. 05), age (χ 2 = 5. 46; DF = 1; p > 0. 05), total cholesterol level (χ 2 = 0. 89; DF = 1; p > 0. 05) and triglyceride (χ 2 = 0. 89; DF = 1; p > 0. 05) levels, the presence of arterial hypertension (χ 2 = 1. 38; DF = 2; p > 0. 05), smoking (χ 2 = 1. 74; DF = 1; p > 0. 05), obesity (χ 2 = 1. 76; DF = 1; p > 0. 05) and presence of cerebrovascular <b>desease</b> (χ 2 = 2. 34; DF = 1; p > 0. 05). Conversly, ischemic heart <b>desease</b> was statistically significantly more present among the patients who, beside AAA, had adjunctive aneurismal <b>desease</b> of F-P segment (χ 2 = 5. 45; DF = 1; p < 0. 05).

Meat is excelent source of proteins with high biological value. The proteins from meat are of high quality because they contain high share of essencial amino acids which are necessary for human organism. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, esspecialy those from ω 3 group, became very importat to human nutritionists because they have significant role in prevention of stress induced <b>deseases</b> and of those induced by improper diets. New findings from western industrial countries point {{out the fact that}} longer intake of LA (ω- 6) with relative “deficiency” of ω- 3 is the main risk factor in occurence of cancer, coronary <b>deseases</b> (CHD), cerebrovascular <b>deseases</b> (CVD) and alergic hyperactivity; not cholesterol as was considered till now. Therefore it is important to reduce the ω- 6 / ω- 3 acids ratio in meat and milk using some feedstufs in diets of animals. Dairy products contribute to health throughout life. Epidemiological researches as well as studies in animals and humans indicate that dairy food and/or their components have a protective effect against cancer. The potential anticancer agents identified so far in dairy foods include conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), calcium, vitamin D, sphingomyelin, butyric acid, ether lipids, protein and lactic acid bacteria. Milk is exclusive source of nutrients for the young and it also represents a high grade source of dietary nitrogen and indispensable amino acids for adults.
