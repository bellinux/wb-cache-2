The second was that if data was held in a non-electronic form but could readily be turned into <b>electronic</b> <b>form,</b> then it constituted data {{for the purposes of the}} act.

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>forms</b> is an {{emerging}} market {{that is being}} incorporated into daily use in many corporations and small businesses. In the transition from paper <b>forms</b> to <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> many users are merely recreating the paper forms digitally to create an exact replica on screen. This is being done through the utilization of page layout programs such as QuarkXpress and PageMaker {{as well as through}} the aid of <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> software programs available today. These software programs aid the user with forms design, often providing templates of forms that are in a graphical format containing rules, logos, and other graphically embellishing elements. The <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> industry is also moving towards a workgroup computing environment where intelligent forms can automatically be sent electronically to other users in the workplace without ever printing onto paper. However, the graphic elements involved in the <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> of today can slow down networks and require many bytes of memory for storage especially in major corporations who may have thousands of forms on file. A comparison of the graphically embellished form versus a straight data-entry questions only form format needs to be researched. The purpose of this thesis project is to provide the <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> industry with knowledge as to {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} both a graphical form and a straight data-entry form. This research also performed a series of tests as to the timeliness, accuracy of data entered, and user 2 ̆ 7 s preference for both graphically embellished forms and straight questions-only forms...|$|R

40|$|Published version. Also {{available}} at [URL] Background: Mobile health (mHealth) applications, such as innovative <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> on smartphones, could potentially improve {{the performance of}} health care workers and health systems in developing countries. However, contextual evidence on health workers’ barriers and motivating factors that may influence large-scale implementation of such interfaces for health care delivery is scarce. Methods: A pretested semistructured questionnaire {{was used to assess}} health workers’ experiences, barriers, preferences, and motivating factors in using mobile health forms on smartphones in the context of maternal health care in Ethiopia. Twenty-five health extension workers (HEWs) and midwives, working in 13 primary health care facilities in Tigray region, Ethiopia, participated in this study. Results: Over a 6 -month period, a total of 2, 893 electronic health records of 1, 122 women were submitted to a central computer through the Internet. Sixteen (69. 6 %) workers believed the forms were good reminders on what to do and what questions needed to be asked. Twelve (52. 2 %) workers said <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> were comprehensive and 9 (39. 1 %) workers saw <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> as learning tools. All workers preferred unrestricted use of the smartphones and believed it helped them adapt to the smartphones and <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> for work purposes. With regards to language preference, 18 (78. 3 %) preferred using the local language (Tigrinya) version of the forms to English. Indentified barriers for not using <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> consistently include challenges related to <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> (for example, problem with username and password setting as reported by 5 (21. 7 %), smartphones (for example, smartphone froze or locked up as reported by 9 (39. 1 %) and health system (for example, frequent movement of health workers as reported by 19 (82. 6 %)). Conclusions: Both HEWs and midwives found the <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> on smartphones useful for their day-to-day maternal health care services delivery. However, sustainable use and implementation of such work tools at scale would be daunting without providing technical support to health workers, securing mobile network airtime and improving key functions of the larger health system...|$|R
