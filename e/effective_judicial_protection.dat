2500|$|However, only {{a limited}} number of people can bring claims for {{judicial}} review. Under TFEU article 263(2), a member state, the Parliament, Council or Commission have automatic rights to seek judicial review. But under article 263(4) a [...] "natural or legal person" [...] must have a [...] "direct and individual concern" [...] about the regulatory act. [...] "Direct" [...] concern means that someone is affected by an EU act without [...] "the interposition of an autonomous will between the decision and its effect", for instance by a national government body. In Piraiki-Patraiki v Commission, a group of Greek textile businesses, who exported cotton products to France, challenged a Commission decision allow France to limit exports. The Commission argued that the exporters were not directly concerned, because France might decide not to limit exports, but the Court of Justice held this possibility was [...] "entirely theoretical". A challenge could be brought. By contrast in Municipality of Differdange v Commission a municipality wanted to challenge the Commissions decision to aid steel firms which reduced production: this would probably reduce its tax collections. But the Court of Justice held that because Luxembourg had discretion, and its decision to reduce capacity was not inevitable, the municipality had no [...] "direct" [...] concern (its complaint was with the Luxembourg government instead). [...] "Individual" [...] concern requires that someone is affected specifically, not as a member of a group. In Plaumann & Co v Commission the Court of Justice held that a clementine importer was not individually concerned when the Commission refused permission to Germany to stop import custom duties. This kept it more expensive for Mr Plaumann to import clementines, but it was equally expensive for everyone else. This decision heavily restricted the number of people who could claim for judicial review. In Unión de Pequeños Agricultores, Advocate General Jacobs propose a broader test of allowing anyone to claim if there was a [...] "substantial adverse effect" [...] on the claimant's interests. Here, a group of Spanish olive oil producers challenged Council Regulation No 1638/98, which withdrew subsidies. Because Regulations are not implemented in national law, but have direct effect, they argued the requirement for individual concern would deny them <b>effective</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>protection.</b> The Court of Justice held that direct actions were still not allowed: if this was unsatisfactory the member states would have to change the treaties. Individual concern is not needed, however under article 263(4), if an act is not legislation, but just a [...] "regulatory act". In Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami v Parliament and Council the Court of Justice affirmed that a Regulation does not count as a [...] "regulatory act" [...] within the Treaty's meaning: it is only meant for acts of lesser importance. Here, a Canadian group representing the Inuit people wished to challenge a Regulation on seal products, but were not allowed. They would have to show both direct and individual concern as normal. Thus, without a treaty change, EU administrative law remains one of the most restrictive in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the coming}} into force of the Charter as primary law of the EU, Article 47 CFR is ‘the {{reference}} standard’ when the Court deals with issues of ffective judicial protection. However, the general principle of <b>effective</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>protection</b> existed already for some 25 years, developed in the case law of the Union courts. While the interpretation and application of Article 47 build upon this case law, a number of changes can be pointed out. What was formerly under the loose umbrella of <b>effective</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>protection</b> and related principles is now split over three different articles of the Charter. On the one hand, these provisions are partly overlapping; on the other hand, their configuration also leads to a lacuna. This gap is bridged by the unwritten general principles such as the rights of defence. When compared to the pre-Charter era, Article 52 (1) CFR structures the review of limitations of fundamental rights in a more compelling fashion. Specifically for Article 47 CFR, which has to be interpreted in harmony with Article 6 ECHR, the implicit limitations of Article 6 ECHR constitute a potential trap of ‘double limitation’. Article 47 may be relied upon by individuals alleging a violation of rights and freedoms conferred upon them by EU law. However, the principle of <b>effective</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>protection</b> is broader in application, providing protection against acts that adversely affect an individual’s interests.

40|$|The {{right of}} private {{applicants}} to bring actions for annulment in European Union courts is regulated by article 263 (4) TFEU. According to the article, private parties may bring actions for annulment only in three situations. First, {{as stated in}} the first limb, they may institute proceedings against an act addressed to them. Second, the second limb enables instituting proceedings against an act, which is of direct and individual concern to them. The third limb and last possibility is to institute proceedings against a regulatory act, which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures. These limitations raise {{the question of whether the}} <b>effective</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>protection</b> is sufficiently ensured in the Union legal order. The principle of <b>effective</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>protection</b> is a general principle of Union law. It can be seen as one of the emanations of rule of law, which is a foundational value of the European Union. The principle is also laid down in article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is inspired by articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention of Human Rights. The judicial protection in the European Union rests on two pillars: the Union remedies and the remedies before national courts. Although the European Union offers a complete legal system of legal remedies and procedures, the effectiveness of the alternative remedies is not always adequate. The Court of Justice of the European Union has consequently interpreted especially the criterion of individual concern strictly. However, it has used a more generous approach in the fields of competition, state aid, and anti-dumping. It seems like the Court has been more willing to safeguard the effectiveness of European Union law than the <b>effective</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>protection</b> of individuals.
