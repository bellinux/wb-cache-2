5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2006 at 4:45 pm, a {{structural}} {{failure in the}} 'Rose Bowl' section of the ride created a bump on the track that caused a train {{to come to an}} abrupt stop. Twenty-seven injuries were reported in the accident and rescue units were required to evacuate the riders. Most of the injuries were of the chest or neck. Seventeen people were released from the hospital within five hours of the accident, and two were admitted. None of the injuries were life-threatening. After an inspection the following day, the park stated that the accident was caused by a crack or split in the wood. The ride was shut <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extended period of time, while the park worked with the State of Ohio to complete a full investigation. The park completed repairs of the ride but the state asked for extensive testing to be done to ensure it would not happen again. The park indicated that the ride would not reopen until the 2007 season.|$|E

25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted {{in a direction}} that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it <b>down.</b> <b>For</b> <b>an</b> example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not the}} direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E

25|$|The feud {{ended on}} February 24, 2002, at Pride 19, where Shamrock fought Frye {{in the main}} event in a match that {{potentially}} had PRIDE Heavyweight Championship title implications (PRIDE FC considered giving the winner of this fight a title shot against Pride heavyweight champion Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira). Frye got the edge {{on a series of}} clinch battles, while Shamrock dropped <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ankle lock and transitioned into both a kneebar and a toehold, wrenching Frye's leg badly; however, despite the damage, Frye refused to tap out and managed to knock Shamrock down in a subsequent punching exchange. The bout moved to the mat, where Shamrock attempted another ankle lock, only for Frye to try to counter with one of his own and finally refusing to tap out by sheer will until the time ran out. Shamrock lost a close split decision, and the two hugged after the fight ended, putting an end to their rivalry.|$|E
25|$|Craig {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} when his best friend, Chris Warner (Michael Galvin), hired him to be run the Emergency Department. Craig at first clashed with Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) before the two briefly dated. The arrival of Craig's ex-wife, Paula (Vivian Bell) and his brother Brett (Colin Moy), for whom she had left Craig, caused trouble when Brett died and Paula tried to reignite the marriage. Craig kicked Paula out and in 2005 started to date Huia (Nicola Kawana). However, he unsuccessfully tried to persuade Sarah to return to him over fiancé Andrew (Paolo Rotondo). Craig's anger problems began to destroy his relationship with Huia and when she stood him <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> outburst, he broke it off and returned to Sarah. However, while at a conference, Craig had a one-night stand with, and impregnated, Huia. Sarah broke it off with him and Huia and their child died in an explosion. Craig confessed his love for Sarah only to lose out on her to Huia's cousin TK (Benjamin Mitchell).|$|E

500|$|The {{situation}} with Leighton meant that Scotland {{were forced to}} make a half-time substitution, replacing the goalkeeper with Alan Rough, whose last international had been against the Soviet Union during the 1982 World Cup Finals. The second half began with Wales remaining {{in control of the}} game as they had been during the first half, with their best chance coming when Ian Rush mis-hit {{what appeared to be a}} simple tap-in, causing it to pass wide. As a consequence, with an hour of the game gone, Stein made his second and final substitution, withdrawing Strachan and replacing him with Davie Cooper on the left-hand side. Cooper had a reputation for being somewhat he was considered to be one of the most gifted Scottish players of his generation, but was regarded as the type of player who could be anonymous throughout games. On this occasion, Cooper's introduction had an impact and caused the home side to look vulnerable for the first time. However, although Scotland were gaining in confidence, they were running out of time, with the Welsh defenders able to absorb the pressure and use the long clearance to get the ball upfield towards Hughes and Rush, who held the ball and waited for reinforcement from their midfielders. Scotland had already had a penalty claim turned <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> apparent push on David Speedie when, with nine minutes left, Nicol crossed into the Welsh box. The ball was nodded down by Graeme Sharp into Speedie's path; his shot, which appeared to be heading over the crossbar, struck defender David Phillips on the elbow and led to the Dutch referee awarding Scotland a penalty. It was Cooper who stepped up to assume responsibility to take the spot kick: ...|$|E
