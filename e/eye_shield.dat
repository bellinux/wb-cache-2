50|$|A {{more recent}} {{addition}} to the football helmet is the visor or <b>eye</b> <b>shield,</b> which is affixed to the face mask to protect players from glare or eye injuries, such as pokes. It is believed that {{the first player to}} use a protective visor Mark Mullaney of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings in 1984, in order to protect a healing eye injury. Top manufacturers of visors are Nike, Oakley, and Under Armour, with Leader being the first to come out with a visor/shield for former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon. While Mullaney and McMahon's visors were tinted, most of the earlier visors were clear or smoked, but they are now offered in a variety of styles ranging from blue, gold, black, rainbow, silver, or amber. High-school and pee-wee leagues prohibit all but clear visors. This rule was enacted so that training staff and coaches can easily view a player's face and eyes {{in the case of a}} serious injury, to discern if the player is conscious. The NCAA banned the use of tinted visors for the same reason, and the NFL has followed suit as well. However, players with eye problems may still obtain special permission to wear tinted visors, some notable examples being LaDainian Tomlinson and Chris Canty.|$|E

40|$|Metallic eye shields {{have been}} widely used for near-eye {{treatments}} to protect critical regions, but have never been incorporated into treatment plans because of the unwanted appearance of the metal artifacts on CT images. The purpose of this work was to test the use of an acrylic dummy <b>eye</b> <b>shield</b> as a substitute for a metallic <b>eye</b> <b>shield</b> during CT scans. An acrylic dummy shield of {{the same size as the}} tungsten <b>eye</b> <b>shield</b> was machined and CT scanned. The BEAMnrc and the DOSXYZnrc were used for the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, with the appropriate material information and density for the aluminum cover, steel knob and tungsten body of the <b>eye</b> <b>shield.</b> The Pinnacle adopting the Hogstrom electron pencil-beam algorithm was used for the one-port 6 -MeV beam plan after delineation and density override of the metallic parts.

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} {{and knowledge of}} dose delivered under <b>eye</b> <b>shield</b> during superficial X-ray radiotherapy is required for patient peripheral dose assessment. Critical structures can include the cornea, lens and retina. Measurement of dose under eye shields has been historically performed with Thermoluminescent Dosimeters (TLD 2 ̆ 7 s) due to their small size and design. Restrictions include the energy dependence {{and the fact that}} they only provide a point dose assessment. This note investigates the use of a low energy dependence radiochromic thin film for measurement of dose under eye shields in a phantom and compares results to theoretical calculation of dose. Results have shown a good match between predicted and experimentally measured results at the centre of an <b>eye</b> <b>shield</b> irradiated with 50 kVp and 150 kVp beams. The added advantage of radiochromic film compared to TLD measurements is the two dimensional dose map which is recorded for the assessment of dose providing not only an assessment at the site of the cornea, lens and retina in a phantom but in other areas as well. Radiochromic film has been found to accurately measure dose under <b>eye</b> <b>shield</b> in phantom treatments...|$|E
40|$|Background: Conjunctival {{contamination}} from splashed debris during orthopaedic {{surgical procedures}} places surgeons {{at risk for}} communicable diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the effectiveness of various types of protective eyewear in preventing conjunctival contamination. Methods: A simulation model was constructed with use of a mannequin head in a typical position of a surgeon’s head during an operation. The head was placed at an appropriate distance from the surgical field, and a femoral osteotomy was performed on a cadaver thigh. Six experimental groups were tested to determine the ability of various types of eye protection to prevent contamination of the conjunctiva: (1) modern prescription glasses, (2) standard surgical telescopic loupes, (3) hard plastic contoured glasses, (4) disposable plastic glasses, (5) a combination facemask and <b>eye</b> <b>shield,</b> and (6) no protection (control). Thirty femoral osteotomies were performed, and contamination of both the protective devices and the simulated conjunctival surfaces were recorded. Results: None of the tested devices were completely effective. The modern prescription glasses and the controls both were associated with conjunctival contamination rates of 83 %. The other eye protective devices were associated with significantly lower rates of overall contamination, with a rate of 50 % for the loupes, 30 % for the facemask and <b>eye</b> <b>shield,</b> 17 % for the hard plastic glasses, and 3 % for the disposable plastic glasses. Conclusions: Modern prescription glasses provided no benefit over the control in our experimental model; therefore...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The recent {{reductions}} to {{the international}} dose limit recommendations for {{the lens of the}} eye have renewed interest in radiation protection strategies in interventional fluoroscopy, where eye-lens radiation exposure occurs frequently. Radiationshielding eyewear can significantly reduce lens dose in these scenarios, but accurate protection factors are elusive because they depend on a variety of factors. This work aims to investigate variables that affect <b>eye</b> <b>shield</b> performance in fluoroscopy rooms, test several shield designs, and rate the shield designs based on shielding performance. Eight separate shields were modeled in MCNP 5 using detailed head and eye geometry, and the shields were evaluated at eight individual source positions. Results showed that shields of different thicknesses and shapes can provide similar protection to the operator. A total protection factor of about 5 is the most protection a 0. 10 mm lead equivalent material can reasonably provide, and small shields constructed of this material can provide protection factors of about 3. Shield performance can vary greatly depending on the irradiation angle, and this could cause an overestimation of the dose reduction provided by the shield if vulnerable angles are exploited. With increasing evidence of cataract risk at low lens doses, fluoroscopy operators need radiation protection equipment that can provide well characterized protection, and radiation-shielding eyewear can provide excellent dose reduction if they are designed well and used correctly...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Personal {{protection}} equipment (PPE) {{is recommended}} for use during airway management of patients with highly contagious respiratory tract illness. While its use in chemical hazards {{and its effect on}} airway management has been assessed previously, there has been no research assessing whether this equipment affects the ability to perform tracheal intubation. It is the intention of this investigation to answer this question. Methods: Eighteen workers at various level of training were asked to wear three different types of PPE while performing four different types of tracheal intubation. The PPE used included the <b>eye</b> <b>shield,</b> face shield and the Dustmaster™. The intubation techniques were direct laryngoscopy, intubation through the intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach™) and flexible bronchoscopy using the eyepiece and an eyepiece with camera attached. We assessed the time to intubate as well as the incidence of oesophageal intubation. A short questionnaire was used to examine participants' subjective experiences of wearing the various types of PPE. Results: There was no significant effect on the time to intubation for any of the methods studied. However, all subjects found that the face shield was uncomfortably hot to wear. Fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation using the eyepiece was particularly difficult with all of the PPE used due to the distance of the subjects' eye from the eyepiece. Conclusion: Although the use of PPE may not affect the length of time to intubate manikins, certain types of PPE may be uncomfortable to wear and noisy. Further research is needed to investigate whether this could be a problem in the clinical setting or in actual difficult intubations. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Eye {{injuries}} {{come at a}} {{high cost}} to society and are avoidable. Ocular blast injuries can be primary, from the blast wave itself; secondary, from fragments carried by the blast wind; tertiary; due to structural collapse or being thrown against a fixed object; or quaternary, from burns and indirect injuries. Ballistic eye protection significantly reduces the incidence of eye injuries and should be encouraged from an early stage in Military training. Management of an injured eye requires meticulous history taking, evaluation of vision that measures the acuity {{and if there is}} a relative pupillary defect as well as careful inspection of the eyes, under anaesthetic if necessary. A lateral canthotomy with cantholysis should be performed immediately if there is a sight-threatening retrobulbar haemorrhage. Systemic antibiotics should be prescribed if there is a suspected penetrating or perforating injury. A ruptured globe should be protected by an <b>eye</b> <b>shield.</b> Primary repair of ruptured globes should be performed in a timely fashion. Secondary procedures will often be required at a later date to achieve sight preservation. A poor initial visual acuity is not a guarantee of a poor final result.
