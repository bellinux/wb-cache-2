5|$|Monument 65 is a {{badly damaged}} {{depiction}} of a human head in Olmec style, dating to the Middle Preclassic. Its <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> and the mouth and nose are completely destroyed. It is wearing a helmet. It is located {{to the west of}} Structure12.|$|E
5|$|Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from sticking together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids.|$|E
5|$|The gilding and monumentality of {{the cross}} link it to the Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is {{reflective}} of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of the passion at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: his <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed,</b> his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Vel√°zquez to Francis Bacon.|$|E

25|$|In this tradition, {{masks are}} made of clay while the creator's <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed.</b> A mask is made for each {{direction}} of the medicine wheel. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.|$|E
25|$|Not {{all people}} have the same {{internal}} perceptual ability. For many, when the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed,</b> the perception of darkness prevails. However, some {{people are able to}} perceive colorful, dynamic imagery. The use of hallucinogenic drugs increases the subject's ability to consciously access visual (and auditory, and other sense) percepts. The Mental Imagery article goes into more detail.|$|E
25|$|Gestation {{is usually}} between 50 and 52 days, {{although}} there have been 62- and 63-day gestation periods reported from foxes in captivity. The typical litter is between one and four kits, with weaning taking place at around 61 to 70 days. When born, the kit's ears are folded over and its <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed,</b> with the eyes opening at around ten days and the ears lifting soon afterward. The life span of a fennec fox has been recorded as up to 14 years in captivity.|$|E

25|$|Baby mice, called pinkies or pups, {{are born}} blind, naked, and deaf. Their <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> and their ears are {{stuck to the}} sides of their heads. Mothers may eat any dead or sickly offspring. Pups begin to grow hair at two to four days. Ears open at three to five days, and the pups will start vocalizing. Eyes open at 14 days, and the babies will start {{exploring}} the world around them. At three weeks old they look like miniature versions of adult mice. At four weeks the males in the litter should be separated out so as to not cause the mother and sisters to become pregnant, while the females can be left in with the mother.|$|E
25|$|The chicks of {{swallows}} hatch naked, generally {{with only}} a few tufts of down. The <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> and do not fully open for up to 10 days. The feathers take a few days to begin to sprout, and the chicks are brooded by the parents until they are able to thermoregulate. On the whole they develop slowly compared to other passerine birds. The parents do not usually feed the chicks individual insects but instead a bolus of food comprising ten to a hundred insects. Regardless of whether the species has males that incubate or brood the chicks the males of all swallows and martins will help feed the chicks. It is difficult to judge when swallows and martins fledge, as they will be enticed out of the nest after three weeks by parents but frequently return to the nest afterwards in order to roost.|$|E
25|$|Humans possess both {{slow wave}} and REM sleep, in both phases both <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> and both hemispheres {{of the brain}} involved. Sleep has also been {{recorded}} in mammals other than humans. One interesting study showed that echidnas possess only slow wave sleep (non-REM). This {{seems to indicate that}} REM sleep appeared in evolution only after therians. But this has later been contested by studies that claim that sleep in echidna combines both modes into a single sleeping state. Other studies have shown a peculiar form of sleep in odontocetes (like dolphins and porpoises). This is called the unihemispherical slow wave sleep (USWS). At any time during this sleep mode, the EEG of one brain hemisphere indicates sleep while that of the other is equivalent to wakefulness. In some cases, the corresponding eye is open. This might allow the animal to reduce predator risk and sleep while swimming in water, though the animal may also be capable of sleeping at rest.|$|E

25|$|Floaters {{present at}} birth usually remain lifelong, while those that appear later may {{disappear}} within weeks or months. They are not uncommon, {{and do not}} cause serious problems for most persons; they represent {{one of the most}} common presentations to hospital eye services. A survey of optometrists in 2002 suggested that an average of 14 patients per month per optometrist presented with symptoms of floaters in the UK. However, floaters are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases, especially if the spots seem to constantly drift through the field of vision. The shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the vitreous humour. Floaters can even be seen when the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> on especially bright days, when sufficient light penetrates the eyelids to cast the shadows. It is not, however, only elderly persons who are troubled by floaters; they can also become a problem to younger people, especially if they are myopic. They are also common after cataract operations or after trauma.|$|E
500|$|The {{basis of}} Dr. Quimby's {{theory is that}} there is no intelligence, no power or action in matter of itself, that the spiritual world to which our <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> by ignorance or unbelief is the real world, that in it lie all the causes for every effect visible in the natural world, and that if this spiritual life can be {{revealed}} to us, in other words if we can understand ourselves, we shall then have our happiness or misery in our own hands..." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the female}} is incubating, the male remains on guard {{at one of}} several regular vantage points. The {{incubation}} period is around sixteen days, and the fledging period approximately eighteen days. On hatching, the young birds' <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed,</b> and they are naked except for tufts of down on the head, nape and back. [...] Both sexes feed {{and care for the}} young, taking all of the insects for the young birds on the wing. At one nest, two small young were fed every ten minutes or so, with the male bringing food three to four times more often than the female.|$|E

500|$|The red fox has an {{elongated}} body and relatively short limbs. The tail, which {{is longer than}} half the body length (70 per cent of head and body length), is fluffy and reaches the ground when in a standing position. Their pupils are oval and vertically oriented. Nictitating membranes are present, but move only when the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed.</b> The forepaws have five digits, while the hind feet have only four and lack dewclaws. They are very agile, being capable of jumping over [...] fences, and swim well. Vixens normally have four pairs of teats, though vixens with seven, nine, or ten teats are not uncommon. The testes of males are smaller than those of Arctic foxes.|$|E
500|$|Nimoy, in {{addition}} to his directing duties, appears {{towards the end of the}} film as Spock, but only appears in the opening credits as the director. Nimoy found the most difficult scene to direct was one in which Leonard McCoy talks to the unconscious Spock in sickbay, en route to Vulcan. Nimoy recalled that not only was he in the scene, but his <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed,</b> making it difficult to judge the quality of the shot or the actor's performance: [...] "It drove DeForest Kelley crazy. He swears that I was trying to direct him with the movement and flutter of my eyelids." [...] Nimoy was thankful the story required him to appear in a minimal number of scenes. The rapidly aging Spock, at the ages of 9, 13, 17, and 25, was portrayed successively by Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley and Joe W. Davis. Frank Welker provided Spock's screams, and Steve Blalock doubled for Nimoy, so that a total of seven actors contributed to the role.|$|E
2500|$|The Bhr≈´madhye d·πõ·π£·π≠i ( [...] ; meaning [...] "to {{the middle}} of the eyebrows/brow") has the gaze set at the [...] "third eye", which is right between the eyebrows. [...] In order to do this, the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> half way. This purportedly stimulates the {{olfactory}} and optic nerves, consequently awakening the autonomic and central nervous systems. It sooths the cranial nerves and aids concentration, and helps awaken kundalini. It is advised that caution be taken as prolonged or incorrect practice may cause problems for the eye muscles or nervous system. Initial practice is often done for only minutes at a time, but is gradually increased to up to ten minute intervals.|$|E

2500|$|In captivity, {{dolphins}} seemingly enter a fully asleep {{state where}} both <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> {{and there is}} no response to mild external stimuli. In this case, respiration is automatic; a tail kick reflex keeps the blowhole above the water if necessary. Anesthetized dolphins initially show a tail kick reflex. [...] Though a similar state has been observed with wild sperm whales, it is not known if dolphins in the wild reach this state. The Indus river dolphin has a sleep method that is different from that of other dolphin species. Living in water with strong currents and potentially dangerous floating debris, it must swim continuously to avoid injury. As a result, this species sleeps in very short bursts which last between 4 and 60seconds.|$|E

2500|$|Neural {{oscillations}} {{have been}} most widely studied in neural activity generated by large groups of neurons. Large-scale activity can be measured by techniques such as EEG. In general, EEG signals have a broad spectral content similar to pink noise, but [...] also reveal oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands. The first discovered and best-known frequency band is alpha activity (7.5‚Äì12.5 Hz) that can be detected from the occipital lobe during relaxed wakefulness and which increases when the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed.</b> Other frequency bands are: delta (14Hz), theta (48Hz), beta (1330Hz) and gamma (3070Hz) frequency band, where faster rhythms such as gamma activity {{have been linked to}} cognitive processing. Indeed, EEG signals change dramatically during sleep and show a transition from faster frequencies to increasingly slower frequencies such as alpha waves. In fact, different sleep stages are commonly characterized by their spectral content. Consequently, neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive states, such as awareness and consciousness.|$|E
