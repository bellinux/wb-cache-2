Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion {{as to how to}} achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states. When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states.|$|E
25|$|Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA): {{following}} {{the bill passed}} by the Swiss Federal Parliament in 2004 which outlined various measures for civil peacebuilding and human rights strengthening, the Human Security Division (HSD) of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) {{has been responsible for}} <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> which serve to promote human security around the world.

To this end, the FDFA gets a line of credit to be renewed and approved by Parliament every four years (it was CHF 310 million for the 2012–2016 period.) Its main peacebuilding programmes focus on 1. the African Great Lakes region (Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo), 2. Sudan, South Sudan and the Horn of Africa, 3. West Africa and Sahel, 4.

25|$|The Government {{managed the}} {{internal}} sphere of the Union of Soviet of Socialist Republics' social policy. It {{was responsible for}} <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> which would either promote or ensure the well-being of Soviet citizens through economic, social and economic development. On the economic sphere, the government was responsible for monetary, technological, pollution, price wages and social security policies, controlled all All-Union, literally institutions controlled by the Central Government, and All-Republican institutions. For instance, the Government controlled the State Bank and {{was responsible for the}} organisation of state insurance and accounting. It was the Government which drafted the five-year plans for economic and social development, through its control of the State Planning Committee, and the country's budget, through its control of the Ministry of Finance. Both the five-year plan and the budget needed approval from the Supreme Soviet to be implemented. It was responsible for socialist property, public order and the protection of its citizen's.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 April 2014, EU {{issued a}} {{statement}} on the Council of Europe Secretary General's ninth consolidated report on the conflict in Georgia. The EU supported the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia and expressed its concern about the Russian military and security related presence and infrastructure reinforcements in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The EU believed [...] "... that a clear commitment by Russia on non-use of force is necessary." [...] It also called for [...] "... the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement of 12 August 2008 and of the 8 September <b>Implementing</b> <b>Measures</b> of the six-point agreement, including providing the EU Monitoring Mission {{with access to the}} breakaway regions." [...] The EU called to ensure freedom of movement across the ABL. The release of three journalists, imprisoned on 15 April, was welcomed.

2500|$|On its {{arrival in}} the front lines on 12 May 1915, the Mounted Rifles was {{deployed}} on the northern (or left) sector of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) perimeter and relieved a brigade of Royal Marines Light Infantry. [...] It would remain here for three months. The area was overlooked by the Sari Bair range and the Turks dominated with snipers and machine gun fire. Russell set his men to improving the defensive arrangements of their positions, digging trenches and saps and <b>implementing</b> <b>measures.</b> He made his headquarters on an elevated plateau which would become known as Russell's Top, only 40 metres from the front line and sharing the discomfort and dangers with his men. A week after arriving, the Mounted Rifles helped to fend off a Turkish night attack across the entire front line. The Turks lost 10,000 men killed and wounded, and the next morning, Godley, commanding the New Zealand and Australian Division to which the Mounted Rifles were subordinate, ordered a counterattack. [...] Russell, aware of how exposed to Turkish machine gun fire an advance across the front lines would be, refused to order the attack. Despite insisting his orders be followed, Godley eventually conceded.|$|E
2500|$|In late November, WikiLeaks {{released}} confidential State Department cables, {{selections of}} which were then published by several major newspapers around the world. The leak of the cables led to a crisis atmosphere in the State Department, as blunt statements and assessments by U.S. and foreign diplomats became public. Clinton led the damage control effort for the U.S. abroad, and also sought to bolster the morale of shocked Foreign Service officers. In {{the days leading up}} to the publication of the cables, Clinton called officials in Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Afghanistan, Canada, and China to alert them to the pending disclosures. She did note that some foreign leaders were accepting of the frank language of the cables, with one telling her, [...] "Don't worry about it. You should see what we say about you." [...] She harshly criticized WikiLeaks, saying: [...] "Let's be clear: This disclosure is not just an attack on America's foreign policy interests. It is an attack on the international community – the alliances and partnerships, the conversations and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity." [...] The State Department went into immediate [...] "war room" [...] mode in order to deal with the effects of the disclosures, and began <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> to try to prevent another such leak from happening in the future.|$|E
2500|$|Although it is {{generally}} accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have [...] "direct effect". In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that {{the provisions of the}} Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not [...] "expressly" [...] confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed [...] "the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are 'directly applicable in all Member States'. Member states come under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. [...] "Regulations", held the Court of Justice, [...] "come into force solely by virtue of their publication" [...] and implementation could have the effect of [...] "jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union". On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require <b>implementing</b> <b>measures,</b> in which case those specific rules should be followed.|$|E
