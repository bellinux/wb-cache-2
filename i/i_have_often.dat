If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E

For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions I have tried to do this , I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity.|$|E
500|$|In November 1821, {{shortly before}} his seventeenth birthday, Disraeli was {{articled}} as a clerk to a firm of solicitors—Swain, Stevens, Maples, Pearse and Hunt—in the City of London. T F Maples {{was not only the}} young Disraeli's employer and friend of his father's, but also his prospective father-in-law: Isaac and Maples entertained the possibility that the latter's only daughter might be a suitable match for Benjamin. A friendship developed, but there was no romance. The firm had a large and profitable business, and as the biographer R W Davis observes, the clerkship was [...] "the kind of secure, respectable position that many fathers dream of for their children". Although biographers including Robert Blake and Bradford comment that such a post was incompatible with Disraeli's romantic and ambitious nature, he reportedly gave his employers satisfactory service, and later professed to have learned a good deal from his time with the firm. He recalled, [...] "I had some scruples, for even then I dreamed of Parliament. My father's refrain always was 'Philip Carteret Webb', who was the most eminent solicitor of his boyhood and who was an MP. It {{would be a mistake to}} suppose that the two years and more that I was in the office of our friend were wasted. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> thought, though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> regretted the University, that it was much the reverse." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Bertram Davis, [...] "For {{every person}} who remembers Sir John Hawkins {{as the author of}} the first {{full-length}} biography of Samuel Johnson, many remember him as the man Johnson once described as 'unclubable'." [...] Although [...] "unclubable" [...] reflects Hawkins's relationship with others of Johnson's circle, Johnson and Hawkins had a close friendship as Miss Reynolds describes: [...] "As we were returning from the meadows that day, I remember we met Sir John Hawkins, whom Dr. Johnson seemed much rejoiced to see; and no wonder, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> heard him speak of Sir John in terms expressive of great esteem and much cordiality of friendship" [...] Their relationship began around 1739 and they were both involved with The Gentleman's Magazine. Later, Hawkins was, in 1749, a member of Johnson's first club: the Ivy Lane club.|$|E
500|$|Following her accession, John Owen Dominis {{was given}} the title Prince Consort and {{restored}} to the Governorship of Oʻahu, which had been abolished following the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Dominis' death on August 27, seven months into her reign, greatly affected the new Queen. Liliʻuokalani later wrote: [...] "His death occurred {{at a time when}} his long experience in public life, his amiable qualities, and his universal popularity, would have made him an adviser to me for whom no substitute could possibly be found. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> said that it pleased the Almighty Ruler of nations to take him away from me at precisely the time when I felt that I most needed his counsel and companionship." [...] Cleghorn, her sister's widower, was appointed to succeed Dominis as Governor of Oʻahu. In 1892, Liliʻuokalani would also restore the positions of governor for the other three main islands for her friends and supporters.|$|E
2500|$|Maugham's {{love life}} was almost never smooth. He once confessed: [...] "I have most loved people who cared {{little or nothing}} for me and when people have loved me I have been embarrassed...

2500|$|Carson {{discovered}} {{a book about}} himself in the Apache camp. This {{was the first time}} that he found himself in print. He was the hero of adventure stories. He was sorry for the rest of his life that Mrs. White had been killed. He wrote in his Memoirs: [...] "In camp was found a book, the first of the kind I had ever seen, in which I was made a great hero, slaying Indians by the hundreds ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> thought that Mrs. White read the same ... for my appearance that she might be saved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leibniz rightly {{saw that}} {{creating}} the characteristica would be difficult, fixing {{the time required}} for devising it as follows: [...] "I think that some selected men could finish the matter in five years" [...] (Loemker 1969: 224), later remarking: [...] "And so I repeat, what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> said, {{that a man who}} is neither a prophet nor a prince can ever undertake any thing of greater good to mankind of more fitting for divine glory" [...] (Loemker 1969: 225). But later in life, a more sober note emerged. In a March 1706 letter to the Electress Sophia of Hanover, the spouse of his patron, he wrote: ...|$|E

[...] "In fact, my struggle with depression as a student was no secret. I had talked {{about it in a}} widely-covered news conference as early as 1977, when I was in the South Carolina State Senate. Since then, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> shared with appropriate groups the full story of my recovery to responsible adulthood as a professional, political and civic leader, husband and father. Teenage depression and suicide are major problems in the United States, and I believe that my life story offers hope to young people who are suffering with a constant fear of the future".|$|E

2500|$|Grass {{told the}} Süddeutsche Zeitung that the poem {{was aimed at}} the current Israeli government, not {{the country as a}} whole. He voiced {{particular}} criticism of the government's policy of continuing to build settlements despite a United Nations' resolution. He said that, with hindsight, he should have made it clearer that it was the government he was criticizing. Netanyahu, he said, was damaging Israel. He added: [...] "I have often supported Israel, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been in the country and want the country to exist and at last find peace with its neighbours." [...] On 11 April, in an article for the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Grass compared the ban on his entering Israel to his treatment by dictatorships in Myanmar and East Germany.|$|E

2500|$|Strachey {{was only}} ten when Newman died and never met him. In {{contrast}} to Strachey's account, James Anthony Froude, Hurrell Froude's brother, who knew Newman at Oxford, {{saw him as}} a Carlylean hero. Compared with Newman, Froude wrote, Keble, Pusey, and the other Tractarians [...] "were all but as ciphers, and he the indicating number". Newman's face was [...] "remarkably like that of Julius Caesar. ...<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> thought of the resemblance, and believed that it extended to the temperament. In both there was an original force of character which refused to be moulded by circumstances, which was to make its own way, and become a power in the world; a clearness of intellectual perception, a disdain for conventionalities, a temper imperious and wilful, but along with it a most attaching gentleness, sweetness, singleness of heart and purpose. Both were formed by nature to command others, both had the faculty of attracting to themselves the passionate devotion of their friends and followers. ...For hundreds of young men Credo in Newmannum was the veritable symbol of faith." ...|$|E

2500|$|Such {{views are}} also shared by former CIA {{director}} James Woolsey who {{said in a}} 1999 Congressional Statement: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to {{strike up a conversation}} with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and {{wants to talk to you}} about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{fragment}} (fragment 583) {{appears to}} be a lament by Procne about the status of married women. [...] In the Lloyd-Jones translation, this passage begins [...] "But now I am nothing on my own. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> regarded the nature of women in this way, seeing that we amount to nothing." [...] The passage goes on to note that as children living with their father girls [...] "live the happiest life." [...] But then they are [...] "pushed out and sold, away from our paternal gods and from our parents, some to foreign husbands, some to barbarians, some to joyless homes, and some to homes that are opprobrious." [...] But regardless, they must approve and be happy with their lot. [...] Fitzpatrick believes that the tension between husband and wife was one of the themes of the play. [...] The tension between families by marriage and families by birth may also be a theme, as by raping Philomela, Tereus betrays the trust of Procne's and Philomela's father Pandion.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{views were}} shared by politologist Julie Anderson {{who said the}} same person can be a Russian {{intelligence}} officer, an organized criminal, and a businessman, who quoted the former CIA Director James Woolsey as saying: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to {{strike up a conversation}} with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and {{wants to talk to you}} about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group.

60|$|It was {{not until}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ridden half a mile beyond the suburbs that I looked round me, and {{discovered}} towards {{what part of the}} country I was proceeding. I drew the rein directly, and turned my horse's head back again, towards the south. To follow the favourite road which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> so <b>often</b> followed with Clara; to stop perhaps at some place where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>often</b> stopped with her, was more than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the courage or the insensibility to do at that moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thus far shalt thou go," [...] said I, [...] "and no farther." [...] And then I {{quoted as}} solemnly as I was able a verse that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>often</b> before fitted to {{the chorus of}} the breakers:-- ...|$|R
60|$|As {{we walked}} briskly {{away from the}} house, I glanced at him more than once. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>often</b> before noticed that, if {{anything}} excited him, his eyes turned green like a cat's. They were shining like emeralds now.|$|R
2500|$|Hopkins {{supported}} Trump's Republican {{presidential nomination}} in the Daily Mail during December: [...] "I hear cries {{that he is}} a blithering idiot. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, [...] the two of us shouting naked at the rain. It's because we articulate sentiments repressed by the politically correct consensus that we have a voice". Hopkins defended his remarks that all Muslims should be banned from entering the United States. Trump thanked Hopkins for her support, calling her a [...] "respected journalist", although the Metropolitan Police and the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson among others, rejected his comments that there are 'no go' areas of London for non-Muslims. Hopkins asserted that Britain is in part [...] "radicalised" [...] and [...] "it does nobody any favours to deny the obvious". When asked by BBC's Daily Politics presenter Andrew Neil in a December 2015 interview to name the [...] "swathes" [...] of Britain that are no-go areas for non-Muslims, Hopkins replied that she couldn't for [...] "legal reasons". When Neil pointed out there could be no legal problems with identifying an area she continued to refuse, saying only “I know those places exist".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{recurring}} motif is animal imagery, particularly, bird imagery. The first {{example is}} in Act 1, Scene 1, when Warwick says [...] " [...] dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells" [...] (l.47), {{a reference to}} falconry. Again in the opening scene, Henry claims that York will, [...] "like an empty eagle/Tire on the flesh {{of me and my}} son" [...] (ll.269–270). Later, as York describes his failed attempts to win the recently concluded battle, he muses to himself, [...] "We botched again, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> seen a swan/With bootless labour swim against the tide" [...] (1.4.19–20). Subsequently, as Clifford tells York he will soon die, York declares [...] "My ashes, as the Phoenix', may bring forth/A bird that will revenge upon you all" [...] (1.4.35–36), to which Clifford replies [...] "So cowards fight when they can fly no further,/So doves peck the falcon's piercing talons" [...] (1.4.40–41). After the news of York's death has reached them, Richard encourages Edward to take York's place; [...] "If thou be that princely eagle's bird" [...] (2.1.91). Later, Warwick points out that Henry has been compelled to rescind his oath to yield the throne to the House of York; [...] "Clifford and the Lord Northumberland/And of their feather many more proud birds,/Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax" [...] (2.1.169–171). When Clifford is urging Henry to protect the Prince's birthright, he attempts to illustrate to Henry that doing the right thing for his children should be a natural course of action; [...] "Doves will peck in safeguard of their brood" [...] (2.2.18). During the debate about the rightful king, Edward refers to Clifford as [...] "that fatal screech owl/That nothing sung but death to us and ours" [...] (2.6.55–56). Bird imagery continues to be used contemptuously in France, where Margaret says of Edward and Warwick, [...] "both of you are birds of selfsame feather" [...] (3.3.161). Prior to the Battle of Barnet, as Somerset attempts to rally the troops, he says [...] "And he that will not fight for such a hope,/Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,/If he arise, be mocked and wondered at" [...] (5.4.55–57). When Richard visits Henry in the tower, Henry defends his suspicion of Richard's intentions; [...] "The bird that hath been lim'd in a bush,/With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush" [...] (5.6.13–14). Birds also play an important part in Henry's prophecy of Richard's future evil reign, as he points out the many ill omens accompanying Richard's birth; [...] "The owl shrieked at thy birth, an evil sign,/The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time,/Dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees,/The raven rooked her on the chimney's top,/And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung" [...] (5.6.44–48).|$|E

"I do," [...] she answered, [...] "for {{it is what}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> {{foreseen}}--Yes, brother, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>often</b> foreseen {{that you}} would make your sister the subject of your plots and schemes, so soon as other stakes failed you.
