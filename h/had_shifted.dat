5|$|In 1874, Parker was {{the caucus}} nominee of the Republican Party for a Missouri Senate seat. However, the {{political}} tide <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> in Missouri; it seemed unlikely {{that he would}} be elected to the Senate, so he sought a presidential appointment as judge for the Western District of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|WrestleMania X was {{the first}} edition of the event not to include Hulk Hogan, who had been seen as the public face of the WWF; {{following}} Hogan's 1993 departure, that role <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> to Bret Hart. The card also marked Randy Savage's last televised match for the company.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th-century, the act {{of suicide}} <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> from being viewed as caused by sin to being caused by {{insanity}} in Europe. Although suicide remained illegal during this period, it increasingly became the target of satirical comments, such as the Gilbert and Sullivan musical The Mikado that satirized the idea of executing someone who had already killed himself.|$|E

5|$|Early federal {{plans for}} a {{nationwide}} system of interregional highways {{did not include a}} route along or near the present turnpike, instead connecting Oklahoma City and Kansas City via southeastern Kansas and U.S. Route 69. By the mid-1940s, this route <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> to roughly the present Interstate 35 alignment, serving Wichita. The only major difference from the present route was between Wichita and Emporia, where the highway ran north to Newton before turning northeast along U.S. Route 50.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} nineteenth century, the {{emphasis}} of Imperial defence policy <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> from a single centralised Army and Navy to an approach whereby the self-governing Dominions began to provide forces for their own defence, and to begin {{to take responsibility for}} strategic interests and bases in their own geographic areas. The culmination of this was the South African War, where contingents from the Dominion militaries had played a significant role.|$|E
5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{had been}} used since 25 seconds after take-off from Namsos and {{was used for the}} remainder of the flight. From 20:29:21 all four engines showed increasing torque and immediately before the crash the aircraft <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> its angle from −2.5degrees to 5degrees. At 20:29:29 the ground proximity warning system showed 'minimum'. The aircraft crashed into the western side Torghatten at 20:29:30 at 170meters (560ft) elevation.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversy}} embroiled leading European universities; the Qing dynasty's Kangxi Emperor {{and several}} popes (including Clement XI and Clement XIV) considered the case; {{the offices of}} the Holy See also intervened. Near the end of the 17th century, many Dominicans and Franciscans <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> their positions in agreeing with the Jesuits' opinion, but Rome disagreed. Clement XI banned the rites in 1704. In 1742, Benedict XIV reaffirmed the ban and forbade debate.|$|E
5|$|The race to Bulson ridge {{began at}} 16:00 on 13 May. At 07:30 on 14 May, French armour {{advanced}} to Bulson ridge {{with a view}} to seizing the high ground vacated by the infantry of the 55th Infantry Division on 13 May. But the main, primary objective was to destroy the German bridgeheads. While that may have been possible on 13 May, the odds <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> against the French.|$|E
5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 {{at the beginning of}} a small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she was framed. By the early 1900s the only progress that had been made was the addition of armor plating around her keel. Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 but by that time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent hogging and sagging, <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> and the ship was considered a total loss. She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914. A model of this ship exists in the Constantinople Naval Museum.|$|E

5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, {{the core}} of St. Louis {{leadership}} <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> from the Creole and Irish families to a new group, dominated by anti-slavery Germans. Among this new class of leaders was Frank P. Blair, Jr., who led an {{effort to create a}} local militia loyal to the Union after Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson hinted about secession. This local militia allied itself with the Union army forces at Jefferson Barracks under the leadership of Nathaniel Lyon, which on May 10, 1861 cleared a Confederate encampment outside the city in {{what became known as the}} Camp Jackson Affair. While the Confederates were being marched back into town, a group of citizens attacked the Union and militia forces, costing 28 civilian lives.|$|E
5|$|By March 1962, the trilateral {{talks in}} Geneva <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> to 18-party talks at the UN Disarmament Conference. On 27 August 1962, within that conference, the US and UK offered two draft {{treaties}} to the Soviet Union. The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban verified by control posts under national command, but international supervision, and required on-site inspections. This {{was rejected by}} the Soviet Union due to the inspection requirement. The alternative proposal included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be verified by national detection mechanisms, without supervision by a supranational body.|$|E

5|$|By early 1943 the Australian Army's focus <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> to {{operations}} in the Pacific theatre against the Japanese, and the 9th Division received orders to return to Australia to join the other two 2nd AIF divisions, the 6th and 7th, which had departed earlier in 1942. A divisional parade was held in Gaza, after which the 2/15th embarked upon the transport Acquitania and sailed with a large convoy established under Operation Pamphlet {{as part of the}} final stage in the withdrawal of the 2nd AIF divisions from the Middle East. After a journey of just over a month, the Acquitania berthed at Sydney in late February 1943. During this time the battalion was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Raymond Barham.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Bill of Rights was {{submitted}} to the states for ratification, opinions <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill {{as a means of}} silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the debates and {{legislative}} maneuvering that went into crafting the Bill of Rights amendments was done, many personal opinions <b>had</b> <b>shifted.</b> A number of Federalists came out in support, thus silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective critique. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, were now opposed, realizing that Congressional approval of these amendments would greatly lessen {{the chances of a}} second constitutional convention. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 1992, Armenian forces {{captured}} the mountain stronghold of Shusha but {{remained on the}} defensive until the next year. Fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued {{in other parts of}} the enclave, including Lachin, Khojavend, and Aghdara. However, nearly all offensives launched by Azerbaijan failed or could not hold on to captured territory. By the spring of 1993 the Azerbaijani military, which had the upper hand in the initial stages of the war, had been largely reduced to unorganized and incoherent fighting groups. By March 1993 the fighting <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> to west and south of Karabakh.|$|E
5|$|Romney's {{liabilities}} included having run {{for senator}} {{and serving as}} governor {{in one of the}} nation's most liberal states and having taken positions in opposition to the party's conservative base during that time. Late during his term as governor, he <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> positions and emphases to better align with traditional conservatives on social issues. Skeptics, including some Republicans, charged Romney with opportunism and a lack of core principles. As a Mormon, he faced suspicion and skepticism by some in the Evangelical portion of the party.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo {{also made}} {{hypotheses}} {{in regards to}} geology and climatology in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. Shen believed that land was reshaped over time due to perpetual erosion, uplift, and deposition of silt, and cited his observance of horizontal strata of fossils embedded in a cliffside at Taihang {{as evidence that the}} area was once the location of an ancient seashore that <b>had</b> <b>shifted</b> hundreds of miles east over an enormous span of time. Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a dry northern climate zone where they had never been known to grow, climates naturally shifted geographically over time.|$|E
