25|$|After the war's end, Whitaker left Oak Ridge {{to take up}} {{the post}} of President of Lehigh University on June 1, 1946.

In 1959 he initiated the Centennial development program, which raised over $22 million for faculty salaries and construction that included the University Center, and the Whitaker Laboratory, which would be named in his honor in 1966.|$|E
25|$|The dissent {{also took}} issue {{with most of the}} majority's conclusions. Federal {{immunity}} from taxation stemmed not from the common law but from the federal nature of the American system of government, he said. He admitted that <b>Dravo</b> Contracting was not an instrumentality of the federal government, but concluded that the tax did burden the government. Citing Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U.S. 460 (1881); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Attorney General, 125 U.S. 530 (1888); and Massachusetts v. Western Union Tel. Co., 141 U.S. 40 (1891), McReynolds noted that none of these cases turned on the unique contractual relationship between the private company and the government (as the majority had distinguished them) but rather on the mere fact that a tax was laid on a corporation engaged in carrying out the duties assigned to it by the federal government under its constitutional mandates. The Court had long held, he claimed, that taxes (such as an estate tax on an estate that held government bonds) which only indirectly impinged on the relationship between the federal government and a private entity were valid. But if a tax on the contract itself were permitted, there would be no end to unlimited taxation on the federal government, he warned.|$|E

500|$|Construction of the LRT Line 1 {{started in}} September 1981 with the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (now the Philippine National Construction Corporation) as the {{contractor}} with assistance from Losinger, a Swiss firm, and the Philippine subsidiary of <b>Dravo,</b> an American firm. [...] The government appointed Electrowatt Engineering Services of Zürich to oversee construction and eventually became {{responsible for the}} extension studies of future expansion projects. [...] The line was test-run in March 1984, and {{the first half of}} LRT-1, from Baclaran to Central Terminal, was opened on December 1, 1984. [...] The second half, from Central Terminal to Monumento, was opened on May 12, 1985. Overcrowding and poor maintenance took its toll a few years after opening. [...] In 1990, the LRT-1 fell so far into disrepair due to premature wear and tear that trains headed to Central Terminal station had to slow to a crawl to avoid further damage to the support beams below as cracks reportedly began to appear. [...] The premature ageing of LRT-1 led to an extensive refurbishing and structural capacity expansion program with a help of Japan's ODA.|$|E
