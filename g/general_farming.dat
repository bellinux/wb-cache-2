On July24, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared that the National Disaster Coordinating Council would provide assistance to citizens affected by the typhoon. The president requested P134million (PHP, $2.5million USD) for farmers to buy new seeds, and P35million (PHP, $650,000 USD) to rebuild the hard-hit Cagayan Valley, where Arroyo visited days after the storm struck. The government ultimately spent about P24million (PHP, $435,000 USD) in emergency aid for relocating storm victims, search and rescue operations, and assistance. In Mindanao, officials prepared 800bags of rice and various other food supplies due to the storm. Power and water outages persisted across Luzon {{for up to three}} weeks, causing many factories otherwise undamaged to close. In Isabela province, 25Tzu Chi volunteers provided supplies to 2,873houses. The Philippine government provided rice, sardines, and coffee to many affected houses. Damaged houses were supposed to receive 1,000pesos, although few received the monetary aid. In the town of San Mariano in Isabela province, most farmers incurred more debt and continued their same <b>general</b> <b>farming</b> practice, despite sustaining heavy losses from the storm.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{enforced}} Corn (Cereal grains) laws, 1794–1846, {{protected the}} British agricultural sector from imports of British North American wheat. The Reciprocity Treaty, 6 June 1854, developed a trade agreement between Canada and the United States which affected trade of wheat grown in Ontario. [...] Northern Ontario is mainly tundra and forested area, whereas southern Ontario has lands suitable for livestock and <b>general</b> <b>farming</b> {{as well as}} geography suitable for pasture and dairying industries.

40|$|The Company of <b>General</b> <b>Farms,</b> a quasi-private {{collector}} of {{about half the}} French taxes in the eighteenth century, {{was one of the}} largest lenders to the Crown. The relationship between the Crown and <b>General</b> <b>Farms</b> fits the model of sovereign debt as a contingent claim. Lending is sustained in contingent claims models if the lender credibly commits to withhold funds from the sovereign if he defaults. The <b>General</b> <b>Farms</b> maintained this commitment with amonopsony of the Crown's access to taxes and borrowed funds. When revolution threatened, the monopsony stood between the Crown and reform of the fiscal system. The history of the Company of <b>General</b> <b>Farms</b> shows how a contingent claims equilibrium can raise the cost of legitimate reform...|$|R

By confining his main analysis to <b>general</b> <b>farm</b> organizations (American Farm Bureau Federation, National Farmers Union, National Farmers Organization, etc.), Hansen misses other major players who also have access to Congress.
