5|$|By 1900, {{the lumber}} {{industry}} had declined, and the city's economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a <b>fire</b> <b>brick</b> plant, and a silk mill. In 1938, the Piper Aircraft Corporation, {{maker of the}} Piper Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained one of the city's biggest employers until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida. The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment {{rate of more than}} 20% in Lock Haven in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the 1880s in Castanea Township, closed in 2001. By 2005, 32% of the city's labor force was employed in health care, education, or social services, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in retail trade, 13% in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and smaller fractions in other sectors. The city's biggest employers, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania and UPMC Susquehanna Lock Haven hospital, are among the seven biggest employers in Clinton County.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{railroad}} {{was soon to}} pass into a decline. The Fountain branch had already been removed by 1923. The Great Depression caused the closure {{of most of the}} coal mines in the area, and the Big Sandy Branch was abandoned in 1935. A <b>fire</b> <b>brick</b> manufacturer near Clarence and the remaining coal mines still provided some business to the line, but the mine branches continued to be pruned back. On March 6, 1959, the entire line from Wingate north was abandoned.|$|E

Silicate {{minerals}} {{are also}} in whiteware ceramics, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired clay minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates). An example is porcelain {{which is based on}} the silicate mineral kaolinite. Traditional glass (silica-based soda-lime glass) also functions in many of the same ways, and is also used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based glass fibers are used for optical fiber, as well as to produce fiberglass for structural support and glass wool for thermal insulation.|$|E
40|$|Individual <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> {{domestication}} is {{not widely}} practiced; yet the <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> has played {{and will continue}} to play an immense role in the global built environment. Its pivotal task of creating and sustaining architectural structures is ancient and has permeated through to contemporary times courtesy of clay’s colossal vitality. Clay exploration and exploitation are perhaps most apparent in <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> production, particularly in first-world countries with a diverse range of clayware such as bricks and tiles. This development has not been fully maximized in Nigeria {{as a result of the}} small number of refractory plants whose total production capacity is beneath the nation’s building requirements. This scenario makes <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> procurement costly and limits its accessibility; consequently, it promotes socio-built inequality among viable <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> prospectors. In view of the aforementioned, this paper advocates individual <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> domestication in Nigeria’s rural and suburban settlements, providing concise practical details, from materials identification and mould fabrication to brick production. When fully harnessed, this is hoped to create jobs, alleviate the country’s <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> deficit, boost individual economic standing, communal economies and ultimately the national economy. Possibly it could serve as a template in similar settings around the world...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} materials consist of mud-brick, <b>fired</b> <b>brick,</b> gypsum, and mortar. Clay {{was also used}} during the early Parthian period. Mud-bricks was more popular in the early period {{in the construction of}} forts and cities, while <b>fired</b> <b>bricks</b> became popular in the later period. Sometimes one brick was set in the vertical position, with two horizontal rows of bricks laid above and below. The sizes of mud or <b>fired</b> <b>bricks</b> differ, but in general the standard size was 40 × 40 × 10 cm. The <b>fired</b> <b>bricks</b> were made from the local loess soil, and fired in kilns along the line of the wall.|$|R

500|$|Carr Hill by 1820 was {{a modern}} and populous village, {{situated}} on hill, still isolated from Gateshead and Felling. A variety of industries had developed alongside Warburton's pottery and were prospering; a flint glass manufacturer, under {{the management of}} Alexander Elliot, three corn mills- Carr Hill Mill, Felling Windmill and St John's Mill (the latter built after an earlier mill was destroyed by a mysterious fire in 1824)– and a <b>fire</b> <b>brick</b> kiln. There were also three inns and [...] "some neat houses occupied by respectable families". [...] By 1840 Carr Hill Reservoir had been built and, under {{the management of the}} Newcastle Water Company was the major water supplier for residents in Carr Hill, Sheriff Hill and Windy Nook, and freestone quarries, similar to Kells' Quarry in Windy Nook, were producing Newcastle Grindstone of excellent quality. In 1856 a Methodist Chapel was built. [...] During the mid-19th century, the increasing population led to calls for social amenities to be improved; footpaths were a particular concern, although an examination of ordnance survey mapping demonstrates the continued isolation of the village generally. The success of Warburton's pottery resulted in a street being named after him, but the lack of residential development is evident. Carr Hill glassworks and quarries are still clearly marked, along with Swan Pond and a public house, The Free Gardeners Arms. By the mid-19th century Carr Hill Reservoir was {{in the hands of the}} Whittle Dean Water Company, and in 1883 was converted into a 10-million imperial gallon (45 million l; 12 million US gal) open reservoir.|$|E
2500|$|Brick making {{flourished in}} the city until after World War I, the clay {{unearthed}} in various sections of the community proving highly suitable for the manufacture of building brick as well as <b>fire</b> <b>brick.</b> [...] Bricks were the first products shipped outside of the Allentown area by rail and were sold nationwide. [...] Food processing started with the early bakers, {{who came into the}} city with the first settlers. In 1887, Wilson Arbogast and Morris C. Bastian formed Arbogast and Bastian, where commercial slaughtering was done on a large scale.|$|E
2500|$|The Lowe {{process is}} {{performed}} {{in a series of}} three chambers, the generator, the carburettor and the superheater. [...] The original air blast is used to produce air gas in the generator. [...] The heat of primary combustion heats the coal sufficiently, while the air gas is burned by a second air blast in the other two chambers in which the oil for carburetting is decomposed. These chambers contain a quantity of loose <b>fire</b> <b>brick</b> called “checker work,” and the air gas is burned in them during the time the air blast is on the main producer. When the coal and checker work are hot enough, the air blast is shut off and the steam blast is turned on. Heat stored in the checker work pyrolyzes the mixture of water gas and oil, which is led through the chambers while the steam blast is on the producers. The Lowe process is endothermic, and cools the generator and checker work, so the process has to alternate between air blast for heating and steam blast for gas production.|$|E
