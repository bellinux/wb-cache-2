5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch <b>fishing</b> is a ritualized method of <b>fishing</b> on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch <b>fishing</b> requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch <b>fishing</b> results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch <b>fishing</b> is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch <b>fishing</b> is the most advertised <b>fishing</b> occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch <b>fishing</b> season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the <b>fishing</b> season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch <b>fishing</b> thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E

Processing of <b>fish</b> into forms for human consumption or suitable {{to be used as}} a supplement in animal food has been neglected in <b>fish</b> culture practices. This may be due to the high technology required in some of the processes and the fact that those involved in actual <b>fish</b> production are ignorant of the different processing methods.

25|$|Forage <b>fish</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as bait <b>fish</b> or feeder <b>fish.</b> Bait <b>fish</b> is a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch <b>fish</b> to bait longlines and traps. Forage <b>fish</b> is a fisheries term, and is used in the context of fisheries. Bait <b>fish,</b> by contrast, are <b>fish</b> that are caught by humans to use as bait for other <b>fish.</b> The terms overlap in the sense that most bait <b>fish</b> are also forage <b>fish,</b> and vice versa. Feeder <b>fish</b> is a term used particularly in the context of <b>fish</b> aquariums. It refers essentially to the same concept as forage <b>fish,</b> small <b>fish</b> that are eaten by larger <b>fish,</b> but the term is adapted to the particular requirements of working with <b>fish</b> in aquariums.|$|R

40|$|The cleaner <b>fish</b> Labroides dimidiatus {{affected}} the pigmented monogenean parasite Benedenia lolo on the <b>fish</b> Hemigymnus melapterus (Labridae) held in aquaria. The effect of cleaner <b>fish</b> varied {{with the size}} class of fish; only small <b>fish</b> [a posteriori size class 11 · 5 cm LS) was not affected by cleaner <b>fish.</b> The size-frequency distributions of monogeneans on both size-classes of H. melapterus were affected by cleaner <b>fish.</b> <b>Fish</b> exposed to cleaner <b>fish</b> had fewer large (> 3 mm) and more small (< 1 mm) monogeneans than <b>fish</b> not exposed to cleaner <b>fish,</b> suggesting cleaner <b>fish</b> selectively removed larger monogeneans. This difference was more pronounced on large <b>fish.</b> In the absence of cleaner <b>fish,</b> small <b>fish</b> had almost as many monogeneans as large fish; they also had more small monogeneans than the large <b>fish,</b> suggesting small <b>fish</b> were more vulnerable to infection by monogeneans than larger <b>fish.</b> This suggests that the cleaner <b>fish</b> L. dimidiatus {{has the potential to}} control benedeniine monogeneans on captive <b>fish</b> and highlights the importance of taking into account <b>fish</b> size in studies of the effect of cleaner <b>fish</b> on ectoparasites...|$|R
