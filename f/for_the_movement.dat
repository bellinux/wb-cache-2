5|$|By the 2000s, {{adherents of}} {{prosperity}} theology in the United States were {{most common in}} the Sun Belt. In the late 2000s, proponents claimed that {{tens of millions of}} Christians had accepted prosperity theology.

5|$|In {{the format}} of the chorale cantata cycle, an unknown {{librettist}} retained some parts of Luther's wording, while he paraphrased other passages for recitatives and arias. He used the original verses 46–48 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first <b>movement,</b> verse 54 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>movement,</b> and <b>the</b> doxology <b>for</b> <b>the</b> seventh <b>movement.</b> He paraphrased verse 49 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second <b>movement,</b> verses 50–51 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> third, verses 52–53 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fourth, and verse 55 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sixth <b>movement,</b> <b>the</b> latter expanded by a reference to the birth of Jesus.|$|R

5|$|A major {{turning point}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> came during World War I, when many U.S. {{servicemen}} {{were diagnosed with}} venereal diseases. The government's response included an anti-venereal disease campaign that framed sexual intercourse and contraception as issues {{of public health and}} legitimate topics of scientific research. This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters; as a consequence, contraception transformed from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.|$|E
5|$|Along with Tarnovo, {{during the}} rule of Ivan Sratsimir Vidin emerged as a major {{literary}} center, under the strong influence of the Tarnovo Literary School. Some of the works that have survived from that period include the Tetraevangelia of the Metropolitan Danail and the Vidin collection from 1360, ordered by Empress Anna, which contains the hagiographies of thirteen Orthodox saints and {{a description of the}} holy sites in Jerusalem. Joasaph of Bdin, who was elected Archbishop of Vidin in 1392 wrote Praising epistle <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> of St Philotea relics from Tarnovo to Vidin which contained all features of the Tarnovo Literary School. Joasaph also demonstrated great respect to Patriarch Evtimiy of Tarnovo, the most prominent figure in the Bulgarian cultural and literary life {{in the second half of}} the 14th century.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1906, most {{leaders from}} Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission. These {{missions}} were largely composed of immigrant or ethnic groups. The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of growth <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate {{that had already been}} taking root in those areas. Other new missions were based on preachers who had charisma and energy. Nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants and the poor.|$|E
5|$|Despite this reserve, early {{settlers}} {{extended their}} fences to the river. In 1791, the Land Board ordered that the fences be removed {{to permit the}} reserve's use as a public road. The Niagara Road quickly became the primary route between Fort Erie and Fort George. Its importance grew with the declaration of war against the Americans in June 1812. During the war, the road became vital <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> of militia and supplies, and accordingly {{it was one of}} the primary frontiers of the war.|$|E
5|$|General Krueger was gravely {{concerned}} about {{the seriousness of the}} situation on Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> {{of the rest of the}} 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use them, and to permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E

5|$|In January 2003, Raël held a {{ceremony}} {{at which he}} thanked Boisselier for her service and anointed her as his successor. He praised her for spreading the message of Raëlism internationally while publicizing the cloning. In the Raëlian hierarchy, she is one level below Raël {{and serves as a}} spokesperson <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement.</b> As a leader, she has attempted to rehabilitate the swastika, one of the group's symbols. She maintains that it is valuable as an ancient symbol of peace, and that it has been unfairly associated with Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{share the}} view that the militants {{escalated}} the conflict toward violence on the basis of false information transmitted by duplicitous individuals or groups attempting to neutralize the nationalist influence. Members of VVS and Jiny involved in the initial attacks have stated that their organizations were obliged to attack after the signal to take action was transmitted to them by a group that was later discovered to have secret ties to the national police. Researchers have documented reports of nationalists whose member organizations joined the conflict upon commands issued by the police, British nationals, and French settlers living in Madagascar. Despite the role of the militants in leading the uprising, the colonial authorities immediately held MDRM responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> and responded by targeting the party's members and supporters.|$|E

5|$|Mozart did {{not write}} down a cadenza <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> or at least there is no {{evidence}} of him having done so. Many later composers and performers, including Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni and Gabriel Fauré, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 2002, Brigitte Boisselier, a Raëlian Bishop and CEO of a {{biotechnology}} {{company called}} Clonaid, announced {{the birth of}} baby Eve, supposedly the first-ever human clone. The announcement ignited much media attention, ethical debate, doubt, criticism, and claims of a hoax. Spokespeople <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> including Claude Vorilhon, have suggested {{that this is one}} of the first steps in achieving a more important agenda. They claim that through cloning they can combine an accelerated growth process with some form of mind transfer, and in such, may achieve eternal life. Raelians constitute the world's largest UFO religion.|$|E
5|$|The role {{of women}} in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E

5|$|Æthelwold {{reformed}} monasteries {{in his own}} {{diocese of}} Winchester, and he also helped to restore houses in eastern England, such as Peterborough, Ely, Thorney and St Neots. Almost all had been monasteries in the seventh century, and had later become communities of secular clerks or transferred to secular ownership, so he could argue {{that he was just}} restoring their original status. He also restored nunneries, working with his ally, Queen Ælfthryth. He did not merely attempt to revive the historical church, but also to improve it by inventing dubious pedigrees for his houses. He was the main propagandist <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> and wrote all the major works supporting it in England during Edgar's reign.|$|E
5|$|After Ernest died in 1971, Ruth succeeded him {{as their}} group's leader and primary channeler. She {{subsequently}} began publishing accounts of her experiences and revelations. In early 1974, she predicted that a space fleet of benevolent extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would land on Earth later that year, which led the Unarius Academy {{to purchase a}} property {{to serve as the}} landing site. After the extraterrestrials failed to appear, Norman said that trauma she had suffered in a past life had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Undaunted, she rented a building for Unarius' meetings and sought publicity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> claiming to have united the Earth with an interplanetary confederation. She revised the Space Brothers' expected landing date several times, before finally settling on 2001. Her health declined in the late 1980s, prompting her students to try to heal her with rituals of past-life regression. Despite predicting that she would live to see the extraterrestrials land, Norman died in 1993. Unarius has continued to operate after her death, and formed a board of directors. Since the 2000s, leaders have concentrated on individual transformation leading to spiritual change in humankind.|$|E
5|$|After {{some time}} off to recover in Zwittau, Schindler was {{promoted}} to second in command of his Abwehr unit and relocated with his wife to Ostrava, on the Czech-Polish border, in January 1939. He was involved in espionage {{in the months leading}} up to Hitler's seizure of the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March. Emilie helped him with paperwork, processing and hiding secret documents in their apartment for the Abwehr office. As he frequently travelled to Poland on business, he and his 25 agents were in a position to collect information about Polish military activities and railways for the planned invasion of Poland. One assignment called for his unit to monitor and provide information about the railway line and tunnel in the Jablunkov Pass, deemed critical <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> of German troops. Schindler continued to work for Abwehr until as late as fall 1940, when he was sent to Turkey to investigate corruption among the Abwehr officers assigned to the German embassy there.|$|E
