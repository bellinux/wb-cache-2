40|$|This report {{contains}} an exact {{description of the}} new wind tunnel of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. This is the first american type wind tunnel. It differs from ordinary wind tunnels by its being surrounded by a strong steel shell, 35 feet long and 15 feet in diameter. A compressor system is provided to fill this shell - and hence the entire wind tunnel - with air compressed to a density up to 25 times the ordinary atmospheric density. It is demonstrated in the report that the increase of the air density makes up for a corresponding decrease in {{the scale of the}} model. Hence such american type wind tunnel is <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>scale</b> effect. The report is illustrated by many drawings and photographs.

40|$|Navigation is a {{fundamental}} task for mobile robots in applications such as exploration, surveillance, and search and rescue. The task involves solving the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, where {{a map of the}} environment is constructed. In order for this map to be useful for a given application, a suitable scene representation needs to be defined that allows spatial information sharing between robots and also between humans and robots. High-level scene representations have the benefit of being more robust and having higher exchangeability for interpretation. With the aim of higher level scene representation, in this work we explore high-level landmarks and their usage using geometric and appearance information to assist mobile robot navigation in urban areas. In visual SLAM, image registration is a key problem. While feature-based methods such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) matching are popular, they do not utilize appearance information as a whole and will suffer from low-resolution images. We study appearance-based methods and propose a scale-space integrated Lucas-Kanade?s method that can estimate geometric transformations and also take into account image appearance with different resolutions. We compare our method against state-of-the-art methods and show that our method can register images efficiently with high accuracy. In urban areas, planar building facades (PBFs) are basic components of the quasirectilinear environment. Hence, segmentation and mapping of PBFs can increase a robot?s abilities of scene understanding and localization. We propose a vision-based PBF segmentation and mapping technique that combines both appearance and geometric constraints to segment out planar regions. Then, geometric constraints such as reprojection errors, orientation constraints, and coplanarity constraints are used in an optimization process to improve the mapping of PBFs. A major issue in monocular visual SLAM is scale drift. While depth sensors, such as lidar, are <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>scale</b> drift, this type of sensors are usually more expensive compared to cameras. To enable low-cost mobile robots equipped with monocular cameras to obtain accurate position information, we use a 2 D lidar map to rectify imprecise visual SLAM results using planar structures. We propose a two-step optimization approach assisted by a penalty function to improve on low-quality local minima results. Robot paths for navigation can be either automatically generated by a motion planning algorithm or provided by a human. In both cases, a scene representation of the environment, i. e., a map, is useful to specify meaningful tasks for the robot. However, SLAM results usually produce a sparse scene representation that consists of low-level landmarks, such as point clouds, which are neither convenient nor intuitive to use for task specification. We present a system that allows users to program mobile robots using high-level landmarks from appearance data...|$|E

40|$|As {{traditional}} {{volatile and}} non-volatile data storage and memory {{technologies such as}} SRAM, DRAM, Flash and HDD face fundamental scaling challenges, scientists and engineers are forced to search for and develop alternative technologies for future electronic and computing systems that are relatively <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>scaling</b> issues, have lower power consumptions, higher storage densities, faster speeds, and can be easily integrated on-chip with microprocessor cores. This thesis focuses on the scaling and advanced functionality potential of one such memory technology i. e. Phase Change Memory (PCM), which is a leading contender to complement or even replace the above mentioned traditional technologies. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, a physically-realistic Multiphysics Cellular Automata PCM device modelling approach was used to study the scaling potential of conventional and commercially-viable PCM devices. It was demonstrated that mushroom-type and patterned probe PCM devices can indeed be scaled down to ultrasmall (single-nanometer) dimensions, and in doing so, ultralow programming currents (sub- 20 μA) and ultrahigh storage densities (10 Tb/in 2) can be achieved via such a scaling process. Our sophisticated modelling approach also provided a detailed insight into some key PCM device characteristics, such as amorphization (Reset) and crystallization (Set) kinetics, thermal confinement, and the important resistance window i. e. difference in resistances between the Reset and Set states. In the second part of the thesis, the aforementioned modelling approach was used to assess the feasibility of some advanced functionalities of PCM devices, such as neuromorphic computing and phase change metadevices. It was demonstrated that by utilizing the accumulation mode of operation inherent to phase change materials, we can combine a physical PCM device with an external comparator-type circuit to deliver a ‘self-resetting spiking phase change neuron’, which when combined with phase change synapses can potentially open a new route for the realization of all-phase change neuromorphic computers. It was further shown that it is indeed feasible to design and ‘electrically’ switch practicable phase change metadevices (for absorber and modulator applications, and suited to operation in the technologically important near-infrared range of the spectrum). Finally, it was demonstrated that the Gillespie Cellular Automata (GCA) phase change model is capable of exhibiting ‘non-Arrhenius kinetics of crystallization’, which were found to be in good agreement with reported experimental studies...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{spectral}} quark model {{which can be}} applied to low energy hadronic physics. The approach is based on a generalization of the Lehmann representation of the quark propagator. We work at the one-quark-loop level. Electromagnetic and chiral invariance are ensured with help of the gauge technique which provides particular solutions to the Ward-Takahashi identities. General conditions on the quark spectral function follow from natural physical requirements. In particular, the function is normalized, its all positive moments must vanish, while the physical observables depend on negative moments and the so-called log-moments. As a consequence, the model is made finite, dispersion relations hold, chiral anomalies are preserved, and the twist expansion is <b>free</b> <b>from</b> logarithmic <b>scaling</b> violations, as requested of a low-energy model. We study a variety of processes and show that the framework is very simple and practical. Finally, incorporating the idea of vector-meson dominance, we present an explicit construction of the quark spectral function which satisfies all the requirements. The corresponding momentum representation of the resulting quark propagator exhibits only cuts on the physical axis, with no poles present anywhere in the complex momentum space. The momentum-dependent quark mass compares very well to recent lattice calculations. A large number of predictions and relations can be deduced from our approach for such quantities as the pion light-cone wave function, non-local quark condensate, pion transition form factor, pion valence parton distribution function, etc. Comment: revtex, 24 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{class of}} {{enhancement}} techniques is proposed for images in arbitrary dimension D. They are <b>free</b> <b>from</b> either space/frequency (<b>scale)</b> or grey references. There are two subclasses. One subclass is the chain: {Negative Laplace operator, Multiplication by Power (γ− 1) of modulus-Laplace value, Inverse Negative Laplace operator} together with generalized versions. The generalization of the Negative Laplace operator consists of replacing its isotropic frequency square transfer function by an (equally isotropic) modulusfrequency to-the-power-p transfer-function. The inverse is defined accordingly. The second subclass is the chain: {Vector-Gradient operator, Multiplication by Power (γ− 1) of modulus-gradient value, Inverse Vector-Gradient operator} together with generalized versions. We believe the Inverse Vector-Gradient operator (and its generalized version) to be a novel operation in image processing. The generalization of the Vector-Gradient operator consists of multiplying its transfer functions by an isotropic modulus-frequency to-thepower-(p− 1) transfer-function. The inverse is defined accordingly. Although the generalized (Inverse) Negative Laplace and Vector-Gradient operators are best implemented via the frequency domain, their point spread functions are checked for too large footprints {{in order to}} avoid spatial aliasing in practical (periodic image) implementations. The limitations of frequency-power p for given dimension D are studied. ...|$|R

Among these, we consider (Super-) Liouville theory and simply and non-simply laced Toda theories. In this paper we show how to compute the scaling functions of effective central charge for the models perturbed by some primary fields which maintains integrability. This new derivation of the scaling functions are compared with the results from conventional TBA approach and confirms our approach along with other non-perturbative results such as exact expressions of the on-shell masses {{in terms of the}} parameters in the action, exact free energies. Another important application of the reflection amplitudes is a computation of onepoint functions for the integrable models. Introducing functional relations between the one-point functions in terms of the reflection amplitudes, we obtain explicit expressions for simply-laced and non-simply-laced affine Toda theories.

Alkyl amines with branched structure are more thermally stable than linear alkyl amines, exhibit better adsorption and effectiveness of surface shielding.
