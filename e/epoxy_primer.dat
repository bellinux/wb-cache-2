After documenting the statue’s initial condition, the paint was stripped away {{using a combination of}} pressure washers, propane torching, and solvent application. Once the brass surface had been cleaned, Wharton assessed the various stress cracks and gouges in the metal and determined that the damage was all relatively old, probably dating back to the shipwreck and its recovery from the sea. (Ref: Wharton 148-152.) In addition, much of the bronze disease once visible {{on the surface of the}} sculpture had been blasted away during the paint stripping process. After it was determined that the statue was in stable condition, any holes or gaps in the metal were filled in using a pH-neutral epoxy putty, and the brass surface was misted with a benzoltriazole solution in order to prevent future corrosion. To repaint the sculpture, Wharton selected a hearty paint system that could withstand the harsh Hawaiian sun and rain, which consisted of an automotive <b>epoxy</b> <b>primer</b> (See primer (paint)), a polyurethane paint, and a polyurethane clear top coat. Special care was taken to choose the proper colors for Kamehameha’s skin tone and red and yellow feathered garments.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in corrosion prevention by protective coatings is the loss of coating adhesion under environmental influence.

Theoretical work of adhesion values for the various pre-treated surfaces were calculated using the contact angle data and further tested experimentally by adhesive bond strength evaluation by tensile testing of a single lap aluminium-epoxy aluminium assembly. The method of surface pre-treatment showed a profound effect on the surface topography and roughness by AFM.
