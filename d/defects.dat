40|$|In this article, {{localized}} <b>defect</b> modes in one-dimensional optically induced photonic lattices are studied comprehensively. First, {{the origin}} of these <b>defect</b> modes is investigated analytically in the weak-defect limit by perturbation methods. It is shown that in an attractive <b>defect</b> where the lattice light intensity at the <b>defect</b> site is {{higher than that of}} nearby sites, a <b>defect</b> mode bifurcates from the left edge of every Bloch band; while in a repulsive <b>defect,</b> a <b>defect</b> mode bifurcates from the right edge of every Bloch band. When the <b>defect</b> is not weak, <b>defect</b> modes are examined by numerical methods. It is shown that in a repulsive <b>defect,</b> the strongest confinement of <b>defect</b> modes arises when the lattice light intensity at the <b>defect</b> site is nonzero rather than zero. In addition, as the potential strength increases, <b>defect</b> modes disappear from lower bandgaps and appear in higher bandgaps. In an attractive <b>defect,</b> however, <b>defect</b> modes persist in every bandgap as the potential strength increases. Using a piecewise-constant potential model, <b>defect</b> modes are calculated analytically for a general <b>defect.</b> The analytical results qualitatively explain the main features in numerical results. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{easiest way}} to produce {{intrinsic}} <b>defects</b> in diamond is by displacing carbon atoms through irradiation with high-energy particles, such as alpha (helium), beta (electrons) or gamma particles, protons, neutrons, ions, etc. The irradiation can occur in the laboratory or in the nature (see Diamond enhancement– Irradiation); it produces primary <b>defects</b> named frenkel <b>defects</b> (carbon atoms knocked off their normal lattice sites to interstitial sites) and remaining lattice vacancies.

5|$|Within an ionic crystal, {{there will}} usually be some point <b>defects,</b> but to {{maintain}} electroneutrality, these <b>defects</b> come in pairs. Frenkel <b>defects</b> {{consist of a}} cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in {{the bulk of the}} crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions. Schottky <b>defects</b> consist of one vacancy of each type, and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size. If the cations have multiple possible oxidation states, then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a non-stoichiometric compound. Another non-stoichiometric possibility is the formation of an F-center, a free electron occupying an anion vacancy. When the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are possible. All of these point <b>defects</b> can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration. Because they are energetically costly, but entropically beneficial, they occur in greater concentration at higher temperatures. Once generated, these pairs of <b>defects</b> can diffuse mostly independently of one another, by hopping between lattice sites. This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal, including diffusion and solid state ionic conductivity. When vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can recombine and annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal (Schottky). <b>Defects</b> in the crystal structure generally expand the lattice parameters, reducing the overall density of the crystal. <b>Defects</b> also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which causes them to experience a different crystal-field symmetry, {{especially in the case of}} different cations exchanging lattice sites. This results in a different splitting of d-electron orbitals, so that the optical absorption (and hence colour) can change with defect concentration.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} <b>defect</b> modes in {{optically}} induced photonic lattices are possible in biased photovoltaic-photorefractive crystals. These <b>defect</b> modes exist in different bandgaps when the <b>defect</b> strength is changed. When the <b>defect</b> strength is positive, {{there is a}} defect-mode branch in each bandgap. When the <b>defect</b> strength is negative, there is a defect-mode branch in the first bandgap and are many defect-mode branches in higher bandgaps.
