40|$|As the {{received}} {{radar signal}} {{is the sum}} of signal contributions overlaid in one single pixel regardless of the travel path, the multipath effect should be seriously tackled as the multiple bounce returns are added to <b>direct</b> <b>scatter</b> echoes which leads to ghost scatters. Most of the existing solution towards the multipath is to recover the signal propagation path. To facilitate the signal propagation simulation process, plenty of aspects such as sensor parameters, the geometry of the objects (shape, location, orientation, mutual position between adjacent buildings) and the physical parameters of the surface (roughness, correlation length, permittivity) which determine the strength of radar signal backscattered to the SAR sensor should be given in previous. However, it's not practical to obtain the highly detailed object model in unfamiliar area by field survey as it's a laborious work and time-consuming. In this paper, SAR imaging simulation based on RaySAR is conducted at first aiming at basic understanding of multipath effects and for further comparison. Besides of the pre-imaging simulation, the product of the after-imaging, which refers to radar images is also taken into consideration. Both Cosmo-SkyMed ascending and descending SAR images of Lupu Bridge in Shanghai are used for the experiment. As a result, the reflectivity map and signal distribution map of different bounce level are simulated and validated by 3 D real model.

40|$|Two {{types of}} <b>direct</b> <b>scatter</b> from the F region are {{identified}} on the [...] {{records from the}} oblique incidence sweep-frequency sounder located at [...] College, Alaska. One type of echo appears to come from randomly distributed, [...] field-aligned irregularities in the ionosphere and the other [...] from discrete patches of irregularities. The former is essentially a [...] nighttime phenomenon, while the latter occurs mostly during the day. From [...] these <b>direct</b> <b>scatter</b> modes we can obtain an estimate on the horizontal and [...] the vertical extents of the irregularities. Analysis of {{the data for the}} [...] past year has shown that the randomly distributed irregularities commonly [...] occur in regions having horizontal extents of more than 1000 km. The discrete [...] irregularities appear to extend throughout most of the lower half of [...] the F layer. The sequence of events near sunrise and sunset on a magnetically [...] quiet winter day indicates that solar radiation eliminates the random [...] irregularities and accentuates the discrete irregularities. [...] Certain phenomena frequently recorded on high latitude ionograms [...] such as Spread F and triple splitting are probably manifestations of backscatter [...] from ionospheric irregularities. The occurrence of Z-traces in [...] College ionograms is studied statistically and it is concluded that the [...] majority, if not all, of the Z-traces are produced by backscatter of the [...] radiation obliquely incident {{in the direction of the}} magnetic zenith. [...] Fixed frequency oblique incidence soundings on frequencies of 12, 18 [...] and 30 mc/s made at College, Alaska show both direct backscatter from the [...] E and F layers and F layer propagated backscatter from the ground. The [...] 12 mc/s soundings made during 1956 have been re-scaled under this contract to extract the available information concerning direct backscatter echoes [...] at ranges below 1000 km. The direct backscatter echo from the F layer [...] (IF echo) has a large diurnal maximum at approximately 1800 AST and a [...] smaller maximum at 0400 AST. IF echoes are observed at ranges from 500 [...] to 1000 km, usually occurring at approximately one-half the range of the [...] 2 F echo. The azimuth distribution of the IF echo has a maximum centered [...] on magnetic north. [...] Direct backscatter from the E layer (IE echo) occurs in the range [...] interval of 200 to 800 km with a maximum between 300 and 500 km. The [...] azimuth distribution maximum is centered on magnetic north and the diurnal [...] distribution shows maxima from 0000 to 0200 AST and 0300 to 0400 AST. [...] F layer propagated backscatter from the ground (2 F echo) is investigated [...] using both the 12 mc/s 1956 soundings and soundings on 12, 18 and 30 mc/s [...] obtained during 1958. Histograms showing the diurnal distribution of 2 F [...] echo occurrence on 12 mc/s for 1956 and 1958 are essentially the same, and [...] illustrate solar effects on the F layer. The behaviour of the regular 2 F [...] echo on 12, 18 and 30 mc/s for a typical day in December 1958 is illustrated [...] by a series of PPI photographs. [...] The results obtained during an experimental investigation of the drift [...] motions of auroral ionization are summarized, and certain properties of [...] the luminous aurora established by photo-electric measurements reviewed. [...] Some preliminary observations of solar radio emission at 65 mc/s are [...] reported. [...] A technique of estimating the electron densities of the outer ionosphere [...] by the use of nose whistlers is described. The method involves the numerical [...] integration of the whistler dispersion equation after first assuming a model for the distribution in density. This technique is applied to several [...] whistlers which occurred on 19 March 1959 resulting in estimates of electron [...] densities between four and five earth's radii. [...] The temporal variations in the occurrence of chorus during the IGY [...] at College and Kotzebue, Alaska are studied.

[...] The mathematical theory of longitudinally propagated whistlers in a [...] magnetic dipole field is developed. The usual method for deriving electron [...] density distributions in the exosphere from nose whistler observations by [...] means of assumed distribution functions is criticized and shown to be [...] ambiguous and subjective. A systematic method which avoids subjective [...] assumptions is described.

40|$|Observations {{made during}} 1958 and 1959 using a sweep frequency, HF, oblique sounder located at College, Alaska, are discussed, and {{selected}} groups of echoes are illustrated. Groundscatter is the predominant echo type observed on mid-latitude backscatter records, {{but this is}} not true [...] in the high latitudes. The majority of the scatter echoes from soundings [...] toward geomagnetic north were direct F region scatter of two main types - [...] IF and constant range echoes. These same echo types were observed from [...] the E region during magnetic disturbances (the slant Es echo corresponds [...] to the IF echo). These echoes were centered about geomagnetic north on [...] swept azimuth soundings and were produced by scatter near the oblique [...] reflection point in the ionosphere. Thus, we conclude that the echoes [...] were caused by scatter from irregularities aligned along the geomagnetic [...] field. [...] The IF echo branches off the first order vertical incidence F region [...] trace and increases linearly in range with frequency. It is produced by [...] scattered energy which is least-time focused. The scatterers are essentially [...] randomly distributed within large regions called clouds in the F [...] region. The height of the irregularities producing the IF echo can be [...] computed if the vertical incidence traces are clear; heights between 200 [...] and 350 km have been found by this technique, indicating that electron [...] density irregularities are not confined only to the lower ionosphere. [...] From the regularity of occurrence of the IF echo, it is highly probable [...] that the irregularities extend throughout much of the F region. [...] The constant range echo is produced by energy scattered from the [...] field-aligned surface of a cloud of irregularities. The soundings were [...] made to the north so the clouds producing the observed constant range [...] echo extended east and west. [...] The IF and the constant range echoes are useful research tools [...] because they indicate the amount of cloudiness present in the F region. [...] During the summer day, the F region is relatively free of clouds, while [...] during the winter night, it is quite overcast. The cloud size and distribution [...] depend primarily upon the zenith angle of the sun, the smaller [...] the zenith angle, the smaller and fewer the clouds. [...] Geomagnetic effects do not appear to influence the behavior or the [...] F region clouds, although this point is somewhat uncertain. The E region [...] clouds which produced the slant Es echo were definitely correlated with [...] geomagnetic activity but not to solar radiation, there appeared to be [...] no connection between the causes of the E and the F region <b>direct</b> <b>scatter</b> echoes even though they were propagated by the same general mechanisms.

40|$|When gas atoms or {{molecules}} {{collide with}} clean and ordered surfaces, under many circumstances the energy-resolved scattering spectra exhibit two clearly distinct features due to <b>direct</b> <b>scattering</b> and to trapping in the physisorption well with subsequent desorption. James Clerk Maxwell {{is credited with}} being the first to describe this situation by invoking the simple assumption that when an impinging gas beam is scattered from a surface it {{can be divided into}} a part that exchanges no energy and specularly reflects and another part that equilibrates or accommodates completely and then desorbs with an equilibrium distribution. In this paper a scattering theory is developed, using an iterative algorithm and classical mechanics for the collision process, that describes both <b>direct</b> <b>scattering</b> and trapping-desorption of the incident beam. The initially trapped fraction of particles can be followed as they continue to make further interactions with the surface until they are all eventually promoted back into the positive energy continuum and leave the surface region. Consequently, this theory allows a rigorous test of the Maxwell assumption and determines the conditions under which it is valid. The theory also gives quantitative explanations of recent experimental measurements which exhibit both a <b>direct</b> <b>scattering</b> contribution and a trapping-desorption fraction in the energy-resolved spectra.
