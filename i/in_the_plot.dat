His {{official}} historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plot,</b> and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after. It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plot,</b> for prior to his accusation he {{had fallen out of}} favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.|$|E

5|$|Amis drew upon {{a holiday}} {{he had taken}} in the Greek islands to create a {{realistic}} Greek setting and characters. He emphasised political intrigue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> more than Fleming had done in the canonical Bond novels, also adding revenge to Bond's motivations by including M's kidnapping.

40|$|Snow {{accumulation}} {{was compared}} between forested and clear-cut <b>plots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transient snow {{zone of the}} western Cascade Range of Oregon. and measured snowmelt in both plots was compared to melt predicted by energy balance analyses. The absence of forest vegetation affected both snow accumulation and amount of energy available for melt during rainfall. Because intercepted snow melted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest canopy and reached the ground as meltwater, water equivalents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear-cut <b>plot</b> were commonly 2 - 3 times greater than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forested <b>plot.</b> During <b>the</b> largest rain-on-snow event of the study, measured water outflow (rain plus snowmelt) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear-cut <b>plot</b> was 21 % greater than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forested <b>plot.</b> Estimates made from microclimatological data show that during the common period of melt, total energy available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear-cut <b>plot</b> was 40 % greater than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forested <b>plot.</b> Because of greater wind speed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear-cut <b>plot,</b> combined sensible and latent heat transfers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear-cut <b>plot</b> were nearly triple those of <b>the</b> forested <b>plot...</b>|$|R

5|$|Following the July 20 Plot, Model was {{the first}} senior {{commander}} to reaffirm his loyalty to Hitler. However, he also {{refused to give up}} General Hans Speidel, his chief of staff at Army Group B who was heavily implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plot,</b> to the Gestapo. Model was well aware of Speidel's political leanings, as were his predecessors at Army Group B, Erwin Rommel and Günther von Kluge. Like them, he shielded Speidel for as long as possible, while ignoring such treasonous talk as might take place.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{understory}} dwarf bamboo (Sasa kurilensis) on <b>the</b> seasonal changes <b>in</b> soil temperature was studied in a dense secondary forest of Betula ermanii in northern Japan. Four <b>plots</b> were established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Betula ermanii forest with Sasa kurilensis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> understory, and Sasa was removed <b>in</b> two <b>plots</b> of <b>the</b> four. The soil temperatures at 5 em {{below the surface}} were monitored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> four <b>plots</b> from May 1999 to September 2000, and were compared between <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> with and without Sasa. The daily maximum soil-temperature was ca. 0. 5 'C lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> without Sasa than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> with Sasa during the snow-cover period. On the contrary, the daily maximum soil-temperature was ca. 3 - 4 'C higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> without Sasa than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> with Sasa just after <b>the</b> snowmelt <b>in</b> mid-May 2000. <b>The</b> difference <b>in</b> soil temperature between <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> with and without Sasa decreased gradually from the snowmelt toward the snow-cover period. The solar radiation was highest at around late Mayor early June 2000, and decreased toward winter. In addition, much solar radiation penetrated through the overstory layer from the snowmelt till early June when the leaf emergence of overstory trees started. Therefore, <b>the</b> absolute difference <b>in</b> solar radiation on the soil surface between <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> with and without Sasa {{was thought to be}} highest after the snowmelt, and gradually decreased till the snow cove...|$|R

In 1989, soybean aphids <b>in</b> <b>the</b> untreated <b>plots</b> developed earlier and increased rapidly. Aphid density per 100 plants on June 15 th was over 10, 000, and the rapid development period was over 40 d. But aphids in 1990 developed slightly later with a shorter development period. Soybeans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> untreated <b>plots</b> significantly displayed <b>the</b> symptoms of distorted leaves, shorter stems and stunted plants. Plants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treated <b>plots</b> were higher (20. 2 cm in 1989) than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> untreated <b>plots.</b> Soybean aphids significantly affected soybean yields.

5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus {{as an example of}} a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plot.</b> Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in the poetry of Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.|$|E
