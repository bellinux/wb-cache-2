At noon we started to ascend to the palace, {{on the top of the}} spur. On the way we passed a beautiful well, sixty feet deep, and with a fine flight of steps to the bottom. Now neglected and overgrown with flowering weeds and creepers, it afforded me many of the plants I had only previously obtained in a withered state; it was curious to observe there some of the species of the hill-tops, whose seeds doubtless are scattered abundantly over the surrounding plains, and only vegetate where they find a coolness and moisture resembling that of the altitude they elsewhere affect. A fine fig-tree growing out of the stone-work spread its leafy green branches over the well mouth, which was about twelve feet square; its roots assumed a singular form, enveloping two sides of the walls with a beautiful net-work, which at high-water mark (rainy season), abruptly divides into thousands of little brushes, dipping into the water which they fringe. It was a pretty cool place to descend to, from a temperature of 80 degrees above, to 74 degrees at the bottom, where the water was 60 degrees; and most refreshing to look, either up the shaft to the <b>green</b> <b>fig</b> shadowing the deep profound, or along the sloping steps through a vista of flowering herbs and climbing plants, to the blue heaven of a burning sky.|$|E

The constitutive elements of the Andalusian kitchen are delimited. Wheat was {{an important part in}} the composition of some plates. The working class used to have several soups, oatmeals, wheat and vegetables, and, they fed on dry fruits, that the fertile land of Al-Andalus produced in abundance. On the contrary, the rich people used to have complicated plates, prepared with meat and spices. They liked chicken, hare and poultry in general.

Fruits (like the known <b>green</b> <b>fig</b> from M??laga), drinks (especially the wine), rice and preserves had an special attention. The relationship between the Spanish-Moslem cooking and the Eastern one are manifested here, the same as the identity of the culinary tastes which existed between Christiens and Moslems of all social conditions during the last centuries that those Moslems were in Spain. We can easily find the influence of Al-Andalus in the predilection that the Spaniards of the Golden century had for the vegetables, fruits, and varied suits; also, in the sobriety which characterized the vassals of Felipe II, and in the preference that the Portugueses had for the rice, preserves and jam.

40|$|Although the {{historic}} use of biological weapons has been infrequent, {{a belief that}} state sponsored armies or terrorist organizations will use this type of weapon has never been greater which demands a capability for rapid medical response and early intervention. Molecular diagnostic methods, based on DNA amplification known as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) are promising tools in fast and specific detection and identification of biological agent(s). The R. A. P. I. D. TM - PCR (Ruggedized Advanced Pathogen Identification Device) (fig. 1), is a 32 sample capacity, automated instrument integrating Idaho Technology's LightCycler® technology into a portable, impact resistant package. This allows field identification of pathogens quickly. Monitoring the fluorescence from the double-stranded DNA dye SYBR® <b>Green</b> (<b>fig.</b> 2), followed by differentiation of products by melting curves or from TaqMan® probes (6 -FAM-oligo-TAMRA,), allows inexpensive quantification of low initial template copy number. Cycle sequencing reactions done in the thermocycling module of the R. A. P. I. D. system are faster, cleaner and more readable than parallel reactions done in a conventional heat block cycler. The use of air as the cycling medium ensures temperature uniformity and rapid heat exchange with the sample loaded in thin micro-capillary tubes which are ideally suited to temperature cycling, because of their extremely high surface area to volume ratio. A conventional PCR protocol takes up-to 3 hours to do 30 three temperature cycles. The R. A. P. I. D. system can complete a 40 cycle reaction in less than 20 minutes (6 to 30 min.). This makes R. A. P. I. D. system the fastest thermal cycler in the world. The United States Air Force has developed over 50 assays for infectious agents on the R. A. P. I. D. system. Assays for infectious agents typically consist of two temperature cycling for 40 cycles. Protocols for isolation of bacteria and viral DNA (or RNA) {{have been developed for}} clinical specimens, air samples and water samples. Protocols for food samples are being developed now. Assays in use for : Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, botulinum toxin, staphylococcal enterotoxins, Francisella tularensis, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, E. coli, Campylobacter, VEE, West Nile, Yellow Fever, Brucella spp., and many others.

I wanted {{each and every one of}} them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet. -Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar This project was created to explore a text I have always felt personally indebted to but never further examined. Tied to my studies in printmaking, specifically intaglio and aquatint methods, and my recent interest in photographing trees, the project was created to explore layers of aesthetic representation. Drawn towards trees that have bare branches free to the open sky, I have built up a library of photographs that I have been incorporating in various personal artistic endeavors, including printmaking. I choose to create a project that incorporated the reoccurring images of the fig tree in Plath’s novel with my own reoccurring desire to incorporate natural images in my work. With a seemingly elegant project proposal, I was left with one overwhelming question: what is the significance of this fig tree image and how can this been reflected in my own representation? My work was incomplete until I could understand the connection. My self-created project had then become huger than I had ever imagined. With library books four-times renewed I was often left puzzled and exhausted by issues of representing representation. While the novel could be critiqued in every direction, from autobiographical implications to issues of marriage and gender, I was left lacking a conceptual direction that encased both Esther Greenwood’s dilemmas and my own. It was not until a long airplane ride allowed me the time to read the entire novel in a new light, that I made an incredible connection between the natural image and the “coming of age” motif the novel held. Had it not been for a recent encounter with Alfred North Whitehead’s Modes of Thought, which discusses an inescapable system of critical thought relating to views of temporality, I never would have seen such a beautiful link between Plath’s representation and youth and nature and my own struggling desires for connections. Striving for perfection, Esther Greenwood is baffled her ability to recognize future events and processes, but is haunted by a past that is no longer. The central image of the fig tree, ultimately represented through my prints, is one that recognizes the role of past within the present and that of an ever-dieing present within an unknown future. The link was Whitehead’s notion of potentiality. The images of nature allow glimpses of the “now” while keeping in mind a past of growth and a future that holds the definite fate of death but infinite possibilities within the finite. My goal is to create a print and textual piece that allows viewers to both recognize and feel these issues of process, nature, and vitality given an ultimate fatality...|$|E

The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effect of the lopping system on the development and production of <b>green</b> <b>figs</b> 'Roxo de Valinhos'. The experiment using plants of four years of age, with spaced 3 x 2 m, was conducted from July/ 2007 to March/ 2008 in Quatro Pontes, PR. The design was randomized blocks with four blocks, and the treatments arranged in a 2 x 5, taking as factors the number of productive branches (plants conducted with six or twelve branches) and the number of loppings (one, two, three or four, besides the control without lopping). In the lopping system, after the emission of the 16 th leaf, the branch was blunted (apical bud removed), selecting two sprouting per productive branches. New lopping was accomplished later, always after the emission of sixth leaf. In each plot, consisting of the three plants, data were collected in the production cycles 2007 / 2008. The highest yield (2, 208. 87 g planta- 1) and estimated yield (3, 681. 19 kg ha- 1) observed of <b>green</b> <b>figs</b> were obtained when plants were conducted with twelve branches of production, effecting three loopings...|$|R
