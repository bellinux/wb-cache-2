50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the Cestoda has been clarified with molecular data. The Gyrocotylidea are a sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> all other Cestoda (Nephroposticophora): the Amphilinidea form the sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> the Eucestoda. The Caryophyllidea are the sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> Spathebothriidea and remaining Eucestoda. The Haplobothriidea are the sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> Diphyllobothriidae.

5|$|Overnight, {{thousands}} of protesters continued {{to defy the}} curfew and, as the night progressed, troops and armoured vehicles deployed across Cairo to guard key places such as train stations, major government buildings and banks. The army had insufficient capacity to patrol neighbourhoods, so residents set up armed vigilante <b>groups</b> <b>to</b> drive off looters and robbers. A heavy army presence (though no police) was reported in Suez. Chaos was rampant in Suez during the night, but as day broke the streets remained relatively quiet. As in Cairo, many residents formed vigilante <b>groups</b> <b>to</b> protect their homes and businesses {{in the absence of}} police. The military set up numerous checkpoints throughout the city. An estimation of about 30 bodies including the bodies of two children were taken to El Demerdash Hospital in central Cairo.|$|E

5|$|The local {{population}} remained faithful to Skanderbeg {{and did not}} reveal his whereabouts. Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had up until then been in separate <b>groups,</b> <b>to</b> assemble without being seen by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta – as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was in this direction – and on 2 September 1457, it was split again into three <b>groups</b> <b>to</b> assault the Ottoman camp. With {{some of his most}} trusted men, he climbed to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp and saw that the Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men to get ready for battle.|$|E

Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among non-Brahmin caste groups.|$|E
5|$|Activision {{provided}} {{a budget of}} US$1.8 million; the amount was intentionally kept low to make the project manageable for Nihilistic and reduce the risk to Activision, which was relatively inexperienced with RPGs at the time. Nihilistic's management was committed to the entire team working in a one-room environment with no walls, doors, or offices, believing this would force the individual <b>groups</b> <b>to</b> communicate and allow each department to respond to queries immediately, saving hours or days of development time.
