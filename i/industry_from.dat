5|$|At {{the time}} of Taft's presidency, {{protectionism}} {{through the use of}} tariffs was a fundamental position of the Republican Party. The Dingley Tariff had been enacted to protect American <b>industry</b> <b>from</b> foreign competition. The 1908 party platform had supported unspecified revisions to the Dingley Act, and Taft interpreted this to mean reductions. Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the tariff question.|$|E

5|$|Ironstone {{outcrops}} {{along the}} northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield were extensively worked for the production of iron and were important in the initiation of the Industrial Revolution in South Wales. Lead was mined at Pentre Halkyn in Flintshire during the Roman occupation of Britain and there were ore-bearing sites in Clwyd where lead, silver and sometimes zinc were mined. These metals were also mined in the upland areas of the Rivers Ystwyth and Rheidol. Manganese, titanium and numerous other minerals occur in various parts of Wales. Gold is found in southern Snowdonia and at Dolaucothi, and Snowdonia had a flourishing copper <b>industry</b> <b>from</b> the early 1800s. Although exploited in the past, none of these minerals is mined on a commercial scale today.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} in the area since around 1350 AD. Prior to European settlement, the region was sparsely {{inhabited}} by nomadic groups of Māori, most of whom lived close to river mouths. In the early days of European settlement the area was frequented by whalers and sealers, and saw milling became a major local <b>industry</b> <b>from</b> the mid-19th century until the 1930s. Ecotourism has become of growing importance in the Catlins economy, which otherwise relies heavily on dairy farming and fishing.|$|E

5|$|The True Cost is a 2015 {{documentary}} film directed by Andrew Morgan {{that focuses on}} fast fashion. It discusses several aspects of the garment <b>industry</b> <b>from</b> production—mainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries—to its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Using an approach that looks at environmental, social and psychological aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} regarding which European settlement is the oldest in North America. As mentioned above, while English fishermen had set up seasonal camps in St. John's in the 16th century, they were expressly forbidden by the English government, {{at the urging of}} the West Country fishing <b>industry,</b> <b>from</b> establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast. As a result, the town of St. John's was not established as a 'permanent' community until after the 1630s. With respect to the oldest surviving permanent English settlements in North America, it was preceded by Jamestown, Virginia (1607), the Cuper's Cove colony at Cupids (1610), St. George's, Bermuda (1612) and the Bristol's Hope colony at Harbour Grace (1618).|$|E
5|$|A dam on Nescopeck Creek was {{destroyed}} during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In the early 1900s, {{there was a}} steam-electric power station {{at the mouth of}} Nescopeck Creek. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Nescopeck Creek {{in the beginning of the}} 1900s. The Jeddo Tunnel, which drained a colliery in the 20th century, emptied into Nescopeck Creek. After World War II, there was a large increase in unemployment rates in the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to the failing coal mining <b>industry.</b> <b>From</b> 1919 to 1926, the United States Geological Survey had a station on Nescopeck Creek near the community of St. Johns. Two other stream gauging stations have been built on Nescopeck Creek. One of these stations, which was in use from 1949 to 1950 was in Nescopeck. The other, which was in use from 1963 to 1970, was 0.6 miles upstream of Nescopeck Creek's mouth. In the 1990s, some people were caught stealing Native American artifacts at the Nescopeck Creek headwaters.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto considers Space Invaders to be {{the game}} that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it.

John Romero and John Carmack cited Space Invaders as their introduction to video games. Several publications ascribed {{the expansion of the}} video game <b>industry</b> <b>from</b> a novelty into a global industry {{to the success of the}} game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders.

5|$|Siva, which {{attained}} cult {{status in}} Telugu cinema, {{is one of}} the first Telugu films produced after the migration of Telugu film <b>industry</b> <b>from</b> Madras to Hyderabad to feature characters speaking the Telangana dialect. The film made Nagarjuna a superstar in Telugu cinema; it changed his career, and earned him a reputation for encouraging new directors. Nagarjuna considered Siva a milestone in his personal life as well since he and Amala, who were in a relationship during the film's shoot, decided to marry after its completion. According to filmmaker V. V. Vinayak and writer Pulagam Chinnarayana, Siva divided Telugu cinema into two eras: before and after the film. With Siva, Varma was credited with the introduction of steadicams and new sound recording techniques in Telugu films. Within a year of the film's release, more than ten steadicams were imported into India. Siva attracted the young audience during its theatrical run, and its success encouraged filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental Telugu films.|$|E

5|$|The {{fact that}} it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim's economy: the fishing <b>{{industry}},</b> <b>from</b> the fishing vessels that put in each day to the canning industry and to the city's fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for fertilizing fields are the result of its geography. Tourism and the related industries are more relevant in Póvoa's economy these days, as fisheries have lost importance. Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels' capacity. Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average. A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned fish, for MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D'Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.|$|E
