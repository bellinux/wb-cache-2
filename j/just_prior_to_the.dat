5|$|McKinley {{remained}} well ahead {{when the state}} conventions concluded, leaving his opponents' only hope the Republican National Committee (RNC), which would make initial rulings on which delegates would be seated; there were contested seats or rival delegations in several states, and rulings against McKinley could still deprive him of a first-ballot majority. When the RNC met in mid-June, <b>just</b> <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> convention, McKinley was easily victorious in almost all cases.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records.

Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it <b>just</b> <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E

5|$|BAe {{eventually}} received £450million {{of funding}} from the UK government, well short of the £750million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings.

Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. With funding in place, Airbus launched the A330 and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987, <b>just</b> <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paris Air Show. At that time, the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers, including lessor International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Of the order total, forty-one were for A330s.

However, exit polls revealed that Rocha's comments had served to increase support for Morales. Following the election, the U.S. embassy maintained this critical stance, characterising Morales as a criminal and encouraging Bolivia's traditional parties to sign a broad agreement to oppose the MAS; Morales himself began alleging that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was plotting to assassinate him.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate.

Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body.
