25|$|A {{key factor}} {{in the success of}} Italian cuisine is its heavy {{reliance}} on traditional products; Italy has the most traditional specialities protected under EU law.

Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon. Gelato, tiramisù and cassata are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes and patisserie.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese wines {{were first}} shipped to England in the 12th century from the Entre Douro e Minho region (which today {{includes}} modern Portuguese wine regions {{such as the}} douro and vinho verde). In 1386, Portugal and England signed the Treaty of Windsor which fostered close diplomatic {{relations between the two}} countries and opened the door for extensive trade opportunities. The 1703 Methuen Treaty furthered advanced English economic interest in Portugal by reducing tariffs and giving Portuguese wines preferential treatment in the British wine market over French wines. Around this time, the fortified wine known as port was increasing in popularity in Britain. The lucrative trade in Port prompted the Portuguese authorities to establish one of the world's first protected <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> when Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal established boundaries and regulations for the production of authentic Port from the Douro in 1756.|$|E
25|$|One form {{of fraud}} {{involves}} affixing counterfeit labels of expensive wines to bottles of less expensive wine. This practice became particularly prominent following {{the devastation of}} the phylloxera epidemic in the 19th century when the supply of expensive premium wine was scarce. At first, the label fraud mostly consisted of taking a wine from a region of lesser acclaim (such as Southwest France or Calabria in Italy) and then labeling the wine as if it came from more prestigious regions such as Bordeaux or Tuscany. To counter this type of fraud, governments developed extensive appellation systems and Protected <b>Designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> or (PDOs) that attempted to regulate wines labeled as coming from particular wine regions. Early attempts to protect {{the name of a}} wine region led to government declaration on the boundaries and wine permitted to carry the names of Chianti, Oporto and Tokaji. Today most major European wine producing countries have some appellation system of protected origins. The most well systems include the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) used in France, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) used in Italy, the Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) used in Portugal, and the Denominación de Origen (DO) system used in Spain. Producers who are registered in each appellation must abide by the appellation's rules, including exact percentage of grapes (often 100%) that must come from that region. Producers who fraudulently use grapes outside the region they are proclaiming on their wine labels can be caught by the appellation's authorities.|$|E

40|$|Food {{regulatory}} councils, <b>designations</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> {{and protected}} <b>designations</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> {{are critical for}} quality control and compliance of regulations of food production.

In adopting social anchor theory, this study examines {{the role of a}} cheese regulatory council in an ultra-peripheral European region (La Palma Island). Interviews with current and former representatives of the regulatory council and with member cheese producers were conducted. The findings demonstrate the council’s potential to help create rural wealth by fulfilling the role of a social anchor, particularly promoting change, and providing a point of connection, guidance, and support in production processes. The various implications emerging from the findings are discussed, and avenues for future studies are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Accession to the European Union (EU) {{implies the}} {{acceptance}} of the rights and obligations attached to the EU system and its institutional framework, known as the “acquis communautaire”.

The subject matter of this Article is the part of the “acquis” dealing with the protection of geographical indications and <b>designations</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for agricultural products and foodstuffs.

Hershey Creamery alleged [...] "trademark infringement, unfair competition, false <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> false descriptions, and false representations", to which Hershey Chocolate responded with a counterclaim questioning {{the validity of the}} trademark, claiming it was fraudulently obtained.
