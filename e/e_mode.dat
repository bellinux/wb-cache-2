The evanescent T <b>E</b> 0 <b>mode</b> of the waveguide {{filled with a}} DNG/DPS bilayer is characterized also by a simple normalized dispersion relation. Since an important behavior of the modes in the waveguide filled with a DNG/DPS bilayer is {{the existence of a}} turning point (TP) at which the power carried by the respective mode on the propagation direction equals zero and changes the sign, we present also implicit relations for determining the normalized parameters of the T M and T <b>E</b> <b>modes</b> at that TP.

The violoncello has not received th e same a ttention, however. The objectives of this project were to investigate th <b>e</b> <b>modes</b> of th <b>e</b> cello, to compare and contrast the modes of the cello to those of th e violin, and to suggest a system of nomenclature for th <b>e</b> vibrational <b>modes</b> observed in th e cello. This thesis discusses th e experiments, data, results and conclusions on a school-grade cello owned by th e author. To perform a modal analysis, the cello was driven into sinusoidal vibrations by three separate methods: 1) a mechanical bridge drive, 2) an internal oscillating sound pressure, and 3) an external sound field. To help find the resonance frequencies of the cello, sound spectra and accelerance spectra were recorded. Holographic interferometry images of th e cello, driven at its resonance frequencies, revealed how th e cello was moving at these frequencies from which a classification of th <b>e</b> <b>modes</b> of vibration of th e cello was made. The modes of vibration were determined by holographic interferometry using all three driving methods over a frequency range of 90 Hz to 400 Hz. Experiments were also performed to find th <b>e</b> cavity air <b>modes.</b> By damping out the vibrations of the cello body, th <b>e</b> vibrational <b>modes</b> of the air inside the cavity were determined.

40|$|The {{electrical}} and plasma characteristics of radio frequency (13. 56 MHz) inductively coupled argon plasma (RF ICP) were studied in this project. On the electrical breakdown properties, the breakdown voltage has a general appearance of Paschen’s curve and the minimum is achieved at 0. 1 mbar. After ignition, two modes of discharge exist, namely, the <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> at low RF power and H mode at high RF power. Mode transition that occurs {{is accompanied by}} abrupt changes in both {{electrical and}} plasma characteristics. Hysteresis is observed in the mode transitions and has a minimum at 0. 1 mbar. The resistance reflected into the electrical circuit due to H mode plasma is 9. 8 times higher when compared to <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> (Rp= 0. 10 ± 0. 01) Ω. Therefore, the impedance matching scheme used is most efficient at <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> where the antenna coil resistance Ra is (1. 12 ± 0. 01) Ω. Ra doubles in the H mode. However, the transfer of power is more efficient in the H mode. This efficiency {{is reflected in the}} much higher electron density of ne = (3. 6 − 12. 2) × 1017 m− 3 measured in the H mode at 0. 10 ± 0. 1 mbar. Consequently, the increased electron collisions tend to lower the electron temperature Te in the H mode (1. 7 − 2. 0 eV) as compared to that in <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> (Te = 2. 3 - 2. 8 eV). The measured electron energy distribution function EEDF in H mode is inclined towards Maxwellian-type especially at 200 W.

40|$|Tensor Minkowski Functionals (TMFs) are tensor generalizations of {{the usual}} Minkowski Functionals which are scalar quantities. We {{introduce}} them here for use in cosmological analysis, in particular to analyze the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. They encapsulate information about the shapes of structures and the orientation of distributions of structures. We focus {{on one of the}} TMFs, namely W- 2 (1, 1), which is the (1, 1) rank tensor generalization of the genus. The ratio of the eigenvalues of the average of W- 2 (1, 1) over all structures, a, encodes the net orientation of the structures; and the average of the ratios of the eigenvalues of W- 2 (1, 1) for each structure, 13, encodes the net intrinsic anisotropy of the structures. We have developed a code that computes W- 2 (1, 1), and from it alpha and beta, for a set of structures on the 2 -dimensional Euclidean plane. We use it to compute alpha and beta as functions of chosen threshold levels for simulated Gaussian and isotropic CMB temperature and <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> fields. We obtain the value of a to be one for both temperature and <b>E</b> <b>mode,</b> which means that we recover the statistical isotropy of density fluctuations that we input in the simulations. We find that the standard ACDM model predicts a charateristic shape of beta for temperature and <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> {{as a function of the}} threshold, and the average over thresholds is beta similar to 0. 62 for temperature and beta similar to 0. 63 for <b>E</b> <b>mode.</b> Accurate measurements of a and beta can be used to test the standard model of cosmology and to search for deviations from it. For this purpose we compute alpha and beta for temperature and <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> data of various data sets from PLANCK mission. (1) We compare the values measured from observed data with those obtained from simulations to which instrument beam and noise characteristics of the 44 GHz frequency channel have been added (which are provided as part of the PLANCK data release). We find very good agreement of beta and alpha between all PLANCK temperature data sets with ACDM expectations. <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> data show good agreement for 13 but a for all data sets deviate from ACDM predictions higher than 3 - sigma. It is most likely that the deviations are probing the anisotropy of the noise field and beam characteristics of the detector rather than the true <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> signal since for 44 GHz the signal-to-noise ratio is well below one. This will be further investigated after the full PLANCK data becomes publicly available...|$|E
40|$|Although it has {{previously}} been recognized that the CMB polarization measurement on a sky ring is able to separate the B and E-mode patterns, we show that the rotational symmetry of the CMB polarization measurement is indeed unique, in that it enables the B and <b>E</b> <b>modes</b> to be separately measured in a simple and clean manner. The separation of B and <b>E</b> <b>modes</b> can in principle be achieved even with a single-polarization detector of arbitrary beam pattern. Based on this premise, a specific observing strategy is suggested, where the telescope scans along a sky circle with the polarimeter axis always oriented to a fixed direction {{with respect to the}} radial direction of the sky circle. The observational strategy for B-mode measurements can further be refined by choosing appropriate beam sizes to suppress the accidental E-mode leakage.
