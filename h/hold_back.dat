5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. When {{the wind is}} blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops {{to a point that}} he judged that he could no longer <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E

The Big Four Bridge {{would be the}} only Louisville bridge with serious {{accidents}} during its building; thirty-seven individuals died during its construction. The first twelve died while working on a pier foundation when a caisson that was supposed to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> the river water flooded, drowning the workers. Another four men died a few months after that when a wooden beam broke while working on a different pier caisson.|$|E
5|$|Private Rafel Toro, from Humacao, Puerto Rico, {{was part}} of the U.S. Marine Corps {{occupation}} force in Nicaragua, serving with the Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua. On July 25, 1927, Private Toro was assigned to advance guard duty in Nueva Segovia. As he rode into town, he was attacked; returning fire, he was able to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> the enemy until reinforcements arrived. He was mortally wounded in this action for which he was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.|$|E
5|$|The Conservators {{applied for}} a second act of {{parliament}} in 1707, as they needed a further £3,800 to finance projects including {{the building of a}} half-lock and the removal of a shoal just below Knapp Bridge. Boats carrying 15tons of cargo could reach Taunton by 1717. The navigation included a lock and two or more half-locks, consisting of a pair of gates to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> the water, and an agreement to build a towpath between Ham Mills and Taunton was reached in 1724.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Malakand was the 26 July – 2 August 1897 {{siege of}} the British {{garrison}} in the Malakand region of colonial British India's North West Frontier Province. The British faced {{a force of}} Pashtun tribesmen whose tribal lands had been bisected by the Durand Line, the 1,519 mile (2,445km) border between Afghanistan and British India drawn {{up at the end}} of the Anglo-Afghan wars to help <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> what the British feared to be the Russian Empire's spread of influence towards the Indian subcontinent.|$|E

Stryker is {{killed in the}} deluge and Jean sacrifices herself to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> the flood of water while getting the jet into the air, and is then {{consumed}} by the flood and presumed dead. The X-Men give the president Stryker's files, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Wolverine remember Jean, and Xavier begins to hold a class.|$|E
5|$|The encounter: Once {{the prey}} detects the wolves, it can either {{approach}} the wolves, stand its ground, or flee. Large prey, such as moose, elk, and muskoxen, usually stand their ground. Should this occur, the wolves <b>hold</b> <b>back,</b> as they require the stimulus of a running animal {{to proceed with}} an attack. If the targeted animal stands its ground, the wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} a coup for Channel 4, who erected crush {{barriers}} outside their building to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> fans when the cast arrived for {{a press conference}} (though no fans actually turned up). The broadcaster also commissioned a behind-the-scenes program from Princess Productions. Hosted by British television personality Johnny Vaughan, The One Where Johnny Makes Friends features comedic tongue-in-cheek interviews with all six main cast (Vaughan contacted Kudrow by payphone, claiming that he couldn't make international calls from his dressing room) and was broadcast on Channel 4 on May 6, 1998.|$|E
5|$|The three battles to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> the Central Powers {{ended in}} early autumn 1917, {{by which time}} there were 31 dead and 453 wounded among the volunteers; 129 {{received}} distinction. Dimitrie Lăzărel was one to have survived all three engagements, and {{legend has it that}} he never went into combat without the banner. Deleu had left reserve duty to join the 10th Chasseurs Battalion in the Mărășești combat, but fell severely ill and was reassigned to other offices.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the day, Warren's {{squadron}} closed {{from the}} north-east while Bompart made frantic {{efforts to reach}} open water. Both fleets were hindered by a gale which swept the sea shortly before 20:00. All three of Hoches topmasts were blown down and her mizzensail shredded, leaving her substantially slower than her compatriots and forcing them to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> in her defence. Other ships suffered too, as the French Résolue sprang a severe leak and HMS Anson lost her mizzenmast and several topmasts.|$|E

5|$|Although the Song dynasty {{was able}} to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> the Jin, a new foe came to power over the steppe, deserts, and plains north of the Jin dynasty. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227), {{initially}} invaded the Jin dynasty in 1205 and 1209, engaging in large raids across its borders, and in 1211 an enormous Mongol army was assembled to invade the Jin. The Jin dynasty was forced to submit and {{pay tribute to the}} Mongols as vassals; when the Jin suddenly moved their capital city from Beijing to Kaifeng, the Mongols saw this as a revolt. Under the leadership of Ögedei Khan (r.1229–1241), both the Jin dynasty and Western Xia dynasty were conquered by Mongol forces. The Mongols also invaded Korea, the Abbasid Caliphate of the Middle East and the Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|Then-Bruins {{head coach}} Don Cherry {{suggested}} that the reason Orr never re-signed with the Bruins was Orr's complete trust in Eagleson at the time (Orr said that he described Eagleson as a brother). Cherry recalled Orr had refused {{to speak with the}} Bruins team president directly, allowing Eagleson to mislead or withhold enough details from Boston's offer. Orr's departure from the Bruins was acrimonious and he has not held an official role with the Bruins since. Years later, it emerged that Eagleson had very good relations with Black Hawks owner Bill Wirtz and NHL president John Ziegler that colluded to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> salaries of certain players. Orr disassociated himself from Eagleson in 1980.|$|E

5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at the Necromanteion, the reunited crew is {{attacked}} by Clytius, Pasiphaë, {{and a group}} of their minions. Each of the demigods uses some aspect of their newly strengthened powers or identities to help defeat these monsters; for example, Hazel's new power and alliance with Hecate helps her defeat Pasiphaë and Clytius. During the questers' journey in the mortal world, Percy and Annabeth have been travelling through Tartarus {{to the other side of}} the Doors of Death, aided by the Titan Iapetus (Bob) and a few other beings. As the other demigods fight in the world above, Percy and Annabeth's group reaches the Doors and fights the personification of Tartarus to destroy the chains holding the Doors in place. Bob stays behind amongst hordes of angry monsters to defend the Doors while Percy and Annabeth escape. Once the full quest group is safely reassembled in the mortal world, Reyna arrives on her dying Pegasus. Annabeth says that Reyna, as a Roman, should bring the Athena Parthenos (in the Argo IIs <b>hold)</b> <b>back</b> to Camp Half-Blood to appease both the Greeks and Romans, with Nico and Coach Hedge volunteering to accompany her.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} day of the invasion, the two main forces made rapid {{progress}} inland, the militia troops sent against them retreating and deserting without offering resistance. Serious opposition to the British advance did not begin until 1 February, when French defenders on the heights of Desfourneaux and Surirey were attacked by Prevost's troops, under the direct command of Brigadier-General Daniel Hoghton. Fighting was fierce throughout the next two days, as the outnumbered French used the fortified high ground to <b>hold</b> <b>back</b> a series of frontal assaults. The British lost 84 killed and 334 wounded to French losses of over 700 casualties, and by 3 February the French had been forced back, withdrawing to Fort Desaix near the capital. Progress was also made at Cape Salomon, where the appearance of British troops panicked the French defenders into burning the naval brig Carnation and retreating to the small island, Ilot aux Ramiers, offshore. Henderson's men, assisted by a naval brigade under Captain George Cockburn, set up batteries on the coast and by 4 February had bombarded the island into surrender, opening the principal harbour of Martinique to naval attack.|$|E
