60|$|Then {{first let}} us take a sample case and suppose {{yourself}} to be an elementary teacher. So far as your work went you would be very much as you are to-day; {{you would have a}} finer and more beautiful school-room perhaps, better supplied with apparatus and diagrams; you would have cleaner and healthier, that is to say brighter and more responsive children, and you would have smaller and more manageable classes. Schools will be very important things in the Socialist State, and you will find outside your class-room a much ampler building with open corridors, a library, a bath, refectory for the children's midday meal, and gymnasium, and beyond the playground a garden. You will be an enlisted member of a public service, free under reasonable conditions to resign, liable under extreme circumstances to <b>dismissal</b> <b>for</b> <b>misconduct,</b> but entitled until you do so to a minimum salary, a maintenance allowance, that is, and to employment. You will have had a general education from the State up to the age of sixteen or seventeen, and then three or four years of sound technical training, so that you will know your work from top to bottom. You will have applied for your present position in the service, whatever it is, and have been accepted, much as you apply and are accepted for positions now, by the school managers, and you will have done so because it attracted you and they will have accepted you because your qualifications seemed adequate to them. You will draw a salary attached to the position, over and above that minimum maintenance salary to which I have already alluded. You will be working just as keenly as you are now, and better because of the better training you have had, and because of shorter hours and more invigorating conditions, and you will be working for much the same ends, that is to say for promotion to a larger salary and wider opportunities and for the interest and sake of the work. In your leisure you may be studying, writing, or doing some work of supererogation for the school or the State--because under Socialist conditions it cannot be too clearly understood that all the reasons the contemporary Trade Unionist finds against extra work and unpaid work will have disappeared! You will not in a Socialist State make life harder for others by working keenly and doing much if you are so disposed. You will be free to give yourself generously to your work. You will have no anxiety about sickness or old age, the State, the universal Friendly Society, will hold you secure against that; but if you like to provide extra luxury and dignity for your declining years, if you think you will be amused to collect prints or books, or travel then, or run a rose garden or grow chrysanthemums, the State will be quite ready for you to pay it an insurance premium in order that you may receive in due course an extra annuity to serve that end you contemplate.|$|E

40|$|MM - P&DMDisputes between {{workers and}} their {{employers}} continue {{to take place in}} the country and elsewhere in the world. These disputes cause disruption in workplaces. The disputes are evident in the different sectors - in small and large enterprises, and in the public and the private sectors. The State has established institutions that are responsible for resolving labour disputes, like the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). This institution does not only resolves disputes but also prevents them in order to have harmoniums workplaces. The object of this research is to assess how the CCMA resolve labour disputes in relation to <b>dismissals</b> <b>for</b> <b>misconduct,</b> by exploring the management processes and the procedures employed. The research also compares the processes of labour dispute resolution in South Africa and in Namibia. The research concludes that the management of dispute resolution of cases heard in the CCMA requires an upgrade in the institutional provisions for managing disputes. The findings of the research require the State and the CCMA in particular, to find ways of improving the institution’s administrative processes in a manner that ensures efficient and effective dispute resolution. The research recommends that the CCMA develop a comprehensive communication strategy between the institution and its users. There should be ongoing education and training on labour relations and also the CCMA processes, to both the CCMA users and the staff of the institution.

40|$|In Sidumo v Rustenburg Platinum Ltd ((2007) 12 BLLR 1097 (CC); (2007) 28 ILJ 2405 (CC); 2008 (2) SA 24 (CC)) the Constitutional Court {{made two}} {{findings}} of immense significance for dismissed employees: firstly, the court rejected {{the use of}} the so-called “reasonable employer” test in our law, a test which traditionally required arbitrators and courts evaluating the fairness of a <b>dismissal</b> <b>for</b> proven <b>misconduct</b> to treat the employer’s decision on sanction with a measure of deference; and secondly, on scrutiny of the more controversial issue before the court, to wit, the basis, if any, upon which arbitrators are obliged to make reasonable decisions, the court (in confirming that arbitrators are so obliged) held that the obligation to do so suffuses section 145 of the LRA, and that the extended review grounds legislated under PAJA do not apply. In the present article these judicial conclusions are critically analysed and evaluated, and a number of submissions are made, inter alia: it is submitted that the Constitutional Court’s rejection of the “reasonable employer” test was premised on a fundamental misinterpretation of the test; that while the court’s attempt to locate the reasonableness standard within the LRA was perhaps justifiable, the court failed to consider properly, or at all, the wording of section 145 and its history, with the consequence that the court failed to appreciate that section 145 of the LRA (save on an unduly strained interpretation) could not conceivably be construed to cater, in itself and without more, for the constitutional right to lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair administrative action; and further, that the labour landscape post-Sidumo is, to an extent, unquestionably one bathed in greater uncertainty. In conclusion, the author poses the question whether, on a review of Sidumo, the Constitutional Court should not be considered to have fallen short of fulfilling its constitutional obligations under the rule of la...|$|R

40|$|Since the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) {{made clear}} ‘that Article 10 applies {{also to the}} workplace’, the right to freedom of {{expression}} of employees is no longer disputed. Case law of the ECtHR shows that Article 10 applies both to employees of public authorities, and to employees in the private sector, as well as labour organisations and trade union officials in their relation to the employer or the management. The jurisprudence of the ECtHR shows that in many countries in Europe employers have indeed interfered {{with the right to}} freedom of expression of their employees, eventually organised or acting as trade unions’ officials. Such interference can take place in different forms, such as a refusal of promotion, disciplinary measures, non-renewal or termination of an employment contract or an immediate <b>dismissal</b> <b>for</b> serious <b>misconduct.</b> <b>For</b> a diversity of reasons employers have interfered with employees’ or trade unions’ freedom of expression, for instance because some expressions or publications were considered defamatory, insulting or dishonestly criticising the employer, the management or other employees. The crucial issue is where the limits and restrictions of the employee’s and trade unions’ right to freedom of expression lie, as the exercise of this freedom carries with it ‘duties and responsibilities’ (Article 10 § 2 ECHR). According to the standards of the ECHR, the decisive question concerns whether an interference by the employer with the employee’s or trade union’s right to freedom of expression is ‘necessary in a democratic society’. In other words: when is there ‘a pressing social need’ justifying such interference? When it concerns freedom of expression of employees this right will be enhanced even more when opinions are expressed or statements are made in the context of trade union activities. The ECtHR in some of its judgments however seems not to give pertinent or sufficient weight to this dimension of the right to freedom of expression as part of trade union activities...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed. (Education Law)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2008. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the role of principals in ensuring the implementation of the Labour Relations Act at school. It was also to determine if District Officials in Sedibeng West: cluster five are supporting the principals in their efforts to ensure that educators are in line with the expectation of the Labour Relations Act. This investigation was prompted by school principals who failed to implement the Act as expected in their respective schools, as well as principals who could manage their schools effectively, but could not sustain the standard for a longer period. To investigate the problem, a literature study and empirical research were undertaken. The literature survey focused on an overview of the Labour Relations Act, the importance of labour relations at school level, operational management of the Labour Relations Act at school level and the Employment of Educators Amendment Act. The literature study focused on training and development (Labour Issues in Education), a systems approach to training and development, the role of principals in supporting professional development, designing professional development programmes and introducing techniques for professional development on-the-job. The empirical investigation obtained the required information from Principals, Deputy Principals, HODs and educators plus the data. The study revealed that principals, deputy principals, HODs and educators need urgent training in the following aspects of the Labour Relations Act i. e. the aims of the Act, strike action, unfair dismissal, <b>dismissal</b> <b>for</b> <b>misconduct,</b> dismissal for incapacity and incompetence and discipline at the workplace. iv The research findings revealed that the District Office (Sedibeng West: Labour Relations Unit) should train and develop educators on a regular basis in dealing with the Labour Relations Act, design a database, so that all the cases (especially the core statistics) will be easily accessible, induct newly appointed educators (i. e. principals, deputy principals, HODs, educators:PL 1) properly, monitor principals' work on a regular basis in order to ensure that the Labour Relations Act is fully implemented at school level, and have a programme that will ensure that all educators (especially principals) attend in-service training on an annual basis, because we are living in a dynamic and transformational type of education. Recommendations have therefore been made so that District Officials (Labour Relations Officials) can assist principals in ensuring that the Labour Relations Act is implemented and owned by educators. vMaster...|$|E
40|$|Magister Legum - LLMIn this mini-thesis, I {{will present}} a {{historical}} development of {{the manner in which}} South African courts have tested the fairness of dismissals, for misconduct. South African Labour history has been marred by confusion and inconsistency in relation to the test to be adopted in determining the fairness of dismissals. This has been so, because there have been two dominant schools of thought, one referred to as the ‘own opinion’ approach, whereby the commissioner/court has the discretion to express his/her own view based upon value judgments on the fairness of the dismissal. The other approach is known as the reasonable employer test (‘ defer to the employer’ approach), whereby the commissioner had to defer to the decision of the employer, unless the dismissal is one that no reasonable employer would impose, or is so excessive that it would shock one’s sense of fairness, then the commissioner may interfere. This thesis will reveal the inconsistency that has been caused, by these two approaches, and the South African courts dissent as to the approach consistent with our law. This dissent, as shall be shown in this thesis, has led to our courts contradicting themselves as to the test consistent with the law. There will be a critical discussion on the source of the reasonable employer test and its application in South Africa during the Labour Relations Act 28 of 1956 (old LRA) and the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 (new LRA). With a further discourse {{on the development of the}} ‘own opinion’ approach during the periods of both the old LRA and the new LRA. This will lead to me looking at the provisions of the South African Constitution, together with the meaning of the right to fair labour practice as provided in the Constitution. Based upon a critical analysis of past jurisprudence, the provisions of the ILO Convention, the provisions of the old LRA and new LRA, foreign law and the Constitutional imperatives, I will attempt to illustrate the approach most consistent with our law. This thesis will culminate with a critical analysis of the Supreme Court of Appeal’s judgment, in the case of Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd vs Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and the ruling of the Constitutional court in Sidumo and Another v Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd and Others. The purpose of providing this historical journey, is to further highlight the rulings of past judgments, that have developed the concept of fairness, as was consistent with the Constitution. It is envisaged that the body of judgments cited in this thesis, may be used as authority, whenever the issue of determining the fairness of <b>dismissal</b> <b>for</b> <b>misconduct</b> arises, before a court or tribunal, such as the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration(CCMA). It is may further be used by employers and employees, in obtaining clarity of the law in relation to the test for fairness of dismissals for misconduct...|$|E

50|$|Prior to 1995, an {{employee}} could be dismissed {{in terms of}} the contract of employment, which could permit any reason <b>for</b> <b>dismissal.</b> Since 1995, {{an employee}} may be dismissed only <b>for</b> <b>misconduct,</b> operational reasons and incapacity. The Labour Relations Act 1995 is a pivotal piece of legislation, as it recognises the need for fast and easy access to justice in labour disputes. The Industrial Court had the status of a High Court, and therefore was not accessible to all labourers.|$|R
40|$|It is {{the right}} of every {{employee}} in South Africa not to be unfairly dismissed. According to the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 an employer may fairly dismiss an employee {{on the grounds of}} conduct, capacity or operational requirements. In addition, the employer is required to also comply with a fair procedure before effecting a dismissal. The requirement of procedural fairness is, however, not as stringent as it was under the previous dispensation established by the former Industrial Courts in terms of the earlier Labour Relations Act. The question {{as to whether or not}} a reason for dismissal is fair, is to be established by the facts of each individual case, and the suitability of dismissal as an appropriate remedy. It remains a challenge to establish if dismissal would be an appropriate sanction in a particular case of misconduct. The test is whether the award is one that a reasonable decision-maker could arrive at taking into account the evidence to be considered. It is no longer the employer’s view that is dominant, but “[u]ltimately, the commissioner’s sense of fairness is what must prevail”. The notion of fairness however applies equally to employer an employee and it involves balancing the competing and, every so often, inconsistent, interests of the employer on the one side, and the employee on the other side. The relative weight afforded to the particular interests creates very specific challenges, but nonetheless depends essentially on the overall circumstances of each individual case. Whether <b>dismissal</b> <b>for</b> <b>misconduct</b> is for a fair reason would established by the facts of the case, coupled with the appropriateness of dismissal as a sanction. Dismissal as a penalty should be reserved for cases involving serious misconduct and repeated disciplinary infractions. A crucial question would be whether the misconduct is of such a serious nature that it goes to the core of the employment relationship and makes any possible continued employment relationship intolerable. Additionally, apart from aspects like the importance of the rule breached and the harm caused by the employee’s breach, certain considerations should also be accounted, like length of service disciplinary history, and the employee’s personal circumstances, as well as the particular circumstances surrounding the infringement. Dishonest conduct by an employee that destroys the goodwill, trust and confidence an employer holds towards an employee, would normally be deemed as a significant breach which may justify a sanction of dismissal. The test is whether or not the misconduct was of such serious nature that it would make a continued employment relationship intolerable; “whether or not respondent’s actions had the effect of rendering the continuation of the relationship of employer and employee intolerable”. It still remains for the employer to present evidence that a continued relationship would be intolerable and not to merely liken serious misconduct with such a finding. Relatively recent case law seems to suggest that employers are entitled to a strict attitude towards dishonesty as a ground for dismissal. The objective of the CCMA Guidelines on Misconduct Arbitrations, effective from 1 January 2012, is to ensure that arbitrators issue consistent awards on dismissals involving misconduct. The questions that the guidelines seek to address are, inter alia, (i) how an arbitrator should conduct the proceedings; (ii) the valuation of evidence for the purpose of making an award; (iii) assessing the procedural fairness of a dismissal; (iv) assessing the substantive fairness of a dismissal; and (v) determining the remedy for an unfair dismissal. The Guidelines are peremptory in that arbitrators will have to take them into account and will have to provide an explanation if they deviate. It is undoubtedly a useful tool in guiding employers on what they need to present to commissioners at arbitration...|$|E
