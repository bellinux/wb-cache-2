5|$|John's first {{marriage}} probably dates to {{after his arrival}} in Serbia, though the identity of his first wife, if any, is unknown. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> ruler of Valona, Alexander Komnenos Asen, was his son, {{then he would have}} been born circa 1346–1348, as he was already an adult in 1363–1366. This would place John's potential {{first marriage}} a few years before Alexander's estimated birth. Around 1350–1355, John married Anna Palaiologina, a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini, the despot of Epirus. This marriage to an Epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised John's position in the region. Besides Alexander, another very likely child of John Komnenos Asen was a certain Komnena, the wife of Balša II who had succeeded Alexander as ruler of Valona in early 1372.|$|E

5|$|On 31 January, {{an attempt}} was made to free Missouri with the {{assembled}} collection of tug boats and salvage ships. This attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, owing to an anchor from a previous wreck that had become embedded in Missouris hull. The extreme force generated by the tugs caused several two-inch cables made from wire rope to break, and the failed attempt also revealed that Missouri needed to lose more weight <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> attempt was to be successful. In light of this, some additional changes were made for the next attempt, which included cutting the anchors and chains off the battleship—after they had been re-added at Wallin's request—and the inclusion of additional pontoons to help lighten Missouri even more. A second attempt was tentatively scheduled for 1 February.|$|E

5|$|The ACC's {{representatives to}} these bowls were picked in a {{hierarchical}} system {{that allowed the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl to have the first selection after the Orange Bowl's automatic pick of {{the winner of the}} ACC Championship Game. Following the Chick-fil-A Bowl were the Gator Bowl, Champs Sports Bowl, Music City Bowl, Meineke Car Care Bowl, Emerald Bowl, and Humanitarian Bowl, in that order. The ACC's agreement with the bowls dictated that the bowls would select the highest-ranking ACC team left after the bowls with higher selections made their pick. Bowls would be allowed to skip the highest remaining team only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> team was within one conference win of the highest remaining team.

25|$|The same {{as regular}} {{quicksort}} except the pivot {{is replaced by}} a buffer. First, read the M/2 first and last elements into the buffer and sort them.

Recursively sort the smaller partition, and loop to sort the remaining partition. This is a kind of three-way quicksort in which the middle partition (buffer) represents a sorted subarray of elements that are approximately equal to the pivot.|$|E

500|$|The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989 with [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". The {{series was}} {{originally}} set to {{debut in the}} fall of 1989 with the episode [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", but the producers discovered that the animation was so appalling that 70 percent of the episode needed to be redone. At the time {{there were only a few}} choices for animation style; usually, they would follow the style of Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. They considered aborting the series <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> episode [...] "Bart the Genius" [...] turned out as bad, but it only suffered from easily fixable problems.

500|$|In {{the event}} that a {{contestant}} leaves and very little time remains (in the final part of an episode), a randomly selected audience member is given one chance to win $1,000 by answering the next question intended for the previous contestant (or $2,000 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> question was on a Double Money episode).

500|$|The {{producers}} considered aborting {{the series}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> episode, [...] "Bart the Genius", turned out as this episode, but fortunately {{it turned out}} to suffer only a few, easily fixable problems. Afterwards, the producers entreated Fox to postpone the series premiere for several months. The premiere then switched to [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which had to be aired in December, being a Christmas special. This ensured that more time could be spent fixing the animation problems and rewriting much of this episode. Directorial retakes were handled by David Silverman, who already had considerable experience directing the shorts. Silverman estimates that about 70% of everything had to be redone. Most of these retakes consisted of changing the backgrounds. The result is an episode where the animation is uneven, because it shifts between the early animation and the retakes. It is still possible to see the doors slam like they were made of rubber. The Fox censors wanted to replace the sentence [...] "the blue thing with the things", which they believed to be too sexual. Due to the fledgling position of the Fox network, Brooks had obtained an unusual contractual provision that ensured the network could not interfere with the creative process by providing show notes, so the producers simply ignored the censors.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{if there were}} laws dealing with epikleroi prior to Solon's {{legislative}} activity around 594 BCE. According to the 1st century CE writer Plutarch, Solon authored legislation covering the epikleros. Solon's laws attempted to prevent the combination of estates by the marriage of heiresses. Modern historians have seen this {{as part of an}} effort by Solon to maintain a stable number of households. According to Plutarch, Solon also legislated that the husband of an epikleros must have sexual intercourse with her at least three times a month in order to provide her with children to inherit her father's property, but by the time of Pericles (d. 429 BCE) this law is definitely attested. It is unclear whether or not the nearest relative had the power to dissolve an epikleros' [...] previous marriage in order to marry her himself in all cases. The historian Sarah Pomeroy states that most scholars lean towards the opinion that the nearest relative could only dissolve the previous marriage if the heiress had not yet given birth to a son, but Pomeroy also states that this opinion has not yet been definitely proven. Roger Just disagrees and has argued that even if the epikleros had a son she could still be forced to marry her nearest relative. Athenian law also required that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> of kin did not marry the heiress, he had to provide her with a dowry. It may have been Solon who legislated that if the new spouse was unable to fulfill his thrice monthly duties to his wife, she was entitled to have sex with his next of kin so that she could produce an heir to her father's property. Alternatively, she might have been required to divorce and marry the next nearest relative.|$|E
