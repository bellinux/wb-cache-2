40|$|The {{title of}} the dissertation: Law of Treaties - {{subsequent}} agreements and subsequent practice The topic of the dissertation is the codification {{of the rules of}} interpretation of international treaties, with special focus on the phenomenon of subsequent agreements and subsequent practice of the state parties. In its general introductory section, the thesis defines international treaties as a source of international law and presents a comprehensive analysis of methods of interpretation and their codification.

This thesis also focuses on the issue of evolutionary interpretation. The practical part of the thesis is based on the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treaties</b> in three branches of international law (investments, cultural cooperation, taxes), with emphasis on the use of subsequent agreements and subsequent practice and on the current developments in the negotiation of new treaties and in the activities of international organizations...|$|E

40|$|International law requires that {{everyone}} rescued at sea shall be disembarked and delivered to a ‘place of safety’. However, neither the treaties that establish this requirement {{nor any other}} treaty define {{what is meant by}} ‘place of safety’. When refugees and migrants are rescued at sea considerations of international human rights law and international refugee law as well as of international law against transnational organized crime are of principal concern. This article examines the concept of 'place of safety' and argues that it needs to be interpreted in the wider context of international law, so that other relevant and applicable rules of international law are taken into account. The article provides an exploratory discussion of the interpretation of the concept of 'place of safety', seen particularly against the background that many of those rescued at sea are refugees and migrants. The article also comprises discussions of the duty to rescue those in distress at sea, the basic rules on <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treaties</b> and the legal framework for rescue of migrants at sea. The analysis is illustrated by references to Australian legislation, state practice and case law...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Waitangi Tribunal’s {{application of the}} contra proferentem rule, a rule developed by United States courts for the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treaties</b> with Native Americans. The Waitangi Tribunal adopted the Unites States courts’ approach {{in one of its}} earliest reports when interpreting the Treaty of Waitangi and has held on to it ever since, even though it is less prominent in the later reports. As a survey of Tribunal reports reveals, the Tribunal has used the contra proferentem rule to different effects. A comparison of the circumstances surrounding the treaties with Native Americans in the United States and the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi however reveals crucial differences that make an interpretation of the Treaty contra proferentem inappropriate. Given that the Treaty is essentially the text in the Māori language, this paper argues, it should be interpreted as a Māori document, that is to say in the Māori oral and cultural context of the Treaty signings. This however is something that the Tribunal only very rarely attempts...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the analysis of Articles 31 and 32 of the 23 May 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law <b>of</b> <b>Treaties</b> (VCLT) in relation to means <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> According to the author, article 31 § 3 provides for two types of agreements, respectively under subparagraphs a) and b). This reflection concerns itself with the agreement resulting from subsequent practice {{within the meaning of}} Article 31 § 3, b). The distinction between what comes under Article 31 § 3, b) and that under Article 32 {{does not appear to have}} been well received by the International Law Commission (ILC) in its work on the subject titled “Agreements and Subsequent Practice in the Context <b>of</b> <b>Treaty</b> Interpretation”, set out in Conclusion 6 Paragraph 1. The criteria for identifying the existence of a subsequent practice so as to establish an agreement on the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>treaty</b> emerge from the case law. Evidence of acceptance of a subsequent practice also establishes an agreement on the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>treaty.</b> If there is strictness regarding State practice, there is more flexibility in the establishment of an agreement on the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>treaty</b> resulting from the subsequent practice of international organizations. According to his analysis, the author concludes that the loose <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> the concept of agreement adopted by the Special Rapporteur - and followed so far by the Commission - which considers that “agreement” in international law does not necessarily lead to a binding commitment, is not convincing...|$|R
40|$|In May 2012, the International Law Commission (ILC) {{appointed}} a special rapporteur, Georg Nolte, {{to complete a}} project on “subsequent agreements and subsequent practice {{in relation to the}} <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treaties.</b> ” Previously referred to by the name “treaties over time,” the project is expected to result by 2016 in a series of “observations” or “conclusions” about how the meaning of a treaty might be determined based, at least in part, on the conduct of the States Parties after the treaty is concluded. The project raises a large number of interesting issues, some of which concern terminology and line drawing, others that concern theory and history, and still others that concern when and how States and tribunals rely upon this phenomenon. This essay discusses the extent to which subsequent agreements and practice have actually been a relevant or important component of treaty law in the past and present, and what level of importance they might enjoy in the future. In other words, while there are certainly examples of the use of subsequent conduct in different fields of international law, how pervasive is this phenomenon, and is it increasing or decreasing in its relevance...|$|E
40|$|Non-refoulement is {{the central}} part of the {{protection}} of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. It is true that Article 1, a definition, is the passport to Convention refugee status and the expectation of naturalization. However, this affects only a fraction of the world's refugees. Non-refoulement, and the form of protection it brings, affects 10 - 15 million refugees. Although it is now recognized that non-refoulement has been reinforced by other human rights treaties, such as the Convention against Torture, (CAT), the full impact has not been grasped. Non-discrimination obligations from Article 26 of the 1966 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, (CCPR) can limit differentiations in the allocating of rights and benefits. A review of rights based refuge is timely because the content, what is enjoyed beyond the refuge itself, is highly variable and relates, in part, to ambiguities in key terms allocating rights in the Convention. However, the refugees involved may be persons protected from expulsion not only by the Convention, but also by the newer human rights treaties. So the content problems also relate to a lack of interpretation of human rights treaties as these apply to persons protected from expulsion. Throughout, this essay shows that authoritative <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treaties</b> is needed to make the promise of the rights based refuge a reality for refugees...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{seeks to}} {{ascertain}} the extent of international legal (primarily treaty) constraints on the military use of outer space. These {{are to be found}} for the most part in the multilateral 1963 Partial Test Ban and 1967 Outer Space Treaties and in the bilateral U. S. -Soviet 1972 ABM Treaty. The thesis assesses the compatibility of all feasible near- and mid-term military uses of outer space with these treaties. Alternative interpretations of various provisions are assessed. The thesis contains an especially long and detailed analysis of one particular interpretation dispute under the ABM Treaty [...] that which concerns the treaty's effect on the development and testing of mobile ABM systems and components based on exotic technologies such as laser and particle beams. Prior to, and in the course of, assessing the evidence bearing upon this issue, the thesis examines the international law that governs the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treaties</b> generally and the ABM Treaty in particular. The applicability of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and of the jurisprudence of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice to the interpretation of the ABM Treaty is considered. The thesis concludes by assessing the desirability and feasibility of several proposed improvements to the international legal regime governing the military use of outer space...|$|E

40|$|This article {{follows a}} {{contribution}} {{by the same}} author, published in the previous edition of the World Tax Journal. The conclusion of that article was that seeking to define an attribution rule of sufficient generality for use in treaties is not a fruitful path to take. This article picks up the challenge of ascertaining how {{this aspect of the}} route to treaty entitlement should be defined. It identifies a structural flaw in the present OECD Model, which lies at the root of many current problems with the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treaties</b> and which has sometimes led courts to take a very liberal view of treaty interpretation in order to reach the correct policy result. A new approach to treaty entitlement is proposed, starting from a conceptually sound base and setting out a logical route for establishing whether or not treaty benefits are available. The author tests the new approach by applying it to the fact patterns of various decided cases and to trusts, and demonstrates that the new approach produces appropriate policy results in the situations analysed. A rigorous application of the new approach leads to a radical restructuring of the OECD Model. The article pursues this restructuring exercise and, at the end, includes a draft text of a new model treaty incorporating the basic features of the new approach...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years, {{the world has}} {{experienced}} exponential growth in international trade and investment, {{as well as the}} number of bilateral tax treaties which now number roughly 3, 000. As the globalization of economic activity has greatly increased opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, so also has the expansion of the international tax treaty network increased opportunities for taxpayers to take advantage of domestic tax rules and bilateral tax treaties by arranging their affairs in ways that reduce taxes otherwise owing or eliminate them altogether. Regarding many of these arrangements as abusive treaty shopping, the OECD and several member jurisdictions have adopted various responses to this phenomenon, involving the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treaties</b> as the well as the introduction and application of anti-avoidance rules in domestic law and tax treaties. This paper reviews and evaluates these responses to treaty shopping, providing a comparative examination of developments in various jurisdictions. Part II discusses the concept of treaty shopping, defining this term {{for the purposes of this}} analysis, providing a few examples for illustrative purposes, and explaining why treaty shopping is problematic on policy grounds. Part III considers interpretive responses to abusive treaty shopping, examining recent cases and commentary on the concepts of “residence” and “beneficial ownership” as well as the existence of an anti-abuse principle inherent in tax treaties and international law. Part IV addresses specific and general anti-avoidance rules, both domestic rules and their relationship to tax treaties as well as anti-avoidance rules contained in tax treaties themselves. Based on this analysis, Part V provides general conclusions...|$|E
