5|$|Although beagle-type {{dogs have}} existed for 2,500 years, the modern breed was {{developed}} in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot <b>Hound,</b> the North Country Beagle, the Southern <b>Hound,</b> and possibly the Harrier.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century two breeds {{had been}} {{developed}} for hunting hare and rabbit: the Southern <b>Hound</b> and the North Country Beagle (or Northern <b>Hound).</b> The Southern <b>Hound,</b> a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the River Trent and probably {{closely related to the}} Talbot <b>Hound.</b> Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern <b>Hound,</b> less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed. As fox hunting became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of <b>hound</b> diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern Foxhound. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small rabbit-hunting packs.|$|E
5|$|In the 11th century, William the Conqueror {{brought the}} Talbot <b>hound</b> to Britain. The Talbot was a {{predominantly}} white, slow, deep-throated, scent <b>hound</b> {{derived from the}} St. Hubert <b>Hound</b> which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds {{to give them an}} extra turn of speed. Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably gave rise to the Southern <b>Hound</b> which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day beagle.|$|E

5|$|Culann {{the smith}} invites Conchobar to a feast at his house. Before going, Conchobar {{goes to the}} playing field to watch the boys play hurling. He is so {{impressed}} by Sétanta's performance that he asks him to join him at the feast. Sétanta has a game to finish, but promises to follow the king later. But Conchobar forgets, and Culann lets loose his ferocious <b>hound</b> to protect his house. When Sétanta arrives, the enormous <b>hound</b> attacks him, but he kills it in self-defence, in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, and in another by driving a sliotar (hurling ball) down its throat with his hurley. Culann is devastated {{by the loss of}} his <b>hound,</b> so Sétanta promises he will rear him a replacement, and until it is old enough to do the job, he himself will guard Culann's house. The druid Cathbad announces that his name henceforth will be Cú Chulainn—"Culann's Hound".|$|E
5|$|The Beagle is a {{breed of}} small <b>hound</b> {{that is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent <b>hound,</b> developed primarily for hunting hare. With {{a great sense of}} smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.|$|E

5|$|The Fox and the <b>Hound</b> is a 1967 novel {{written by}} American novelist Daniel P. Mannix and {{illustrated}} by John Schoenherr.

5|$|The scenes at Baskerville were filmed at {{a number}} of locations. The {{exterior}} was filmed at the gas works by Baverstocks near Llwydcoed in Mid Glamorgan.
