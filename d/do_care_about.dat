5|$|Sharon Hawkins (Michele Morgan) – Virgil's older sister, Sharon attends college, but {{she still}} lives at home. She volunteers at a hospital, and counsels young people at the Freeman Community Center. While they do argue frequently, Sharon and Virgil really <b>do</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> each other and are quick {{to come to the}} other's defense if one of them is in danger. After their mother died, Sharon took it upon herself to act as the woman of the house after, mostly when it comes to doling out chores between her and her brother and the cooking (which, at least {{according}} to Virgil, Sharon is not good at).|$|E
25|$|It is the {{reasoned}} {{conclusion of}} this study... that the sense of guilt created by the Vietnam war {{in the minds of}} many Americans is not warranted and that the charges of officially, condoned illegal and grossly immoral conduct are without substance. Indeed, detailed examination of battlefield practices reveals that the loss civilian life in Vietnam was less great than in World War II and Korea and that concern with minimizing the ravages of the war was strong. To measure and compare the devastation and loss of human life caused by different war will be objectionable to those who repudiate all resort to military force as an instrument of foreign policy and may be construed as callousness. Yet as long as wars do take place at all it remains a moral duty to seek to reduce the agony caused by war, and the fulfillment of this obligation should not be disdained. I hope that this book may help demonstrate that moral convictions are not the exclusive possession of persons in conscience opposed to war, and that those who in certain circumstances accept the necessity and ethical justification of armed conflict also <b>do</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> human suffering.|$|E
500|$|Roger Sutton from Horn Book Magazine {{felt that}} the moment Marcus {{explains}} this flaw to Miranda is the first exchange that shows the novel to be complicated and mysterious. Quattlebaum noted, [...] "The story's structure– an expert interweaving of past, present and future– brilliantly contradicts Miranda's commonsensical belief that the end can't happen before the middle." [...] Stead explained her view of time travel in her novel, where going back in time is fulfilling the future, rather than changing it. She hoped to make the time travel element logical to show that [...] "Miranda wasn't struggling to understand the seeming randomness and infinity of the universe, but learning that her world has value and that people <b>do</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> her".|$|E

500|$|William J. Bell {{had created}} the {{character}} of Phillip Chancellor III in 1976, and he remained {{a vital part of}} the soap opera's storylines until his death onscreen in 1989. In 2007, Latham rewrote Chancellor's birth by establishing that Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), Jill's enemy and Phillip Chancellor II's wife, switched their child with another hours after his birth; the character was brought back to the series as an adult named Cane Ashby, an Australian looking for his birth mother. During that time, Goddard did not want to know the real motives of his character because he did not want that to influence his performance. After the revelation that Jill was Cane's mother, his views changed, saying he [...] "now welcomed the information as it added more color to his portrayal". The initial lack of information made portraying Cane difficult since there was an amount of ambiguity over whether he was a good, bad, or mediocre character. The ambiguity deepened when Goddard read the script revealing that a DNA test performed for Jill and Cane came back negative. He stated that he had never asked Latham [...] "what was going on" [...] with the storyline, but told her that he could [...] "play anything he needed to". A second DNA test later confirmed Cane as Jill's son. Goddard also said it was [...] "too good to be true" [...] for Cane to be Jill's son, adding that, [...] "But, down the road you realize these people actually <b>do</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> you, that you can reciprocate that care. For Cane, he's had so much time without them it's pointless to have the time with them and not enjoying it." [...] Though the maternity question was answered, more ambiguity about Cane's intentions appeared as the character received a phone call from his uncle Langley that hinted about Cane scheming against Jill and Katherine. The original intent of the call was to show that Cane wanted what was owed to him after being given away as an infant. The writers changed directions after the popularity of the character grew. Goddard said he felt the phone call was resolved within the story when Cane sent money to his uncle as part of taking care of him.|$|E
2500|$|Catharine Bond Hill, {{president}} of Vassar College argued that, [...] "many {{of us in}} higher education dislike popular college rankings such as the annual academic beauty pageant from US News & World Report. But expecting them to go away is naive, and attempting to undermine them is unwise since students and families could perceive that as petulant and paternalistic. Worse, it could seem as if {{we have something to}} hide." [...] Rather than not sending in the reputation survey, she argued, it would be of value to focus on, [...] "a third-party non-profit or foundation", sending them [...] "the same data that we already submit to US News and other rating organizations." [...] On this point, she argues, [...] "a one-size ranking does not fit all, because students and families care about different things [...] What if a school doesn't use the SAT in making admissions decisions and therefore doesn't collect or report these data? In a new system, that school couldn't be ranked if a student chose a positive weight for the SATs. Students would know that the school doesn't value that piece of information. They could then run the rankings with other information (maybe class rank and other indicators of academic achievement), excluding the SAT, and see what those rankings look like. Alternatively, they could decide they actually <b>do</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the average SATs of the student body and decide to look at other schools. Fair enough." ...|$|E

5000|$|For {{the members}} of the officialdom, it was their rank, or status, which was of prime importance. The 'superior' man (literati) should stay away from the pursuit of wealth (though not from the wealth itself). Therefore, {{becoming}} a civil servant was preferred to becoming a businessman and granted a much higher status class. Literati <b>did</b> not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the wealth, although they could and <b>did</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> their status. As Weber wrote: ...|$|R

'We must do {{something}} that'll take Mr. Le Breton out of himself {{for a short time}} entirely--that'll give him occupation of a kind he thinks right, {{and at the same time}} put money in his pocket. Now, he's always talking about this socialistic business of his; but why doesn't he tell us what he has actually seen about the life and habits of the really poor? Mrs. Le Breton tells me he knows the East End well: why doesn't he sit down and give us a good rattling, rousing, frightening description of all that's in it? Of course, I don't care twopence about the poor myself--not in the lump, I mean--I beg your pardon, Mr. Berkeley,'--for the Progenitor gave a start of surprise and astonishment--'you know we women are nothing if not concrete; we never care for anything in the abstract, Mr. Le Breton used to tell me; we want the particular case brought home to our sympathies before we can interest ourselves about it. After all, even YOU who are men don't feel very much for all the miserable wretched people there are in China, you know; they're too far away for even you to bother your heads about. But I <b>DO</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the Le Bretons, and it strikes me we might help them a little in this way. I know a lot of artists, Mr. Berkeley; and I know one who I think would just do for the very work I want to set him.
