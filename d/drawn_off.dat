5|$|Stone wool or {{rock wool}} is a spun mineral fibre {{used as an}} {{insulation}} product and in hydroponics. It is manufactured in a blast furnace fed with diabase rock which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> and spun to form the rock wool product. Very small amounts of metals are also produced which are an unwanted by-product and run to waste.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolytic}} finishing {{plant was}} established at Morgantown because that plant {{was under the}} control of DuPont's Ammonia Division. At this plant the output from the distillation plants, which was about 90% heavy water, was broken down by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen tends to be <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> first, leaving the heavy water behind. This process was repeated through several stages to yield a finished product that was 99.75% heavy water.|$|E

5|$|In {{the seven}} weeks that {{followed}} the occupation of Arlington {{and the beginning of}} work on Fort Corcoran, Barnard and his engineers were forced to focus virtually all of their effort on Corcoran and Runyon, owing to the limited resources available. By the time Barnard was beginning to focus his efforts on tying Corcoran and Runyon into an entire belt of fortifications, his engineers were <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> by the approach of the Confederate Army and the incipient First Battle of Bull Run.|$|E

5|$|This {{time the}} mere {{presence}} of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided {{that he would have to}} break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 508510 Although he did attack the city, he seems to have <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E

25|$|At each {{stroke the}} warm {{condensate}} was <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> from the condenser {{and sent to}} a hot well by a vacuum pump, which also helped to evacuate the steam from under the power cylinder. The still-warm condensate was recycled as feedwater for the boiler.|$|E
25|$|Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth a {{textiles}} magnate, patented {{the modern}} form of fixed-spool spinning reel in 1905. When casting Illingworth's reel design, {{the line was}} <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> {{the leading edge of}} the spool, but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.|$|E
25|$|When flow {{starts from}} the {{uppermost}} outlet, cold water enters the tank at the bottom. This drop in temperature causes the thermostat {{to switch on}} the electric heating element {{at the bottom of}} the tank. When the water at the top of the tank is <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> the hot water at the top is displaced by relatively cooler water, the top thermostat turns the top element on. When the flow stops, the elements stay on until their settings are met.|$|E

25|$|The {{personnel}} {{problem was}} even worse. North Carolina had raised and equipped 22 infantry regiments {{to serve in}} the war, but 16 of these had been <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> for the campaigns in Virginia. The six regiments remaining were responsible for the defense of the entire North Carolina coastline. Only a fraction of one regiment, the 7th North Carolina Volunteers, occupied the two forts at Hatteras Inlet. The other forts were likewise only weakly held. Fewer than a thousand men garrisoned Forts Ocracoke, Hatteras, Clark, and Oregon. Reinforcements, if needed, would have to come {{from as far away as}} Beaufort.|$|E
25|$|Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip {{were under}} the local command of Brigadier General Johnson K. Duncan. The average quality of the {{soldiers}} in the garrison was probably {{not as high as}} Lovell and Duncan would have liked; the most militant had been <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> for other fields, leaving the irresolute and the unfit. Because New Orleans was something of an international city, the ranks contained a greater proportion of foreign-born soldiers than most units of the Confederate Army. Nevertheless, they could be expected to perform their duty, even if they would not make extraordinary exertions.|$|E
25|$|In the {{preparation}} of alum from clays or from bauxite, the material is gently calcined, then mixed with sulfuric acid and heated gradually to boiling; it is allowed to stand for some time, the clear solution <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> and mixed with acid potassium sulfate and allowed to crystallize. When cryolite is used for {{the preparation}} of alum, it is mixed with calcium carbonate and heated. By this means, sodium aluminate is formed; it is then extracted with water and precipitated either by sodium bicarbonate or by passing a current of carbon dioxide through the solution. The precipitate is then dissolved in sulfuric acid, the requisite amount of potassium sulfate added and the solution allowed to crystallize.|$|E

25|$|Hatfield {{would be}} re-elected to five more terms, most comfortably, before {{retiring}} from the Senate in 1996. Duncan sought revenge against Morse in the Democratic primary of the 1968 Senate election, but came in second in a close three-way primary {{that he might have}} won had not a third candidate <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> some anti-Morse votes. After Morse's loss to Bob Packwood in the 1968 general election, Duncan and Morse again squared off for the Democratic nomination in the 1972 Senate election to face Hatfield. Morse won again, and lost to Hatfield in the general election. In 1974, Duncan was re-elected to the House of Representatives. He served three terms before being defeated in the Democratic primary by Ron Wyden in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 9 August 1945, through terrain {{believed}} by the Japanese to be impassable by armoured formations, the Soviet Union invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria. Red Army combined-arms forces achieved complete surprise {{and used a}} powerful, deep-penetrating attack in a classic double encirclement pattern, spearheaded by the T-34-85. The opposing Japanese forces had been reduced as elite units had been <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> to other fronts and the remaining forces {{were in the middle}} of a redeployment. The Japanese tanks remaining to face them were all held in the rear and not used in combat; the Japanese had weak support from IJAAF forces, engineering, and communications. Japanese forces were overwhelmed, though some put up resistance. The Japanese emperor transmitted a surrender order on 14 August, but the Kwangtung Army was not given a formal cease fire until 17 August.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} obtain alum from alunite, it is {{calcined}} and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water, the liquor decanted, and the alum allowed to crystallize. The alum schists employed {{in the manufacture of}} alum are mixtures of iron pyrite, aluminium silicate and various bituminous substances, and are found in upper Bavaria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Scotland. These are either roasted or exposed to the weathering action of the air. In the roasting process, sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form aluminium sulfate, a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering. The mass is now systematically extracted with water, and a solution of aluminium sulfate of specific gravity 1.16 is prepared. This solution is allowed to stand for some time (in order that any calcium sulfate and basic ferric sulfate may separate), and is then evaporated until ferrous sulfate crystallizes on cooling; it is then <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> and evaporated until it attains a specific gravity of 1.40. It is now allowed to stand for some time, decanted from any sediment, and finally mixed with the calculated quantity of potassium sulfate, well agitated, and the alum is thrown down as a finely divided precipitate of alum meal. If much iron should be present in the shale then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate.|$|E
500|$|In July and August 1943, the Ames Project {{attempted}} to create thorium metal using {{something similar to}} the Ames Process. This was unsuccessful, because thorium has a much higher melting point than uranium. Efforts continued into 1944, and {{it was found that}} with a zinc chloride booster they could produce a zinc-thorium alloy. Heating to [...] in a graphite crucible could then melt the zinc, which could be <b>drawn</b> <b>off.</b> This left the thorium, which was cast into [...] ingots in beryllia crucibles. Some [...] was produced by 31 December 1945. Thorium sold for $3 a gram before the war; by its end, the Ames Project was producing it for less than 5¢ a gram.|$|E
500|$|Uranium ore {{was crushed}} and {{dissolved}} in acids. Impurities were separated and uranium oxide was precipitated. Radium {{was returned to}} Union Minière under the contract with the company. [...] The uranium oxide was then purified. It was dissolved in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. This was then dissolved [...] in ether, <b>drawn</b> <b>off</b> and precipitated {{by the addition of}} ammonia, producing ammonium diuranate. The ammonium diuranate was heated in a furnace and reduced with hydrogen and hydrofluoric acid to produce uranium tetrafluoride. Heating and mixing with calcium metal reduced it to metallic uranium, leaving calcium fluoride behind as a slag. The metallic uranium was then cast into billets. These were extruded into rods and sealed in aluminium cans.|$|E
