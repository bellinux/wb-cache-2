40|$|The {{design and}} {{evaluation}} of environmental policy requires the incorporation of time and risk elements as many environmental outcomes extend over long time periods and involve a large degree of uncertainty. Understanding how individuals discount and evaluate risks with respect to environmental outcomes is a prime component in designing effective environmental policy to address issues of environmental sustainability, such as climate change. Our objective {{in this study is}} to investigate whether subjects' time preferences and risk aversion across the monetary <b>domain</b> and the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> differ. Crucially, our experimental design is incentivized: in the monetary domain, time preferences and risk aversion are elicited with real monetary payoffs, whereas in the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain,</b> we elicit time preferences and risk aversion using real (bee-friendly) plants. We find that subjects' time preferences are not significantly different across the monetary and <b>environmental</b> <b>domains.</b> In contrast, subjects' risk aversion is significantly different across the two domains. More specifically, subjects (men and women) exhibit a higher degree of risk aversion in the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> relative to the monetary domain. Finally, we corroborate earlier results, which document that women are more risk averse than men in the monetary domain. We show this finding to, also, hold in the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the manual {{creation}} of context-‐dependent natural-‐language definitions in EcoLexicon, a terminological knowledge base on the Environment. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain,</b> many concepts in EcoLexicon show {{a high degree of}} multidimensionality. In other words, this means that concepts can be described from many different perspectives. For such concepts, a single definition that encompasses the whole <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> is not informative enough because not all <b>environmental</b> <b>domains</b> describe concepts in the same fashion. For that reason, we propose the creation of flexible definitions. A flexible definition is a system of definitions for the same concept composed of a general environmental definition with a set of recontextualized definitions (definitions that describe a concept from the viewpoint of a certain subject domain). This approach is based on category definitional templates and conceptual frames that provide a consistent way of managing and representing the dimensions of contextually-‐variable concepts in terminological definitions. ...|$|R

30|$|In our findings, {{the highest}} scores were {{recorded}} in the spiritual domain and the lowest scores {{were found in the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>domain.</b> In Burkina Faso, 99.6 % of the population practice a religion (INSD 2008). As religions recommend the seek of heaven's wellbeing, instead of earthy happiness, religion practices of our subjects and the distress situation in which they are living due to the disease could explain the high scores recorded in the spiritual domain. This demonstrates how people in distress refer to religion to better accept their situation. In a study conducted in Ethiopia (Deribew et al. 2013), better scores {{were recorded in}} spiritual domain and the worst in environmental scores, results consistent with ours. The lower scores in <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> could be explained by the economical situation of our respondents dominated by small traders, employees of informal sector and housewives.

Materials and Methods: During the crosssectional epidemiological study conducted among the economically active population aged 45 – 60, we used a short version of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. Respondents were recruited randomly from selected factories located in the Silesian Agglomeration. The statistical analysis used descriptive and analytical methods available in the Statistica 9. 0 software. Results: The results confi rmed the statistically signifi cant association between marital status, type of occupational activity, declared health status, and the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> of quality of life in economically active inhabitants of the Silesian Agglomeration. The best qualities of life in the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> were those of married people, white collars, and persons who declared their health status to be the best.

40|$|Abstract: In {{environmental}} engineering, sensor measurement is {{a process}} undertaken with respect to an <b>environmental</b> <b>domain,</b> i. e. an area of interest, to measure a domain property. Knowledge of a domain, meaning its concepts and relations that hold among them, can be formally represented by means of ontology. Therefore, given an ontology for an <b>environmental</b> <b>domain,</b> {{it seems reasonable to}} suggest that sensor data acquisition can be translated into ontological knowledge acquisition. We demonstrate this translation for the domain of road vehicle classification by measurement of vibration. We show how supervised machine learning is applied to learn a function that maps sensor data to ontological concepts. Hence, we abstract from both the physical sensor layer and the sensor data layer by discarding raw measurement data and retaining the knowledge conveyed by these data.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the long-term effects}} of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on quality of life (QOL) in therapy-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. DESIGN: 16 patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4 th ed) (DSM-IV) criteria for OCD and were considered therapy-refractory were treated with DBS. Patients were assessed 1 month before device implantation (T 0), at 8 months of active stimulation (T 1) and at 3 - 5 years of active stimulation (T 2). QOL was measured with the WHO Quality of Life Scale-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) that covers physical, psychological, social and <b>environmental</b> <b>domains.</b> The study was conducted between April 2005 and January 2011 at the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. RESULTS: At T 1 and T 2, we found significant improvement (p< 0. 05) in the general score and in the physical, psychological and <b>environmental</b> <b>domains</b> of WHOQOL-BREF. Between T 1 and T 2, the physical and psychological domains improved further (p< 0. 05). At T 2, the general score improved by a total of 90 %, the physical and psychological domains both improved by 39. 5 % and the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> improved by 16 %. The social domain did not change between baseline and follow-up assessments. CONCLUSIONS: In line with symptom improvement, patient's QOL improved in the general score and in three of the four WHOQOL-BREF domains.

40|$|Purpose Assessing the {{validity}} of the Comprehensive Frailty Assessment Instrument (CFAI) in comparison with the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI). Background When ageing, most individuals prefer to age in place even if they are frail. Detecting frail older persons in the community becomes a challenge for professionals and policymakers. Most international frailty instruments emphasize physical factors. The CFAI was developed from a multidimensional perspective, measuring a physical, a psychological, a social and an <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> and showed good validity and reliability. The novelty of the CFAI is the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain,</b> which is important because older people will highly depend on their environment when ageing in place. In this study, the CFAI is validated against the TFI. Design Scale validation study. Methods One hundred and seventy-eight respondents aged 60 and over participated in this study. Internal consistency and explained variance of the CFAI and the subscales was assessed. Next, the correlation between the two scales was evaluated. Convergent and divergent validity between the subscales of the CFAI and TFI was assessed. Results The internal consistency of the CFAI was 0. 759. The correlation between the CFAI and TFI was 0. 590. Correlations between the physical, psychological and social domains of both scales was good and the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> showed weak correlations with all other domains, pointing to convergent and divergent validity. Conclusion The CFAI is found to be valid in comparison with the TFI and can be used by health care professionals for the detection of frail older people living in the community.

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} goal and mindset specificity on goal-related behavior in the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain.</b> Two Studies demonstrated that goal-related behavior was maximized when participants focused on an abstract goal in combination with a specific mindset, or when they focused on a specific goal in combination with an abstract mindset. When goals and mindset instead matched in terms of abstractness, goal-related behavior was reduced. Study 2 demonstrated {{that the effect of}} goal specificity on behavior was mediated by different processes in each of the mindset conditions. When mindsets were abstract, self-efficacy mediated the positive effect of specific goals on behavior; when mindsets were specific, the value of collective environmental action mediated the positive effect of abstract goals on behavior. The results are discussed in the framework of a complementarity approach. It is argued that complementarity, of levels of specificity of goals and mindsets may affect behavior particularly strongly in domains where the discrepancy between the abstract and the specific is large (e. g. the <b>environmental</b> <b>domain).</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|BACKGROUND Environmental {{exposures}} {{often occur}} in tandem; however, epidemiological research often focuses on singular exposures. Statistical interactions among broad, well-characterized <b>environmental</b> <b>domains</b> {{have not yet}} been evaluated in association with health. We address this gap by conducting a county-level cross-sectional analysis of interactions between Environmental Quality Index (EQI) domain indices on preterm birth in the Unites States from 2000 - 2005. METHODS: The EQI, a county-level index constructed for the 2000 - 2005 time period, was constructed from five domain-specific indices (air, water, land, built and sociodemographic) using principal component analyses. County-level preterm birth rates (n= 3141) were estimated using live births from the National Center for Health Statistics. Linear regression was used to estimate prevalence differences (PD) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) comparing worse environmental quality to the better quality for each model for a) each individual domain main effect b) the interaction contrast and c) the two main effects plus interaction effect (i. e., the net effect) to show departure from additivity for the all U. S counties. Analyses were also performed for subgroupings by four urban/rural strata. RESULTS: We found the suggestion of antagonistic interactions but no synergism, along with several purely additive (i. e., no interaction) associations. In the non-stratified model, we observed antagonistic interactions, between the sociodemographic/air domains (net effect (i. e. the association including main effects and interaction effects) PD: - 0. 004 (95 % CI:- 0. 007, 0. 000), interaction contrast: - 0. 013 (95 % CI:- 0. 020, - 0. 007)) and built/air domains (net effect PD: 0. 008 (95 % CI 0. 004, 0. 011), interaction contrast: - 0. 008 (95 % CI:- 0. 015, - 0. 002)). Most interactions were between the air domain and other respective domains. Interactions differed by urbanicity, with more interactions observed in non-metropolitan regions. CONCLUSIONS: Observed antagonist associations may indicate that those living in areas with multiple detrimental domains may have other interfering factors reducing the burden of environmental exposure. This study is the first to explore interactions across different <b>environmental</b> <b>domains</b> and demonstrates the utility of the EQI {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> interactions and human health.

Using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire for Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), this study evaluated the Quality of Life (QOL) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Zhejiang province, China, and assessed the influences of demographic, laboratory and disease-related variables on QOL. This cross-sectional study was conducted among PLWHA aged ≥ 18 years in Taizhou municipality, Zhejiang province, China, between August 1 and October 31, 2014. A multiple linear regression model was {{used to analyze the}} influential factors. Of 403 subjects, 72. 48 % were male, 72. 46 % had received a high- school or above education, 94. 79 % were of Han ethnicity, and 65. 51 % were non farmers. The total score of QOL was 15. 99 ± 1. 99. The scores of QOL in physiological, psychological, social relation, and <b>environmental</b> <b>domains</b> were 14. 99 ± 2. 25, 14. 25 ± 2. 12, 13. 22 ± 2. 37, and 13. 31 ± 1. 99 respectively. Except the total score of QOL and the score of <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> (p< 0. 05), the scores in other domains had no significant difference with the results of the national norm level. The multiple linear regression model identified the physical domain related factors to be age (β = - 0. 045), CD 4 count (β = 0. 002), and ART adherence(β = 1. 231). And it also showed that psychological domain related factors included CD 4 count (β = 0. 002) and WHO clinical stage (β = - 0. 437); social domain related factors included WHO clinical stage (β = - 0. 704) and ART adherence (β = 1. 177); while <b>environmental</b> <b>domain</b> related factors included WHO clinical stage (β = - 0. 538), educational status(β = 0. 549) and ART adherence(β = 1. 078). Those who are young, with higher level of education, higher CD 4 count and good access and adherence of ART, are likely to have better QOL among PLWHA in Zhejiang province.
