40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyze the inconsistency in responses to survey questions within the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) regarding insurance coverage of dental services. Self-reports of dental coverage in the dental services section were compared with those in the insurance section of the 2002 HRS to identify inconsistent responses. Logistic regression identified characteristics of persons reporting discrepancies and assessed the effect of measurement error on dental coverage coefficient estimates in dental utilization models. In 18 % of cases, data reported in the insurance section contradicted data reported in the <b>dental</b> <b>use</b> section of the HRS by those who said insurance at least partially covered (or would have covered) their (hypothetical) <b>dental</b> <b>use.</b> Additional findings included distinct characteristics of persons with potential reporting errors and a downward bias to the regression coefficient for coverage in a <b>dental</b> <b>use</b> model without controls for inconsistent self-reports of coverage. This study offers evidence for the need to validate self-reports of dental insurance coverage among a survey population of older Americans to obtain more accurate estimates of coverage and its impact on dental utilization...|$|E

The sharp composition of metallic wires and soldering materials was assessed by Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). The results of our experiment showed that the new model revealed inhibition of keratinocyte growth and stratification near soldering material, whereas mucosal cells were able to grow and layer out on dental wire. It is concluded that this experimental model, which simulates the oral environment, is useful for studying the effects of materials for <b>dental</b> <b>use</b> for its sensibility and reproducibility.

Although {{socioeconomic}} {{barriers to}} receiving adequate dental care {{have been well}} documented, phys-ical frailty as {{a risk factor for}} not visiting the dentist has not been fully explored. This study prospectively examines the relationship between functional health and <b>dental</b> service <b>use,</b> taking into account sociodemographic characteris-tics, general and dental health status, and prior dental utilization behavior. Methods. Data from a randomized trial of a comprehensive geriatric assessment and prevention program in commu-nity-dwelling adults age 75 + years living in Santa Monica, CA, collected between 1988 and 1993, were analyzed. A series of discrete-time proportional hazards models were used to assess the effects of functional status, sociodemo-graphic characteristics, and general health and dental health measures on <b>dental</b> service <b>use.</b> Results. Functional status was negatively associated with <b>dental</b> service <b>use,</b> and the conditional probability of a first visit to the dentist after baseline decreased over time. When additional measures of general health, dental health, and socioeconomic status were introduced, the effect of functional status was mitigated but remained significant. In the most fully specified model, which took dental visitation behavior prior {{to the beginning of the}} study into account, the effect of functional limitation remained significant. Conclusions. Even in this relatively well-educated group of older persons with higher than average <b>dental</b> service <b>use,</b> impaired functional status was associated with lower levels of <b>dental</b> service <b>use</b> over time...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of treatment for}} dental disease has been keyed to develop-ments in technology. Once the diseased tooth structure was removed, various materials were then utilized to restore health and function to the tooth. A ma-jor consideration must be the biocompatibility of the restorative materi-als&mdash;both to the vital process of the tooth, {{as well as the}} oral cavity. It has been generally accepted that calcium hydroxide containing products are the materi-als of choice to be placed in direct contact with the pulp, prior to placement of these restorative materials. As the demands on restorative materials became more defined, the requirements of the base materials also became greater. Due to the numerous desirable features of polymeric resins, the search for a bio-compatible resin base system incorporating calcium hydroxide was initiated.

We examined the prevalence of their <b>dental</b> care <b>use</b> and needs, compared the prevalence of use {{with that of the}} general population, and examined which factors predict patients' <b>dental</b> care <b>use.</b> Patients with primary breast cancer completed a questionnaire at 6 and 15 months post-diagnosis. Medical data were retrieved from medical records. The prevalence of <b>dental</b> care <b>use</b> and needs was examined with descriptive analyses. Associations between predictors and <b>dental</b> care <b>use</b> were examined with multivariate analyses. Twenty-one percent of 746 participants visited their dentist at least once in the past three months at 6 months, and 23 % at 15 months post-diagnosis. The estimated percentage of women with at least one contact with their dentist in 12 months was low compared to the general female population (31. 9 % versus 79. 5 %). One to two percent of the respondents wanted more contact. Having dental care insurance (odds ratio 1. 80; 95 % CI, 1. 08 - 3. 00), chemotherapy (odds ratio 1. 93; 95 % CI, 1. 21 - 3. 06), and clinical distress 6 months post-diagnosis (odds ratio 2. 53; 95 % CI, 1. 70 - 3. 79) predicted <b>use</b> of <b>dental</b> care 9 months later.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore how the level of frailty and various frailty factors affect the <b>dental</b> service <b>use</b> and oral {{self-care}} behaviour of frail elderly people, 51 frail elderly people were interviewed. Additional information on age, gender, living situation, prosthetic status, self-reported health and oral health, chronic diseases and an index for frailty was collected. A thematic qualitative analysis of the collected data reveals that frail elders maintain long-established oral hygiene routines {{as long as possible}} to sustain a sense of self-worth. When burdened by severe health complaints they discontinue visits to the dentist first and oral hygiene routines subsequently. A loss of confidence in the results of <b>dental</b> service <b>use,</b> the trivializing of complaints and a diminishing sense of the importance of oral health play a role in these developments.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} family socioeconomic trajectories from childhood to adolescence on dental caries and associated behaviours. DESIGN: Population-based birth cohort. SETTING: Representative sample {{of the population of}} subjects born in 1982 in Pelotas, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents (n =  888) aged 15 years old were dentally examined and interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dental caries index (DMFT), care index (F/DMFT), tooth brushing, flossing and pattern of <b>dental</b> services <b>use.</b> MAIN RESULTS: Adolescents who were always poor showed, in general, a worse pattern of dental caries, whereas adolescents who never were poor had a better pattern of dental caries. Adolescents who had moved from poverty in childhood to non-poverty in adolescence and those who had moved from non-poverty in childhood to poverty in adolescence had similar dental pattern to those who were always poor except for the pattern of <b>dental</b> services <b>use,</b> which was higher in the first group. In all groups girls had fewer carious teeth, better oral hygiene habits and higher <b>dental</b> services <b>use</b> than boys.
