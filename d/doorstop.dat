5|$|Despite {{knowing that}} she is innocent, Chrissie allows Zoe {{to believe that she}} has killed Den. Consequently, a power {{struggle}} breaks out between Sam – who wants her pub back in return for her silence – and Chrissie, with each woman trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his clothes into the street and engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time, and begins a relationship with Jake Moon (Joel Beckett); however, Sam has taken the <b>doorstop</b> and hidden it in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) what has happened before she goes.|$|E

25|$|Chrissie persuades Zoe {{to abort}} {{the baby and}} tells her they should team up for revenge on Den. They get {{together}} with Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) to do this, meeting up in The Queen Victoria. Chrissie sends for Sharon claiming Den is on his deathbed. She finds out that it isn't true and leaves again. Chrissie planned this {{to get rid of}} Sharon so Den would pay attention to her and love her instead. Right after Sharon leaves, Den realizes Chrissie did this and attacks her smashing her head against the jukebox. Zoe stops him by attacking him with a metal <b>doorstop,</b> supposedly killing him. She runs off and Sam goes after her to calm her down. However, he is not dead, and he grabs Chrissie. She hits him again with the <b>doorstop,</b> killing him. Zoe is led to believe that she killed Den, though Sam sees Chrissie kill Den and eventually tells Zoe, who punches Chrissie. Zoe leaves for Ibiza after having an emotional goodbye from Kat while Chrissie is charged with Den's murder, and Sam goes on the run after.|$|E

5000|$|The bricks {{from the}} {{demolition}} were turned into <b>doorstops</b> by 'Mrs. H. C. Colville, Burke rd, Hawthorn and {{sold at the}} 'Red Cross Variety Shop at 82 Collins st, Melbourne'. In making the <b>doorstops</b> 'Mrs Colville covers the sides and back with green felt, and on the front is a small copper plate bearing the inscription [...] "Brick from residence of Victoria's first Governor, 1939."' The <b>doorstops</b> sold for 3 shillings but for an extra shilling the buyer could 'have the brick covered with felt to match the room {{where it will be}} used'. The Red Cross had other bricks from the cottage for sale which 'would be most suitable for use as garden paving squares or surrounds' and, for 10 shillings and sixpence, landscape gardener Edna Walling would 'plan designs and supervise construction'. Also available for sale were 'other interesting relics from the cottage' including '5 windows with wood and metal frames', 3 doors, '10 panel wall sections' and 'one pair of cedar shutters'.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Doorstops</b> {{are simple}} devices {{used to prevent}} a door from coming into contact with another object (typically a wall).

25|$|In 1799, {{in nearby}} Cabarrus County, 12-year-old Conrad Reed found a 17-pound rock, which his family {{used as a}} <b>doorstop.</b> Three years later, a jeweler {{determined}} it was nearly solid gold, paying the family a paltry $3.50. The first documented gold find in the United States of any consequence set off the nation's first gold rush. Many veins of gold {{were found in the}} area throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the 1837 founding of the Charlotte Mint. North Carolina was the chief producer of gold in the United States until the Sierra Nevada find in 1848, although the volume mined in the Charlotte area was dwarfed by subsequent rushes.|$|E
25|$|Sam teams up with Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) and Den's wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman) to get {{revenge on}} Den, each humiliated by Den in differing ways. However, the women's {{confrontation}} leads to violence: Den attacks Chrissie and Zoe hits {{him over the}} head with an iron <b>doorstop</b> in defence. This is thought to have killed him; however, when Zoe and Sam leave the room, Den grabs Chrissie's ankle. She responds by hitting him on the head a second time, killing him. Unbeknown to Chrissie, Sam witnesses this, but Chrissie allows Zoe to believe that her blow killed Den. As Chrissie has possession of The Vic following Den's death, Sam blackmails her, threatening to unveil her as Den's killer unless she gives her the pub. When Sam realises that Chrissie is attempting to sell the pub and leave Walford, she begins drinking heavily; she smashes up Den's grave and digs him up, hoping Chrissie will be arrested. The plan backfires; all evidence points to Sam, who is charged with murder and remanded in custody. Phil and Grant return to Walford to secure her release by proving Chrissie killed Den. Chrissie is arrested on a murder charge, while Sam is released from custody; however, she still faces a charge of perverting the course of justice and faces a prison sentence up to four years. This prospect is too daunting for Sam, and she flees to Brazil while on bail in 2005.|$|E
500|$|In January, Dennis catches Den and {{his girlfriend}} Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) in bed {{together}} and tells Chrissie who is stunned. Zoe discovers she is pregnant by Den. Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, and later reveals that she knows it was Den's baby. Chrissie, Zoe and Sam Hunter (Kim Medcalf) plan revenge on Den; Chrissie for his lies and adultery, Zoe for forcing her to fake a pregnancy and then sleep with him, and Sam for losing her pub to Den in a corrupt scheme that both he and Chrissie were involved in. Chrissie plans to intimidate Den into signing the pub over to her. They confront Den but he takes it in his stride and openly talks about his sins, unaware that Sharon is hiding {{at the other side}} of the pub, listening to her father's confessions. Sharon berates Chrissie for tricking her into coming back to Walford with the lie that her father is ill. She storms out of the pub and Den follows. Chrissie knows that Sharon is the one person Den truly loves and cares about and knows that losing Den the love of his favourite child will destroy him. Den walks back in and she taunts him that he now knows what it is like to lose what he loves most. Unable to contain his rage, Den attacks his wife and hits her head against a fruit machine. Zoe picks up the nearest object (a metal, dog-shaped <b>doorstop)</b> and hits Den over the head with it and he falls to the ground. Perceiving him to be dead, Zoe and Sam go out the back to turn all the lights off and lock all the doors. A smug Chrissie starts to gloat that Den is dead, as if to say she has won. Den suddenly grabs her leg and hisses, [...] "You'll never get me out of the Vic." [...] so Chrissie picks up the <b>doorstop</b> and delivers a fatal blow to his head, secretly watched by Sam. The three women bury him in a hole in the pub's cellar, which is filled with cement the next morning.|$|E

5000|$|Antique {{folk art}} is {{distinguished}} from traditional art in that, while collected today based mostly on its artistic merit, {{it was never}} intended to be 'art for art’s sake' {{at the time of}} its creation.

500|$|The character's {{narrative}} {{also included}} various feuds, most notably with the soap's lothario Den Watts, a family-friend who gets Pauline's daughter Michelle pregnant {{at the age}} of 16. EastEnders pulled in the biggest television audience of the 1980s when over 30million people watched the 1986 Christmas Day episode in which Pauline discovers that Den is the father of her granddaughter, Vicki. Wendy Richard has commented on the hostility between the characters [...] "once Pauline realised that Dennis was Vicki's father, she was out to get him one way or another" [...] and actor Leslie Grantham, who played Den, added [...] "from then on it was out and out war, which was great!" [...] An array of confrontations between Den and Pauline occur, as she tries to force him to leave Walford and keep him away from her family. The feud appears to end in 1989 when the character Den is shot and presumed dead, but it is ignited once again in 2003 when Den is re-introduced, 14 years after he supposedly died. 2005 saw Den killed off for the final time, and although Pauline is not directly responsible for killing him, the item used to bludgeon him to death turns out to be her dog-shaped iron <b>doorstop,</b> which has been described as [...] "a nice touch of pathos".|$|E
500|$|A notable {{feature of}} the Final Destination films is the {{threshold}} or tipping-point logic of characters' deaths. Conrich frames the complex death sequences in Final Destination films as [...] "death games, contraptions or puzzles {{in which there are}} only losers", which he compares to Rube Goldberg machines, the Grand Guignol, and Mouse Trap. Brinkema picks out the deaths of Ashley and Ashlyn from Final Destination 3 as epitomizing the death sequences in the Final Destination series. The characters' deaths are brought about by [...] "a series of neutral gestures, a set of constraints that will ultimately lead to their conflagratory ends"; these include the placing of a drink, a rifling-through of CDs, and an ill-chosen <b>doorstop.</b> The scene utilizes logics of temperature, color, and light to realize the deaths of the characters, as well as to allow Wendy to recognize the threat that they face. The [...] "literal tipping point", at which the characters can no longer escape, occurs when a coat rack is knocked onto the sunbeds; it is blown by an air-conditioning unit, which was turned on by the rising heat. Conrich identifies the roller-coaster derailment as paradigmatic of the franchise's focus on mobility in death sequences. He argues that theme-park rides and horror cinema are mutually influential; the former draw from the frightening aspects of the latter, while the latter draw from the [...] "theatrics and kinetics" [...] of the former.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of this, Dennis leaves in search of Sharon but not before telling Chrissie about Zoe and Den's affair. When Zoe discovers she is {{pregnant}} with Den's child, Chrissie persuades her to abort and concocts a plan of revenge on Den to ruin him {{in the eyes of}} Sharon and gain ownership of the Vic. She recruits Zoe and Sam (both scorned by Den) and they confront him, setting it up for Sharon to discover Den's deeds. Sharon subsequently disowns Den in February 2005 and in a rage, Den violently throws Chrissie against a fruit machine and is only stopped by Zoe, who hits him over the head with an iron <b>doorstop</b> in the Vic. Den is assumed dead, but when Chrissie is alone with him, he stirs and grabs her ankle exclaiming [...] "You'll never get me out of the Vic!"; Chrissie responds by hitting him on the head with the <b>doorstop.</b> He dies moments later. Sam secretly witnesses the fatal blow, but Chrissie continues to allow Zoe to think it is she who has killed Den. The three women bury Den in the Vic cellar and concrete it over. Arguments between the women occur, and Sam and Chrissie become embroiled in a feud to regain ownership of the Vic, with Sam blackmailing Chrissie and digging up Den's body in the hope that Chrissie will be imprisoned, and Chrissie subsequently framing Sam for Den's murder, which leads to Sam's imprisonment. Eventually the truth is revealed, and Chrissie is imprisoned after pleading guilty. Den is finally given a proper burial in his 'original' grave next to Angie.|$|E

2500|$|In fact, {{the body}} {{thought to be}} Den's is {{actually}} that of the mysterious Mr. Vinnicombe, the boss of The Firm - who ordered Den's assassination. 14 years after Den's disappearance, {{it turns out that}} he had not died after all, and had faked his own death in order {{to get away from the}} gangsters who had been employed to kill him. However, Den eventually meets his demise at the hands of his second wife Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) in February 2005, after being bludgeoned to death with Pauline's <b>doorstop.</b> A body found under the basement of The Queen Vic six months later is quickly identified as Den's, and he is buried in his [...] "original" [...] grave next to Angie.|$|E
2500|$|A {{safety door}} {{prevents}} finger injuries near the hinges {{without the use}} of door guards. [...] Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place. [...] This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular ("bull-nose" [...] shaped) extension to the door, which moves {{in and out of a}} cavity as the door opens and closes. [...] This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges – either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a <b>doorstop).</b>|$|E
60|$|The funeral completed, {{the doctor}} gave orders {{for a single}} {{monument}} {{to be put in}} memory of Lord Harry Norland, thus prematurely cut off. He then returned to the cottage, paid and dismissed the nurse, taking her address in case he should find an opportunity, as he hoped, to recommend her among his numerous and distinguished clientele, and proceeded to occupy himself in setting everything in order before giving over the key to the landlord. First of all he removed the medicine bottles from the cupboard with great care, leaving nothing. Most of the bottles he threw outside into the dust-hole; one or two he placed in a fire which he made for the purpose in the kitchen: they were shortly reduced to two or three lumps of molten glass. These contained, no doubt, the mysteries and secrets of Science. Then he went into every room and searched in every possible place for any letters or papers which might have been left about. Letters left about are always indiscreet, and the consequences of an indiscretion may be far-reaching and incalculable. Satisfied at last that the place was perfectly cleared, he sat down in the salon and continued his business correspondence with the noble family and the solicitors. Thus engaged, he heard footsteps outside, footsteps on the gravel, footsteps on the <b>doorstop.</b> He got up, not without the slightest show of nervousness, and opened the door. Lord Harry was right. There stood the woman who had been his first nurse--the woman who overheard and watched--the woman who suspected. The suspicion and the intention of watching were legible in her eyes still. She had come back to renew her watch.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{the company began}} {{shifting}} to diecast zinc alloy (mazac) molding similar to Tootsietoy which had been doing toys in diecast since 1933 (Johnson 1998, p. 96; Richardson 1999, p. 67). Foreshadowing the post-war diecast boom, and perhaps {{in an attempt to}} steal some of Tootsietoys' thunder, new mazac and plastic Hubley toys were now called Kiddietoys - a name which was used at least until the mid-1950s (Richardson 1999, p. 67). Household objects such as <b>doorstops</b> and bookends were also produced, but automobiles, trucks and airplanes gradually became Hubley's mainstay.|$|R
25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Kennedy-Warren {{when it opened in}} 1931 was its air-cooling system. Three {{enormous}} fans drew cool air from Klingle Park {{at the back of the}} building and forced it through the public corridors. Residents could then open metal louvers above their hallway doors to cool individual apartments. Cross-ventilation during temperate weather was so effective that <b>doorstops</b> were required to prevent doors from slamming closed if left ajar. Advertisements for the Kennedy-Warren showed that the air was at least ten degrees cooler than on Connecticut Avenue. The fans were removed during the 2009–11 renovation after central air conditioning was installed.|$|R

Shells are made into cameos, bracelets and lamps, and traditionally as <b>doorstops</b> or decorations by families of seafaring men. The shell continues to be popular as a decorative object, though its export is now regulated and restricted by the CITES agreement. In modern culture, queen conch shells are often represented in everyday objects such as coins and stamps.|$|R
50|$|A <b>doorstop</b> (also {{door stop}}per, door stop or door wedge) is an object or device {{used to hold}} a door open or closed, or to prevent a door from opening too widely. Alternatively, a <b>doorstop</b> can be a thin slat built inside a door frame to prevent a door from {{swinging}} through when closed. A <b>doorstop</b> (applied) {{may also be a}} small bracket or 90 degree piece of metal applied to the frame of a door to stop the door from swinging (bi-directional) and converting that door to a single direction (in-swing push or out-swing pull).|$|E
50|$|Another {{method is}} to use a <b>doorstop</b> which is a small wedge of wood, rubber, plastic, cotton or another material. Manufactured wedges of these {{materials}} are commonly available. The wedge is kicked into position and the downward force of the door, now jammed upwards onto the <b>doorstop,</b> provides enough static friction to keep it motionless.|$|E

Following the confrontation Leyland {{was found dead}} in a hotel, leading to calls on social media for Brunt to be sacked. During the inquest into Leyland's death, Brunt expressed to the coroner that he was devastated at hearing the news of Leyland suicide. Following the inquest, Ofcom reported they had received 171 complaints in relation to the case and that they would consider these complaints in light of the coroner's verdict.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, the Monster case made {{headlines}} again. Michele Giuttari, chief inspector {{for the police}} unit GIDES (Investigative Group for Serial Crimes) announced that the crimes were connected to a satanic cult allegedly active in the Florence area. This conclusion was based, in part, on {{the discovery of a}} pyramidal stone near a villa where suspect Pietro Pacciani had been employed. The stone, Giuttari suggested, was indicative of cult activity. Critics, such as journalist Mario Spezi, found this idea laughable, given that such stones are commonly used as <b>doorstops</b> in the surrounding area. For Giuttari and Giuliano Mignini, it was possible that a pharmacist, Francesco Calamandrei, was involved, but he was then exonerated. It was possible that a physician from Perugia, who may had committed suicide in a lake the same year as the last murder, named Francesco Narducci was the killer. The truth to these claims have never been confirmed. In their 2008 non-fiction book The Monster of Florence, Douglas Preston and Mario Spezi suggested the same perpetrator that Nabb had identified: Antonio Vinci (the nephew and son of two Sardinian brothers each suspected of being the Monster) as a likely candidate for being the real killer. Vinci denied this in a Dateline NBC interview with Stone Phillips. Because of this book, prosecutor Mignini arrested Spezi for misdirection and defamation, but the journalist was acquitted of all the later charges.|$|R
50|$|Queen conch shells {{were used}} by Native Americans and Caribbean Indians {{in a wide variety}} of ways. South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and Taíno used conch shells to {{fabricate}} tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, cookware and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source.Brought by explorers, queen conch shells quickly became a popular asset in early modern Europe.

40|$|Note {{from the}} editor This issue follows {{hard on the}} heels of the last. Well, maybe. We were wanting to move to a twice-yearly {{publication}} schedule, if for no other reason than to avoid all the complaints from overworked postmen and crazed readers about the hefty weight of the last issue. Some ungracious souls compared it to sending an encyclopaedia by mail. Thank you. Do you read your encyclopaedias, shelve them, or use them as <b>doorstops?</b> But point taken; we want to be more of a bulletin than a tome. We will therefore try to adhere to a couple of deadlines for incoming articles and clippings— 30 June and 31 December of each year. I will do my best to hurry them over to Noumea shortly thereafter. There can often be backlogs on the SPC pressline (Regional Technical Fisheries Meetings, other Information Bulletins and such can swamp them for months), but the capable production folk there will get them to your doorstep as soon as possible. So this issue strives to be not dour documentation, but ground-breaking news, dispatches from the front. And we do bring both great news, and news of great tragedy. The bad news first: by now most of you have probably heard of the disastrous cyclone (hurricane, typhoon) which hit Manihiki in early November 1997. Both villages on the atoll were devastated, all of the pearl-farm structures above the water in the lagoon were destroyed, and almost twenty lives were lost (9 confirmed, about 10 still missing, presumed dead). The island has been largely evacuated, as there is simply no means of accommodating and feeding the 400 -odd folk. Inside this issue Research notes and reports p. 2 News and views p. 1...|$|R
50|$|Tom Howard (born in Kent on 27 March 1910) was an esteemed British {{special effects}} artist who gained especial {{prestige}} {{for his work}} in the 40’s - 60’s, in what is considered the golden age of Hollywood filmmaking. Initially starting out as a theatre-projectionist - the cinema equivalent of a water boy - Howard would transition to Denham Studios, working under the tutelage of Alexandra Korda, a Hungarian film director who would have a profound impact on the evolution of Howard’s career. Howard would become a key player in the production of many of Korda’s films, including the perennial classic Lawrence of Arabia, dreaming up (alongside Lawrence Butler) the earliest innovations of impressive photographic effects that would eventually net him an Oscar {{for his work in}} David Lean’s Blithe Spirit (1945). By 1945, his prestigious innovations would come to the attention of MGM, who would end up appointing him as Director of Visual Effects for their British Studios division, located in Borehamwood, a town in Southern Hertfordshire, UK. There, he would be responsible for many effects that are still celebrated as some of the most memorable work in the business today, demonstrating a pioneering eye for practical effects, use of space, and iconic visual imagery. His most notable works include the burning of Rome in Mervyn LeRoy’s Quo Vadis and many of the effects shots that made Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey such a beloved film. His tenure at the British offices of MGM Entertainment would last 15 years. In 1958, Howard would win his sophomore Academy Award for his involvement with George Pal’s Tom Thumb at the 31st Academy Award ceremony, and continue to work on many films, including The Haunting, Where Eagles Dare, et al. A quiet, unassuming man, he made his home near the MGM studios in the village of Bushey where he and his wife, Dorothy, brought up their children, and the only sign of his illustrious film reputation were the <b>doorstops</b> to his study and the dining room which, on closer inspection, turned out to be his Oscars. By the time of his retirement, Howard would have touched as many as 150 motion pictures, and have accomplished work on 85 of them. Howard died in his home in Bushey, Hertfordshire, from a stroke on 30 August 1985, at the age of 75.|$|R
50|$|Another type of <b>doorstop</b> is used {{to prevent}} doors from opening too far and {{damaging}} nearby walls. In this case a rubber cylinder or dome, or a rod or block of rubber-tipped metal, wood or plastic, is screwed into the wall or {{the floor in the}} path of the door. If it is attached to the wall it may be either a few inches above the ground, or at such a height as to meet the doorknob. A short wall-attached <b>doorstop,</b> usually a rubber dome or cylinder, is sometimes called a wall bumper.|$|E
