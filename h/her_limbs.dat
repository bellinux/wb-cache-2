5|$|In June 1911, Charlotte {{attended}} {{her cousin}} George V's coronation in England, but the country's summer heat left her bed-ridden with a swollen face and pain in <b>her</b> <b>limbs.</b> On 25 June 1914, her husband inherited his father's dukedom and became Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. World War I broke out on 28 July; Bernhard {{left for the}} front while Charlotte remained behind to oversee the duchy, serving mainly as a figurehead. During the war, Charlotte increasingly experienced various pains including chronic aches, swollen legs, and kidney problems. The degree of the pain became so severe that she took opium as her only comfortable treatment.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January 1569, Mary {{was moved}} to Tutbury Castle {{and placed in the}} custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury and his {{formidable}} wife Bess of Hardwick. Elizabeth considered Mary's designs on the English throne to be a serious threat and so confined her to Shrewsbury's properties, including Tutbury, Sheffield Castle, Wingfield Manor and Chatsworth House, all located in the interior of England halfway between Scotland and London, and distant from the sea. Mary was permitted her own domestic staff, which never numbered less than 16, and needed 30 carts to transport her belongings from house to house. Her chambers were decorated with fine tapestries and carpets, as well as her cloth of state on which she had the French phrase En ma fin est mon commencement ("In my end lies my beginning") embroidered. Her bedlinen was changed daily, and her own chefs prepared meals with a choice of 32 dishes served on silver plates. She was occasionally allowed outside under strict supervision, spent seven summers at the spa town of Buxton, and spent much of her time doing embroidery. Her health declined, perhaps through porphyria or lack of exercise, and by the 1580s, she had severe rheumatism in <b>her</b> <b>limbs,</b> rendering her lame.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} legends {{involving}} healing wounds by licking them or applying saliva. Saint Magdalena de Pazzi {{is said to}} have cured a nun of sores and scabs in 1589 by licking <b>her</b> <b>limbs.</b> The Roman Emperor Vespasian {{is said to have}} performed a healing of a blind man using his saliva. Pliny the Elder in his Natural History reported that a fasting woman's saliva is an effective cure for bloodshot eyes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the latest}} {{recorded}} witch-hunts in England took place in Coggeshall. It is known from the diary of Joseph Bufton, {{a resident of the}} town, that in 1699 the widow Common was tried three times for witchcraft, each time by 'swimming' – binding <b>her</b> <b>limbs</b> and putting her in the river to see if she would sink. She was found guilty on each occasion but died, probably from influenza, before she could be hanged. Another account is found in the records of the Reverend James Boys, the Vicar of Coggeshall.|$|E

The third carriage had been cleared of all but one live casualty trapped by <b>her</b> <b>limbs.</b> This passenger was successfully released about one hour later by the surgical member of the resuscitation team. The second carriage had been cleared of the living but there were several victims who were trapped and obviously dead. The front carriage was an indescribable tangle of twisted metal and in it the living and the dead were heaped together, intertwined among themselves and the wreckage.|$|E

25|$|In July 1967, McFall, aged 18 {{and eight}} months {{pregnant}} with Fred's child, vanished. She was never reported missing, but her dismembered remains were found buried {{at the edge of}} a cornfield between Much Marcle and Kempley in June 1994. <b>Her</b> <b>limbs</b> had been carefully disarticulated, and many phalange bones were missing from her body—likely to have been retained as keepsakes; her unborn child may also have been cut from her womb. Although Fred initially denied he had killed McFall, he confided to one visitor following his arrest that he had stabbed her to death following an argument. Nonetheless, this explanation is inconsistent with the fact that her wrists were found with sections of dressing gown cord wrapped around them, suggesting she had been restrained prior to her murder.|$|E
500|$|To {{physicians}} of the time, {{the appropriate}} treatment for [...] "apparent death" [...] was warmth and stimulation. [...] Anne Greene, a woman {{sentenced to death}} and hanged in 1650 for the supposed murder of her stillborn child, was found by anatomists to be still alive. [...] They revived her by pouring hot cordial down her throat, rubbing <b>her</b> <b>limbs</b> and extremities, bleeding her, applying heating plasters and a [...] "heating odoriferous Clyster to be cast up in her body, to give heat and warmth to her bowels." [...] After placing her in a warm bed with another woman, to keep her warm, she recovered fully and was pardoned.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} further popularized and embellished in Journey Into Darkness: Ghosts and Vampires of New Orleans (1998) by Kalila Katherina Smith, the {{operator}} of a New Orleans ghost tour business. Smith's book added several more explicit details to the discoveries allegedly made by rescuers during the 1834 fire, including a [...] "victim [...] obviously had her arms amputated {{and her skin}} peeled off in a circular pattern, making {{her look like a}} human caterpillar," [...] and another who had had <b>her</b> <b>limbs</b> broken and reset [...] "at odd angles so she resembled a human crab". [...] Many of the new details in Smith's book were unsourced, while others were not supported by the sources given.|$|E

Soon after {{they arrived at}} the Continental Film Company's plant Maud had {{wrenched}} her ankle by stumbling over some loose planks which had been carelessly left on the open-air stage, and she was now lying upon a sofa in the manager's room with <b>her</b> <b>limb</b> bandaged and soaked with liniment.|$|R
500|$|Anne's final {{pregnancy}} {{ended on}} 25 January 1700, when she miscarried a stillborn son. She had been pregnant at least seventeen times over as many years, and had miscarried or {{given birth to}} stillborn children at least twelve times. Of her five liveborn children, four died before reaching the age of two. Anne suffered from bouts of [...] "gout", pains in <b>her</b> <b>limbs</b> and eventually stomach and head, from at least 1698. Based on her foetal losses and physical symptoms, she may have had disseminated lupus erythematosus, or Hughes syndrome. Alternatively, pelvic inflammatory disease could explain why the onset of her symptoms roughly coincided with her penultimate pregnancy. Other suggested causes of her failed pregnancies are listeriosis, diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, and rhesus incompatibility. Rhesus incompatibility, however, generally worsens with successive pregnancies, and so does not fit with the pattern of Anne's pregnancies, as her only son to survive infancy, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, was born {{after a series of}} stillbirths. Experts also rule out syphilis, porphyria and pelvic deformation as incompatible with her medical history.|$|E
500|$|A {{correspondent}} from The Daily Telegraph visited Ellen about 22months {{after she}} fell ill. He wrote:The girl's face {{is by no}} means cadaverous. There is flesh on the cheeks, which have a pinkish tint, and there is some colour in the thin lips. The eyes are calmly closed, as though in healthy sleep. I ventured to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash.... The girl's [...] was quite warm and moist, and the finger nails were neatly trimmed. The fingers are not the least bit stiffened... It is not a skeleton hand, neither are any of the girl's limbs so emaciated as, under the extraordinary circumstances alleged, might be expected.... The child's body is very thin as compared with <b>her</b> <b>limbs....</b> There is not much substance in her flesh, however; it is soft and flabby... almost ice-cold.... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that {{it is almost impossible to}} detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth, and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.|$|E

Blood was also found under her head, suggesting {{that she may have}} tried to fend off Benoit. Officials said that there were no signs of immediate struggle. Toxicologists were unable to determine whether alcohol found in her body was there before death or a decomposition product.

The cardboard plate read “Any government official who compromises this pursuit of happiness and right to travel, will be held criminally responsible and fined, as this is a natural right and freedom.” During the traffic stop, an officer threatened Gaines with a Taser,after she refused to comply with his request to leave the vehicle [...] [...] Later, Gaines reportedly posted videos to Instagram and described the incident and subsequent arrest, stating that the arresting officers threatened to break <b>her</b> <b>limbs</b> and that she spent two days in isolation. Gaines was released with charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and littering. Gaines' failure to appear in court over the traffic violation resulted in a bench warrant being served to her on the day of her death.|$|E
2500|$|Midna's {{original}} form is a turqoise skinned woman with body markings on <b>her</b> <b>limbs,</b> orange hair, and red eyes. She also wears a South Asian-like attire composing of black gagra choli with a trailing black veil. However, after being cursed by Zant, Midna became a diminutive [...] "imp". Other than {{her lack of}} clothing, save a Fused Shadow fragment (powerful magical relics of her race) as a mask, Midna bears elements of her {{original form}}. While in her imp form, Midna frequently speaks in sinister and sarcastic ways, often acting uninterested in the events of Hyrule and/or Link's plight unless they suit her needs. Her bright orange hair is her main method of physical control while she is in imp form and will often use it to deal physical damage or control Link while {{he is in his}} wolf form. Her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Kōmoto.|$|E

Her movements were very hesitant and unsteady and her characteristic [...] "bunny walk", in which she held her {{hands in front of}} her like claws while ambulating, suggested extreme difficulty with sensory processing and an inability to integrate visual and tactile information. Kent was somewhat surprised to find her fine motor skills were significantly better, determining they were at approximately the level of a two-year-old. She could not chew and had very severe dysphagia, totally incapable of swallowing solid or even soft food and barely able to swallow liquids. When eating she held anything she could not swallow in her mouth until her saliva broke it down, and if this took too long she spat it out and mashed it with her fingers. She was also completely incontinent, and did not respond to extreme temperatures.|$|E
