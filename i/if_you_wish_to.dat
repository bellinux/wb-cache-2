25|$|Two images Henri Bergson gave in {{his essay}} An Introduction to Metaphysics may aid us in comprehending the ideas of intuition, analyses, the {{absolute}} and the relative. The first image is a city reconstructed with juxtaposed photographs taken from every viewpoint and angle. The reconstruction can never give us the dimensional value of walking through the actual city. This can only ever be grasped through a simple intuition. The {{same goes for the}} experience of reading a single line of Homer. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> explain this experience to someone who cannot speak ancient Greek, you may translate the line and lay commentary upon commentary, but this commentary shall never grasp the dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its original language.|$|E

2500|$|While {{in prison}} later in life, Hardin {{wrote in his}} {{autobiography}} which is the source for many stories about him. However, he was well known for wildly exaggerating or completely making up stories about his life. In several of his stories, {{he claimed to have}} been involved in events which cannot be confirmed.

Scott requested the aid of James Chalmers' Mississippi brigade, which moved to support Scott throughout the night. The assault commenced the next morning, and though outnumbered, Scott's forces inflicted more than 200 casualties in the early fighting. At 9:30 AM, Chalmers tried to intimidate Wilder into surrender, sending a flag of truce with the message, [...] "You have made a gallant defense of your position, and to avoid further bloodshed I demand an unconditional surrender of your forces. I have six regiments of infantry, one battalion of infantry sharpshooters, and have just been reinforced by a brigade of cavalry, under Colonel Scott, with two battalions of infantry."

The Qur'an says it like this: We have raised mountains on the earth lest it convulse with you. How do you raise a mountain, {{and what is the}} purpose of a mountain? Have you ever tried to balance a tire? You use weights to keep the tire balanced. That's how the earth is balanced, with mountain ranges. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that we have a type of bomb that, when it strikes the earth a drill on it is timed to go into the earth and explode at the height that you wish the mountain to be. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> take the mountain up a mile (1.6 km), you time the drill to go a mile (1.6 km) in and then explode.

2500|$|Finally, {{the release}} of the 2nd Edition rules further complicates the process by making some {{sections}} of the 1st Edition obsolete. [...] Full compatibility with 2nd Edition rules is only possible by owning the 2nd Edition. [...] This forces some players to purchase the ASLRB all over again. [...] An area the new rules simplifies is the Chapters included in various Modules. [...] Originally a new module would add a new chapter to the ASLRB to cover the new material. [...] For instance, {{the release of}} Yanks included special rules in a Chapter E and a chapter detailing the American OOB. [...] Any players wishing to use these rules in a following Module would also have to own Yanks. [...] The 2nd Edition helps to alleviate this problem by supplying more rules in one binder. [...] It still does not supply all rules for all situations. [...] For instance <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> play a scenario using Jungle terrain you will need the Code of Bushido module with its rules section. [...] Also, the OOB of particular nationalities and the map boards from particular Modules may still be required for subsequent Modules.|$|E

It is not my purpose to give a summary of his discourse. It is enough to say of his voice, that its power and volume are sufficient to reach every one in that vast assembly; of his language that it is neither high-flown nor homely; of his style, that it is at times familiar, at times declamatory, but always happy, and often eloquent; of his doctrine, that neither the 'Calvinist' nor the 'Baptist' appears in the forefront of the battle which is waged by Mr. Spurgeon with relentless animosity, and with Gospel weapons, against irreligion, cant, hypocrisy, pride, and those secret bosom-sins which so easily beset a man in daily life; and to sum up all in a word, it is enough to say, of the man himself, that he impresses you with a perfect conviction of his sincerity.|$|E
