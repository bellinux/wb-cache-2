To achieve equilibrium between internal and external environments, the newt would likely be inclined to absorb salt through the integument and/or ingest saline-rich substances orally. In marine animals, water uptake is mainly driven by sodium and chloride absorption, and it may be assumed that if T. carnifex were to be placed into a marine environment, they would undergo similar adaptations.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts relating to a large unknown <b>freshwater</b> <b>animal</b> was in 1818, when Hamilton Hume and James Meehan found some large bones at Lake Bathurst in New South Wales. They did not call the animal a bunyip, but described the remains indicating the creature as {{very much like a}} hippopotamus or manatee. The Philosophical Society of Australasia later offered to reimburse Hume for any costs incurred in recovering a specimen of the unknown animal, but for various reasons, Hume did not return to the lake. It might be noted that Diprotodon skeletons have sometimes been compared to the hippopotamus; they are a land animal, but have sometimes been found in a lake or water course.|$|E
5000|$|Hydramacin-1 {{was first}} {{isolated}} from epithelial {{cells of the}} cnidarian Hydra, a small (almost-microscopic) <b>freshwater</b> <b>animal</b> related to corals, sea anemones and jellyfish.

German researchers managed to isolate the gene that coded for the production of the protein from the Hydra genome in 2008. The gene was transferred and cloned in a plasmid (Pet32a) which was inserted in the bacteria Escherichia coli, a standard method of replicating a protein isolated from a much larger organism. The three-dimensional structure of the resulting protein was then determined by NMR spectroscopy and is now published online by the Protein Data Bank.|$|E

Current projects carrying assessment of freshwater biodiversity focus mainly on leading-better-known groups such as fish, or identify keystone species and/or endemic freshwater systems for conservation purposes. Our purpose is to complete these existing projects by providing quantitative estimates of species number for all freshwater groups on each continent and/ormajor eco-regions.

30|$|Shipping {{has been}} {{by far the}} {{dominant}} pathway for the introduction of non-native marine species to the European Atlantic coast (47 % of established non-native species) and to the Baltic Sea (45 %, [36]). This pathway {{has also been a}} significant factor in <b>freshwater</b> <b>animal</b> introductions to Europe (25 % of established non-native species, [37]). The shipping network creates connections among aquatic ecosystems across the globe, and organisms are frequently transported in the ballast water of ships, or attached to hulls as fouling organisms [28]. Ballast water is taken on to increase a vessel's weight when it is not fully laden with cargo. As this water is taken on, any organisms in the water are also sucked in. Vessels then travel to subsequent ports, and surviving organisms can be discharged with ballast water if the vessel takes on more cargo.|$|E
40|$|<b>Freshwater</b> <b>Animal</b> Diversity AssessmentInternational audienceThe zoogeographic {{distributions}} of the 2, 814 species of copepods reported from freshwater are analysed.

Historical factors affecting levels of diversity are identified. More than 90 % of all freshwater copepods are endemic to a single-zoogeographic region and endemic genera occur in all regions except Antarctica. Species that are not endemic to a single region include the highly vagile and cosmopolitan species occurring in four or more regions. The greatest faunal connectivity, as identified by SÃ¸rensen's Index, is between Palaearctic and Nearctic regions, and identifies the Holarctic taxa.

40|$|The {{euryhaline}} gastropod Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is found}} in northern Germany in freshwater or in brackish water habitats in the Baltic Sea. Previous studies have revealed that individuals from both habitats are not distinguishable by morphological characters or by sequence comparison of DNA encoding 16 S RNA or cytochrome C. As reported in this study, animals collected in the two habitats differ substantially in their physiological ability to adapt to different salinities. Comparison of accumulation rates of ninhydrin-positive substances (NPS) in foot muscle upon transfer of animals to higher medium salinities revealed that brackish water animals were perfectly able to mobilize NPS, while <b>freshwater</b> <b>animals</b> had only limited ability to do so. In an attempt to explore whether this difference in physiology {{may be caused by}} genetic differentiation, we compared protein expression patterns of soluble foot muscle proteins using 2 D gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Of the 40 consistently detected protein spots, 27 showed similar levels in protein expression in <b>animals</b> collected from <b>freshwater</b> or brackish water habitats, respectively. In 12 spots, however, protein concentration was higher in brackish water than in <b>freshwater</b> <b>animals.</b> In four of these spots, expression levels followed increases or decreases in medium salinities. In a different set of 4 of these 12 spots, protein levels were always higher in brackish water as compared to <b>freshwater</b> <b>animals,</b> regardless of their physiological situation (14 days in artificial pond water or in medium with a salinity of 16 â€°). The remaining 4 of the 12 spots had complex expression patterns. Protein levels of the remaining single spot were generally higher in <b>freshwater</b> <b>animals</b> than in brackish water animals. These expression patterns may indicate that freshwater and brackish water animals of T. fluviatilis belong to different locally adapted populations with subtle genetic differentiation...|$|R

30|$|The {{opening of}} canals that link {{previously}} isolated water bodies has created {{many opportunities for}} the introduction and spread of non-native species. In the Mediterranean Sea, 54 % of established non-native species arrived by dispersing through the Suez Canal [36].

There are now river and canal connections running from the Black Sea across Europe to the mouth of the Rhine River, and north to the Baltic Sea [38]. These connections have served as invasion corridors for many species native to the Ponto-Caspian into Western and Northern Europe. It is estimated that 8 % of non-native <b>freshwater</b> <b>animal</b> species in Europe arrived by using natural dispersal mechanisms to move through canals [37]. In addition, many of the species that arrived through shipping (see previous paragraph) could only do so because of the existence of canals.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{calculated}} a Living Planet Index (LPI) for the Netherlands, {{based on}} 361 animal species from seven taxonomic groups occurring in terrestrial and freshwater habitats. Our assessment is basically {{similar to the}} global LPI, but the latter includes vertebrate species and trends in population abundance only. To achieve inferences on trends in biodiversity more generally, we added two insect groups (butterflies and dragonflies) and added occupancy trends for species for which we had no abundance trends available. According to the LPI, the state of biodiversity has slightly increased from 1990 to 2014. However, large differences exist between habitat types. We found a considerable increase in <b>freshwater</b> <b>animal</b> populations, probably because of improvement of chemical water quality and rehabilitation of marshland habitats. We found no trend in the LPI for woodland populations. In contrast, populations in farmland and open semi-natural habitats (coastal dunes, heathland and semi-natural grassland) declined, which we attribute to intensive agricultural practices and nitrogen deposition, respectively. The LPI shows that, even in a densely populated western European country, ongoing loss of animal biodiversity is not inevitable and may even be reversed if adequate measures are taken. Our approach enabled us to produce summary statistics beyond the level of species groups to monitor the state of biodiversity in a clear and consistent way...|$|E
40|$|Sulphur {{isotopes}} in archaeological bone collagen are not routinely analysed in palaeodietary studies. Here {{we investigate}} the potential contribution that sulphur isotope analysis can provide toward {{the study of}} ancient human diet and economy, with particular emphasis on the distinction between freshwater and terrestrial consumers. For material from the Late Bronze Age site of Chicha in the south-western Eurasian forest-steppe, sulphur isotopes effectively separate freshwater and terrestrial animal food resources. The sulphur isotope data coupled with nitrogen isotope values from Chicha reflect a dietary reliance upon <b>freshwater</b> <b>animal</b> protein (fish) for the Late Bronze Age inhabitants. In contrast, sulphur isotope values for freshwater and terrestrial potential food species from the Eneolithic site of Bilâ€™shivtsi in western Ukraine were indistinguishable, demonstrating that d 34 S values cannot always be relied upon to identify freshwater and terrestrial consumers. The data from this study support the adoption of d 34 S analysis as a standard component of palaeodietary studies; apart from its potential to distinguish freshwater from terrestrial consumers, it can provide supplementary dietary information not evident from the carbon and nitrogen isotope data. In addition, certain indices are considered {{that may be used}} to assess the validity of sulphur isotope data, as currently exist for carbon and nitrogen. According to the analysis of modern collagen samples, N:S appears to be a broad indicator of collagen sulphur isotope quality. However, more work {{needs to be done to}} establish an effective means by which highly-altered sulphur isotope values can be identified and thereby removed from consideration...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT THE ENDANGERED WATTLE-NECKED SOFTSHELL TURTLE (Palea steindachneri) THROUGHOUT THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS by Christopher C. Radford Master of Science in Environment Science: Professional Science Master Option California State University, Chico Summer 2011 The wattle-necked {{softshell}} turtle (Palea steindachneri) is {{native to}} China and Vietnam and is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as an endangered species. With continued capture and trade of the species, preservation efforts {{are unlikely to be}} successful in its native range. Outside of its native region, P. steindachneri populations are known to exist in the island nation of Mauritius and in the state of Hawaii. Viable populations in Hawaii may provide an opportunity for ex-situ conservation strategies, however, its status as introduced, and possibly invasive, must be carefully evaluated. The present project was conducted to determine the present distribution of softshell turtles throughout the Hawaiian Islands and to identify suitable sampling sites for future research. Survey methods included live trap placement in freshwater habitat, visual encounter surveys, and interviews. Captured turtles were tagged, measured, photographed, and promptly released. Field research was conducted on the islands of Kauai, Maui, Oahu, and Lanai and resulted in the capture of over five hundred <b>freshwater</b> <b>animal</b> specimens including three P. steindachneri, the identification of future study sites, access to sites, and an abundance of anecdotal data on the whereabouts of softshell turtles in Hawaii. The project produced a customized database, and interactive maps to manage and represent data collected. Future research on P. steindachneri in Hawaii should focus on known populations.
