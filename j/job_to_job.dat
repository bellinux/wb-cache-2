We have specified and estimated a matching function for firms of different size in The Netherlands, according to the number of employees. We found no difference in the elasticity of matching <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> <b>job</b> searchers, but we did find a significant higher efficiency of matching <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> <b>job</b> searchers for small firms, compared to larger firms. This paper provides a number stylized facts, based on characteristics of vacancies offered by firms of different size that give an interpretation of this difference in matching efficiency. Basically, large firms offer more vacancies that require high education, large firms offer more part-time vacancies and large firms look more for employed job searchers and less for unemployed and school leavers. firm size...|$|R

Although he had statistics that put him consistently among the seasonal league leaders, he reportedly had a poor work ethic resulting from an active social life outside of baseball. This behavior did not endear him to his team captain, Cap Anson, which caused them to feud during Gore's time in Chicago.

The results provide partial support for each hypothesis. For example, the relationships of <b>job</b> autonomy <b>to</b> <b>job</b> self-efficacy and job performance were stronger for older workers, but the relationships of <b>job</b> autonomy <b>to</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction and affective commitment were weaker for older workers...|$|R

Despite business success, after a few years, Corrigan decided to return to the West Coast. In 1933, he spent $310 on a used 1929 Curtiss Robin OX-5 monoplane and flew it home, where he returned to work as an aircraft mechanic and began to modify the Robin for a transatlantic flight.|$|E

During the war, he served with a British infantry during military campaigns in Cameroon, East Africa and the Middle East. Wallace-Johnson received exposure to the world outside his tiny village. After being demobilised in 1920, he moved from <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>job,</b> {{unable to find a}} comfortable niche to settle in. While working as a clerk in the Freetown municipal government, a corruption scandal erupted, involving the misappropriations of funds and equipment by top government officials, including the mayor. In his pamphlet regarding municipal governance in Freetown, A Cloud of Doom, Wallace-Johnson took credit for exposing the corruption. His exact role in the affair is not known, but no Sierra Leoneans ever challenged the veracity of his claim. In the aftermath of the scandal, the British revoked Freetown's rights to complete municipal self-government, believing that Africans, no matter how educated they were, could not govern themselves.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Theophilus Akunna Wallace-Johnson (1894 – 10 May 1965) was a Sierra Leonean and British West African workers' leader, journalist, {{activist and}} politician.

After {{attending}} United Methodist Collegiate School for two years, he dropped out and {{took a job as}} an officer in the customs department in 1913. He was dismissed for helping organize a labour strike, but later reinstated to his position a year later. After resigning from his job, he enlisted as a clerk with the Carrier Corps during World War I. After being demobilised in 1920, Wallace-Johnson moved from <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>job,</b> before settling as a clerk in the Freetown municipal government. He claimed to have exposed a corruption scandal, which resulted in the incarceration of top officials, including the mayor. After being fired from this job in 1926, he left Sierra Leone and became a sailor. He joined a national seamen union and it is believed that he also joined the Communist Party. In 1930, he helped form the first trade union in Nigeria and attended the International Trade Union Conference of Negro Workers in Hamburg, where he established a number of contacts. He published articles and edited the Negro Worker, a journal devoted to uniting black workers around the world. He travelled to Moscow, where he claimed to have attended classes on Marxism-Leninism theory, union organisation and political agitation.|$|E
