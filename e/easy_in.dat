5|$|Brenda was {{considered}} the worst storm to strike the area since Hurricane <b>Easy</b> <b>in</b> 1950. While no casualties are directly blamed on the storm, at least one traffic-related death took place. According to an American Red Cross Disaster Service report encompassing eight Florida counties, 11 houses sustained significant damage, while 567 suffered more minor damage. Around 590 families were affected overall. Total monetary damage is placed at near $5 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{technology}} {{of everyday life}} is not well recorded, but archaeological evidence shows it to have been {{similar to that in}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England. Recently evidence has been found of watermills in Pictland and kilns were used for drying kernels of wheat or barley, not otherwise <b>easy</b> <b>in</b> the changeable, temperate climate. Although constructed in earlier times, brochs, roundhouses and crannogs remained in use into and beyond the Pictish period.|$|E

5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and <b>Easy</b> <b>in</b> 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too <b>easy,</b> <b>in</b> Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission {{to the will of}} the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} the first title in the Fire Emblem series on a {{portable}} console. While development of a handheld Fire Emblem title had been considered for earlier games, the team felt available hardware lacked the expression to realize their vision. The GBA offered technical capacities superior to the Super Famicom, the release platform of the last Fire Emblem title , while also offering portability, making it more appealing to players. The platform was also chosen due to estimated development time and budget considerations. Developing for the new hardware proved challenging in some respects, and <b>easy</b> <b>in</b> others such as creating basic software. During development, two different versions were developed while the team were {{getting used to the}} new hardware. One of the main issues they faced was the limited resolution and screen size of the GBA. The game's combat animations were intended to evoke scenes from high fantasy, such as The Lord of the Rings, contrasting with the equivalent styles of fantasy fighting in Japanese stories.|$|E

25|$|The snowball Earth {{hypothesis}} was first posited {{to explain what}} were then considered to be glacial deposits near the equator. Since tectonic plates move slowly over time, ascertaining their position at a given point in Earth's long history is not <b>easy.</b> <b>In</b> addition to considerations of how the recognizable landmasses could have fit together, the latitude at which a rock was deposited can be constrained by palaeomagnetism.|$|E
25|$|A general Lie {{group is}} a semidirect product of a {{solvable}} Lie group and a semisimple Lie group (the Levi decomposition). The classification of representations of solvable Lie groups is intractable in general, but often <b>easy</b> <b>in</b> practical cases. Representations of semidirect products can then be analysed by means of general results called Mackey theory, which is a generalization of the methods used in Wigner's classification of representations of the Poincaré group.|$|E

25|$|If {{the myth}} lacks any {{specific}} scenarios, the MythBusters will test every reasonable scenario, {{and just one}} scenario is {{enough for them to}} confirm the myth. For example, when testing to see whether shooting fish in a barrel was in fact very <b>easy,</b> <b>in</b> most tests, they could not hit the fish with a bullet, but the energy transfer to the water by the bullet was lethal to the fish; therefore, the myth was confirmed.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} in {{miniaturization}} was {{to speed up the}} fissioning of the pit to reduce the minimum inertial confinement time. This would allow the efficient fission of the fuel with less mass in the form of tamper or the fuel itself. The key to achieving faster fission would be to introduce more neutrons, and among the many ways to do this, adding a fusion reaction was relatively <b>easy</b> <b>in</b> the case of a hollow pit.|$|E

25|$|The Yat dialect {{is seldom}} heard when New Orleans is {{depicted}} in movies and television shows. Traditionally, characters portrayed from New Orleans are heard using a southern or Cajun accent. An {{example of this is}} 1986's The Big <b>Easy,</b> <b>in</b> which Dennis Quaid speaks an exaggerated Cajun/southern derivation. This trend has been challenged, though, in light of post-Katrina New Orleans representation, like HBO's Treme and Werner Herzog's , both of which feature actual New Orleans locals either speaking in Yat or one of its variations.|$|E
25|$|Standard Urdu {{is often}} contrasted with Standard Hindi. Apart from {{religious}} associations, {{the differences are}} largely restricted to the standard forms: Standard Urdu is conventionally written in the Nastaliq style of the Persian alphabet and relies heavily on Persian and Arabic {{as a source for}} technical and literary vocabulary, whereas Standard Hindi is conventionally written in Devanāgarī and draws on Sanskrit. However, both have large numbers of Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit words, and most linguists consider them to be two standardised forms of the same language, and consider the differences to be sociolinguistic, though a few classify them separately. Old Urdu dictionaries also contain most of the Sanskrit words now present in Hindi. Mutual intelligibility decreases in literary and specialized contexts that rely on educated vocabulary. Further, it is quite <b>easy</b> <b>in</b> a longer conversation to distinguish differences in vocabulary and pronunciation of some Urdu phonemes. As a result of religious nationalism since the partition of British India and continued communal tensions, native speakers of both Hindi and Urdu frequently assert them to be distinct languages, despite the numerous similarities between the two in a colloquial setting.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} Test, played at Edgbaston, Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed, {{from the first}} ball he received, by Charlie Macartney for a duck. However, the match was a low-scoring one on a pitch which made batting difficult, and Australia left England needing 105 to win. The task was not <b>easy</b> <b>in</b> the conditions, but Hobbs, this time opening the batting with C. B. Fry, hit 62 not out. He scored quickly off all the bowlers and England passed the target without losing a wicket. This innings meant that he had scored 919 runs {{before the end of}} May, but he failed to emulate W. G. Grace's {{achievement}} of scoring 1,000 runs in May when Nottinghamshire batted throughout the day when Surrey played them on 31 May. England lost the second Test by nine wickets, their team much changed to the bafflement of critics and spectators, and Hobbs scored just 19 and 9. The home side also lost the third Test. Hobbs scored 12 and 30, the latter the highest score of the innings, but was involved in controversy in the first innings when he appeared to change his mind when about to walk off after apparently hitting his own wicket. The umpire ruled him not out, to the fury of the Australians who loudly protested for some time. Hobbs was out to a very straightforward delivery almost immediately after; some critics, including the Australian captain, believed he allowed himself to be dismissed because he thought the umpire was wrong, but Hobbs later wrote that the incident unsettled him and he lost concentration.|$|E
