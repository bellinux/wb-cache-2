"It Hurts to Be in Love" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be sung by Pitney's childhood friend and sometime collaborator Neil Sedaka, but Sedaka's employers at RCA Victor refused to release Sedaka's new recording, because he had not recorded it in their studios, as <b>stipulated</b> <b>by</b> his <b>contract.</b> Sedaka attempted another recording of this song in RCA's studios, but the results were unsatisfactory.

25|$|Large {{public service}} rate increases, added to weak {{regulatory}} frameworks and constant renegotiation of concession contracts, brought outsized profits to the privatized companies. Between 1993 and 2000, the 200 largest companies in Argentina accumulated US$28.4 billion in profits, 56.8% {{of which were}} earned by privatized companies, and 26.3% by firms that had ties to those companies. Prices and wages were virtually frozen in Argentina from 1995 to 2001; but utility fees rose {{in line with the}} U.S. inflation rate, constituting an additional source of earnings for the newly privatized companies. The linking of public services fees charged in Argentina to the U.S. inflation rate enabled privatized companies to pocket US$9 billion by 2000. Additionally, privatized firms sent 70% of their earnings abroad while failing to pay the annual concession fees or to make all the investments <b>stipulated</b> <b>by</b> the <b>contracts.</b> The companies also imported large quantities of inputs and goods produced <b>by</b> associated firms, <b>contracting</b> heavy trade debts in dollars while violating a law that required them to prioritize Argentine products when making purchases.|$|R
40|$|The licensor's {{efforts and}} {{cooperation}} {{are essential to}} a successful technology transfer. There {{are two kinds of}} incentives to induce or discourage the licensor's efforts: ownership incentives and contractual incentives. Ownership incentive is defined as the incentive rooted in the licensor's financial equity involvement in licensee firm while contractual. incentive is the incentive provided through performance-dependent royalty arrangement <b>stipulated</b> <b>by</b> the licensing <b>contract.</b> This article empirically examines the effectiveness of these incentives in inducing licensors' efforts based on a survey data from 327 international technology licensing contracts. The findings are (1) (partial) ownership is a very effective incentive for the licensor to exert higher level of efforts; and (2) the contractual arrangement, however, is not an effective incentive. This article closes by discussing the implications of the results of this analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|Freedom of {{contract}} or contractualism {{is the idea}} that individuals should be free to bargain among themselves the terms of their own contracts, without government interference. Anything more than minimal regulations and taxes may be seen as infringements. It is the underpinning of the theory of laissez-faire economics. In the sphere of the private law, the agreement constitutes the traditional mean which generates relations among different categories of subjects. Adjoining to all these, the public law uses the institutions <b>stipulated</b> <b>by</b> a <b>contract</b> as special means in achieving the purposes of public interest. Freedom of public contracts is limited today by the competition law. Today competition law pervades every aspect of doing business in Europe. As a consequence, each business that is active in Europe is continually faced with the challenge of conforming its commercial objectives and practices to the EC competition rules. Abuse of a dominant position is prohibited by Article 82 EC Treaty. The frequent adoption of narrow market definitions and low thresholds for establishing dominance in Europe makes compliance with Article 82 a concern for many companies that would not qualify as traditional “monopolists”. </p...|$|R
40|$|Supply {{contracts}} {{are designed to}} minimize inventory costs or to hedge against undesirable events (e. g., shortages) {{in the face of}} demand or supply uncertainty. In particular, replenishment terms <b>stipulated</b> <b>by</b> supply <b>contracts</b> need to be optimized with respect to overall costs, profits, service levels, etc. In this paper, we shall be primarily interested in minimizing an inventory cost function with respect to a continuous replenishment rate. Consider a single-product inventory system in continuous review with constant replenishment and compound Poisson demands with lost-sales. The system is subject to carrying costs and lost-sale penalties, where the carrying cost is a linear function of on-hand inventory and the lost-sales penalty is incurred per lost-sale occurrence as a function of lost-sale size. We first derive an integro-differential equation for the expected cumulative cost until the first lost-sale occurrence. From this equation, we obtain a closed form expression for the time-average inventory cost, and provide an algorithm for a numerical computation of the optimal replenishment rate that minimizes the aforementioned time-average cost function. In particular, we consider two special cases of lost-sales penalty functions, 2 constant penalty and loss-proportional penalty. We further consider special demand siz...|$|R
25|$|On 2 July 2002 the Austrian {{government}} announced {{its decision to}} buy the Typhoon as its new air defence aircraft, it having beaten the General Dynamics F-16 and the Saab JAS 39 Gripen in competition. The purchase of 18 Typhoons was agreed on 1 July 2003, and included training, logistics, maintenance and a simulator.

The first aircraft was delivered on 12 July 2007 and formally entered service in the Austrian Air Force.

40|$|Section 83 of the Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774 {{has some}} magic about it. It has survived over 200 years, and was {{recently}} applied with success in 1993. An attempt {{has been made}} to abolish it due to its obscurity and archaic nature by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 yet, after all, it has been decided to suspend the repeal. It is now on the list of repeals of the Law Commission on Insurance Law Reform; however the insurers want to keep it. The research will examine two hypotheses: first is that the provision of s. 83 is outdated, and its repeal would not influence the protection to persons with an insurable <b>interest</b> in buildings <b>stipulated</b> <b>by</b> contemporary law; second is that the protection s. 83 provides is not fully substituted by modem legislation, consequently it should not be repealed. This thesis will cover the legal aspect of fire insurance of buildings subject to lease, 'C mortgage and sale, and protection of insurable interests in buildings. It will review the history and present state of the art of this old legislation. Case law will be examined where s. 83 has been applied along with the main criticisms of the provision. The contemporary legislation will be researched to find out whether the protection provided by s. 83 will continue if the Statute is repealed. Finally, the insurers' views on the 1774 Act will be presented and analysed...|$|R
50|$|As was {{the case}} for {{previous}} holders of the Asiento, the Portuguese and the French, the profit was not in the slave trade but in the illegal contraband goods smuggled in the slave ships and in the annual ship. Those goods were sold at the Spanish colonies at a handsome price as they were in high demand and constituted unfair competition with taxed goods, proving an important drain on the Spanish Crown trade income.The relationship between the South Sea Company and the Government of Spain was always bad, and worsened with time. The Company complained of searches and seizures of goods, lack of profitability, and confiscation of properties during the wars between Britain and Spain of 1718-1723 and 1727-1729, during which the operations of the Company were suspended. The Government of Spain complained of the illegal trade, failure of the company to present its accounts as <b>stipulated</b> <b>by</b> the <b>contract,</b> and non-payment of the King's share of the profits.These claims were a major cause of deteriorating {{relations between the two countries}} in 1738; and although the Prime Minister Walpole opposed war, there was strong support for it from the King, the House of Commons, and a faction in his own Cabinet. Walpole was able to negotiate a treaty with the King of Spain at the Convention of Pardo in January 1739 that stipulated that Spain would pay British merchants £95,000 in compensation for captures and seized goods, while the South Sea Company would pay the Spanish Crown £68,000 in due proceeds from the Asiento. The South Sea Company refused to pay those proceeds and the King of Spain retained payment of the compensation until payment from the South Sea Company could be secured. The break up of relations between the South Sea Company and the Spanish Government was a prelude to the Guerra del Asiento, as the first Royal Navy fleets departed in July 1739 for the Caribbean, prior to the declaration of war, which lasted from October 1739 until 1748. This war is known as the War of Jenkins' Ear.|$|R
