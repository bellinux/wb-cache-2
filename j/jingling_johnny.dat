5000|$|The KVIL jingles were {{originally}} produced from the TM Century package [...] "KVIL: The '90s". KVIL-FM in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas market first aired that jingle package in January 1991 {{and continued to}} do so until Late Spring or Early Summer 1993, when JAM introduced the [...] "Celebrate" [...] package for that station. Before that time, however, that jingle package was first tested by TM on a radio station in country of Japan in late 1990, but TM later decided to shift the jingle package to American radio stations, just {{so that they could}} more easily syndicate that package to radio stations in several American markets. Following that, the [...] "Memphis' Best Music" [...] package from Thompson Creative was used.

5000|$|In April 1965, {{programming}} consultant Bill Drake crafted KHJ's top-40 format. Drake hired {{program director}} Ron Jacobs, who had created formats in Hawaii and California. The format featured a restricted playlist and restrained commentary by announcers (although a few, such as Robert W. Morgan, Charlie Tuna, Humble Harve and The Real Don Steele, {{were allowed to}} develop on-air personalities). Other DJs from 1965-68 included Roger Christian, Gary Mack, Dave Diamond, Sam Riddle, Johnny Williams, Frank Terry, Johnny Mitchell, Tommy Vance, Scotty Brink, Steve Clark, Bobby Tripp, Tom Maule and Bill Wade. Part of the format, known as [...] "Boss Radio", were <b>jingles</b> by the <b>Johnny</b> Mann Singers. [...] "Boss Radio" [...] spread throughout the U.S., bringing high ratings to KFRC in San Francisco, WFIL in Philadelphia, KGB in San Diego, WQXI in Atlanta, CKLW in Windsor, Ontario and WRKO in Boston. Drake and Gene Chenault brought many of their announcers from the other [...] "Boss" [...] stations, using them as a proving ground for talent.|$|R
5000|$|KNX-FM {{struggled}} with low listener ratings, and wasn't able to re-capture its original audience. On March 2, 1989 at 12:00 PM, following a day-long stunt with a ticking clock during songs and an announcement from {{vice president and}} general manager of KNX-FM, Charlie Seraphin, an oldies music format was introduced and the heritage KNX-FM call letters were dropped yet again, this time in favor of KODJ to complement the change in branding to [...] "Oldies 93.1". [...] KODJ competed with crosstown rival KRTH, which later came under common CBS Radio ownership when ownership limits were relaxed by the FCC. KODJ focused more on the 1950s and the early 1960s era of oldies music than rival KRTH. DJs on KODJ were The Real Don Steele, Charlie Tuna, Rich Fields, and Machine Gun Kelly. In response to KODJ's debut, KRTH gradually reduced and eventually faded out the amount of newer songs from its playlist, focused mainly on the 1960s decade of oldies with a selected number of top songs from the late 1950s. In addition, KRTH brought in Bill Drake as consultant while featuring all new <b>jingles</b> by the <b>Johnny</b> Mann Singers, which helped it reach higher ratings. The Real Don Steele left KCBS-FM in mid-1992 to join KRTH. Charlie Tuna the morning host at KODJ/KCBS-FM from 1989-1993 would later work at KRTH from 2008-2014.|$|R
