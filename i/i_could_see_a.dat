2500|$|Sullivan praised Elvis {{at the end}} of the show, saying [...] "This is a real decent, fine boy. We've {{never had}} a pleasanter {{experience}} on our show with a big name than we've had with you.... You're thoroughly all right"—a remark that could either be interpreted as a [...] "ringing endorsement" [...] that [...] "legitimized the singer with an adult audience" [...] or as [...] "a somewhat hypocritical statement considering what the CBS censors had just done to his performance on that show." [...] Eyewitness Jerry Schilling writes, [...] "The way Elvis looked out at us at that moment, I thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> mix of hurt over the attacks he’d been subjected to in the press, and a deep pride in who he was and what he was doing." [...] (According to historian Tim Parrish, Presley's manager, Colonel Parker, [...] "had threatened to remove Elvis from the show if Sullivan did not apologize for telling the press that Elvis's 'gyrations' were immoral.") Reflecting on the event in 1969, Presley claimed that Sullivan had expressed a very different opinion off-camera: [...] "So they arranged to put me on television. At that particular time there was a lot of controversy—you didn't see people moving—out in public. They were gettin' it on in the back rooms, but you didn't see it out in public too much. So there was a lot of controversy ... and I went to the Ed Sullivan Show. They photographed me from the waist up. And Sullivan's standing over there saying, 'Sumbitch.' I said, 'Thank you, Ed, thank you.' I didn't know what he was calling me, at the time." ...|$|E
60|$|As I spoke, {{the chief}} arose, and, dark though it was, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> gleam of {{intelligence}} on his swarthy visage.|$|E
6000|$|... "For the present," [...] Dartrey admitted, [...] "Tallente {{is doing}} excellently. I wish, though, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little {{farther into the}} future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was 'Eden New,' {{and dancing}} they sang in a chore, 'We {{are out of}} it all!--yea, in Little-Ease cramped no more!' And their {{shrouded}} figures pacing with joy <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>As</b> you <b>see</b> the stage from the gallery. And they had no heed of me.|$|R
60|$|It {{was several}} miles off, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{distinctly}} <b>see</b> <b>a</b> small dark dot against the dull green and gray.|$|R
60|$|O my friend! If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> English actress {{with but}} one {{hundredth}} {{part of the}} nature and art of Madame Plessy, I should believe our English theatre to be in a fair way towards its regeneration. But I have no hope of ever beholding such a phenomenon. I may as well expect ever to <b>see</b> upon <b>an</b> English stage an accomplished artist, able to write and to embody what he writes, like you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I would <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{communion of}} Men," [...] said Stephen, [...] "and {{then there would}} be no more violence, for {{there would be no more}} plunder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O gin <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{mountain}} top again, I feel {{as though}} I could lay me down and die content. What garred ye come daundering to these weary flats of France?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{am afraid}} that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been {{watching}} me eagerly out of his small eyes, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> shadow pass over his face as I spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh HIM!' rejoined Mark, {{with an air}} of {{careless}} defiance. 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> HIM. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him <b>a</b> little better, if he'd shave himself, and get {{his hair}} cut.' ...|$|R
60|$|I stood up, {{steadying}} myself upon my uncle's shoulder, {{but though}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> for <b>a</b> mile, {{or perhaps a}} quarter more, {{there was not a}} sign of the four-in-hand.|$|R
60|$|It was as I had expected. The stall {{in which}} de Cartienne kept his mare was {{carefully}} closed, {{but through the}} chinks <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>a</b> lamp was burning inside.|$|R
60|$|Far over in {{the east}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> faint break in the clouds, and to this I laid my hope of a change for the better. But the cabin boy shook his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "You build a {{wall around}} your life," [...] she said, [...] "like the wall which encircles your mystery house. Last night I thought that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little {{way over the}} top. To-night you are different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My host {{seemed to}} be absent a long time. I heard the man {{opposite}} lay down his fork and spoon, and half fancied <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> pair of wild eyes shining through the gloom like a cat’s.|$|E
60|$|The bank is very steep, and was {{slippery}} with rain, and half-melted ice. I {{hardly know}} how I got down, but I was soon at the bottom, and climbing, with two English {{officers who were}} crossing and had joined me, over some broken rocks, deafened by the noise, half- blinded by the spray, and wet to the skin. We were {{at the foot of}} the American Fall. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> immense torrent of water tearing headlong down from some great height, but had no idea of shape, or situation, or anything but vague immensity.|$|R
5000|$|... “I’m glad I didn’t give up [...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> finally <b>see</b> <b>a</b> stage {{sparkling}} in the spotlight[...] [...] Every {{single day}} {{felt like a}} dream." [...] - Koda Kumi ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea, yea," [...] {{she said}} (and I {{knew she was}} nodding her head sagaciously); I {{looked out at the}} room window, but all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was <b>a</b> man {{wheeling}} an empty barrow down the brae.|$|R
6000|$|... “I’m afraid {{some one}} else has fed me most of my life,” she laughed, trying bravely {{to enter into the}} spirit of his quizzing, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> terror dawning and growing in her eyes as she watched Wolf Larsen.|$|E
60|$|So {{long as we}} laid in port, Sally {{visited the}} Highlander daily; and {{approved}} herself a neat and expeditious getter-up of duck frocks and trowsers, a capital tailoress, {{and as far as}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>a</b> very well-behaved, discreet, and reputable woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect Goldstein will dock my salary, {{as well as}} fine Flo," [...] remarked Maud musingly, as {{she waited}} for her hat and coat. [...] "He obeyed you very meekly, Mr. Jones, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> wicked glitter in his eye, nevertheless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure of it, Ruth," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{only wish}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> you <b>a</b> little more cheerful. Surely you can't still--be afraid of Wingrave," [...] he added, glancing uneasily across the table.|$|R
60|$|This kept us silent {{again for}} <b>a</b> moment. Mabane, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> was getting <b>a</b> little ruffled.|$|R
60|$|The {{magistrate}} complimented {{the woman}} on her muscular powers, and the court-room laughed; but all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was <b>a</b> boy {{on the threshold of}} life, passionately crawling to muddy death, and there was no laughter in it.|$|R
60|$|Their air {{in dealing}} with this marvel was ostensibly {{critical}} and sceptical, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> considerable amount of belief showing through their guarded qualifications. I took a line of intelligent interest, tinged with a reasonable doubt of the whole story.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{they brought}} him in. He was a timid-looking man with an embarrassed manner and all the low cunning of an author stamped on his features. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> bundle of papers in his hand, and I knew that the scoundrel was {{carrying}} a manuscript.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish the}} snow would {{stop for a}} minute," [...] Dick said, [...] "just to let us have a look round. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> hundred yards I am sure I should know where we are. What is the matter with you, James; what are you blubbering about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heavens!" [...] he muttered. He had {{regained his}} command of himself. [...] "I assure you <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{much more than}} you <b>could</b> tell me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> quite <b>a</b> lot that you don't even suspect yet, but you can't be seen quite through." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner Tom came in alone, and I {{suspected}} that Perry had sent him. He was fidgety, ill at ease, and presently asked if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him <b>a</b> moment in my study. Maude's glance followed us.|$|R
60|$|Shall we ever laugh again? If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{dog that}} I {{knew in the}} old times! and could {{put my arms around}} his neck and tell him all, everything, and ease my heart.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> smile {{struggling}} {{around the}} sweet lips of that dear girl, after I had thus delivered myself, as I fancied, with a most accurate inaccuracy; but she succeeded in repressing it, though those provoking eyes of hers continued to laugh, {{much of the}} time our interview lasted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you can't fool me," [...] {{says the}} driver. [...] "You're {{trying to keep}} back {{something}} from me, you know it mighty well. You know, I reckon, that if I had the salve on the other eye <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> lot more things that's valuable. Come--please put it on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heigho!" [...] said Simon. [...] "I {{wonder whether}} {{this be a}} reality or a dream.--I am sober, I know; for who will give me credit for the means to be drunk? and as for sleeping, I'm too hungry for that. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> capon {{and a bottle of}} white wine." ...|$|E
60|$|JAMES. He's an ugly customer. That's all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> There was <b>a</b> little carpet bag in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{a stormy}} place in winter," [...] McFarlane explained. [...] "These piles of stone are mighty {{valuable}} in a blizzard. I've crossed this divide in August in snow so thick <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> rod." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Through {{the shine}} of the {{slippery}} snow <b>I</b> now <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>As</b> it were through a crystal roof, a great company Of the dead minueting in stately step underground To {{the tune of}} the instruments I had before heard sound.|$|R
