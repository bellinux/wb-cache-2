40|$|AbstractOn the 1 st of January 2004 the Civil Protection Act {{took effect}} and thus {{replaced}} the Rescue Services Act. One {{of the goals}} of the new legislation was to further distinguish the different areas of responsibility regarding <b>fire</b> <b>safety.</b> In order to clarify some parts of the new law, the Swedish Rescue Services Agency issued a general recommendation (SRVFS 2004 : 3) which amongst other things states that the estate agent or the usufructuary are responsible for carrying out and documenting a <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> management system to uphold a reasonable level of <b>fire</b> <b>safety.</b> The theoretical aim of this paper was to define what should be included in such a <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> management system and to try to give an understanding of other factors that may have an impact on risk management as a whole. The theory has then been put to practical use when designing the <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> management system for Fasadelement Verkstads AB, a small company in the Luleå area that specializes in manufacturing steel products for the building- and transport industry. By studying the general recommendation (SRVFS 2004 : 3) along with literature and guidelines of some Swedish municipalities it was concluded that a <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> management system should include the following:• Policy• Organization & Areas of responsibility• Description ofo Building characteristicso Activitieso <b>Fire</b> <b>safety</b> installations• Risk assessment & Risk reduction plan• Training, information and <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> drills• <b>Fire</b> <b>safety</b> regulations• Control and maintenance routines• Follow-up routinesThe mere existence of a documented <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> management system is not enough to achieve a satisfactory standard regarding <b>fire</b> <b>safety.</b> There needs to be an understanding throughout the entire organization in order for such a system to work. The management must show commitment and willingness to allocate recourses and the workforce must have an understanding and respect regarding <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> issues. In order to achieve this a positive safety culture is needed. A well working <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> management system may be favourable from an economic point of view in terms of lower insurance costs. It may also {{have an effect on the}} deductable in the case of an accident if the <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> would be proven to be poorly managed.
