5|$|No. 151's Pilot Officer Richard Milne {{shot down}} Gruppenkommandeur of II./KG 53, Major Reinhold Tamm. The He 111 blew up, killing all aboard. The escorting Bf 109s counter-attacked, {{shooting}} down two No. 151 Squadron Hurricanes, killing one pilot and wounding the other. No. 257 Squadron also engaged and lost one pilot {{killed in a}} crash landing after combat with Bf 110s. No. 46 Squadron—the only 12 <b>Group</b> <b>unit</b> to take part—also engaged. Shortly hence, the 13 Hurricanes from No. 85 Squadron, led by Peter Townsend, struck at the bombers but was blocked by ZG 26 Bf 110s. Bf 109s was also present and inconclusive engagements began. It was likely the Bf 109s belonged to III./JG 51 providing top cover. There was intense combat around the bombers. No. 1 Squadron's leader, David Pemperton, accounted for one JG 3 Bf 109. No. 85 Squadron accounted for one He 111, but lost a Hurricane to the Bf 110s, the pilot, Pilot Officer Paddy Hemmingway, bailed out into the Channel and survived. Another pilot, Flight Lieutenant Dick Lee, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of France and a flying ace with nine victories was reported missing in action. He was last seen chasing three Bf 109s out to sea. His body was never found. Among the few British squadrons left in the fight (owing to fuel and ammunition running low) was No. 54 Squadron. Its commander, Colin Falkland Gray, destroyed a Bf 110.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to the end}} of the Japanese {{threat to}} Australia and the unsuitability of large {{armoured}} formations in jungle warfare the 1st Armoured Division no longer had any real role by 1943. By this time, there was a manpower shortage in the Australian Army, which required a re-allocation of personnel and the gradual reduction of Australia's armoured units. While the division was disbanded in September 1943, its 1st Armoured Brigade and other units was retained as the independent 1st Armoured Brigade Group. This brigade <b>group</b> <b>unit</b> remained part of III Corps in Western Australia until its disbandment in September 1944. The 4th Armoured Brigade, which was established in March 1943 and included several regiments which had previously formed part of the 1st Armoured Division, provided all the Australian armoured units which saw action from 1943 until the end of the war.|$|E

500|$|Moreno is also {{credited}} for founding sociodrama. [...] Though sociodrama, like psychodrama, utilizes {{the theatrical}} form as means of therapy, the terms are not synonymous. [...] While psychodrama focuses on one patient within the <b>group</b> <b>unit,</b> Sociodrama addresses {{the group as}} a whole. [...] The goal is to explore social events, collective ideologies, and community patterns within a group in order to bring about positive change or transformation within the group dynamic. Moreno also believed that sociodrama {{could be used as a}} form of micro-sociologythat by examining the dynamic of a small group of individuals, patterns could be discovered that manifest themselves within the society as a whole, such as in Alcoholics Anonymous. [...] Sociodrama can be divided into three main categories: crisis sociodrama, which deals with group responses after a catastrophic event, political sociodrama, which attempts to address stratification and inequality issues within a society, and diversity sociodrama, which considers conflicts based on prejudice, racism or stigmatization.|$|E

40|$|There is some evidence, {{for small}} collections, that {{perceived}} number {{is affected by}} grouping or unitization of sub-elements. Do these grouping effects extend to large collections and do they affect adaptation to those collections? Here we consider whether using large collections of <b>grouped</b> <b>units</b> rather than separate element alters the adapting power of a collection. Our <b>grouped</b> <b>units</b> were composed by joining four lines (2 ̆ 2 legs 2 ̆ 2) {{by means of a}} circular 2 ̆ 2 body 2 ̆ 2; collections of these were compared to collections of un-connected lines. If unitization affects adapting power, than adaptation should be less for connected units. But if unitization fails for large collections, then 400 unconnected lines would be equivalent in adaptive power to 100 units composed of 4 lines and a central body. We tested this in two ways. First (N= 28), we compared the strength of adaptation from 100 <b>grouped</b> <b>units</b> (adapted on one side of fixation) with the strength of adaptation from 400 unconnected lines (similarly adapted) when assessed with much lower numerosities in the adapted region (e. g, 12, 25, or 50 lines).

2500|$|The plans {{chosen by}} Bose and Masakazu Kawabe, chief of Burma area army, envisaged the INA being {{assigned}} an independent {{sector in the}} U-Go offensive. No INA units were to operate at less than battalion strength. For operational purposes, the Subhas Brigade was placed {{under the command of}} the Japanese General Headquarters in Burma. Advance parties of the Bahadur Group also went forward with advanced Japanese units. As the offensive opened, the INA's 1st Division, consisting of four guerrilla regiments, was divided between U Go and the diversionary Ha-Go offensive in Arakan. One battalion reached as far as Mowdok in Chittagong after breaking through the British West African Division. A Bahadur <b>Group</b> <b>unit,</b> led by [...] Col. Shaukat Malik, took the border enclave of Moirang in early April. The main body of the 1st Division was however committed to the U-Go, directed towards Manipur. Led by Shah Nawaz Khan, it successfully protected the Japanese flanks against Chin and Kashin guerrillas as Renya Mutaguchi's three divisions crossed the Chindwin river and the Naga Hills, and participated in the main offensive through Tamu in the direction of Imphal and Kohima. The 2nd Division, under M.Z. Kiani, was placed to the right flank of the 33rd Division attacking Kohima. However, by the time Khan's forces left Tamu, the offensive had been held, and Khan's troops were redirected to Kohima. After reaching Ukhrul, near Kohima, they found Japanese forces had begun their withdrawal from the area. The INA's forces suffered the same fate as Mutaguchi's army when the siege of Imphal was broken. With little or nothing in the way of supplies, and with additional difficulties caused by the monsoon, Allied air dominance, and Burmese irregular forces, the 1st and 2nd divisions began withdrawing alongside the 15th Army and Burma Area Army. During the withdrawal through Manipur, a weakened Gandhi regiment held its position against the advancing Maratha Light Infantry on the Burma–India road while the general withdrawal was prepared. The 2nd and 3rd INA regiments protected the flanks of the Yamamoto force successfully at the most critical time during this withdrawal, but wounded and diseased men succumbed to starvation along the route. Commonwealth troops following the Japanese forces found INA dead along with Japanese troops who had died of starvation. The INA lost a substantial number of men and amount of materiel in this retreat. A number of units were disbanded or used to feed into new divisions.|$|E
