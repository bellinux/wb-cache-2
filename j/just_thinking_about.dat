500|$|The spanking thing started because I {{believed}} that my character in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around {{with people like}} Al Pacino's character. Warren [...] asked me to write some songs, one of them, the Hanky Panky song, was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', {{and in the middle}} I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, [...] "Oh Love" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as power pop. Its musical style is reminiscent of the band's early albums Dookie (1994) and Nimrod (1997). It is a [...] "move away" [...] from the band's politically inspired releases like American Idiot (2004) and 21st Century Breakdown (2009). Bassist Mike Dirnt described the musical style of [...] "Oh Love" [...] by stating, [...] "We were <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> making a killer power-pop record– dirtier, back to basics. We tapped into our version of Exile on Main Street". Vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong also talked about his desire to write a power pop song, stating, [...] "What I really wanted to do was write real power-pop kind of music that had that old Green Day energy, so the original Green Day sound became ¡Uno!".|$|E

5000|$|Try My Love is an R&B studio album by Táta Vega. It is {{her third}} solo album and was {{released}} on Motown's Tamla label in late 1978. While not as critically acclaimed as her two previous albums, it received the greatest success on Billboard's Pop and R&B album charts. The double-sided single [...] "I <b>Just</b> Keep <b>Thinking</b> <b>About</b> You Baby/Get It Up For Love" [...] hit the Top 20 on Billboard's Dance Music charts. [...] "I <b>Just</b> Keep <b>Thinking</b> <b>About</b> You Baby" [...] was also a hit on Billboard's R&B charts. It was her most successful single during her Motown years.|$|R

500|$|Reception of the single-player aspect varied. Yin-Poole {{wrote that}} while the cliffhanger ending of Halo 2 was disappointing, the {{campaign}} of Halo 3 was much more satisfying. Gerstmann, GameSpy's Gabe Graziani, and Goldstein maintained that the campaign was too short, especially on easier difficulty levels or with three additional players in co-op. Goldstein was {{highly critical of the}} eighth level, stating [...] "the penultimate chapter is so bad, <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it puts a rotten taste in my mouth." [...] The New York Times Charles Herold said the game had a [...] "throwaway" [...] plot and Total Video Games judged the single-player aspect ultimately disappointing. Goldstein and Steve West of Cinema Blend thought a part of the game's story was lost by not having the Arbiter featuring as prominently as the character was in Halo 2.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Tennis Court" [...] address Lorde's newly {{established}} fame and criticise the [...] "high life." [...] Lorde said {{she wrote the}} song [...] "after having had {{a glimpse into the}} music industry, and I was <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how superficial people can be and how we put up all these fronts." [...] She found the idea of a tennis court [...] "very visually beautiful" [...] and [...] "something I kept coming back to on Tumblr and all that sort of thing", saying it was [...] "kind of a symbol of nostalgia for me. It was something which was familiar and safe to me." [...] She also described the song as being [...] "about the town where she grew up and the friends [...] she would ... hang out all summer." [...] Paul Lester, writing for The Guardian, compared the song's lyrical theme to that of two other songs by Lorde: [...] "Royals" [...] and [...] "Million Dollar Bills" [...] (from The Love Club EP).|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax {{when you have a}} good race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, when asked about the radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish. [...] What do you think these guys are here to do? I call them egocentric bastards. That {{is the only way to}} win and the only way to win the Championship, they are all the same." ...|$|E

500|$|TV Week often {{commented on}} her {{pregnancy}} storyline. After the plot was half way through Erin Miller of TV Week said that Nicole {{had changed her}} mind about adopting her baby [...] "more times that Julia Gillard has uttered the phrase 'moving forward'". Upon watching Nicole's beach birth scenes, the magazine website editor quipped [...] "Who knew sand had birthing properties?! Well, maybe not... but you could forgive pregnant teen Nicole for thinking that after a casual stroll along the Bay's beach ends with Angelo delivering her newborn son!" [...] Commenting on the realism of the storyline they added: [...] "Only in the Bay would a baby be born on the beach!" [...] Miller thought it was odd she had then [...] "miraculously lost any signs that she even had a baby." [...] She quipped [...] "already the teen is back to wearing skin-tight dresses!". They later described Nicole and Marilyn's argument over George as [...] "the mother of all rifts" [...] and said [...] "It's exhausting <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it!" [...] Miller later criticised Nicole's career in fashion, after John told her he hated her designs for the Surf Club. She said [...] "I had to agree with him - putting lifesavers in pink polo-neck swimmers is a terrible idea." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Movin' Down the Line", an ode to a love unrequited, {{features}} mellow horns, jangling guitar, heavy bass lines, and a swelling {{string and}} piano conclusion. In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. I was <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> growing up in Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it back and say thank you, and tell all the kids out there to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E

In November 2011, The Unthanks {{released}} a live album, The Songs of Robert Wyatt and Antony & the Johnsons, and Wyatt is quoted {{on the cover of}} the album as saying [...] "I love the idea.

5000|$|EXAMPLE: A human being’s Determination is {{thinking}} reason, since {{that is what}} she unalterably is in opposition to her Other: nature. However, humans are entangled in nature in myriad other ways than <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> rationally <b>about</b> it, and how humans react to this external influence also tells us about what they are. This is their Constitution, the part of their being that undergoes alteration in relation to its Others.|$|R

2500|$|According to Jeff Ayers, Linus Torvalds had a [...] "fixation for flightless, fat waterfowl" [...] and Torvalds {{claims to}} have {{contracted}} [...] "penguinitis" [...] after being gently nibbled by a penguin: [...] "Penguinitis makes you stay awake at nights <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> penguins and feeling great love towards them." [...] Torvalds' supposed illness is a joke, but he really was bitten by a little penguin {{on a visit to}} the National Zoo & Aquarium, Canberra, Australia. Torvalds was looking for something fun and sympathetic to associate with Linux, and a slightly fat penguin sitting down after having had a great meal perfectly fit the bill.|$|E
2500|$|Early episodes {{told the}} story of student Kenneth Barlow (William Roache), who had won a place at university, and thus found his working-class {{background}} something of an embarrassment. The character {{was one of the few}} to have experienced life 'outside' of Coronation Street. In some ways this predicts the growth of globalisation, and the decline of similar communities. In an episode from 1961, Barlow declares: [...] "You can't go on <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than Elsie Tanner and her boyfriends." [...] Roache is the only remaining member of the original cast, which makes him the longest-serving actor in Coronation Street, and in British and global soap history.|$|E
2500|$|I went to {{the front}} office all the time, and I would say, [...] "John is kicking the dogs and putting them into freezers." [...] Or I would say, [...] "They are {{stepping}} on the animals, crushing them like grapes, and they don't care." [...] In the end, I would go to work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals myself. Because I couldn't stand to let them go through that. I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day. Some of those people would take pleasure in making them suffer. Driving home every night, I would cry <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it. And I just felt, to my bones, this cannot be right.|$|E

She sometimes is a shy person, but is able to become more sociable, though still generally dislikes speaking to others.

50|$|It {{might be}} {{expected}} intuitively that Pirate A will have to offer the other pirates {{with most of the}} gold to increase the chances of his plan being accepted. However, this is quite far from the theoretical result. When each of the pirates votes they won't <b>just</b> be <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the current proposal, but all other outcomes down the line. Also because the order of seniority is known in advance, each of them can accurately predict how the others might vote in any scenario.|$|R
2500|$|For the score, Giacchino felt no {{pressure}} to align his music with the style or tone of previous MCU films, and [...] "in fact they {{encouraged me to}} go in my direction, so there were never any handcuffs put on me." [...] In regards to the title character, Giacchino felt the key [...] "was getting inside of him—not worrying {{so much about the}} magic stuff, more <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> who he was as a person, what he lost and then how that loss affected him. For me it's a very sad story, {{and a lot of the}} music has this very melancholy feel to it." [...] To particularly differentiate the score, and help create a [...] "mystical mood", Giacchino used a harpsichord and an electric sitar.|$|E
2500|$|McKee {{continued}} {{working on}} the song the following days. She explained, [...] "I thought about my own adolescent years, my own first love. I thought about watching Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo and Juliet' and putting on a little mini disco ball light and just dreaming of Leo. I thought about me and my friends sitting around at slumber parties in the 90's, giddy even <b>just</b> <b>THINKING</b> <b>about</b> boys..... I thought about what Benny said and I listened to the song again, and I was like The Teenagers..... that's such a great word, Teenager. It is a very descriptive word; it packs a lot of emotion and imagery into three syllables..... I couldn't believe after all of our agonizing over 'youth' themes, that we had overlooked such an obvious one – the teenage condition." [...] The following week, Perry invited McKee, Luke, and Martin to write at her hometown of Santa Barbara, California. McKee tried to approach Luke about her idea, but he was upset {{about the amount of}} time he had spent working in the chorus, so he banned them from changing it. They started {{working on the}} verses, where Perry had already prepared most of the imagery.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two records she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it... And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which {{led her to the}} realisation that she [...] "needed refreshing". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted {{to make sure it was}} a look that was all me, you know?." [...] She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel [...] "completely intoxicated!." [...] In July 2010, Rowland said during {{an interview}} with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that [...] "I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} a SEF as {{described}} here is actually {{not so different from}} the definition of normal science. This definition <b>just</b> highlights why <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the future needs more discursive scepticism.

5000|$|In Chapter 3, [...] "Thinking in the Service of Knowledge," [...] Steiner {{observes that}} {{when confronted with}} percepts, we feel obliged to think about and add {{concepts}} to these: to observation we add thinking. Steiner seeks to demonstrate that what he considers the primary antithesis between observation and thinking underlies all other related antitheses and philosophical distinctions, such as subject vs. object, appearance vs. reality, and so on. For most objects of observation, he points out, we cannot observe both the percept and our <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> this percept simultaneously, for a tree and <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a tree are fundamentally different; we can only attend to one at a time. In contrast, we can simultaneously observe thinking and observe our thoughts <b>about</b> <b>thinking,</b> for here the percept (thinking) and our <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the percept consist of the same element (thought): <b>Just</b> <b>thinking</b> and <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>thinking</b> are the same process; observing the latter, we are simultaneously observing the former.|$|R
