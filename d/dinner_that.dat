5|$|The speech clearly impresses {{both the}} judges and Leslie, and Pawnee is {{ultimately}} {{selected for the}} tournament. Leslie reluctantly accepts Ben's invitation to a celebratory <b>dinner</b> <b>that</b> night, where Ben brings up his feelings for Leslie. She slips away to call Ann for advice, and she urges Leslie to act on her feelings. Just as Leslie decides to do so, she is surprised to find Chris has arrived at the dinner to congratulate the two personally. He insists they sleep {{at his home in}} Indianapolis, ruining their night. The next day, Leslie and Ben run into each other alone and Ben reveals Chris is out for the day. Ben then immediately kisses her, leaving Leslie simultaneously delighted and nervous about their future.|$|E
5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health {{over the past six}} months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a <b>dinner</b> <b>that</b> Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E

25|$|On 5 April Captain Charles Barnard of the American sealer Nanina was sailing off {{the shore}} of Eagle Island, with a {{discovery}} boat deployed looking for seals.

When the family fall ill at dinner by a small dose of arsenic, Alfred, weakened as a result, is later killed in his bed by a fatal injection from Quimper; as he is being killed, Alfred cried out his killer's name, which Quimper made certain was misconstrued as him calling for the doctor's help, shortly after appearing to have run back up the stairs to Alfred's bedroom when Emma rushed out to the commotion being created.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the editing}} {{techniques}} used in Citizen Kane {{was the use}} of montage to collapse time and space, using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in five vignettes that condense 16 years of story time into two minutes of screen time. Welles said that the idea for the breakfast scene [...] "was stolen from The Long Christmas Dinner of Thornton Wilder... a one-act play, which is a long Christmas <b>dinner</b> <b>that</b> takes you through something like 60 years of a family's life." [...] The film often uses long dissolves to signify the passage of time and its psychological effect of the characters, such as the scene in which the abandoned sled is covered with snow after the young Kane is sent away with Thatcher.|$|E
500|$|... 1951 was the 50th {{anniversary of}} the fire department, and so the village held a week-long celebration {{beginning}} on July 1, 1950 with a morning service at the Briarcliff Congregational Church, a band concert at Law Park, and a Fourth of July parade with 5,500 spectators, with a march led by Fred Messinger, followed by eight ex-chiefs. The parade included Scarborough's first fire engine (the red hand-pumped 1901 truck), many bands, and twelve fire departments from Westchester County municipalities. The ex-chief's <b>dinner</b> <b>that</b> evening drew 85 guests. In that year, {{it was noted that}} there were not yet any resident deaths from fires within village boundaries. In the late 1950s, Edna O'Brien was the first; trapped in her house and surrounded by intense flames. In 1955, the department purchased a new pumper and a Mack hook-and-ladder truck with a 75ft. ladder for $40,000 ($ in [...] ). Also in the mid 1950s, a new firehouse was decidedly needed, and more urgently when the weight of the then-new pumper and ladder trucks ruptured the municipal building's floor. For five years, the equipment was housed in Briarcliff and Ossining garages until late 1963, when the new firehouse and municipal offices building was completed. Also in the 1950s, additional sirens were installed for firemen outside of the central siren's range, both on Schrade and at the intersection of Long Hill and Scarborough roads, replacing a siren at Scarborough Presbyterian. During the 1960s the old municipal building's cupola bell, which the department used as a fire bell and which had tolled {{at the end of the}} World Wars, was moved to the front of the new firehouse.|$|E
500|$|As a whole, {{the album}} {{contains}} {{a mixture of}} several different genres of music, particularly pop standards. Commenting on the diverse musical nature of the album, author Tom Santopietro described as the singer being able to [...] "cover [...] all fan bases without seriously alienating any". Lazy Afternoon opens with the title track, originally written by John La Touche and Jerome Moross. A [...] "poetic nature song" [...] where [...] "Streisand gives her voice totally over to the lyrics", director Francis Ford Coppola suggested to the singer over <b>dinner</b> <b>that</b> she record the song in order to revive it. [...] "My Father's Song" [...] was written solely by Holmes and is the first original song on the track listing. Being about the singer's late father, Holmes began work on the track after Streisand shared personal, childhood stories of her father to him. Like other album tracks, it {{was considered to be}} a [...] "sympathetic" [...] ballad that relies on Streisand's vocals, according to AllMusic's William Ruhlmann. [...] "By the Way", the record's third track, is noted as Streisand's first songwriting credit in her entire career. While creating the track, Streisand decided to write from a [...] "sense of resolute rather than desperate emotions". It is followed by a cover of Four Tops' [...] "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)". The original version, set in a gospel rock tempo, was updated into a disco track. Lyrically, the story of a lost love is told, with her neighbors supposedly discussing the matter during [...] "long and sleepless night". The previously unreleased [...] "I Never Had It So Good" [...] is the fifth track on Lazy Afternoon and was written by Paul Williams and Roger Nichols. She wrote in the album's liner notes that she had always wanted to sing it and accompany it with someone playing the harmonica.|$|E
