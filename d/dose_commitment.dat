Fifty-year dose commitments from a one-year exposure were calculated from both liquid and atmospheric releases for four population groups (infant, child, teen-ager and adult) residing between 2 and 80 km from each site. This report tabulates {{the results of}} these calculations, showing the dose commitments for both liquid and airborne pathways for each age group and organ, Also included for each site is a histogram showing the fraction of the total population within 2 to 80 km around each site receiving various average dose commitments from the airborne pathways. The total <b>dose</b> <b>commitment</b> from both liquid and airborne pathways ranged from a high of 220 person-rem to a low of 0. 003 person-rem with an arithmetic mean of 16 person-rem.

40|$|The {{environmental}} consequences and {{the probability of}} conceivable accidents occurring during the high level waste preparation (HLWP) phase of the Commercial Nuclear Waste Vitrification Project (CNWVP) were analyzed. The maximum {{environmental consequences}} of postulated accidents were calculated to result in low radiation doses: a 50 -year <b>dose</b> <b>commitment</b> of 0. 3 rem to the whole body for a maximum individual, and of 20 man-rem to the whole body for the surrounding population. This may be compared to Department of Energy (DOE) values, in Manual Chapter Appendix 0524, of 0. 5 -rem whole-body annual <b>dose</b> <b>commitment</b> to individuals at points of maximum probable exposure in uncontrolled areas. The calculated whole-body relative dose risk to individuals from accidents is low (1. 6 x 10 {sup - 6 } rem/yr) as compared to that received from natural background radiation (approximately 1. 5 x 10 {sup - 1 } rem/yr) and as compared to levels specified in Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements for routine releases from nuclear power reactors (5. 0 x 10 {sup - 3 } rem/yr).

40|$|The MILDOS Computer Code {{estimates}} impacts from radioactive {{emissions from}} uranium milling facilities. These impacts {{are presented as}} <b>dose</b> <b>commitments</b> to individuals and the regional population within an 80 km radius of the facility. Only airborne releases of radioactive materials are considered: releases to surface water and to groundwater are not addressed in MILDOS. This code is multi-purposed {{and can be used}} to evaluate population doses for NEPA assessments, maximum individual doses for predictive 40 CFR 190 compliance evaluations, or maximum offsite air concentrations for predictive evaluations of 10 CFR 20 compliance. Emissions of radioactive materials from fixed point source locations and from area sources are modeled using a sector-averaged Gaussian plume dispersion model, which utilizes user-provided wind frequency data. Mechanisms such as deposition of particulates, resuspension. radioactive decay and ingrowth of daughter radionuclides are included in the transport model. Annual average air concentrations are computed, from which subsequent impacts to humans through various pathways are computed. Ground surface concentrations are estimated from deposition buildup and ingrowth of radioactive daughters. The surface concentrations are modified by radioactive decay, weathering and other environmental processes. The MILDOS Computer Code allows the user to vary the emission sources as a step function of time by adjustinq the emission rates. which includes shutting them off completely. Thus the results of a computer run can be made to reflect changing processes throughout the facility&#x 27;s operational lifetime. The pathways considered for individual <b>dose</b> <b>commitments</b> and for population impacts are: • Inhalation • External exposure from ground concentrations • External exposure from cloud immersion • Ingestioo of vegetables • Ingestion of meat • Ingestion of milk • <b>Dose</b> <b>commitments</b> are calculated using dose conversion factors, which are ultimately based on recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

40|$|The {{radioactive}} gas radon, intermediate term of {{the decay}} series of uranium and thorium, is the main contamination source of underground places and may be a risk for high concentration and long exposure time. European and Italian law requires radon concentration to be measured in workplaces and, if the “action level” of 500 Bq/m 3 is reached, proper actions must be made in order to decrease the <b>dose</b> <b>commitment.</b> Considering natural showcaves or artificial cavities open to public, the exposition of the visitors is frequently small, due to the short residence time, but accompanying people, remaining underground for long time, {{may be subject to}} appreciable dose and the radon concentration should therefore be monitored. The high humidity in natural caves may impair the use of some measuring devices. Therefore, different detection methods were compared (ZnS scintillation counters, E-PERM electret ionisation chambers, cellulose nitrate alpha-track dosimeters) to select the best procedure for long-term investigation. The LR- 115 (Kodak) alpha-track dosimeters were insensitive to humidity and permitted to monitor a great number of places at the same time. Measurements have been carried out in the speleological and archaeological site of the Toirano’s Caves (Savona, Liguria, Italy) and several points were monitored for two years. Radon concentration strongly depends on the site and changes during the year, due to the difference between internal and external temperature. The maximum <b>dose</b> <b>commitment</b> during the visitors tour, considering the average yearly value of radon concentration, was found to be between 1. 5 and 4 Sv.

The two sets of numbers show reasonable agreement; the larger are adopted for use in estimating adverse effects. The contribution of the French and Chinese weapons tests relative to that from all tests is derived by inspection and extrapolation where necessary of data on the injection of strontium- 90 into {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres and its subsequent deposition as a function of time. The risk data reviewed and summarised in the 1972 UNSCEAR and BEIR reports are used to derive estimates of adverse effects.

The assessment includes an {{appraisal of the}} state of the retention and disposal options, an estimate of the <b>dose</b> <b>commitments</b> to the general public, an estimation of the incremental costs of the several retention and disposal options, and the potential reduction of the <b>dose</b> <b>commitments</b> resulting from retention and disposal of the tritium. The assessment is based upon an extensive study of tritium retention in reprocessing completed in 1982 by Grimes et al. Two plants were assumed, one to process LWR oxide fuel and the other to process LMFBR fuel. In each base case plant the tritium was vaporized to the atmosphere. Each of the hypothetical plants was assumed to be constructed during the 1990 `s and to operate for a 20 -year lifetime beginning in the year 2000 at a rate of 1, 500 metric tons of heavy metal (MTHM) per 300 -d year. In addition to the base case (Case 1), six other cases which included tritium retention options were examined. Although many of the features of the base-case plants remain unchanged in the tritium retention options, each case requires some additions, deletions, and modifications of portions of the plants. The retained tritium must also be managed and disposed of in a manner that is environmentally acceptable...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the worst-case case <b>dose</b> <b>commitments</b> and potential consequences of accidental releases at nuclear risk sites in the Russian Far East. The nuclear risk sites of concern are near Petropavlovsk (52055 'N & 158030 'E) and Vladivostok (42055 'N & 132025 'E). The region of interest includes the territories of the Russian Far East, China, Japan, North and South Korea, State of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Mongolia, Burma, Hong Kong, Laos, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. The transboundary region (i. e., that outside of Russia) is of primary interest because the largest doses resulting from hypothetical releases from these sites would reside in Russia and would be examined using site specific information and detailed models that were unavailable for this study. However, the transboundary region can be examined, in general, using existing information and models. The The methodology from the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) 1993 Report was used in this study to estimate effective <b>dose</b> <b>commitments.</b> It is recognized that this methodology is not the only acceptable manner to estimate such doses; the methodology was selected because it is independent, defensible, and, because it is based upon a multiplicative model, lends itself to a facile examination of parameter variation. The research tool used to generate the deposition data used as the basis of this study was a long-range transport model - the Danish Emergency Response Model of the Atmosphere (DERMA) which was used to simulate the 5 -d atmospheric transport, dispersion and deposition of Cs- 137 for a one-day release at a rate of 10 Bq s- 1 for a total "unit hypothetical release" of 8. 64 x 10 14 Bq. The meteorological data from the European Center for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF, Reading, UK) based on the ECMWF global model forecast and analysis were used as input data for the model simulation.

Generally such activities include all steps in the nuclear fuel cycle (for power generation) and non-fuel cycle activities.

An overall waste management scheme consists of the following steps: segregation, minimization, treatment, conditioning, storage, transport, and disposal. To achieve a satisfactory overall management strategy, all steps have to be complementary and compatible.

Consequently, {{it is important to}} understand the long-term fate of 14 C in the marine environment. Research undertaken in 2000 suggested that the carbonate component of Northeast Irish Sea sediments would increase in 14 C activity as mollusc shells, which have become enriched in Sellafield-derived 14 C, are broken down by physical processes including wave action and incorporated into intertidal and sub-tidal sediments. The current study, undertaken in 2011, tested this hypothesis. The results demonstrate significant increases in 14 C enrichments found in whole mussel shells compared to those measured in 2000. Additionally, in 2000, there was an enrichment above ambient background within only the largest size fraction (> 500 μm) of the intertidal inorganic sediment at Nethertown and Flimby (north of Sellafield).

Initial deposition of 238 PuO 2 in the respiratory tract {{was followed by}} translocation of {{a portion of the}} 238 Pu to the liver and skeleton, which resulted in a large <b>dose</b> <b>commitment</b> and tumor risk to all three tissues. In a population of 144 dogs exposed to 238 PuO 2, 112 dogs died or were killed 4000 days after 238 Pu exposure, 100 dogs had osteosarcoma, and 28 dogs had lung cancers. At increasing times after exposure, however, liver lesions have become more pronounced. Ten primary liver tumors in nine animals were diagnosed in the dogs dying before 4000 days after exposure. An additional five primary liver tumors in three dogs occurred in 9 animals killed after 4000 days after exposure. The majority of these tumors have been fibrosarcomas. The liver tumors were usually not the cause of death, and rarely metastasized. The occurrence of liver tumors in this study indicates that 238 Pu is an effective hepatic carcinogen. Liver carcinogenesis is assuming an increasing importance in this study at late times after inhalation exposure.

40|$|Plutonium removal factors (RF) {{averaged}} 14 +- 10 {{during a}} study of the effectiveness of three drinking-water treatment plants for removing Pu from Savannah River water. Plutonium concentrations between 0. 1 and 3. 5 femtocurie/l were measured in raw and finished water samples. From 50 to 10, 000 liter samples of water were concentrated by ion exchange techniques and processed to determine the concentrations of $sup 239 $Pu and $sup 240 $Pu and to derive Pu RF's. The similarity between RF's observed for both Pu and suspended solids suggests a colloidal behavior for Pu. Plutonium RF's may be limited by low-level buildup on the treatment facility filters and subsequent bleeding into finished water, and thus may be higher during abnormal Pu releases to the environment. Flocculation and filtration appear to be the primary factors in the water treatment process contributing to Pu removal. The similarity between the plutonium contents of finished water from treatment facilities upstream and downstream of the Savannah River Plant (SRP) indicates that there is no measurable dose-to-man from SRP Pu releases in the water.

The different waste streams have been identified from the present industrial practices used in the production of nuclear grade thorium from monazite extracted from beach sands. The radionuclides of utmost importance in various waste streams are /sup 232 /Th, /sup 228 /Ra, and /sup 220 /Rn from the thorium series and /sup 238 /U, /sup 230 /Th, /sup 226 /Ra, and /sup 222 /Rn from the uranium series. There are three important steps, where the major radioactivity is generated. It is found that the total amount of solid wastes generated for the production of 1 t of thorium metal is ~ 10 t, which is ~ 50 times less than in the case of 1 t of uranium production. Among them, long-lived wastes represent a small volume and could be disposed of in a deep geological repository, as for alpha-active reprocessing wastes. The raw materials at the mining site are lower by one to two orders of magnitude in the general case of high-grade thorium ore in comparison to the present commercially exploited uranium ore. The short- and long-term impact of these wastes on the environment and radiotoxicity has been calculated. It has been found that the short- and long-term impact for the public is about two orders of magnitude lower than for the equivalent front-end uranium cycles.

Conditions were chosen that would maximize exposure to the $sup 239 $Pu in the sludge through resuspension and in plant content and thus approximated the maximum potential hazards due to the inhalation and ingestion pathways. The estimated 50 -year radiation doses to the pulmonary region of the lung, bone, and liver based on the results of the inhalation experiment are 6 x 10 $sup - 4 $ rem, 1. 2 x 10 $sup - 3 $ rem, and 0. 55 x 10 $sup - 4 $ rem, respectively. Similarly, the 50 - year radiation doses attributable to ingestion of the sludge-grown vegetables were 2. 2 x 10 $sup - 5 $ rem to the bone and 1. 5 x 10 $sup - 5 $ rem to the liver. Thus, the inhalation pathway is the more critical of the two. The maximum permissible annual doses to the lungs, bone, and the liver for a member of the general public are 1. 5, 3. 0, and 1. 5 rem, respectively. Thus, the maximum credible 50 -year lung, bone, and liver <b>dose</b> <b>commitments</b> {{associated with the use of}} the $sup 239 $Pu-contaminated sludge as a soil conditioner are approximately 4. 0 x 10 $sup - 2 $ percent of the annual maximum permissible dose.

Further investigations have shown that, contrary to expectations, no linear correlation can be observed between soil contamination and measured area dose rate. As a contribution towards clarifying these issues, the area dose rate and the soil contamination including the plant fraction were investigated in the Korma district, Belarus. It was found that it is necessary to cover and average over larger areas in order to determine from ground contamination the long-term development of the external <b>dose</b> <b>commitment.</b> This means that for this purpose the introduction of an "effective" surface contamination (sum of mineral and organic contamination components) is necessary. The phenomena observed are described in a model, which permits an analytical calculation of the contamination profile in soil taking migration and transfer effects into account. The differences observed between the measured soil contamination and the resulting external doses or the directly measured dose rate can be explained by the proposed model. Moreover, their long-term development can be calculated.

Nine commonly available vegetation species of Kaiga region were analyzed for their 137 Cs activity, and the soil-to-plant transfer coefficients were evaluated. Measurements were made by gamma spectrometry method employing a 90 cc HpGe detector and a 3 � 3 -inch well type NaI(Tl) detector. Results show significant levels of 137 Cs activity in soil samples—ranging from below detection limit (BDL) to 65. 4 Bq kg� 1. The mean value of activity observed in 0 – 5 cm soil profiles of Kaiga environs is significantly higher when compared to the reported values for other environs of India. Depth profile studies show that the 137 Cs activity decreases with the increasing soil depth, and it is below detection limit for depths more than 25 cm. The mean value of effective <b>dose</b> <b>commitment</b> due to the presence of 137 Cs in soil was 167. 2 �Sv. Vegetation samples of the region show elevated levels of 137 Cs concentration. Epiphytic plants Cymbidium aloifolium (Lo.) Swartz. and Petrobryopsis tumida (Hook.) Dix. have been identified as bio-indicators to monitor the fallout of this radionuclide in the environment of Kaiga. Seasonal variation studies indicate higher fallout of this radionuclide along with rain...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to give an {{overview}} of past nuclear testing and draw some conclusions regarding its potential implications on public health. The introduction presents all kinds of nuclear tests, the history of nuclear testing with respect to particular countries, provides {{the description of the}} kinds of ionizing radiation and protection against it as well as the biological effects of ionizing radiation on tissue. There is a part devoted to international treaties in this field ? The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, The Threshold Test Ban Treaty and The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The summary of the number, the yield and the geographical distribution of the past atmospheric nuclear tests follows. There is an explanation of the global fallout mechanism of the radionuclides released, the estimates of emitted doses and the relationship between these doses and their probability of inducing cancer in the human body. The objective of this work is to make an assessment of the contribution of doses originating from nuclear testing to total population doses (irradiation) and subsequently quantify health implications for the population. The method of achieving this is based on calculating theoretical estimation of cancer incidence from known effective <b>doses</b> <b>commitments</b> and in comparison with those real incidences raised by all the different sources and reasons in world areas chosen, derived from the statistical data gathered from scientific studies and publications of international organizations involved. The outcome of this work is the confirmation of the first hypothesis that nuclear testing has statistic impact on enhancing the frequency of cancer disorders on the world population; however this is relatively small with respect to the other sources of radiation and a rate of naturally spontaneous (non-radiation-induced) cancer occurrence. Also the second hypothesis that underground nuclear tests have significantly smaller influence on public health and environment quality than the other kinds of nuclear tests is acknowledged...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of Task 7. lD was to (1) establish a collaborative US-USSR {{effort to improve}} and validate our methods of forecasting <b>doses</b> and <b>dose</b> <b>commitments</b> from the direct contamination of food sources, and (2) perform experiments and validation studies to improve our ability to predict rapidly and accurately the long-term internal dose from the contamination of agricultural soil. At early times following an accident, the direct contamination of pasture and food stuffs, particularly leafy vegetation and grain, can be of great importance. This situation has been modeled extensively. However, models employed then to predict the deposition, retention and transport of radionuclides in terrestrial environments employed concepts and data bases that {{were more than a}} decade old. The extent to which these models have been tested with independent data sets was limited. The data gathered in the former-USSR (and elsewhere throughout the Northern Hemisphere) offered a unique opportunity to test model predictions of wet and dry deposition, agricultural foodchain bioaccumulation, and short- and long-term retention, redistribution, and resuspension of radionuclides from a variety of natural and artificial surfaces. The current {{objective of}} this project is to evaluate and validate pathway-assessment models applicable to exposure and dose reconstruction at DOE facilities through use of international data sets. This project incorporates the activity of Task 7. lD into a multinational effort to evaluate models and data used for the prediction of radionuclide transfer through agricultural and aquatic systems to humans. It also includes participation in two studies, BIOMOVS (BIOspheric MOdel Validation Study) with the Swedish National Institute for Radiation Protection and VAMP (VAlidation of Model Predictions) with the International Atomic Energy Agency, that address testing the performance of models of radionuclide transport through foodchains...|$|R
40|$|Hunters {{and their}} {{families}} {{were one of the}} most exposed subpopulations in Sweden after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in 1986. In this pilot study we used existing registries and whole-body measurements to develop algorithms to calculate lifetime effective doses and collective doses to some hunters in Sweden. Ten hunters and their family members were randomly selected from each of the three most contaminated counties in Sweden (Västernorrland, Uppsala, Gävleborg) using the register for hunting weapons from the Police Authority in 1985. Hence, this design can be regarded as a closed cohort only including hunters and their family members living in these three counties {{at the time of the}} accident. Statistics Sweden matched these individuals (n = 85) with their dwelling coordinates onto the digital map produced by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority after aerial measurements of 137 Cs (kBq m− 2). Internal effective doses were estimated using aggregated transfer factors from ground deposition to in-vivo body concentration for 134 Cs and 137 Cs in hunters (Bq kg− 1). External effective doses were also calculated on the dwelling coordinate for 134 Cs, 137 Cs and short-lived nuclides in these three counties. Annual effective doses for external and internal doses were then cumulated up to a life expectancy of 80 years for men and 84 years for women, respectively. The total lifetime effective doses to the members of the hunter families in this cohort were on average 8. 3 mSv in Västernorrland, 4. 7 mSv in Uppsala and 4. 1 mSv in Gävleborg. The effective dose to men were about 40 % higher than in women. In all counties the internal dose was about 75 % of the total lifetime effective dose. The collective dose for all hunters with family members, in total about 44, 000 individuals, in these three counties could be approximated at about 256 manSv. This study shows it is possible to use register data to develop algorithms for calculating lifetime effective <b>dose</b> <b>commitments</b> for hunters with relatively accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this report gives a short {{description}} of the different basic types of nuclear weapon and lists Chinese weapons tests in the northern hemisphere and French weapons tests in the South Pacific by date, together with an indication of the power of each device where such information is available. The second section of the report discusses the measurement of radiation and what dose units are appropriate for assessment of the significance of fallout exposure to man, and outlines the background of natural and man-made radiation to which man is inevitably subject. The principal biological effects of radiation are then identified {{and the nature of the}} relationship between radiation dose and the incidence of effects is examined. Conventional radiation protection philosophy assures a linear relationship between dose and effect, which is independent of dose rate, On this assumption it is possible to derive, from the limited high-dose data available, risk coefficients for radiation effects which may be used to calculate the incidence of harmful effects from the low radiation doses relevant to fallout studies. The difficulties and inaccuracies inherent in this extrapolation mean that estimates made in this way are essentially of the upper limits of possible damage, not the most likely value which may often be zero. The final section assesses the magnitude of fallout in Australia from the French and Chinese series of tests and expresses this in the form of dose commitments to man; the <b>dose</b> <b>commitment</b> for any radionuclide being the dose received to date plus the dose to be received in the future from residual long-lived activity already incorporated in the body and remaining in the environment. From these dose commitments, using generally accepted risk coefficients, estimates of the upper limits of the magnitude of the harmful effects, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis, which may be attributed to fallout from the respective series have been derived for the Australian population...|$|E
40|$|The {{measuring}} programme {{was supported by}} the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety, and was carried out from 1991 through 1993 in the three neighbouring countries affected, Russia, Belarus, and the Ukraine. The results obtained in the first year {{made it clear that the}} external radiation dose to the population in the area was an item to be followed up in subsequent measuring campaigns. In response to the results and experience obtained in 1992, the 1993 measuring campaign focused on the following tasks: information of the population about the continuing radiation risk and the <b>dose</b> <b>commitment,</b> in an effort to reach as many people as possible; adjustment of and better information about the overall time periods, periods of the week and daily activities determined for personal dosemeters to be carried by the population, in order to improve measuring conditions so as to obtain representative results; measurement of both ambient dose in homes and personal doses; determination of time-dependent changes in external radiation doses. The measured data of the 1993 campaign require sophisticated statistical evaluation and interpretation in order to derive the values and representative results aimed at. (orig. /MG) Im Jahre 1991 - 1993 wurde mit Unterstuetzung des Bundesministers fuer Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit ein grossangelegtes Messprogramm in Russland, Weissrussland und der Ukraine durchgefuehrt. Bei etwa 300000 Personen wurde die Cs- 137 Inkorporation gemessen. Die Erfahrungen im Jahre 1991 machen klar, dass die externe Strahlenexposition der betroffenen Bevoelkerung nicht unberuecksichtigt bleiben darf. Deswegen wurde das Messprogramm im Jahr 1992 durch das Teilprogramm 'Messung der aeusseren Strahlenbelastung' ergaenzt. Unter Beruecksichtigung der Ergebnisse und Erfahrungen des Jahres 1992 hatte die Messkampagne 1993 folgende Schwerpunkte: Moeglichst viele Menschen genau ueber ihre aeussere Strahlenbelastung zu informieren, die Tragezeit des Personendosimeters fuer die Ermittlung der aeusseren Strahlenbelastung geeigneter festzulegen, die Ortsdosis in der Wohnung gleichzeitig mit der Personendosis zu bestimmen sowie die zeitliche Aenderung der aeusseren Strahlenbelastung zu erfassen. Um diese Ziele zu erreichen, ist eine vielseitige statische Auswertung der Messdaten und Interpretation der Ergebnisse von 1993 erforderlich.

40|$|The {{nuclear energy}} {{industry}} produces radioactive waste {{at various stages}} of the fuel cycle. In the United Kingdom, spent fuel is reprocessed at the Sellafield facility (formerly known as Windscale), in Cumbria on the north-west coast of England. Waste generated at the site comprises {{a wide range of}} radionuclides, including radiocarbon (14 C) which, due to its long half-life (5730 years), environmental mobility and high bio-availability, is the largest contributor to collective <b>dose</b> <b>commitment</b> from the entire nuclear industry. 14 C is disposed of in various forms, one of which is as highly soluble inorganic carbon within the low-level liquid radioactive effluent, via pipelines, into the Irish Sea. The discharged 14 C is then rapidly incorporated into the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool. This project aimed to better understand the fate of Sellafield discharges of 14 C to the marine environment. Investigations of intertidal sites in the Irish Sea and West of Scotland found 14 C enrichment above ambient background levels in shell material, including at the most northerly site, located 265 km north of Sellafield. Dissolved inorganic 14 C is readily utilised during shell formation by calcifying organisms and mussel shell 14 C activities at sites closer to Sellafield appear to be varying in response to the total Sellafield 14 C discharge activity over the preceding 5 years. Due to subsequent erosion of this material, 14 C is transferred to finer fractions of intertidal sediments where it is accumulating. During photosynthesis, primary producing organisms also utilise carbon derived from the DIC pool. This uptake and the trophic-level transfer of 14 C within the Irish Sea and West of Scotland marine environments were examined. The 14 C activities of Irish Sea DIC and biota in the east and west basins were enriched and highly variable. A general decrease in 14 C activity with distance from Sellafield was observed, although, enriched activities were also found in the West of Scotland where the activities were more homogenous. Organic sediments were significantly less enhanced than associated benthic organisms. This could be due to rapid scavenging of labile, 14 C-enriched organic material by organisms and mixing to depth with older, 14 C depleted material. Commercially important species were 14 C enriched; however, the radiation dose from their consumption is extremely low and radiologically insignificant. To evaluate the transfer of 14 C to top predators in the UK marine environment, 14 C activities were examined in stranded marine mammals. All Irish Sea samples were enriched, as were most from the West of Scotland, although the 14 C activities were lower. In demonstrating transfer of enriched 14 C to apex predators for the first time, this study also showed that marine mammal activities correlated significantly with distance from Sellafield and Sellafield 14 C discharge activities for 24 months prior to stranding. These measurements also provided some insight into harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) ecology, indicating high foraging fidelity and suggesting the animals stranded on the West of Scotland did not forage in the Irish Sea. The studies in this thesis examined the dispersion of Sellafield-derived 14 C to both near- and far-field sites and the subsequent ecosystem uptake and trophic transfer at these locations. However, it is important to attempt to understand the fate of 14 C discharges beyond the limitations and scope of analytical investigations. To do so, the first spatial-temporal ecosystem model to predict the ecological fate of Sellafield-derived 14 C was developed. The observed trends in 14 C activities between different species were predicted by the model which illustrated the integration of 14 C in species at higher trophic levels through time...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{attempts}} to highlight {{some of the}} characteristics of present-day literary criticism in Spain: its social invisibility and public inoperability, the measured tone (rather muttered and descriptive), the absence of a strong <b>dose</b> of moral <b>commitment</b> {{on the part of the}} critics. It seems to be a profession closer to the supplying of information than to the debate of ideas and positions, and possibly the same can be said of contemporary essayists. The uncertain professionalization of this field may be behind these characteristics inasmuch as it blurs the line between the personality of the critic and his or her more strictly journalistic function...|$|R
40|$|Five {{areas of}} {{potential}} accidents {{have been evaluated}} for the Argonaut-UTR reactors. They are: • insertion of excess reactivity • catastrophic rearrangement of the core • explosive chemical reaction • graphite fire • fuel-handling accident. A nuclear excursion resulting from the rapid insertion of the maximum available excess reactivity would produce only 12 MWs which is insufficient to cause fuel melting even with conservative assumptions. Although precise structural rearrangement of the core would create a potential hazard, {{it is simply not}} credible to assume that such an arrangement would result from the forces of an earthquake or other catastrophic event. Even damage to the fuel from falling debris or other objects is unlikely given the normal reactor structure. An explosion from a metal-water reaction could not occur because there is no credible source of sufficient energy to initiate the reaction. A graphite fire could conceivably create some damage to the reactor but not enough to melt any fuel or initiate a metal-water reaction. The only credible accident involving offsite doses was determined to be a fuel-handling accident which, given highly conservative assumptions, would produce a whole-body dose equivalent of 2 rem from noble gas immersion and a lifetime <b>dose</b> equivalent <b>commitment</b> to the thyroid of 43 rem from radioiodines...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} interrogates a {{large population}} of shareholders, senior managers and company directors in New Zealand as to their reasons for considering board service, their competence in governance skills areas, their beliefs as to whether board room diversity is needed and their firms’ interests to recruit further independent directors to their boards. With a considerable deference to the contributions of agency theory as the conventional cornerstone to explain the connection of directors into organizations {{for the purpose of}} governance service, this work explores the extension of agency theory by adding an additional driver for governance engagement by company directors: Commitment. Based on this research, company directors in New Zealand appear to base their interest in serving as independent directors on company boards largely on the desire to “do good”. This raises the prospect of a deeper and more meaningful relationship with firms where they serve as directors. Ignorance of this important component of the director/firm relationship by the firms might render directors less willing to contribute and deprive firms of the strong support and engagement of their directors. Lack of recognition of this additional component to the fabric of an enduring committed relationship between external directors and their firms may require a different behavior of firms during the recruitment, board induction training and maintenance of the director relationship. While the strong expression of interest by SMEs in additional independent directors is a welcome sign of rising governance standards in New Zealand’s large group of such enterprises, concern emerges about the potential lack of competence by directors in several areas of governance. While directors appear to compensate for deficiencies in skills with an extra <b>dose</b> of <b>commitment,</b> significant needs for upskilling exists in this sector. It is noted that the absence of well-established, easily accessible and comprehensive director training schemes in New Zealand conflicts with the expected large number of additional independent director recruitments in the near future. Shareholders, senior managers and directors report a need for diversity on boards in the area of business experience, but no specific concern is expressed as to how any specific importance of gender or age while other factors, such as work experience and global knowledge, are of much greater interest. This could indicate that the status quo of {{only a small number of}} women on boards in New Zealand is accepted, but in the context of this work more likely indicates that directors will not be recruited (or excluded from recruitment) in the future on the basis of gender. This research attempts to lay groundwork for a more intensive investigation into the true motivations of company directors when they think of an independent director mandate and while they discharge directorship duties. There now appears to be solid evidence that the historic application of agency theory does not completely describe the factors of motivation and relationship under which independent directors serve on company boards...|$|R
