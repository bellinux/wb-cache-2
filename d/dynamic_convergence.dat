Design/Methodology - The empirical evidence is premised on 11 homogenous panels based on regions (Sub-Saharan and North Africa), income-levels (low, middle, lower-middle and upper-middle), legal-origins (English common-law and French civil-law) and religious dominations (Christianity and Islam). We examine convergence in financial intermediary dynamics of depth, efficiency, activity and size. Findings - Findings suggest that countries with small-sized financial intermediary depth, efficiency, activity and size are catching-up countries with large-sized financial intermediary depth, efficiency, activity and size respectively. We also provide the speeds of convergence and time {{necessary to achieve}} a full (100 %) convergence. Practical implications - The presence of strong links among African banking sectors may present little opportunity for portfolio diversification. The convergence patterns show positive steps towards regional integration. As a policy implication, African governments should not relent in structural and institutional reforms. Originality/value - It is the first critical assessment of convergence in financial intermediary development dynamics in the African continent...|$|R

Implementing these models with administrative data for California, the authors find that the welfare caseload has considerable momentum and that adjustments are far from instantaneous. In addition, the authors find that changes in the entry rate are empirically more important than changes in the exit rate for explaining changes in the overall caseload.

Stochastic convergence, which indicates convergence of regions in the long-run, is tested using Levin, Lin & Chu (LLC) and Im, Pesaran & Shin (IPS) panel unit root tests. The presence of convergence, on one hand, indicates that the economically laggard regions are gaining on the economically better-performing regions with respect to per capita GRDP. On the other hand, the lack of convergence indicates a need to reevaluate existing regional and national economic policies on development. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>convergence</b> reveals several convergence characteristics of individual regions over time. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>convergence</b> {{is determined by the}} time-varying parameter (TVP) model derived using the Kalman Filter.

It is shown that a sequence of Ehrenfest processes with appropriate scaling and shifting converges in law to the O-U process. Accordingly, first passage times and the historical maximum of the Ehrenfest process converge in law to those of the O-U process. Through analysis of the spectral structure of the Ehrenfest process, efficient numericalalgorithms are developed, thereby providing effective approximation tools for capturing the dynamic behavior of the O-U process.

Swarm Intelligence (SI) is an {{innovative}} distributed intelligent paradigm whereby the collective behaviors of unsophisticated individuals interacting locally with their environment causing coherent functional global patterns to emerge.
