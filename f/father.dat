Apollo takes the paternity test, but the <b>father</b> doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that {{he actually}} was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his <b>father</b> was genuinely loving. The only reason the <b>father</b> did not show up to the paternity test was that he was detained for having the wrong license plates.

40|$|Existing {{literature}} {{on the experience of}} fatherhood in Black South African <b>fathers</b> is limited and commonly portrays <b>fathers</b> in a negative light. Scholarship and media representations tend to focus on the increasing number of absent <b>fathers</b> and the lack of parental care given by Black South African <b>fathers.</b> This study explores the perspectives of ‘new generation’ South African <b>fathers</b> on fatherhood. Eight Black South African <b>fathers</b> participated in semi-structured interviews focused on their experiences of fatherhood. Interviews were subjected to thematic content analysis. The primary theme to emerge from the analysis concerned the ways in which <b>fathers</b> spoke of themselves as ‘new generation’ <b>fathers</b> in contrast to old generation fatherhood. Three distinct yet interrelated themes are presented, examining the ways in which <b>fathers</b> described themselves as ‘new generation’; how gender was incorporated into ‘new’ and ‘old’ generation distinctions; and how their own <b>fathers</b> influenced participants’ perspectives of fatherhood. Findings suggest tensions between ‘new’ and ‘old’ generation ideals of <b>fathering,</b> but also strong investment in new generation <b>fathering.</b> These ‘new generation’ <b>fathers</b> represented a unique practice of non-hegemonic fatherhood, a resistant fatherhood, which opposes the negative stereotypes they are faced with...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{examined}} the socio-demographic characteristics and attitudes of primary care giving <b>fathers</b> and non-primary care giving <b>fathers</b> {{and the quality of}} their interaction with their infants. METHOD: Two groups of <b>fathers</b> of 11. 9 -month old infants were compared - 25 primary care giving <b>fathers</b> (20 h per week or more of sole infant care) and 75 non-primary care giving <b>fathers</b> - with regard to socio-demographic characteristics, attitudinal differences and father-infant interaction during play and mealtimes. The quality of father-child interaction in relation to the total number of hours of primary care provided by <b>fathers</b> was also examined. RESULTS: Primary care giving <b>fathers</b> had lower occupational status and earned a smaller proportion of the family income but did not differ in educational level or attitudes compared with non-primary care giving <b>fathers.</b> There were no differences between the partners of the two groups of <b>fathers</b> on any variables, and their infants did not differ in temperament. Primary care giving <b>fathers</b> and their infants exhibited more positive emotional tone during play than non-primary care giving <b>fathers,</b> although <b>fathers</b> did not differ in responsivity. There were no differences between the groups during mealtimes. There was a positive association between total number of child care hours provided by all <b>fathers</b> and infant positive emotional tone. CONCLUSIONS: Primary and non-primary care giving <b>fathers</b> were similar in many respects, but primary care giving <b>fathers</b> and their infants were happier during play. This suggests a possible link between the involvement of <b>fathers</b> in the care of their children and their children's emotional state. The finding of a trend towards increased paternal happiness with increased hours of child care suggests that there may also be a gain for <b>fathers</b> who are more involved in the care of their infants. Further {{research is needed to determine}} whether these differences ultimately have an effect on children's development...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fathers,</b> <b>fathering</b> and {{fatherhood}} {{have been}} the subjects of much contemporary debate and investigation. The study’s aims and research questions were informed by the existing body of fatherhood research which has been, predominantly, constructed and undertaken in relation to an ‘unproblematic norm’ of fatherhood, {{in which it is}} presumed that ‘good fatherhood’ is experienced. This study, therefore, sought to explore – through a series of ten case studies – <b>fathers,</b> everyday <b>fathering</b> and notions of ‘good fatherhood’ within ‘normative’ contexts. In doing so, the study took a relational approach, drawing on the perspectives of <b>fathers,</b> mothers and children in recognition of the potential of each family member to deepen and broaden understandings of <b>fathers,</b> <b>fathering</b> and fatherhood. Findings highlight the common and divergent ways in which <b>fathers</b> and <b>fathering</b> were understood, experienced and ‘done’ both within and between families, and over time and space. The multiple meanings and concepts which are entangled with <b>fathering</b> practices were also revealed. The study has further shown that ‘family display’ is a useful tool for exploring the nuances of contemporary notions of ‘good fatherhood’. Using the lens of ‘family display’, the value placed upon ‘intimate fatherhood’ by <b>fathers,</b> mothers and children in normative contexts was demonstrated. This study has also contributed new and nuanced understandings to existing work on ‘intimate fatherhood’ by showing that intimate <b>fathering</b> practices are those which can be claimed as <b>fathering</b> (rather than parenting more generally) and are characterised by communication and mutuality between <b>fathers</b> and children. Through such intimate <b>fathering</b> practices, family members felt that <b>fathers</b> and children were able to nurture and sustain close relationships. ...|$|R
