In particular, over a period of 4 weeks, we manually investigate, in coordination with the IT department of our university, 200 security incidents about compromised hosts detected by an IDS alert correlator. The security investigation combines data from four security sources: (1) Snort alerts, (2) reports from four scanning and vulnerability assessment tools, (3) five independent blacklists, and (4) a search engine (Google).|$|R

40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} unprecedented {{criticism of the}} forensic sciences from academic commentators and authoritative scientific and technical organizations. Simultaneously, podiatrists have begun to promote themselves as forensic scientists, capable of assisting investigators and courts in their endeavors to identify offenders. This article traces the emergence of forensic podiatry, particularly <b>forensic</b> gait <b>analysis.</b> <b>Forensic</b> gait <b>analysis</b> is a practice that involves comparing persons of interest in crime-related images (such as CCTV and surveillance recordings) with reference images of suspects, where the primary focus is on movement and posture. It tends to be applied when other techniques, such as the comparison of facial and body features, are constrained because of disguises (e. g., the use of balaclavas) or the low quality of the images. This article endeavors to explain how forensic podiatry came into being, shed light on forensic field formation, make {{an assessment of the}} knowledge base underpinning <b>forensic</b> gait <b>analysis,</b> and reflect on what the legal recognition of <b>forensic</b> gait <b>analysis</b> reveals about the ability of common law courts to regulate expertise...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Passive <b>forensics</b> <b>analysis</b> aims to {{find out}} how {{multimedia}} data is acquired and processed without relying on pre-embedded or preregistered information. Since most existing compression schemes for digital images are based on block processing, one of the fundamental steps for subsequent <b>forensics</b> <b>analysis</b> is to detect the presence of block artifacts and estimate the block size for a given image. In this paper, we propose a novel method for blind block size estimation. A 2 × 2 cross-differential filter is first applied to detect all possible block artifact boundaries, morphological operations are then used to remove the boundary effects caused by the edges of the actual image contents, and finally maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is employed to estimate the block size. The experimental results evaluated on over 1300 nature images show the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared with existing gradient-based detection method, our method achieves over 39 % accuracy improvement on average...|$|R
