40|$|The present {{article has}} as its aim to {{illustrate}} and discuss the impacts of individualization strategies on equity educational policies through the analysis of individualized teaching strategies applied {{within the framework of}} <b>educational</b> <b>priority</b> <b>policies</b> in Sweden. The methodology used in our research work includes: (a) the study of research literature about the individualization of teaching implemented in the Swedish comprehensive compulsory school; and (b) the study of research literature about <b>educational</b> <b>priority</b> <b>policies</b> aimed at children from socially and ethnically segregated areas. Comparative research of educational policies considers the individualization of teaching carried out in the Swedish comprehensive compulsory school as a relevant explanation for the successful application of equitable educational policies in that country. However, research studies published during the 2000 s in Sweden show a more complex perspective regarding the effects of individualized teaching strategies. This contribution reviews European comparative research studies on individualization strategies followed in the context of equity policies. It raises questions about the lack of analyses referring to the impacts of individualization on schools located in socially and ethnically segregated areas. It argues that this ideology tends to reduce the issue of school failure to ethnic segregation and individualized teacher support. This article claims that Individualization strategies based on differentiated curricula for students run the risk of increasing the discrimination of students for reasons of language or ethnic background. Even though the present study focuses on the Swedish experience, it can lead {{to a better understanding of}} the impacts caused by individualization strategies on equity in other European countries. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Teachers are a {{key part}} of the wider public health {{workforce}} in England. We conducted a survey to find out how they are trained for this role during their initial teacher education (ITE). Methods: Between 2011 and 2012, we sent an online questionnaire to 220 ITE course managers and conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 19 course managers to explore issues in more depth. Results: The response rate to the questionnaire was 34 % (n = 74). Although most of the course managers felt inclusion of health and well-being training in ITE was important, provision across courses was variable. Topics which are public health priorities [e. g. sex and relationships education (SRE) and drugs, alcohol and tobacco] were covered by fewer courses than other topics (e. g. child protection, emotional health and anti-bullying). Perceived barriers to training included lack of time and a belief that health and well-being were low <b>priorities</b> in <b>educational</b> <b>policy.</b> Conclusions: Not all of tomorrow's teachers are being adequately prepared for their role in helping to address public health <b>priorities.</b> <b>Educational</b> <b>policy</b> does not appear to be supporting the priorities of public health policy, and this is a key barrier to health promotion training in ITE...|$|R
40|$|Original title: Gemeentelijke onderwijsachterstandenbeleid. The {{introduction}} in the Netherlands of the Municipal Compensatory Policy (Education) Act on 1 August 1998 {{made the}} former <b>educational</b> <b>priority</b> <b>policy</b> a responsibility of local authorities. The intention {{is that the}} educational compensatory policy should be developed and implemented at local level {{in the coming years}} in collaboration with school boards. The predominant argument for the decentralisation of the educational compensatory policy is that combating educational disadvantage requires a customised approach. The municipal compensatory policy lays the basis for this customised approach. The ultimate aim is that all school pupils, including those from socially disadvantaged groups, should be able to develop their talents to the full. The Netherlands Institute for Social Research/SCP was commissioned by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science to carry out a study of the policy process driving the municipal educational disadvantage policy. This study provides an impression of how the policy has been put into practice at local level. Based on a survey of local authorities, it presents an overview of the current status of the municipal educational compensatory policy, shortly after the new Act came into force. Information was gathered on the number of local authorities implementing an educational compensatory policy, the current phase of its implementation and the practical form given to the policy at local level. Based on the substantive choices made by local authorities and the administrative and organisational structure chosen, different policy types are identified. This substantive and administrative typology of the municipal educational compensatory policy forms {{the first part of the}} study...|$|E
40|$|Pupils who {{present with}} Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties (BESD) at school {{have been the}} focus of {{extensive}} study, research and reports for many years in England. These have focused on exploring the nature of BESD, contributing factors relating to school and the schools that have shown evidence of good practice when working with these pupils. This work has reflected the situation in the English education system. In Cyprus, however, answers to questions about how best to educate pupils who may demonstrate BESD remain elusive. In 2003, the Cypriot government approved a policy prioritising the education of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The policy instituted ‘Zones of Educational Priority programme’ as it is an area-based initiative. The schools joining this programme and working under the policy have been selected based on the areas in which they are located and the local populations’ socio-economic and educational status. Additionally, many of the pupils registered in these schools present with BESD. Despite this fact, up to the time the research described in this thesis was conducted; the issue of good practice when working with these pupils seems to have been neglected by Cypriot researchers and educational authorities. The study reported here was begun in 2008 and continued in 2009. It involved two primary schools operating under the Zones of <b>Educational</b> <b>Priority</b> <b>policy</b> in Cyprus and is a case study of what ‘good practice’ is perceived to be in relation to pupils with BESD. For the purposes of this research, 22 semi-structured interviews were carried out, as well as 29 lesson observations and informal conversations. The collected data was subjected to content analysis and the findings are reported and discussed in a way that allow the readers to draw their own conclusions concerning how the study has reinforced what is already known in the area of study as well as how it has contributed to building new knowledge. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of Groningen community schools on child behaviour problems and education at home. These Groningen community schools were first developed in 1995. Motives for the development of Groningen community schools were the lack of success of the <b>educational</b> <b>priority</b> <b>policy</b> that was executed until then, and some specific societal problems in the city of Groningen, such as a low average income level and high unemployment rates. Groningen community schools are expected to improve education and behaviour and to solve or at least diminish several educational and behavioural disadvantages. More generally, community schools should unburden teachers that have to deal with all kinds of problems their pupils could have, and community schools should provide several kinds of opportunities for all children and parents. These opportunities include methods to deal with or prevent child behaviour problems and programmes to stimulate education at home. To study the extent to which Groningen community schools indeed influence child behaviour problems and education at home, the following research questions were formulated: (1) which activities concerning child behaviour and education at home are offered by community schools?; (2) are parents and children involved in community schools?; (3) do community schools influence the behaviour of community school children?; and (4) do community schools influence the educational situation at home of community school children? To answer these questions, 74 parents of kindergarten children in four Groningen neighbourhoods (i. e. Hoogkerk, Vinkhuizen, Selwerd/Paddepoel/Tuinwijk (SPT) and Oosterpark) were annually interviewed concerning participation in community school activities, their child's behaviour and education at home. Furthermore, Kindergarten and first grade teachers annually assessed the socio-emotional behaviour of in total 180 pupils. Before going into {{the results of this study}} we will give a summary of the theoretical framework of this thesis. This theoretical framework concerns the concept community schools as well as the concepts child behaviour problems and education at home. ...|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{subsidies}} were allocated to local authorities faced with acute areas of severe poverty (or other social problems). The Housing Act 1969 provided local authorities with {{the duty of}} working {{out what to do}} about 'unsatisfactory areas'. Local authorities could declare 'general improvement areas' in which {{they would be able to}} buy up land and houses, and spend environmental improvement grants. On the same basis, taking geographical areas of need, a package was developed by the government which resembled a miniature poverty programme. In July 1967, the government decided to pour money into what the Plowden Committee defined as <b>Educational</b> <b>Priority</b> Areas, poverty-stricken areas where children were environmentally deprived. A number of poor inner-city areas were subsequently granted EPA status (despite concerns that Local Education Authorities would be unable to finance <b>Educational</b> <b>Priority</b> Areas).

In 2014, it {{is still one of}} the priorities of the Law for the Refoundation of the schools of the Republic.

Against this backdrop, several observation groups have been created to study the real activity of teachers in order to enable a better understanding of the evolution of the teaching profession in difficult contexts. Investigations into <b>priority</b> education <b>policy</b> undertaken in five lower secondary schools have enabled researchers to use objective and subjective indicators to account for the numerous prescriptions which regulate the work of the various members of the educational community as well as the processes of transformation of teaching methods needed to meet these prescriptions.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} policies for stochastic project scheduling with resource constraints, the linear preselective policies. They combine the benefits of two known classes of scheduling policies for stochastic and deterministic scheduling, viz. <b>priority</b> <b>policies</b> and preselective <b>policies.</b> <b>Priority</b> <b>policies</b> solve resource conflicts by means of a priority list (list scheduling). They have several computational benefits but suffer from the well-known Graham anomalies. On the other hand, preselective policies possess favorable properties such as continuity and monotonicity and thus avoid these anomalies, but computing optimal such policies requires excessive computation time. The new class of linear preselective policies is a subclass of the class of preselective <b>policies.</b> Like <b>priority</b> <b>policies,</b> linear preselective <b>policies</b> use <b>priority</b> lists for their definition.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{asymptotic}} optimal control of multi-class restless bandits. A restless bandit is a controllable stochastic process whose state evolution {{depends on whether}} or not the bandit is made active. Since finding the optimal control is typically intractable, we propose a class of <b>priority</b> <b>policies</b> that are proved to be asymptotically optimal under a global attractor property and a technical condition. We consider both a fixed population of bandits as well as a dynamic population where bandits can depart and arrive. As an example of a dynamic population of bandits, we analyze a multi-class M/M/S+M queue for which we show asymptotic optimality of an index policy. We combine fluid-scaling techniques with linear programming results to prove that when bandits are indexable, Whittle's index policy is included in our class of <b>priority</b> <b>policies.</b> We thereby generalize a result of Weber and Weiss (1990) about asymptotic optimality of Whittle's index policy to settings with (i) several classes of bandits, (ii) arrivals of new bandits, and (iii) multiple actions. Indexability of the bandits is not required for our results to hold. For non-indexable bandits we describe how to select <b>priority</b> <b>policies</b> from the class of asymptotically optimal policies and present numerical evidence that, outside the asymptotic regime, the performance of our proposed <b>priority</b> <b>policies</b> is nearly optimal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} real-time communica-tion with delay constraints. In earlier work {{it has been shown}} that a certain weighted-debt policy is feasibility-optimal in the sense that if any scheduling policy can satisfy the throughput-with-deadline requirements of all the clients, then the weighted-debt policy can do so. This raises the interesting question: Why is it that a periodwise static <b>priority</b> <b>policy</b> can satisfy any set of requirements that the more general class of history dependent policies can? We answer this by showing that the set of feasible timely-throughput vectors is a polymatroid. We do so by establishing a submodularity property of the complement of the unavoidable idle time function. This shows that a periodwise static <b>priority</b> <b>policy,</b> where the <b>priority</b> order is revised at the beginning of each period, but never in the middle of a period, can attain any feasible timely-throughput vector. We next go on to investigate a more general problem where the packet arrivals and channel conditions can vary over periods, and establish the existence of an optimal periodwise static <b>priority</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|R
