40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} an {{additional}} parameter in the Chebyshev polynomial is introduced {{so as to}} design an endfire array by controlling two factors of the radiation characteristics- namely the Half Power Beam Width(HPBW) and the side lobe level(SLL) simultaneously. It {{has been shown that}} for a given SLL improved HPBW and First Null Beam Width (FNBW) can be achieved. Individual elements in the array are assumed to be isotropic. Simulations were carried out to find bounds on the choice of HPBW and SLL. Simulation results also shows that the directivity can be improved over the <b>Dolph-Chebyshev</b> <b>array.</b> Improvement in the roll off characteristics are also shown. Implementation of the array using the coefficients obtained by this synthesized procedure can result in a highly directive array...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{piezoelectric}} wafer active sensors (PWAS) phased arrays for Lamb wave {{damage detection}} in thin-wall structures is presented. The PWAS capability to tune into specific Lamb-wave modes (which is an enabling factor for our approach) is first reviewed. Then, a generic beamforming formulation {{that does not}} require the conventional parallel-ray approximation is developed for PWAS phased arrays in connection with the delay-and-sum beamforming principles. This generic formulation is applied to a 1 -D linear PWAS phased array. Particularly, 1 -D PWAS array beamforming reduces to the simplified parallel ray algorithm when the parallel ray approximation is invoked. The embedded ultrasonic structural radar (EUSR) algorithm is presented. A couple of simple experiments are used to show that the linear EUSR PWAS phased array system can successfully detect cracks in large aluminum thin plates. To improve the EUSR image quality, advanced signal processing is studied for possible integration into the EUSR system. The approaches include Hilbert transform for envelope detection, thresholding techniques for removing background noise, discrete wavelet transform for denoising, continuous wavelet transform for single frequency component extraction, and cross-correlation for time-of-flight detection. The optimization of linear PWAS arrays is studied next. First we consider the effect of several pa-rameters affecting the phased-array beamforming: (1) number of elements M; (2) elementary spacing d; (3) steering angle φ 0; (4) location of the target r. Second, we examine the so-called nonuniform PWAS arrays which are generated by assigning different excitation weights to each of the array elements. The design of two nonuniform linear PWAS arrays, the binomial array and the <b>Dolph–Chebyshev</b> <b>array,</b> is presented. Significant improvement of the EUSR image is observed when using these nonuniform arrays. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of wireless communications increases the challenges on antenna performance {{to improve the}} capability of the whole system. New fabrication technologies are emerging that not only can improve the performance of components but also provide more options for materials and geometries. One of the advanced technologies, referred to as deep X-ray lithography (XRL), can improve the performance of RF components while providing interesting opportunities for fabrication. Since this fabrication technology enables the objects of high aspect ratio (tall) structure with high accuracy, it offers RF/microwave components some unique advantages, such as higher coupling energy and compacted size. The research presented in that thesis investigates the properties of deep XRL fabricated tall microstrip transmission line and describes some important features such as characteristic impedance, attenuation, and electromagnetic field distribution. Furthermore, since most of traditional feeding structure cannot supply enough coupling energy to excite the low permittivity DRA element (εr≤ 10), three novel feeding schemes composed by tall microstrip line on exciting dielectric resonator antennas (DRA) with low permittivity are proposed and analyzed in this research. Both simulation and experimental measured results exhibit excellent performance. Additionally, a new simulation approach to realize Dolph-Chebyshev linear series-fed DRA arrays by using the advantages of tall microstrip line feeding structure is proposed. By using a novel T shape feeding scheme, the array exhibits wide band operation due to the low permittivity (εr= 5) DRA elements and good radiation pattern due to the novel feeding structure. The tall metal transmission line feed structure and the polymer-based DRA elements could be fabricated in a common process by the deep XRL technology. This thesis firstly illustrates properties and knowledge for both DRA element and the tall transmission line. Then the three novel feeding schemes by using the tall transmission line on exciting the low permittivity DRA are proposed {{and one of the}} feeding structures, side coupling feeding, is analyzed through the simulation and experiments. Finally, the T shape feeding structure is applied into low permittivity linear DRA array design work. A novel method on designing the <b>Dolph-Chebyshev</b> <b>array</b> is proposed making the design work more efficient...|$|E
40|$|A {{modification}} of the classic <b>Dolph-Chebyshev</b> low sidelobe <b>array</b> pattern design is introduced, which allows the adjustment of the mainlobe’s width relatively freely and independently from the sidelobe level. In order to illustrate {{the advantages of the}} tool provided by the new design method, its application to Uniform Linear Arrays (ULA’s) and Uniform Circular Arrays (UCA’s) is discussed. It is shown that by using the proposed design, low sidelobe beampatterns that are steering invariant within a certain range are achievable with a ULA. In addition the synthesis of beampatterns similar to those of sector antennas, but with electronically adjustable mainlobe, sidelobe level and steering direction are yielded with UCA’s...|$|R
