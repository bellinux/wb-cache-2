5|$|Betances {{was awarded}} the rank of Chévalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honor by the French {{government}} in July 1887, for {{his work as a}} diplomat for the Dominican Republic, and for his work as a medical doctor in France. He had been offered the award as early as 1882, but had repeatedly declined the honor out of humility, until <b>friends</b> <b>from</b> Puerto Rico persuaded him to accept it as a tribute to Puerto Rico, and not as a personal award. The French Legion of Honor (Légion d'honneur) is the premier order of France, and its award is one of great distinction.|$|E

5|$|Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came {{to suspect}} that Fantasy Records had failed to pay them {{all of the money}} that they were owed from the sale of their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the company had been withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority of the money that was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his <b>friends</b> <b>from</b> ever mentioning his name.|$|E
5|$|Cordova-Buckley, {{who began}} {{appearing}} on the show during the third season, {{was surprised to find}} the writers' characterization of Rodriguez in the episode to closely mirror her own life. Cordova-Buckley stated that, like how Rodriguez is seen in the episode, she dislikes nightclubs, and has found herself changing over time to be a different person from who her old friends remember; for Cordova-Buckley, this was seen in returning to Mexico after becoming an actor in the United States, which is reflected with Rodriguez's <b>friends</b> <b>from</b> Colombia from before she worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. as an Inhuman asset.|$|E

5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old <b>friends</b> <b>from</b> his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, Jolin and Isaac Grünewald left Sweden for {{the vibrant}} life in Paris and its art community. The Swedish painter, graphic artist and {{forester}} Carl Palme knew Henri Matisse {{and helped the}} artist to find a suitable location for the new Matisse Academy. An abandoned nunnery in central Paris became the first home for the academy. Together with Grünewald and Leander Engström, Jolin joined the Matisse Academy, where their <b>friends</b> <b>from</b> Stockholm had already been accepted as pupils. At the Academy, Jolin would develop his sense for a stylish line in combination with bright and clean colours in his paintings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1914, when Jolin and his <b>friends</b> <b>from</b> the Matisse Academy {{returned}} to Stockholm, the group became known as De Unga (The Young Ones).
