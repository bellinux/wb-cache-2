5|$|Lucas and {{producer}} Gary Kurtz took the script to American International Pictures, who expressed interest, but ultimately believed American Graffiti was not violent or sexual {{enough for the}} studio's standards. Lucas and Kurtz eventually found favor at Universal Pictures, who allowed Lucas total artistic control {{and the right of}} final cut privilege on the condition that <b>he</b> <b>make</b> American Graffiti on a strict, low budget. This forced Lucas to drop the opening scene, in which the Blonde Angel, Curt's image of the perfect woman, drives through an empty drive-in cinema in her Ford Thunderbird, her transparency revealing she does not exist.|$|E

5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed {{follow-up}} surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that <b>he</b> <b>make</b> a deposit toward the next surgery, because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{incident}} that closed his railroad, Walt Disney consulted with Roger Broggie about the concept of including his ridable miniature train in a potential tour of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, north of Downtown Los Angeles. Broggie, believing {{that there would be}} limited visitor capacity for the attraction, recommended to Disney that <b>he</b> <b>make</b> the train bigger in scale. The idea of a studio tour was eventually replaced by the idea of an amusement park named Disneyland {{across the street from the}} studio, and in one of its first design concepts at that proposed location, a miniature steam train ride was included, as well as a larger, narrow-gauge steam railroad attraction. During this time, Disney proposed that the narrow-gauge Crystal Springs & Southwestern Railroad, which the nearby Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park planned to build, be extended to run through Disneyland. Planned construction of the Ventura Freeway across land between the two sites, and rejection by the Burbank City Council of a new amusement park in their city, led Disney to look for a different location to build the park and its narrow-gauge railroad.|$|E

When its owner Tio Tek Djien suggested <b>he</b> <b>make</b> a film with the troupe's star, Nelson insisted that his family be brought to the Indies. Although this initial film was not realised, the brothers made numerous feature films with different studios under the banner Halimoen Film, starting with Lily van Java (1929). After a two-year hiatus, during which Nelson fell ill, Joshua and Othniel worked with Albert Balink and Mannus Franken to produce Pareh, a commercial failure which bankrupted its producers.|$|E
25|$|Development {{for both}} The Lightning Thief and the Percy Jackson series {{commenced}} when Rick Riordan began making stories {{for his son}} Haley Riordan, who {{had at the time}} been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. His son, Haley, had been studying Greek mythology in second grade and requested that his father tell him bedtime stories based on Greek myths. When Riordan ran out of myths, his son suggested that <b>he</b> <b>make</b> up new stories using existing mythological characters and new ones. This led Riordan to create the fictional character of Percy Jackson and create the story of how he travels across the United States to recover Zeus's lightning-bolt. Haley suggested that he should turn that story into a book, and Riordan wrote the book over the next year despite being busy at that time.|$|E

25|$|In the {{previous}} Oz book, The Emerald City of Oz, magic {{was used to}} isolate Oz from all outside worlds. Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart the series with this book due to financial hardships. In the prologue, he explains how {{he managed to get}} another story about Oz, even though it is isolated from all other worlds. He explains that a child suggested <b>he</b> <b>make</b> contact with Oz with wireless telegraphy. Glinda, using her book that records everything that happens, is able to know that someone is using a telegraph to contact Oz, so she erects a telegraph tower and has the Shaggy Man, who knows how to make a telegraph reply, tell the story contained in this book to Baum.|$|E
25|$|Assistant coach Jerry Frei became {{head coach}} after Len Casanova {{moved on to}} Athletic Director in 1967, the year Oregon moved its home {{football}} games to the newly constructed Autzen Stadium. Although his teams were never selected for a bowl game, and he ended his Oregon career with a losing record, he coached several players {{who went on to}} NFL stardom, including Hall of Fame member Dan Fouts and All-Pro wide receiver Ahmad Rashād, known by his birth name Bobby Moore during his college career. In 1970, he coached the Ducks to an improbable comeback at UCLA, scoring 20 points in the final four minutes of the game to beat UCLA 41–40. However, Frei was unable to defeat arch-rival Oregon State, and after the 1971 loss some influential boosters reportedly were demanding that <b>he</b> <b>make</b> significant changes to his coaching staff.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{research}} on Corinthian pottery {{was accomplished by}} Humfry Payne, who in the 1930s made a first stylistic classification which is, in essence, being used {{up to the present}} time. He classified the vases according to shape, type of decoration and image subjects, and only afterward did <b>he</b> <b>make</b> distinctions as to painters and workshops. He followed Beazley’s method except for attributing less importance to allocating painters and groups since a chronological framework was more important for him. Jack L. Benson took on this allocation task in 1953 and distinguished 109 painters and groups. Last of all, Darrell A. Amyx summarized the research up to that point in his 1988 book Corinthian Vase-Painting of the Archaic Period. It is however a matter of scholarly dispute whether it is at all possible in the case of Corinthian pottery to attribute specific painters.|$|E

On 5 August 2011 McKenzie hit his career best {{first-class}} score of 237 in a County Championship match against Yorkshire. Not only did <b>he</b> <b>make</b> his highest score, but during his innings {{a number of}} records fell. Himself and Michael Carberry set a new Hampshire record for the 3rd wicket in first-class cricket, setting a partnership of 523 runs to surpass the previous best partnership for the 3rd wicket, which was set by George Brown and Phil Mead in 1927. The partnership with Carberry was also the highest for any wicket for Hampshire, surpassing the 411 set by Robert Poore and Teddy Wynyard in 1899. Their partnership was the 11th time in first-class cricket that a partnership has passed 500 runs, currently ranks 9th on the all time list.|$|E
25|$|Assistant Attorney General John Doar {{and former}} Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, {{representing}} President Lyndon Johnson, went to Selma {{to meet with}} King and others at Richie Jean Jackson's house and privately urged King to postpone the march. The SCLC president told them that his conscience demanded that he proceed, and that many movement supporters, especially in SNCC, would {{go ahead with the}} march even if he told them it should be called off. Collins suggested to King that <b>he</b> <b>make</b> a symbolic witness at the bridge, then turn around and lead the marchers back to Selma. King told them that he would try to enact the plan provided that Collins could ensure that law enforcement would not attack them. Collins obtained this guarantee from Sheriff Clark and Al Lingo in exchange for a guarantee that King would follow a precise route drawn up by Clark.|$|E
25|$|Pelham was at Cambridge University {{for four}} years from the autumn of 1930, {{but for most of}} his student time there he was an {{irregular}} cricketer, seldom picked for the university side. In 1931, he played against the university for Sussex, and appeared in only one match for the university side, featuring in eight other Sussex matches across the season. The following year, 1932, he played only for the university team, and took five Essex wickets for 37 runs, the best bowling performance of his first-class career, in a match in May. But he was unable to retain his place in the team and did not win a Blue. In 1933, he was given only two matches by Cambridge, and {{after the end of the}} university season he played two matches for Somerset, for whom he was qualified by his birthplace; in none of these games did <b>he</b> <b>make</b> much impact.|$|E

25|$|Suffolk is banished for {{his role}} in Gloucester's death, whilst Winchester {{contracts}} a fever and dies, cursing God. Margaret, horrified at Suffolk's banishment, vows to ensure his return, but he is killed by pirates shortly after leaving England, and his head sent back to the distraught Margaret. Meanwhile, York has been appointed commander of an army to suppress a revolt in Ireland. Before leaving, he enlists a former officer of his, Jack Cade, to stage a popular revolt in order to ascertain whether the common people would support York should <b>he</b> <b>make</b> an open move for power. At first, the rebellion is successful, and Cade sets himself up as Mayor of London, but his rebellion is put down when Lord Clifford (a supporter of Henry) persuades the common people, who make up Cade's army, to abandon the cause. Cade is killed several days later by Alexander Iden, a Kentish gentleman, into whose garden he climbs looking for food.|$|E
25|$|Lomax was {{a regular}} member of the 1948 Lancashire Second Eleven which won the Minor Counties Championship, but though he took 19 wickets {{at an average of}} 16.94 his main task appears to have been to start the bowling before giving way to the spin trio of Roy Tattersall (66 wickets), Bob Berry (47) and Malcolm Hilton (42), all of whose wickets cost fewer than 12 runs apiece. In 1949, Lomax moved on into {{occasional}} first-team matches, opening the bowling in his first first-class game against Oxford University, when he bowled 23 overs in the match for 31 runs (and two wickets). There were six first-class matches in 1949, nine in 1950 and eight in 1951; in none of them did he manage to take more than three wickets in an innings and nor did <b>he</b> <b>make</b> significant runs. In 1951, in the match against Middlesex at Old Trafford, he made his first score of more than 50, with 52, and put on 103 for the seventh wicket with the schoolboy Colin Smith.|$|E
25|$|Robinson's father {{founded the}} {{successful}} Home Brewery in Daybrook, Arnold in 1875, later acquired Worksop Manor and was knighted in 1905; Sandford Robinson {{was sent to}} Harrow School {{and then he went}} to Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper, but neither at school nor at university did <b>he</b> <b>make</b> much impression: at Harrow he did not play in the grand set-piece cricket matches against the other major public schools, though he did appear in a 12-a-side match with the MCC in 1886. At Cambridge, he played in two trial games but was given only one chance in the first team: a match against the Gentlemen of England in which he opened the batting, scored 7 and 1, and took a catch in each innings. He did no better in a game for Nottinghamshire later in that season and in single matches in both 1889 and 1890 against Cambridge University – playing for an opposing team was a frequent ploy used by Cambridge when they wanted to try a cricketer out, but in Robinson's case it led to no further first-team appearances.|$|E
