2500|$|ArcGIS 9 was {{released}} in May 2004, which included ArcGIS Server and ArcGIS Engine for developers. The ArcGIS 9 release includes a geoprocessing environment that allows execution of traditional GIS processing tools (such as clipping, overlay, and spatial analysis) interactively or from any scripting language that supports COM standards. [...] Although {{the most popular of}} these is Python, others have been used, especially Perl and VBScript. [...] ArcGIS 9 includes a visual programming environment, similar to ERDAS IMAGINE's Model Maker (released in 1994, v8.0.2). The Esri version is called ModelBuilder and as does the ERDAS IMAGINE version allows users to graphically link geoprocessing tools into new tools called models. [...] These models can be executed directly or exported to scripting languages which can then execute <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> <b>mode</b> (launched from a command line), or they can undergo further editing to add branching or looping.|$|E
