5|$|Potter's weariness with {{depicting}} rabbits {{is reflected}} in the book's pictures. Of the twenty-six illustrations, eight depict Mr. McGregor and seventeen the garden and its structures. There are almost no close-ups of the rabbits and none with the detail found in Benjamin Bunny. When the rabbits are depicted, they are viewed in the middle distance in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no facial expression. It is likely Potter (a <b>farm</b> <b>owner</b> at the date of the book's composition) had come to view rabbits as undifferentiated pests rather than individual personalities. Several drawings for the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies were given to the British Museum in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a <b>farm</b> <b>owner,</b> is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out {{for a period of}} seven months (January 2006 to July 2006) from 50 <b>farm</b> <b>owners</b> and 50 local people near the farms of {{different}} Upazilla (Joypurhyat sadar, Panchbibi, Akkelpur, Khetlal and Kalai) in Joypurhat district. The study indicated that most of the farms (46 %) were established within last ten years. Fifteen different fish species were cultured. Three types of farm were observed, such as own (48 %), leased (38 %) and both (14 %). Fish farming (58 %) was the major income source for <b>farm</b> <b>owners.</b> Most of the (72 %) farms depend on underground water. Various types of chemicals and toxic substances like rotenone (16 % farm), phostoxin (10 % farm), bleaching powder (6 % farm), disel/kerosin (22 % farm) and sumithion (4 % farm) were used. Among all the farms 32 %, 56 % and 34 % were affected by tail and fin rot, oxygen deficiency and disease, respectively. Lime (76 % farm), salt (34 %) and sumithion (18 %) were widely used as antibiotics for disinfection, prevention and control of fish disease. Total fish productions have gradually been increased in all the farms. The benefits of fish <b>farm</b> <b>owners</b> were increased in income (92 % <b>farm</b> <b>owners),</b> social status (74 % <b>farm</b> <b>owners),</b> employment opportunity (58 % <b>farm</b> <b>owners),</b> ingestion of fish (42 % <b>farm</b> <b>owners)</b> and poverty alleviation (70 % <b>farm</b> <b>owners)</b> ...|$|R

25|$|A farmer (also {{called an}} agriculturer) {{is a person}} engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies {{to people who do}} some {{combination}} of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a <b>farm</b> <b>owner,</b> while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past, a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).|$|E
25|$|In 1851, a {{group of}} Methodist {{business}} leaders founded Northwestern University and Garrett Biblical Institute. They chose a bluffed and wooded site along the lake as Northwestern's home, purchasing several hundred acres of land from Dr. John Foster, a Chicago <b>farm</b> <b>owner.</b> In 1854, the founders of Northwestern submitted to the county judge their plans for a city to be named Evanston after John Evans, one of their leaders. In 1857, the request was granted. The township of Evanston was split off from Ridgeville Township; at approximately the same time, that portion of Ridgeville south of Devon Avenue was organized as Lake View Township. The nine founders, including John Evans, Orrington Lunt, and Andrew Brown, hoped their university would attain high standards of intellectual excellence. Today these hopes have been fulfilled, as Northwestern consistently ranks {{with the best of}} the nation's universities.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} {{basis of}} {{entrance to the}} frälse was mostly demolished by Gustav I of Sweden in 1536 when he, among his rearrangements of the military, made a new organization of the cavalry. Practically continuing the old system of a large farm (manor) maintaining a cavalryman, he created a new name for these, rusthåll, and greatly enlarged their number. A rusthåll, generally speaking a plain manor, was to support a horseman, his horse and equipment, in exchange for tax exemption. This no longer carried a noble status with it, and the cavalryman was not required to permanently be in the king's garrisons, but was summoned to service only for wartime, being allowed {{to remain in the}} farm in peacetime, off-duty (after a century, this became obsolete as Sweden was continuously at war somewhere, or maintained all-too-big an empire, wherefore off-duty for cavalrymen became an unknown concept). This organization did not change in essence when in 1682 Charles XI of Sweden introduced the new Swedish allotment system, where rusthålls continued as its cavalry element. (In the 1st century of rusthålls, the <b>farm</b> <b>owner</b> himself often served as a cavalry soldier, but later that role was often filled by a hired employee, who enjoyed a rider croft and pay from the farm. Thus, in later centuries, owners of rusthåll again became a sort of local higher class, though not endowed with formal nobility. In exceptional cases, one rusthåll could support as many as seven horsemen. The system of rusthålls continued until the 19th century in Finland.) People thus lost in 1536 the original entranceway to the frälse which continued to enjoy its privileges, continuing to provide cavalrymen on behalf of their allodial manors, and becoming a much more closed class.|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} the necessary investment required from <b>farm</b> <b>owners</b> {{in the process}} of integration. There are various kinds of integration, and the focus here is on integration to create a large-scale pork firm within Japanﾕs pork industry. For this purpose, the subject of this study is Global Pig Farm, Inc., which was established via various investments from farms. The company integrates all stages of the pork industry, with its various complex forms. The case study analysis looks at Global Pig Farms, Inc., whose farm service enjoys stable management and a trusting relationship with <b>farm</b> <b>owners.</b> Through its <b>farm</b> service, the company makes contracts with feed companies and purchases breeding pigs. In addition, Global Pig Farm has many characteristics that are the result of investments from <b>farm</b> <b>owners,</b> including stable and high-level management based on trust and competition and the existence of a central leader to guide the organization. Finally, this study offers suggestions on how to manage the following important tasks, which <b>farm</b> <b>owners</b> should engage in to achieve successful integration: {{how to deal with the}} feed sector, how to establish and maintain trusting relationships with <b>farm</b> <b>owners,</b> and how to adopt the management philosophy of the integrated firm...|$|R
