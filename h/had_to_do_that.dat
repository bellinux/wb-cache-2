'We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{in the middle}} of the night, in order to get our twenty-six oboes together.' The recording, issued in 1959, was {{received}} with critical acclaim for attempting to reproduce the sound Handel would have heard, rather than the smoother orchestral arrangements usually played at that time.|$|E
25|$|It's really {{difficult}} {{for a person to}} create their own life and their own freedom. It's going to become more and more difficult, and it's going to create more and more disillusioned people who become dishonest and angry and are willing to fuck the next guy to get what they want. There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been so lucky that we've never <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Part of it was because of our own tenacity, and part of it was because we were lucky.|$|E
25|$|Simplified game launching, {{also known}} as {{universal}} game launching, was implemented with Core Client update v1.30 and allowed any PS3 game to be launched from Home. With simplified game launching, users could insert a game into their PS3 while in Home and follow the on-screen directions. Users had {{a limited number of}} options to select with simplified game launching. For instance, they could not choose what map or level they wanted, nor could they choose what settings for the map or level within Home. Users <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> after the game had been launched. The name of the game and how many users had joined the session was also shown under the users' names above the avatars' heads.|$|E

500|$|For most of Bullock's shots, she {{was placed}} inside a giant, {{mechanical}} rig. Getting into the rig took {{a significant amount}} of time, so Bullock chose to stay in it for up to 10 hours a day, communicating with others through a headset. Costume Designer Jany Temime said the spacesuits were fictitious – [...] "no space suit opens up at the front – but we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in order for her to get out.

2500|$|In July 2004 Jebediah issued {{their fourth}} studio album, Braxton Hicks, which was {{produced}} by the band itself and appeared on their own record label, Redline Records, distributed by Shock Records. Redline Records {{had been set up}} in July 2000 with their then-manager, Heath Bradby, of Naked Ape Management. The album is named for the intermittent weak contractions which some pregnant women experience. Daymond reflected on the recording process [...] "Because it was self-produced as well, {{there was no one in}} the producer's chair to tie the whole thing together. We've <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> ourselves. We're a very close band but it was even more of a bonding experience in the recording studio, where we had to motivate each other to do our best and I think it's paid off".|$|E

2500|$|In her autobiography, A Lonely Life, Davis gave a {{different}} version {{about having to}} see Bankhead in the play. [...] "A great admirer of hers, I wanted in no way {{to be influenced by}} her work. It was Willie's intention that I give {{a different}} interpretation of the part. I insisted that Tallulah had played it the only way it could be played. Miss Hellman's Regina was written with such definition that it could only be played one way." [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> part exactly the way Tallulah did it, because that's the way Lillian Hellman wrote it. But I was always sad that Tallulah couldn't record Regina from the theatre, because she was marvelous." [...] Charles Dingle, Carl Benton Reid, Dan Duryea, and Patricia Collinge all reprised their critically acclaimed Broadway performances. Critics preferred Bankhead's rendition of the role to Davis's, though the supporting cast was highly praised.|$|E

The part that {{was hard for me}} was {{actually}} doing the mask,where they put all that plaster on your face and you have to lie there still for a long time. Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Comăneci {{is highly}} {{involved}} in fundraising {{for a number}} of charities. She personally funded the construction and operation of the Nadia Comăneci Children's Clinic in Bucharest that provides low-cost and free medical and social support to Romanian children. In 2003, the Romanian government appointed her as an honorary consul general of Romania to the United States to deal with bilateral relations between the two nations. In addition, both Comăneci and Conner are involved with The Special Olympics. One of the public methods Comăneci used to raise funds for the Special Olympics in 2008 was to participate in [...] Donald Trump's reality show, [...] Prior to the airing of the season, Trump announced {{that it was going to}} be the [...] "nastiest version that we've done" [...] and [...] "a very vicious show" [...] because of the unusual combination of celebrities who were each competing to raise money for a favorite charity. Comăneci was a member of [...] "The Empresario" [...] team (all women), which lost to [...] "The Hydra" [...] team (all men) in the second episode. Trump responded to this loss by firing Comăneci, thus preventing her from raising money for the Special Olympics. [...] Comăneci later commented on her participation in the show, stating, [...] " [...] had great fun. I only did it because it was all for charity.
