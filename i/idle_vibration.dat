50|$|The engines's bore {{and stroke}} both measure 86.0 mm, which {{engineers}} refer to as square. According to Mitsubishi, the new cylinder dimensions contribute to a free-revving character (max power at 6,500 rpm), linear power delivery and wide torque curve. Mitsubishi used a timing chain instead of a belt for better reliability and iridium spark plugs to lower emissions and to help extend major service intervals for lower cost of ownership. To reduce weight, Mitsubishi used a plastic cam cover and intake manifold and double-layer stainless steel exhaust manifold. The exhaust manifold has a rear location on the transverse engine, compared to the front location for the previous engine, yielding important benefits such as better emissions performance. To lower vibration, Mitsubishi used a 4-point inertial axis system with cylindrical hydraulic engine mounts {{on the left and}} right sides. A lightweight, high-rigidity squeeze-cast aluminium bracket on the right side mount (engine side) lowers engine noise under acceleration. A lightweight, high-rigidity steel plate bracket on the left side mount (transmission side) lowers gear noise. A custom-tuned insulator was developed for the front and rear mounts to help control both <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> and acceleration shock.|$|E

An efficient procedure for minimizing the engine-induced <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> is developed in this study. Reciprocating unbalance and gas pressure torque as two major sources of engine excitation are studied. Using the field vibration tests and FEM analysis, the cause and characteristics of steering system’s <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> are recognized. So as to distribute the characteristic modes based on the optimization strategy, global sensitivity analysis of the main parameters is also carried out to achieve the optimal combination of the optimization factors. Based on all analysis above, some structure modifications for optimization are presented to control the <b>idle</b> <b>vibration.</b> The effectiveness and rationality of the improvements are also verified through experimental prototyping testing. This study also {{makes it possible to}} provide a design guideline using CAE (computer aided engineering) analysis for some other objects...|$|E
40|$|The {{variations}} in diesel engine <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> caused by fuels of different composition and {{their contributions to}} the {{variations in}} steering wheel vibrations were assessed. The time-varying covariance method (TV-AutoCov) and time-frequency continuous wavelet transform (CWT) techniques were used to obtain the cyclic and instantaneous characteristics of the vibration data acquired from two turbocharged four-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine vehicles at idle under 12 different fuel conditions. The analysis revealed that TV-AutoCov analysis was the most effective for detecting changes in cycle-to-cycle combustion energy (22. 61 per cent), whereas changes in the instantaneous Values of the combustion peaks were best measured using the CWT method (2. 47 per cent). On the other hand, both methods showed that diesel <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> was more affected by amplitude modulation (12. 54 per cent) than frequency modulation (4. 46 per cent). The results of this work suggest the use of amplitude modulated signals for studying the human subjective response to diesel <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> at the steering wheel in passenger cars...|$|E
50|$|Though {{initially}} {{relatively inexpensive}} mobile radio system components, frequently damaged antennas {{can be costly}} to replace since they are usually not included in maintenance contracts for mobile radio fleets. Some types of vehicles in 24-hour use, with stiff suspensions, tall heights, or rough diesel engine <b>idle</b> <b>vibrations</b> may damage antennas quickly. The location and type of antenna can affect system performance drastically. Large fleets usually test a few vehicles before making a commitment to a certain antenna location or type.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{proposes a}} multi-body dynamic {{simulation}} to numerically evaluate the generated axial force(G. A. F) and plunging resistant force(P. R. F) practically {{related to the}} shudder and <b>idling</b> <b>vibration</b> of an automobile. A numerical analysis of two plunging types of CV joints, tripod joint(TJ) and very low axial tripod joint(VTJ), is conducted using the commercial program DAFUL. User-defined subroutines of a friction model illustrating the contacted parts of the outboard and inboard joint are subsequently developed to overcome the numerical instability and improve the solution performance. The Coulomb friction effect is applied to describe the contact models of the lubricated parts in the rolling and sliding mechanisms. The numerical results, {{in accordance with the}} joint articulation angle variation, are validated with experimentation. The offset between spider and tulip housing is demonstrated to be the critical role in producing the 3 rd order component of the axial force that potentially causes the noise and vibration in vehicle. The VTJ shows an excellent behavior for the shudder when compared with TJ. In addition, a flexible nonlinear contact analysis coupled with rigid multi-body dynamics is also performed to show the dynamic strength characteristics of the rollers, housing, and spider...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a {{digital signal processing}} analysis of diesel engine <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> in automobiles, and {{an analysis of the}} human subjective response to the <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> which occurs at the steering wheel. In order to quantify the variations in the diesel <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> that can be introduced by the engine technology, the vehicle, and the fuel type, a set of acceleration time histories were measured at the engine block and at the steering wheel for two automobiles equipped with 4 -cylinder engines which had different injection systems and which operated under different fuel conditions. A combination of time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency wavelet-based analysis were used. Both the continuous wavelet transform and the discrete orthogonal wavelet transform were applied to the steering wheel acceleration time histories in order to analyse the statistical variation in terms of both instantaneous variations, and the cycle-to-cycle variations which occur across complete thermodynamic engine cycles. The combination of orthogonal wavelet transform and time-varying auto-covariance analysis, performed across a complete engine thermodynamic cycle, was identified as the most sensitive method for describing the statistical variation in diesel <b>idle</b> <b>vibration.</b> The second-order engine harmonic H 2 was found to account for most of the vibrational energy at the steering wheel when at idle. Amplitude modulation of the second-order engine harmonic H 2 by the half-order engine harmonic H 112 has been identified as the main characteristic of the steering wheel signature of automobiles at idle. The steering wheel <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> produced by different engines and different fuel conditions have therefore been described in terms of the amplitude modulation depth "mil that characterises the idle waveform. Four psychophysical response tests, determined by the combination of two test protocols and two semantic descriptors, were performed. A model of the growth in the human subjective response to diesel <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> has been proposed in which the response scale {{is a function of the}} modulation depth parameter "mil. The model is defined over two regions of modulation depth. For values of "m" less than 0. 2, humans have been found to be unable to distinguish variations in idle modulation. For values of "m" greater than 0. 2, the human response grows as a power function with respect to modulation depth. Based on the current findings, suggestions for future research are also provided...|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{in motor}} {{vehicles}} is largely {{influenced by the}} engine and thus has {{become the focus of}} much automotive testing. Engine <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> is focused on since deviations in the vibration signature are prevalent at this operating condition. The objective of this thesis was to derive a best-practice method for the analysis of engine <b>idle</b> <b>vibration.</b> Variability of the engine vibration signatures was calculated through the implementation of multiple analysis techniques. These methods included: angle domain analysis, the fast Fourier transform, the discrete cosine transform, the moving average model, and the auto-regressive moving average model. Also included in the investigation were examinations of data normalization, detrending, and filtration. The results of the analyses were then evaluated with reference to the correlation between similar engines and the identification of outliers. It was found that the fast Fourier transform analysis technique provided the best overall results. The moving average model and the auto-regressive moving average models were also identified as methods that have great potential in vibration analysis but are limited by their computational intensity...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} puzzling results of an {{experiment}} on the stability of long liquid columns under microgravity, performed aboard Spacelab-D 2 in 1993 and named STACO, aiming at the analysis of deformations of nearly cylindrical liquid columns under several mechanical disturbances, is revisited here. It corresponds to the unexplained breakage of an 85 mm long liquid bridge of low viscosity silicone oil, established between unequal discs of 30 and 28 mm, intended to counterbalance the expected deformation by residual acceleration found in previous flights, and left <b>idle</b> because the <b>vibrations</b> and oscillations to be applied afterwards were not started, for fear of premature breakage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on {{the cause of}} severe vibration problem of a coach with four-cylinder engine running at an <b>idle</b> state using <b>vibration</b> and impact hammer modal experiments to obtain the main vibration frequency components and the natural characteristics of the coach. The vibration {{results indicate that the}} main vibration component comes from the vibration transmitted from the engine to the chassis frame, which is closely related with the engine idle speed. Based on structural simulation analysis of the coach’s chassis frame and comparison with modal testing, the coach severe vibration problem was due to coupling resonance between the engine idle frequency and the fourth natural frequency of the chassis frame. The solution to eliminate the vibration problem is provided by changing the local structure stiffness of the chassis frame. The contribution of this paper lies in providing a solution to solve similar problems...|$|R
40|$|Current {{practice}} of analytical and test methods {{related to the}} analysis, testing and improvement of vehicle vibrations is overviewed. The methods are illustrated on the determination and improvement of powertrain induced steering wheel vibration of a heavy commercial truck. More specifically, the transmissibility of powertrain <b>idle</b> <b>vibration</b> to cabin is investigated with respect to powertrain rigid body modes and modal alignment of the steering column/wheel system is considered. It is found out that roll mode of the powertrain is not separated from idle excitation for effective vibration isolation as well as steering wheel column mode {{is close to the}} 3 rd engine excitation frequency order, which results in high vibration levels. Powertrain roll mode is optimized by tuning the powertrain mount stiffness to improve the performance. Steering column mode is also separated from the 3 rd engine excitation frequency by the application of a mass absorber. It is concluded that the use of analytical and test methods to address the complex relation between design parameters and powertrain idle response is effective to optimize the system performance and evaluate the trade-offs in the vehicle design such as vibration performance and weight.
