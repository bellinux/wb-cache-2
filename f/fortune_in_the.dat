5|$|When John was nine, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} Hopkins Academy; the next year, the father took him out again, {{in part because the}} boy was in {{constant}} trouble and in part because the father had lost his <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Panic of 1819.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{was born}} in a house on the High Street of Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire: England, on 24 August 1759, the only son of Robert Wilberforce (1728–1768), a wealthy merchant, and his wife Elizabeth Bird (1730–1798). His {{grandfather}} William (1690–1774 or 1776) had made the family <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maritime trade with Baltic countries, and had twice been elected mayor of Hull.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the play's run in Los Angeles, Woods renewed {{his offer}} to produce the play on Broadway. Although he was a renowned {{producer}} of many famous plays in a career of more than three decades, Woods had lost much of his <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1930s and had not produced a hit in several years. Being refused by a neophyte author shocked him and increased his interest. Woods still wanted the right to make script changes, but he made adjustments to the contract to give Rand more influence. She reluctantly agreed to his terms.|$|E

5|$|On his father's side, the {{immigrant}} ancestor was John Pound, a Quaker, who arrived from England around 1650. Ezra's grandfather, Thaddeus Coleman Pound (1832–1914), was a Republican Congressman from northwest Wisconsin {{who had made}} and lost a <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lumber business. Thaddeus's son Homer, Pound's father, worked for Thaddeus in the lumber business, until Thaddeus secured him the appointment as registrar of the Hailey land office. Homer and Isabel married the following year, and Homer built a home in Hailey. Isabel was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887, when he was 18 months old. Homer followed them, and in 1889 he found {{a job as an}} assayer at the Philadelphia Mint. The family moved to Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, and in 1893 bought a six-bedroom house in Wyncote.|$|E
5|$|Sabo {{was born}} in Kufstein, Austria on 22 February 1948 to Elizabeth and Leslie Sabo Sr., who had been members of an upper-class Hungarian family. Leslie Jr. had one brother, George, who {{was born in}} 1944, as well as a second brother who had been killed in World War II bombings at the age of one. With the post-World War II {{occupation}} of Hungary by the Soviet Union, Sabo's family lost their <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war and, upon realizing Communism would be installed in Hungary long-term, they left the country permanently.|$|E
5|$|The twenty-seven story Rand Tower, {{built in}} 1929, {{was the next}} major {{challenger}} to the height limit. The thirty-two story Foshay Tower, also built in 1929, was the highest building in Minneapolis until 1971. Its builder, Wilbur Foshay, wanted a tower built {{along the lines of}} the Washington Monument. He staged a lavish dedication ceremony complete with a march composed by John Philip Sousa. About six weeks later, Foshay lost his <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wall Street Crash of 1929. Foshay's $20,000 check to Sousa bounced, and Sousa forbade anyone else to play the march until the debt was repaid.|$|E
50|$|The SPC {{was further}} marginalized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1915 provincial election. Its only {{candidate}} was Armstrong, who again placed third against Dixon. Subsequent events, however, would briefly revive <b>the</b> party's <b>fortunes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|R
25|$|On May 10, 1869, the First Transcontinental Railroad was {{completed}} at Promontory Summit, {{north of the}} Great Salt Lake. The railroad brought increasing numbers of people into the state, and several influential businessmen made <b>fortunes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territory.|$|R
5|$|York City Football Club is a {{professional}} association football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England. Its history from the 1980–81 to the current season saw fluctuating <b>fortunes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s and 1990s, and relegations from the Football League.|$|R
5|$|William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton (1582-1648), {{sometimes}} numbered as the 6th Earl, inherited Aberdour {{from his}} grandfather in 1606. He was Treasurer of Scotland from 1630–36, {{and a strong}} supporter of the Stewart dynasty during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639-1651). However, he was compelled to spend much of his <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> royal interest, leading him into financial difficulty, and forcing him to sell Dalkeith to the Earl of Buccleuch in 1642. Earl William built the Renaissance east wing at Aberdour, probably around 1635. It was certainly standing in 1647, when an inventory records luxurious furniture, carpets, and tapestries. The walled garden was also built in the 1630s, and improvements made to the terraces. Aberdour was therefore a suitable principal residence for the Earls after the sale of Dalkeith.|$|E
5|$|By 1984, Nicky {{is working}} as a {{successful}} photographer, and Mary has divorced Tosker, who has remarried and is rapidly becoming a rich businessman. Nicky and Mary renew their earlier relationship during the turbulent events of the miners' strike and eventually marry. By 1987, however, their marriage is falling apart. Nicky has {{an affair with a}} young student and is also forced to confront his father's Alzheimer's disease. He meets Geordie, now a homeless, drunken vagrant, by chance in London, but his old friend disappears before {{he has a chance to}} help him. Eventually Geordie is sentenced to life in prison as a danger to the public after setting fire to a mattress in a hostel. Despite her failing marriage to Nicky, Mary's life is becoming an increasing success, and she is now a councillor. Tosker, meanwhile, has lost his <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stock market crash.|$|E
5|$|Highland cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Australia by {{the mid-19th century}} by Scottish migrants such as Chieftain Areneas Ronaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, Scotland. Arriving in Port Albert, Victoria, in 1841 with his clan, they apparently drove their Highland cattle to a farm at Greenmount, on the Tarra River, preceded by a piper. Samuel Amess, also from Scotland, who made a <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Victorian goldfields and became Mayor of Melbourne in 1869, kept a small fold of black Highland cattle on Churchill Island. They were seen and survived in Port Victoria during the late 1800s, but other folds were believed to have died out {{in areas such as}} New South Wales. In 1988 the Australian Highland Cattle Society was formed. Since then, numbers have been growing and semen is being exported to New Zealand to establish the breed there.|$|E
50|$|The Greco-Bactrians had {{recently}} been defeated at the Battle of the Arius by Antiochus III. After this defeat, Euthydemus retreated to Zariaspa, a district of Bactra.

50|$|The Peugeot Type 173 is a {{mid-range}} car produced between 1922 and 1925 by the French auto-maker Peugeot {{at their}} Beaulieu plant.

A sixth place followed the year after.|$|R
5|$|The Judd School was {{established}} in 1888, but {{the need for a}} secondary school to supplement Sir Andrew Judd's Grammar School (now known as the famous Public School: Tonbridge School) was acknowledged as early as 1870, after it was revealed that only one in 200 of its students {{was the son of a}} Tonbridge tradesman. Tonbridge School was founded in 1553 by Sir Andrew Judd, who made a <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Muscovy fur trade during the 16th century. His endowment was left in the hands of the Skinners Company, who agreed to fund the establishment of a commercial school in Tonbridge in 1875. However, the Charity Commissioners – empowered by the 1869 Endowed Schools Act to govern the establishment of charitably funded schools – directed that the £20,000 provided by The Skinners' Company for this cause be taken to neighbouring Tunbridge Wells, where it was used to establish The Skinners' School in September 1887.|$|E
5|$|Gonsales is a Spaniard {{forced to}} flee the country after killing {{a man in a}} duel. Having made his <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East Indies, he decides to return to Spain, but falls ill on the voyage home and is set off on the island of St Helena to recover. There he discovers a species of wild swan able to carry {{substantial}} loads, the gansa, and contrives a device that allows him to harness many of them together and fly around the island. Once fully recovered, Gonsales resumes his journey home, but his ship is attacked by an English fleet off the coast of Tenerife. He uses his flying machine to escape to the shore, but once safely landed he is approached by hostile natives and is forced to take off again. This time his birds fly higher and higher, towards the Moon, which they reach after a journey of twelve days. There Gonsales encounters the Lunars, a tall Christian people inhabiting {{what appears to be a}} utopian paradise. After six months of living among them, Gonsales becomes homesick and concerned for the condition of his birds, and sets off to return to Earth. He lands in China, where he is immediately arrested as a magician, but after learning the language manages to win the trust of the local mandarin. The story ends with Gonsales meeting a group of Jesuit missionaries, who arrange to have a written account of his adventures sent back to Spain.|$|E
5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stock market, but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E
25|$|The South African Fezela XI (often known {{simply as}} the Fezelas) was a team of young South African cricketers who toured England <b>in</b> 1961 under <b>the</b> {{captaincy}} of the Test player Roy McLean.

After World War II, various Jews of European descent moved into the home.|$|R
50|$|In 1870 Smith {{joined the}} law {{partnership}} of Alfred Chapman and Andrew Glassell, the firm becoming known as Glassell, Chapman & Smith.

This law firm acquired and developed the land which ultimately became the city of Orange, California.|$|R
5|$|When RichardII was crowned in 1377, {{he led a}} {{procession}} from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14thcentury and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in StJohn's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in {{the security of the}} Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King HenryIV. In the 15thcentury, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late RichardII attempted a coup, HenryIV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of HenryV (1413–1422) renewed England's <b>fortune</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.|$|E

50|$|The Liberal {{government}} was tired, however, after {{almost thirty years}} in office, and Ross could do little to revive its <b>fortunes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> provincial election of 1902, the Liberal majority was cut to one seat, but {{at a time when}} parties lacked the discipline over their members they would later develop, that was not enough for a secure government.|$|R
