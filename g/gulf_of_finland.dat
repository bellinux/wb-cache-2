5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid up each winter when the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> froze. Bronenosets was {{reclassified}} as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. During 1903, the ship was converted into a coal barge by the removal of her turret, her side armor, and its wooden backing, and by the division of her hull into three holds. She was redesignated as Barzha No. 34, Barzha No. 51 and, in 1914, Barzha No. 324. The ship sank in a storm in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> sometime during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Gromoboi {{came under}} {{control of the}} Soviet Red Fleet in September 1917. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk {{required}} the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> was still frozen over. Gromoboi sailed to Kronstadt in {{what became known as}} the 'Ice Voyage' and was placed into reserve shortly after her arrival.|$|E
5|$|A long bar of Danish territories in {{the south}} and lack of {{sufficient}} year-round ice-free ports severely limited Sweden's access to Baltic trade. Nevertheless, the country prospered due to exports of timber, iron and most notably copper, coupled with the advantages of a growing navy and proximity to the Livonian ports across the narrow <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> Before the Livonian war, Sweden had sought expansion into Livonia, but the intervention of the Russian tsar temporarily stalled these efforts through the Russo-Swedish War of 1554–1557, which culminated in the 1557 Treaty of Novgorod.|$|E

50|$|Coregonus albula, {{known as}} the vendace or as the European cisco, is a species of {{freshwater}} whitefish in the family Salmonidae. It is found in lakes in northern Europe, especially Finland, Sweden, Russia and Estonia, and in some lakes of Norway, the United Kingdom, northern Germany and Poland. It {{is also found in}} diluted brackish water in the <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> and Bothnia, both of which are in the Baltic Sea.|$|R
25|$|Although the Estonian Army had {{attained}} {{control over}} its country, the enemy red armies were still active. The Estonian High Command decided {{to push their}} defense lines {{across the border into}} Russia in support of the White Russian Northern Corps. On 13 May, the Northern Corps went on the offensive at Narva, catching the Soviets by surprise and destroying their 6th Division. The offensive was supported along the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland's</b> coast by the British and Estonian navy and marines. With the front approaching, the garrison of the Krasnaya Gorka fort mutinied. But the 7th Red Army received reinforcements and counterattacked, pushing the White Russians back, until the front was stabilised with the support from the Estonian 1st Division on the Luga and Saba rivers.|$|R
5|$|Finnish–Estonian {{relations}} were closest diplomatically after the Estonian Freedom War in the 1920s, but cooled afterwards. Military relations however remained close. From the Finnish point of view, the close relations with Estonia did not exclude the Scandinavian neutrality policy. Nevertheless, the military {{relations were}} top secret, and the countries held joint military exercises. The central {{aim was to}} prevent the Soviet Baltic Fleet from freely using its strength in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> against either country. Estonia also sought public security guarantees and signed the Baltic Entente in 1934 with Latvia and Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|On a {{strategic}} scale, a natural choke point was present between the northern shore of Lake Peipus and the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> The 45 kilometre wide {{strip of land}} was entirely bisected by the Narva River and had large areas of wilderness. The primary transportation routes, the Narva–Tallinn highway and railway, ran on an east-west axis near and parallel to the coastline. There were no other east-west transportation routes capable of sustaining troop movement {{on a large scale}} in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Finns assured Yartsev that Finland was {{committed}} to a policy of neutrality, and the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev was {{not satisfied with the}} reply, given Finland's military weakness. He suggested that Finland could cede, or lease, some islands in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> along the seaward approaches to Leningrad, a suggestion the Finns rejected. Earlier in the mid-1930s, the Soviet ambassador in Helsinki, Eric Assmus, and the Leningrad Bolshevik party leader Andrei Zhdanov, had presented a similar proposal.|$|E
50|$|Keskiniemi Light is {{a sector}} light tower {{located in the}} northwestern {{promontory}} of Hailuoto island in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia in <b>Finland.</b> It is located next to the Keskiniemi beacon tower built in 1858.|$|R
25|$|The Baltic sea {{drainage}} basin is roughly {{four times the}} surface area of the sea itself. About 48% of the region is forested, with Sweden and Finland containing {{the majority of the}} forest, especially around the <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia and <b>Finland.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hiidenniemi beacon tower (Hiidenniemen pooki in Finnish) was a {{historic}} daymark tower {{on the northern}} coast of Hailuoto island in <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia in <b>Finland.</b> The structure was located at the northernmost point of the island, a minor promontory named Hiidenniemi.|$|R
5|$|The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk {{required}} the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 {{or have the}} ships based there interned by newly independent Finland even though the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> was still frozen over. Admiral Makarov {{was among the first}} group of ships that sailed on 25 March and reached Kronstadt five days later in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage'. She was paid off upon arrival and did not participate in the Russian Civil War. The ship was sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up in Stettin.|$|E
5|$|All {{four of the}} Ganguts were {{assigned}} to the First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet in December 1914 – January 1915 when they reached Helsingfors. Their turrets and fire-control systems, however, were still being adjusted and fine-tuned through the next spring. Their role was to defend the mouth of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so they spent their time training with occasional sorties into the Baltic. Several ships ran aground in 1915 and 1916, often while providing cover for minelaying operations, but only Sevastopol suffered any significant damage. A minor mutiny broke out on 1 November on board Gangut when the executive officer refused to feed the crew the traditional meal of meat and macaroni after coaling. The crews of the battleships joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet on 16 March 1917, after the idle sailors received word of the February Revolution in Saint Petersburg. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> was still frozen over. Gangut and her sisters led the first group of ships on 12 March and reached Kronstadt five days later in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage'.|$|E
5|$|Army Group North {{had already}} {{considered}} abandoning Estonia in February 1944, during the Soviet Kingisepp-Gdov Offensive. A {{large number of}} units would have been freed up with changes to the front, but the Narva front continued to be defended on Hitler's orders. The German Command considered it important to maintain control over the southern shore of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> to ease the situation in Finland and keep the Soviet Baltic Fleet trapped in the eastern bay of the gulf. The retention of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida-Viru was important for economic reasons.|$|E
25|$|During the Finnish War, the Russian army {{unexpectedly}} {{crossed the}} frozen <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia from <b>Finland</b> to the Åland Islands and, by 19 March 1809, reached the Swedish shore within 70km from the Swedish capital, Stockholm. This daring maneuvre decided {{the outcome of}} the war.|$|R
25|$|About 20% of {{the land}} is used for {{agriculture}} and pasture, mainly in Poland and {{around the edge of the}} Baltic Proper, in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. About 17% of the basin is unused open land with another 8% of wetlands. Most of the latter are in the <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia and <b>Finland.</b>|$|R
50|$|The three photoreconnaissance Spitfires {{departed}} on 1 September on {{a hazardous}} flight {{of more than}} 1,950 km (1,200 mi) from Sumburgh, over the North Sea, German-occupied Norway, Sweden (technically in breach of Swedish neutrality), the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia and <b>Finland</b> (with which the Commonwealth countries were at war) to Afrikanda. All three Spitfires arrived safely.|$|R
5|$|Attacks of the Leningrad Front {{had pushed}} the Army Group North {{to the west}} of Lake Peipus {{resulting}} in a series of operations around Narva. The German Command considered it important to maintain control over the southern shore of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland,</b> which eased the situation in Finland and kept the Soviet Baltic Fleet in its eastern bay. From a military economy viewpoint, the preservation of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida-Viru was also important. In the south, Soviet forces advanced towards the Baltic seacoast {{at the end of their}} Operation Bagration of June–August 1944 against the German Army Group Centre.|$|E
5|$|Following the Soviet {{capture of}} that city, the {{remaining}} crew detonated scuttling {{charges in the}} wreck on 21 March to further destroy the ship. After the war, the ship was raised during 1945–46 by the Soviet Navy and transferred to Tallinn. Although reference books long stated that she was scrapped there or in Marienburg, in actuality she was towed out in 1948 and beached for long-term use as a target in shallow water off the island of Osmussaar in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> Last used for target practice around 1966, the remains are now submerged. Her bell {{was held in the}} collection of the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden as of 1990.|$|E
5|$|The Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 slowed her reconstruction, and {{the ship}} was not {{completed}} until 1908. She spent most of World War I as a training ship, although she became a depot ship for submarines in 1917. Petr Veliky was in Helsinki in March 1918 when the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> was still frozen over. The ship reached Kronstadt in April 1918 and was hulked on 21 May 1921. She remained in service with the Soviets, in various secondary roles, until she was finally stricken from the Navy List in 1959 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
50|$|Laitakari beacon {{tower is}} a daymark (navigational aid) {{located on the}} island of Laitakari in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia in <b>Finland.</b> The island is located east-northeast of Hailuoto and is within the {{municipal}} boundaries of the City of Oulu. There has been a navigational aid on the island since the 1750s, and a beacon tower has been marked on a chart dated in 1785.|$|R
50|$|The {{distribution}} of the artifacts found includes Finnmark (Norway) in the north, the Kalix River (Sweden) and the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia (<b>Finland)</b> {{in the west and}} the Vistula River (Poland) in the south. In the east the Comb Ceramic pottery of northern Eurasia extends beyond the Ural mountains to the Baraba steppe adjacent to the Altai-Sayan mountain range, merging with a continuum of similar ceramic styles. It would include the Narva culture of Estonia and the Sperrings culture in Finland, among others. They are thought to have been essentially hunter-gatherers, though e.g. the Narva culture in Estonia shows some evidence of agriculture. Some of this region was absorbed by the later Corded Ware horizon.|$|R
50|$|The Keskiniemi beacon tower (Keskiniemen tunnusmajakka in Finnish), often {{referred}} to as the Karvo beacon tower, is a historic daymark located on a promontory of Keskiniemi in the northwestern part of Hailuoto island in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia in <b>Finland.</b> The tower was built in 1858 to alert the vessels about sandbars reaching northwest from the site. It is the oldest surviving navigational aid on Hailuoto island. The tower has structural similarities with the Härkmeri beacon tower built in 1857.|$|R
5|$|The {{participation}} of Marat and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya in the Winter War {{was limited to}} a bombardment of Finnish coastal artillery in December 1939 at Saarenpää in the Beryozovye Islands before the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> iced over. They failed to inflict any permanent damage before being driven off by near misses. Both ships had their anti-aircraft armament modernized and reinforced over the winter of 1939–40 and were transferred to Tallinn shortly after the Soviets occupied Estonia in 1940. Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya received more AA guns in February–March 1941. Parizhskaya Kommuna received a more modest number of AA guns while she was receiving her bulges, but landed four 120-mm guns right before the Germans invaded.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E
5|$|During the Thirty Years' War in 1618–1648, {{the horses}} used by Finnish cavalry {{were small and}} unrepresentative, {{considered}} inferior even to the cargo horses used by the Swedish Royal Army. However, these animals had great stamina, a crucial quality during long, exhausting campaigns. The humble-looking Finnish horses were presumably exchanged when possible for other horses obtained as spoils of war. It was probably rare for a cavalryman to return with the same horse with which he left, {{and it is likely}} that the horses brought back to Finland were crossbreeds or of purely Central European lines. Reinforcements to replace the considerable horse casualties were obtained from the Baltic States, but during the reign of Charles XI almost all of the cavalry horses were imported from south of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland,</b> due to their larger size.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the Finnish War — the most {{brilliant}} campaign of his career — broke out in 1808, Kamensky {{had a reputation for}} being reckless with his soldiers' lives. However, he was promoted to Full General in 1809 and achieved important successes against the Swedes at Kuortane and Oravais. It was he who came up with a daring plan of the Russian infantry's crossing the frozen <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia from <b>Finland</b> towards Umeå and Åland, which forced Sweden to cede Finland to Tsar Alexander.|$|R
40|$|The new anthaspidellid taxon Brevaspidella dispersa is erected for {{specimens}} {{recovered from}} the Late Ordovician sponge assemblages of the island of Gotland, Sweden and the Dutch-German border region. In the latter area, they are collected from Early Pleistocene fluvial deposits of the Baltic River System, whereas those from Gotland are part of Late Pleistocene glacial or fluvio-glacial deposits. The provenance of both assemblages is uncertain, but they probably originated from an Ordovician basin in the northern Baltic Sea or the Bothnian <b>Gulf,</b> west <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> As yet, Brevaspidella dispersa gen. et sp. nov. is restricted to the Gotland-German-Dutch sponge association {{and has not been}} found in the assemblage of nearly-coeval ‘lavender-blue cherts’ and ‘blue sponges’. The new taxon is closely related to the genus Anthaspidella, but differs in the aquiferous system and in having a well developed concentrically wrinkled dermal layer...|$|R
50|$|Tasku beacon tower (Taskun pooki in Finnish) is a daymark tower {{located on}} the island of Tasku (Pocket in English) in the Raahe {{archipelago}} in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia in <b>Finland.</b> The structure was built in 1853 from the plans drawn by Albin Stjerncreutz. In 1983 the Finnish Maritime Administration handed it over to the City of Raahe. Currently the city is responsible of the upkeep of this historical aid to navigation. The Tasku beacon tower is one of three historical beacon towers in Raahe archipelago, however only two beacon towers remain: the second one is the Iso-Kraaseli beacon tower.|$|R
5|$|In August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, in which Eastern European {{countries}} {{were divided into}} spheres of interest; Finland belonged to the Soviet sphere of interest. In October 1939, Stalin gained control of the Baltic states and turned his sights on Finland, confident that control could be gained without great effort. The Soviet Union demanded territories on the Karelian Isthmus, the islands of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> and a military base near the Finnish capital Helsinki, similar to the demands presented in the previous years. The Finns again refused, and the Red Army attacked on 30 November 1939. Simultaneously, Stalin set up a puppet government for the Finnish Democratic Republic, headed by the Finnish communist Otto Wille Kuusinen.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid up each winter when the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> froze. On 18 July 1875, she was accidentally rammed by the ironclad , but only {{suffered}} minor damage. Perun was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. After she was stricken she was used as a pilot ship before being renamed Lotsiia (Pilot) in 1915. During the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, the ship was struck by artillery fire. She was laid up after the resulting fire badly damaged her. During a flood on 23 September 1924, Lotsiia ran aground and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
40|$|The Baltic Proper shows many {{signs of}} eutrophication. Nutrient {{changes over time}} have been discernable, and also within the Sea there are large spatial patterns. Present study {{analyses}} the spatial patterns of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus as well as dissolved silicate (DSi) in the euphotic zone for the period 1990 - 2001. The {{focus is on the}} spatial heterogeneity with the aim to identify areas significantly different from the overall mean. Three regions are clearly discernible, the interior, the western and the eastern coastal zones. This is further complicated by the <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> and Riga with distinct different behaviour compared to the other ones. While the coastal zones are re-supplied by their terrestrial sources, the exchange with the interior is limited by geophysical constraints. The western border shows permanently high DSi but low DIN and DIP concentrations. The riverine loads of DIN, DIP and DSi are low but a large transport of DSi probably takes place from the Bothnian Sea to the Kattegat along the western coast with only minor retention. The eastern region, on the other hand, is characterised by both high nutrient loads and high production. These spatial patterns agree well with a conceptual model where the spring bloom leads to an interior generally low in DIN. This favours N-fixating cyanobacteria blooms at the expense of diatoms. This view is supported by decreasing DIP concentrations but unaffected DSi levels. The spatial patterns observed well reflect the riverine nutrient loads. This should be regarded in future remedy plans for the eutrophic Baltic Sea. The terrestrial load can have very different impacts on the ecosystems depending on which coastal section is involved.

50|$|By 12,000 BP {{the edge}} of the glacier was at a line across {{southern}} Sweden to the northern shore of the Baltic countries. A connected body of water, the Ramsay Sea, stretched from the Danish islands region to the shores <b>of</b> Estonia. The <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia and <b>Finland</b> were still glaciated, as well as nearly all of Sweden north of Scania. In the Allerød warm period, rising land in the Denmark region created the Baltic Ice Lake. It egressed through a small channel in the Strait of Øresund. The lake was higher than sea level (which itself was lower than the present-day sea level) by some tens of metres. Lake Ladoga was part of it.|$|R
