5|$|Mulder {{telephones}} Scully {{and tries}} to explain that he's the real Mulder. Scully does not believe him and asks Fletcher—in Mulder's body—to pick up {{and listen to the}} conversation. Fletcher decides they should immediately report this incident, which further confuses Scully. She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is very strange and his lack of concern for the X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives through the desert towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO and the resultant problems that night, but Fletcher, having <b>eavesdropped</b> <b>on</b> the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them of the source of the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher. Military police arrive at the appointed hour, and Mulder is dragged away, kicking and screaming, desperately trying to convince Scully. Mulder asks if he would turn in an informant to the authorities in this manner as he is carried away, and Scully begins to realize that Mulder may be telling the truth.|$|E
25|$|In {{his effort}} to have Solor killed and have Nikiya for himself, the jealous High Brahmin informs the Rajah that the warrior has already vowed eternal love to Nikiya over a sacred fire. But the High Brahmin’s plan backfires when, rather than {{becoming}} angry with Solor, the Rajah decides that it is Nikiya who must die. Gamzatti, who has <b>eavesdropped</b> <b>on</b> this exchange, summons Nikiya to the palace {{in an attempt to}} bribe the bayadère into giving up her beloved. As their rivalry intensifies, Nikiya picks up a dagger in a fit of rage and attempts to kill Gamzatti, only to be stopped {{in the nick of time}} by Gamzatti’s aya. Nikiya flees in horror at what she has almost done. As did her father, Gamzatti vows that the bayadère must die.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Edwards was {{selected}} to command RCAF Station Dartmouth (now 12 Wing Shearwater), where he formed one of the RCAF's first squadrons after the crippling Depression. No. 5 (Flying Boat) Squadron was created by amalgamating the five RCAF detachments at Dartmouth, Shediac, Gaspé, Sydney and Rimouski. Under his leadership, No. 5 Squadron initiated anti-smuggling air patrols with a Royal Canadian Mounted Police observer on board. The patrols were flown in consort with RCMP marine vessels to thwart illegal rum running along the Nova Scotia coast. Under his direction, No. 5 Squadron initiated the first use of aircraft radios to report suspect vessels to RCAF and RCMP ground stations. He also introduced a tactical grid system to disguise geographic positions to foil rumrunners who <b>eavesdropped</b> <b>on</b> the wireless communications.|$|E

500|$|The book's authors said Wałęsa, {{working under}} the code name Bolek, was a secret police {{informant}} from 1970 (after {{he was released from}} the arrest) till 1976 (before he was fired from the shipyard). According to them, [...] "he wrote reports and informed on more than 20 people and some of them were persecuted by the communist police. He identified people and <b>eavesdropped</b> <b>on</b> his colleagues at work while they were listening to Radio Free Europe for example". The book describes the fate of the seven of his alleged victims; information regarding others was destroyed or stolen from the files. According to them, Wałęsa received over 13,000 zlotys as remuneration for his services from the SB, while the monthly salary at the time was about 3,500 zlotys. The authors said oppositionist activity in Poland {{in the first half of}} 1970s was minimal and Wałęsa's role in it was quite marginal. However, according to the book, despite formally renouncing his ties with SB in 1976, Wałęsa went on to have contacts with communist officials.|$|E

[...] According to her report, the reactions were wide-ranging, from the number of women who teased their male companions about whether they would ever consider wearing skirts (to which several men responded that they would) to the man who said, [...] "A caftan after a shower or in the gym? Can you imagine? 'Excuse me! [...] Coming through!'". [...] An adolescent girl rejected in disgust the notion that skirts were similar to the wide pants worn by hip-hop artists. Two elderly women called the idea [...] "utterly ridiculous".

2500|$|The British had {{accurately}} {{established the}} Italian {{order of battle}} and aspects of Italian strategic thinking but the Italians managed to keep their tactical moves secret. The Italian army changed its cyphers on the outbreak {{of war and the}} British took until November to break into the new army cypher; a new Regia Aeronautica cypher was introduced in November and broken quickly. During the signals intelligence blackout, the British lacked knowledge of the Italian order of battle, equipment and readiness; fears grew that the Italians were preparing to invade Sudan and Kenya. When the British counter-offensives began in January 1941, captured documents and the inability of the Italians to change their cyphers for transmissions to Italy created perfect conditions for [...] "the cryptographers' war". In spite of a lack of aircraft for reconnaissance and no network of spies in the AOI, the British in 1941 had a comprehensive view of the Italian supply situation and every Italian decision. Knowledge that the Italians were going to retire from Kassala prompted the British to begin their invasion of the AOI on 19 January instead of 8 February, from when the British <b>eavesdropped</b> <b>on</b> Italian plans and assessments of the situation, often before the recipients had decoded the signals.|$|E

2500|$|During the night, Vice-Admiral James Somerville crossed from England and met Nicholson, {{who said}} that with more guns he could hold {{on for a while}} longer and they agreed that the ships in the port should return. At dawn on 25 May, the German {{bombardment}} resumed, concentrating on the old town, where buildings fell into streets, high winds fanned fires everywhere and smoke from explosions and the fires blocked the view. The last guns of the 229th Anti-Tank Battery were knocked out and only three tanks of the 3rd RTR remained operational. Distribution of rations and ammunition was difficult and after the water mains were broken, water could only be taken from derelict wells. At [...] Schaal sent the mayor, André Gerschell, to ask Nicholson to surrender but Gerschell was sent back with a refusal. At noon, Schaal offered another opportunity to surrender and extended the [...] deadline to [...] when he found that his emissaries had been delayed, only to be refused again. The German bombardment increased during the day, despite attempts by Allied ships to bombard German gun emplacements.
