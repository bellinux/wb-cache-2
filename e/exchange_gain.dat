Generally, the literature study of earnings management indicates that the detection of earnings management can be grouped into two objectives, 1] to find variables for detecting earnings management (accruals, real activity and classification shifting) and 2] to use some advanced statistical or mathematical models to detect earnings management. This study applies a quantitative approach using secondary data of financial statements. The study was conducted on 50 companies with the largest market capitalization, 50 of the most active companies based on trading volume, 50 of the most active companies based on the value of trade and 50 of the most active companies by frequency trading. All of them are 200   public company (listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange-ID) based on IDX statistical report 2013. The results of this study are expected to provide a new method to detect earnings management and its application in the context of positive accounting theory (PAT). The results of the study proves that the model is able to detect earnings management by utilizing foreign exchange transaction losses and use these models to support PAT (particularly on debt covenant hypothesis). These results contribute that earnings management can be done by using the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>gain</b> / loss.

40|$|The {{problem of}} how to make an optimum use of a country's limited {{productive}} resources is often a crucial one to the policy makers in less developed countries (LDCs). Not surprisingly, therefore, the various methods of cost-benefit analysis have attracted much attention among professional economists and are finding a wide spread application in evaluating the social profitability of investment projects and in the planning decision-making process as well. Relatively less {{attention has been paid to}} yet another criterion of project appraisal in a developing country that has been developed independently of social cost benefit analysis - the so called domestic resource cost (DRC) approach to project appraisals. This approach is properly regarded as the application of the propositions of allocation theory when the project, or the industry in question, produces (or saves) foreign exchange. The DRC concept compares the opportunity costs of domestic resources (primary factors such as labour, capital, land) conmitted to the production of final goods with prices at which these goods can be exported or imported - the latter prices (the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>gained</b> or saved) being considered as the ensuing benefits from production.
