5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E

25|$|Construction on Glen Canyon Dam {{began with}} a {{demolition}} blast keyed by {{the push of a}} button by President Dwight D. Eisenhower at <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> the Oval Office on October 1, 1956. The first blast started clearing tunnels for water diversion. On February 11, 1959, water was diverted through the tunnels so dam construction could begin. Later that year, the bridge was completed, allowing trucks to deliver equipment and materials for the dam, and also for the new town of Page, Arizona.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, Cornish died at <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> Manhattan; {{his wife}} {{followed}} him two weeks later. Their heirs, battling over the estate in court, {{did not move}} into the property and were not as diligent in maintaining it. As a result, it began to show the signs of neglect, and in 1956 a fire gutted the mansion. Six years later, the remaining heirs sold the land to Central Hudson Gas & Electric, the Mid-Hudson's major utility, which planned to build a 600,000-kilowatt pumped storage power generating station on it.|$|E

25|$|In September 2002, Roark {{and three}} former NSA officials, William Binney, J.

Drake {{was a major}} source for the report, and gave information to DoD during its investigation of the matter. Roark tried to notify her superior, then-Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Porter Goss. She also attempted to contact William Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court at the time. In addition, Roark {{made an effort to}} inform Vice President Dick Cheney's legal counsel David Addington, who had been a Republican staff colleague of hers on the committee in the 1980s. Addington was later revealed by a Washington Post report to be the author of the controlling legal and technical documents for the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program, typing the documents on a Tempest-shielded computer across from <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> room 268 of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and storing them in a vault in his office.

500|$|The Distrest Poet is an oil {{painting}} produced sometime around 1736 by the British artist William Hogarth. Reproduced as an etching and engraving, {{it was published}} in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740. The scene was probably inspired by Alexander Pope's satirical poem The Dunciad. [...] It depicts a scene in a small, dingy attic room where a poet sits at <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> the dormer and, scratching his head, stares at the papers on the desk before him, evidently looking for inspiration to complete the poem he is writing. [...] Near him sits his wife darning clothes, surprised by the entrance of a milkmaid, who impatiently demands payment of debts.|$|E

[...] McKinley, {{on the other}} hand, convinced that his [...] "sound money" [...] campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, [...] "I {{do not know what}} you think about it, but I believe it is a good deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world." ...|$|E

500|$|Back in Auburn, Seward {{began his}} memoirs, but only reached his thirties before putting it aside to write of his travels. [...] In these months he was {{steadily}} growing weaker.

[...] Seward grew worse during the day, as his family gathered around him. [...] Asked {{if he had any}} final words, he said, [...] "Love one another." [...] Seward died that afternoon. His funeral a few days later was preceded by the people of Auburn and nearby filing past his open casket for four hours. Thurlow Weed was there for the burial of his friend, and Harriet Tubman, a former slave whom the Sewards had aided, sent flowers. President Grant sent his regrets he could not be there.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were critical. WhatCulture {{reviewer}} Joseph Kratzer {{awarded the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars and wrote, [...] "Now that's what I'm talking about – few things are better in art than having your expectations overturned and 'The Pool Party' pleasantly surprised me with the efficacy of its execution." [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave gave the episode a 9/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I think 'Pool Party' is my favorite episode so far this season. The Robert California and Erin/Dwight/Andy story lines were rock solid. Previous excursions out of the office have been blah, but the pool party setting really complimented the ensemble – and the sharp writing." [...] Michael Tedder from New York Magazine called the episode the season's second best, after [...] "Trivia." [...] In addition, many critics wrote positively of the characters and their actions. Jill Mader from InsidePulse wrote that while, [...] " [...] storyline itself was just OK... Ellie Kemper was hilarious." [...] Many reviewers, including McNutt and Forcella, found Kevin's lines and actions to be particularly memorable, most notably, his declaration that Val was racist after she asked if Darryl could swim. A variety of reviewers found the cold-opening, featuring Jim pranking Dwight by placing meatballs in <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to make Stanley laugh, funny.|$|E

2500|$|Buckley died at {{his home}} in Stamford, Connecticut, on February 27, 2008.

[...] "He died with his boots on", his son Christopher Buckley said, [...] "after a lifetime of riding pretty tall in the saddle." [...] Subsequently, however, in his 2009 book Losing Mum and Pup: A Memoir, Christopher Buckley admitted that this account was an embellishment on his part: his father had actually been found lying on the floor of his study after suffering a fatal heart attack. At the time of his death, he had been suffering from emphysema and diabetes. In a December 3, 2007, column, Buckley commented on the cause of his emphysema, citing his lifelong habit of smoking tobacco, despite endorsing a legal ban of it. Buckley's body was buried at the Saint Bernard Cemetery in Sharon, Connecticut, next to his wife Patricia's.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Hell Bent", the TARDIS {{gives the}} Doctor {{a brand new}} sonic {{screwdriver}}. The new screwdriver has a TARDIS-blue shaft with gold and silver highlights. The upper half is a rectangular light grid that, when switched on, has four different functions: green light with low-pitched sound, blue light with high-pitched sound, green lights that pulse with a pulsing sound, and a blue light chasing pattern with a pulsing sound. The new sonic screwdriver is meant to represent the TARDIS. The Doctor first uses it in [...] "The Husbands of River Song" [...] (although he also employs the sonic sunglasses earlier in the episode). The new screwdriver has seen use in the spin-off show Class, where the Doctor increases the voltage of flood lights to expel the Shadow Kin and partially close a rift in space-time. He is shown to have working copies of every version of the Sonic Screwdriver ever seen before in a cup on <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> [...] "The Pilot."
