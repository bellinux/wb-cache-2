40|$|SummaryHow the genomic {{landscape}} of a tumor shapes and is shaped by anti-tumor immunity {{has not been}} systematically explored. Using large-scale genomic data sets of solid tissue tumor biopsies, we quantified the cytolytic activity of the local immune infiltrate and identified associated properties across 18 tumor types. The number of predicted MHC Class I-associated neoantigens was correlated with cytolytic activity and was lower than expected in colorectal and other tumors, suggesting immune-mediated elimination. We identified recurrently mutated genes that showed positive association with cytolytic activity, including beta- 2 -microglobulin (B 2 M), HLA-A, -B and -C and Caspase 8 (CASP 8), highlighting loss of antigen presentation and blockade of extrinsic apoptosis as key strategies of resistance to cytolytic activity. <b>Genetic</b> <b>amplifications</b> were also associated with high cytolytic activity, including immunosuppressive factors such as PDL 1 / 2 and ALOX 12 B/ 15 B.

40|$|Attaching and effacing Escherichia coli are {{involved}} in diarrhea in 2 to 8 -week old calves. The virulence factors of these bacteria include: (i) the secretion of proteins (i. e.

We investigated the presence and the pathotype of these strains in several calf populations by colony hybridization or by <b>genetic</b> <b>amplification.</b> Using the colony hybridization method we showed first that only 5 % of calves who died from diarrhea presented EaeA+ E. coli strains and secondly that 19 % of healthy calves showed an asymptomatic carriage. However, using colony hybridization and <b>genetic</b> <b>amplification,</b> we identified EaeA+ strains in 91 % of calves living in farms with recurrent diarrhea problems. In 66 % of the calves, there was a correlation between the presence of AEEC and diarrhea. At the pathotype level, most of the EaeA+ isolates were negative for VT probes. In VT+ bacteria, the majority were VT 1 +. The number of VT positive bacteria was significantly higher in calves who died from diarrhea than in healthy or sick calves. This underlined the aggravating role of verotoxins in the disease. Moreover, only 25 % of the bovine AEEC were positive with the EaeB probe.

40|$|Background: Bilaterality {{in breast}} cancer is a rare event and {{together}} with an early onset of disease points towards inheritance of the disease. However, most cases seem to occur sporadically, either in a synchronous or metachronous manner. Methods: Thirty two invasive carcinomas and one in situ carcinoma from 16 patients with synchronous, bilateral breast cancer were investigated by means of comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) and polymerase chain reaction based multiplex microsatellite analysis. The results were analysed conventionally and were also subjected to a biomathematical cluster analysis. Results: On average, bilateral breast cancer cases showed a low number of genetic alterations, a low frequency of <b>genetic</b> <b>amplifications,</b> and {{a high rate of}} chromosomal 16 q losses. A distinct, character-istic genetic alteration associated with bilateral breast disease could not be found. Although two tumour pairs appeared to be related using biomathematical processing for microsatellite analysis, this result was reproduced by CGH data processing in one patient only. Conclusions: Most synchronous, bilateral breast cancer cases seem to represent independent tumours rather than metastatic events. Nevertheless, the possibility of a specific susceptibility remains. Theoretically, from a tumour biological point of view, thecoincidental occurrence of two independent malignanttumours within one organ or an organ system, such as th...|$|R

Second, we combined measurements of protein production and degradation and mRNA dynamics so as to build a quantitative genomic model of the differential regulation of gene expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse dendritic cells. Changes in mRNA abundance play a dominant role in determining most dynamic fold changes in protein levels. Conversely, the preexisting proteome of proteins performing basic cellular functions is remodeled primarily through changes in protein production or degradation, accounting {{for more than half}} of the absolute change in protein molecules in the cell. Thus, the proteome is regulated by transcriptional induction for newly activated cellular functions and by protein lifecycle changes for remodeling of preexisting functions. by Michael Steven Rooney.

MYCN is itself a target of let- 7, a tumour suppressor family of microRNAs implicated in numerous cancers.

Here we show, however, that LIN 28 B is dispensable in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines, despite de-repression of let- 7. We further demonstrate that MYCN messenger RNA levels in amplified disease are exceptionally high and sufficient to sponge let- 7, which reconciles the dispensability of LIN 28 B. We found that genetic loss of let- 7 is common in neuroblastoma, inversely associated with MYCN amplification, and independently associated with poor outcomes, providing a rationale for chromosomal loss patterns in neuroblastoma.

Intrinsic or acquired resistance can be caused by a range of mechanisms, including increased drug elimination, decreased drug uptake, drug inactivation and alterations of drug targets. Recent data showed that other than by well-known <b>genetic</b> (mutation, <b>amplification)</b> and epigenetic (DNA hypermethylation, histone post-translational modification) modifications, drug resistance mechanisms might also be regulated by splicing aberrations. This is a rapidly growing field of investigation that deserves future attention in order to plan more effective therapeutic approaches. The protocol described in this paper is aimed at investigating the impact of aberrant splicing on drug resistance in solid tumors and hematological malignancies. To this goal, we analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of several in vitro models through RNA-seq and established a qRT-PCR based method to validate candidate genes. In particular, we evaluated the differential splicing of DDX 5 and PKM transcripts. The aberrant splicing detected by the computational tool MATS was validated in leukemic cells, showing that different DDX 5 splice variants are expressed in the parental vs. resistant cells. In these cells, we also observed a higher PKM 2 /PKM 1 ratio, which was not detected in the Panc- 1 gemcitabineresistant counterpart compared to parental Panc- 1 cells, suggesting a different mechanism of drug-resistance induced by gemcitabine exposure...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{performed}} to analyze the genetic characterization using RFLP-ITS and Intron (primer EI 1) markers and the amplification of the cap 20 pathogenicity gene by PCR in Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolates of different hosts plant. The genetic variability was accessed using RFLP-ITS and Intron markers and grouping by UPGMA method. Primers to cap 20 gene were constructed using selected sequences of the GenBank (National Center of Biotechnology Information, [URL] with the Primer 3 program. The dendrograms analysis showed that the RFLP-ITS marker was more informative to separate the Colletotrichum sp, and that primer EI 1 demonstrated greater <b>genetic</b> diversity. The <b>amplification</b> of the DNA of the Colletotrichum isolates to the cap 20 gene with primers P 1 and P 2 indicated that this gene could present variations into C. gloeosporioides related with the host, and also that it was present in other Colletotrichum sp...|$|R
