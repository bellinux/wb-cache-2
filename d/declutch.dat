We had a permanent mechanic up there {{and he was always}} deep inside the bonnet of this or that car. But I had some nice cars to drive, and when they worked they were great fun. And, of course, I was old enough to remember how to double <b>declutch</b> and all that sort of thing, so they weren't a shock to me." ...|$|E

40|$|The solo duck wave-energy {{converter}} (WEC) captures {{power in}} a point absorber manner, hence it exhibits high power-capture efficiency within only a narrow bandwidth. Passive control {{is characterized by a}} unidirectional power flow, and thus its engineering implementation can be simplified. In this paper, two typical passive control strategies, latching and <b>declutching</b> control, are applied to the solo duck WEC to improve its power-capture performance at wave periods larger and smaller than the natural period of the WEC, respectively. Special attention is paid to the peak value of instantaneous WEC performance parameters, including the peak motion excursion, the peak power take-off (PTO) moment, and the peak-to-average power ratio, when the captured power is maximized. Performance differences between the linear and coulomb loads are also investigated. Results show that both latching and <b>declutching</b> control can effectively improve captured power, but also incidentally increase the peak motion excursion and peak-to-average power ratio. When under latching and <b>declutching</b> control, the coulomb load leads to the same maximum relative capture width and peak motion excursion as the linear load, but presents smaller peak PTO moment and peak-to-average power ratio than the linear load, hence making the coulomb load the better choice for the solo duck WEC...|$|R
5000|$|Neither Bugatti's U-16 or the King-Bugatti were {{particularly}} successful engines. Few were installed in aircraft, {{and even fewer}} actually flew.

In 1920 Breguet showed a [...] "quadrimoteur" [...] made of two Type U-24s coupled together, with provision to <b>declutch</b> any cylinder bank to enable it to be stopped while the other three units continued to provide power.|$|E
50|$|Navy {{test pilot}} Cdr. Hugh Wood was killed {{attempting}} {{to land the}} first prototype XA2D-1, BuNo 122988, on 19 December 1950, on its 15th flight. He was unable to check the rate of descent, resulting in a high-impact crash on the runway. Investigation found the starboard power section of the coupled Allison XT40A turboprop engine had failed and did not <b>declutch,</b> allowing the Skyshark to fly {{on the power of}} the opposite section, nor did the propellers feather. As the wings' lift disappeared, a fatal sink rate was induced. Additional instrumentation and an automatic decoupler was added to the second prototype, but {{by the time it was}} ready to fly on 3 April 1952, sixteen months had passed, and with all-jet designs being developed, the A2D program was essentially dead. Total flight time on the lost airframe was barely 20 hours.|$|E
5000|$|In 1920 Mr Ashton-Evans {{decided to}} find out what his {{customers}} wanted in an [...] "owner driver's ideal" [...] car and invited opinions. From the response he worked out that the car should have a four-cylinder water cooled engine not exceeding 12 taxable hp and be silent, vibrationless, easy to start and powerful. Gear changing should be silent and without the need to double <b>declutch.</b> There should be room for three people on the front seat. To meet this specification J Bedford designed a new car which became the Ashton 10.5 model, the Ashton-Evans name being temporarily dropped. This had a normal rear axle. Most cars featured -litre, 4-cylinder Coventry Simplex engines and three-speed constant-mesh gearboxes with selection made by dog clutches. Some of the early cars might have had two-cylinder engines. Two- and four-seat open bodies were available.|$|E
50|$|The new MCT {{transmission}} {{is essentially the}} 7G-Tronic transmission without a torque converter. Instead of a torque converter, it uses a compact wet startup clutch to start the car off, and also supports computer-controlled double <b>declutching.</b> The MCT (Multi-Clutch Technology) acronym refers to a planetary (automatic) transmission’s multiple clutches and bands for each gear.|$|R
50|$|Early {{semi-automatic}} systems used {{a variety}} of mechanical and hydraulic systems—including centrifugal clutches, torque converters, electro-mechanical (and even electrostatic) and servo/solenoid controlled clutches—and control schemes—automatic <b>declutching</b> when moving the gearstick, pre-selector controls, centrifugal clutches with drum-sequential shift requiring the driver to lift the throttle for a successful shift, etc.—and some were little more than regular lock-up torque converter automatics with manual gear selection.|$|R
50|$|The Meadows engine {{drove the}} tracks though a four-speed gearbox {{to the front}} drive wheels. Steering was a {{combination}} of <b>declutching</b> the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The track was tensioned by a rear idler—which being set at the same height as the drive sprocket was new in British tank designs—and returned over three rollers.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} is a summary of information was received from Limitorque via facsimile: "On August 2, 2011, Flowserve-Limitorque was notified by Browns Ferry Nuclear (BFN) Generating Station that a Limitorque SMB- 5 T valve actuator (1 -MVOP- 074 - 052) had failed to run open automatically during {{the performance of a}} stroke test. Electrical maintenance personnel working at the valve reported an abnormal mechanical noise. Upon disassembly, {{it was found that the}} driving lugs on both the sliding clutch gear and the flexible clutch were seriously worn with a significant amount of deformation. Further investigation by BFN showed that the <b>declutch</b> mechanism would not allow full engagement of the drive lugs on the sliding clutch and flexible clutch. These lugs must be engaged for motor operation to take place. The <b>declutch</b> mechanism required adjustment to allow full drive lug engagement. "Following reassembly of the SMB- 5 T on 1 -MVOP- 074 - 052, an inspection was performed of the SMB- 5 T on valve 1 -MVOP- 074 - 066 which was manufactured and supplied to TVA at the same time. This actuator was functioning normally at the time of the inspection. Disassembly of the clutch compartment revealed evidence of deformation of the clutch drive lugs. To better evaluate the operation of the clutch components, the grease was cleaned out of the compartment and a boroscope used so that the action of the clutch could be seen. Boroscope examination of several declutching and re-clutching tests showed that the clutch lugs would not engage fully. The majo...|$|E

50|$|These {{control the}} {{transmission}} system, mainly the shifting of the gears for better shift comfort and to lower torque interrupt while shifting. Automatic transmissions use controls for their operation, and also many semi-automatic transmissions having a fully automatic clutch or a semi-auto clutch (<b>declutching</b> only). The {{engine control unit}} and the transmission control exchange messages, sensor signals and control signals for their operation.|$|R
50|$|Another {{approach}} was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream {{up through the}} rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the C.19 Mk.4, which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed. The system was then <b>declutched</b> prior to executing the take-off run.|$|R
50|$|A few cars, {{notably the}} Alfa Romeo Alfetta, Porsche 924, and Chevrolet Corvette (since 1997), sought a more even weight {{distribution}} between {{front and back}} by placing {{the weight of the}} transmission {{at the rear of the}} car, combined with the rear axle to form a transaxle. The clutch was mounted with the transaxle and so the propeller shaft rotated continuously with the engine, even when in neutral gear or <b>declutched.</b>|$|R

I-Shift borrowed from old transmission technologies like non-synchronised main gears which allowed a reduction in size and weight and a countershaft brake to achieve more precise shift control while matching engine rpm to transmissions rpm e.g. TECU requests the EECU to correct engine rpm so as to synchronise the rpm to effect a smooth gear change, similar to double <b>declutching.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of jump take-off was another major improvement in capability. The rotor was accelerated in no-lift pitch until the rotor speed required for flight was achieved, and then <b>declutched.</b> The loss of torque caused the blades to swing forward on angled drag hinges with a resultant increase in collective pitch, causing the aircraft to {{leap into the}} air. With all the engine power now applied to the forward thrusting propeller, it was now possible to continue in forward flight with the rotor in autorotation.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the MG, the 15/50 engine {{had only}} a single SU {{carburettor}} so the power output was slightly less at [...] at 4400 rpm. Unlike the 4/44, the 15/50 had a floor gear change. From 1956 a [...] "Manumatic" [...] two pedal (centrifugal clutch) transmission was an option. This was controlled by a micro switch hidden in the gear lever operating a vacuum servo. Having no synchromesh on bottom gear could make changes into the lowest ratio, which would normally require double <b>declutching,</b> difficult.|$|R
50|$|In {{a gearbox}} with neutral between gears, a typical shift {{actually}} involves two gear changes, once into neutral, and {{again into the}} next gear. During any shift, disconnecting drive components via a clutch unloads the engine and transmission of the force from the opposing components. Using the clutch for each shift out of, and then into, each gear is double (<b>de)clutching.</b> Due {{to the absence of}} a neutral spacing, double clutching is ill-advised for sequential gear changes, as in a fully sequential gearbox such as a typical motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} {{features}} {{in which the}} Volvo 66 differs from the DAF 66 are also mostly safety related. It has different seats featuring headrests, a safety steering wheel, steel side-impact bars in the doors, a <b>declutching</b> servo which enabled the driver to change gear with the choke engaged (In the older DAF models this was not possible, because the increased idle caused the centrifugal clutch to engage). The Volvo 66 also has a 'park' mode in the CVT, which locks the driveline. From 1977 the estate version featured a window wiper on the bootlid.|$|R

The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as <b>declutching</b> by [...] "paddle neutral" [...] — comparable to pressing the clutch with a conventional manual gearbox - and Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 991 GT3, there is rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock.|$|R
5000|$|Pulse and Glide {{consists}} of rapid acceleration {{to a given}} speed (the [...] "pulse" [...] or [...] "burn"), followed by a period of coasting or gliding down to a lower speed, {{at which point the}} burn-coast sequence is repeated. Coasting is most efficient when the engine is not running, although some gains can be realized with the engine on (to maintain power to brakes, steering and ancillaries) and the vehicle in neutral. Most modern petrol vehicles cut off the fuel supply completely when coasting (over-running) in gear, although the moving engine adds considerable frictional drag and speed is lost more quickly than with the engine <b>declutched</b> from the drivetrain.|$|R
50|$|A {{major problem}} with the {{autogyro}} was driving the rotor before takeoff. Several methods were attempted {{in addition to the}} coiled rope system, which could take the rotor speed to 50% of that required, at which point movement along the ground to reach flying speed was necessary, while tilting the rotor to establish autorotation. Another approach was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream up through the rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the C.19 Mk.4, which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed. The system was then <b>declutched</b> before the take-off run.|$|R

This topology of motor has been selected in order to obviate the presence of external <b>declutching</b> system (i. e. mechanical or electromagnetic clutch) interposed between the electric actuator and the wheel. An axial force contributes to move the rotor inside-out of the stator (principle of sliding-rotor). The axial movement of the rotor can be monitored acting on the magnetizing current.
