40|$|The ICRP {{recognises}} {{three types}} of <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> (planned, <b>existing</b> and emergency). In all three situations, the release of radionuclides into the natural environment leads to exposures of non-human biota, {{as well as the}} potential for exposures of the public. This paper describes how the key principles of the ICRP system of radiological protection apply to non-human biota and members of the public in each of these <b>exposure</b> <b>situations.</b> Current work in this area within ICRP Task Group (TG) 105 is highlighted. For example, how simplified numeric criteria may be used in planned <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> that are protective of both the public and non-human biota. In emergency <b>exposure</b> <b>situations,</b> the initial response will always be focused on human protection however, understanding the potential impacts of radionuclide releases on non-human biota will likely become important in terms of communication as governments and the public seek to understand the exposures that are occurring. For <b>existing</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>situations,</b> we need to better understand the potential impacts of radionuclides on animals and plants especially when deciding on protective actions. Understanding the comparative impacts from radiological, non-radiological and physical aspects is often important in managing remediating legacy sites.

40|$|The IAEA Technical Report Series (TRS) {{handbook}} on {{transfer of}} radionuclides to human foodstuffs from terrestrial and freshwater systems {{has recently been}} revised during the EMRAS I programme [1]. The document updates the previous handbook (TRS 364) and constitutes {{an important source of}} information for transfer parameters for the human foodchain. Quantification of the rates of transfer of radionuclides through foodchains to humans has long been a key focus of radiation protection. More recently, there has been a move away from radiation protection being solely anthropogenic to one which also considers protection of the environment as recognised by both the IAEA [2] and the ICRP [3] in their Fundamental Safety Principles and revised Recommendations, respectively, both of which now include the need to protect the environment. To address these recommendations and safety principles, the consequences of radiological releases need to be considered in part by estimating an internal dose. To do this, the transfer of radionuclides to wildlife of interest needs to be quantified. 	In response to the need for a reference source of information on radionuclide transfer to wildlife, the IAEA initiated the development of a TRS handbook, which has been supported by interaction with the EMRAS II Working Group 5, ([URL] The TRS handbook has been finalised and is currently going through the IAEA approval process. The TRS handbook provides equilibrium concentration ratio values for wildlife groups in terrestrial, freshwater, marine and estuarine environments.

40|$|THE NEW EU BASIC SAFETY STANDARDS DIRECTIVEP. Hill, B. Heuel-Fabianek Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, S, 52425 Jülich, GermanyEuratom Treaty (1957) : Article 30 of {{the treaty}} {{together}} with Article 2 and Article 31 is the legal basis for establishing European basic safety standards {{for the protection of}} people against dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiations. They shall ensure the highest possible protection of workers, members of the public and patients. European Basic Safety Standards: The first directive was adopted in 1959. In 1962, 1966, 1976, 1980, 1984 and 1996 the Directive was amended. Following a legislative resolution of the European Parliament the latest revision (Council Directive 2013 / 59 /Euratom) was adopted by the European Council on December, 15 th 2013 and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on January 17 th, 2013. It combines five existing Euratom Directives (BSS, Medical Exposures, Public Information, Outrside Workers and Control of High-Activity Sealed Radioactive Sources and Orphan Sources) and a recommendation (Radon). All 28 member states of the European Union have to implement the new Directive and transform it into national regulation by February 6 th, 2018. Main features: The 2013 revision covers all radiation sources (including natural radiation) as well as all <b>exposure</b> <b>situations.</b> It integrates the protection of workers, members of the public, patients and the environment. It is based on latest scientific findings and recommendations as e. g. ICRP publication 103 (2007). The dose limit for occupational exposure is now 20 mSv in any single year. A new dose limit has been adapted for the lens of the eye (20 mSv per year). National dose registries are required and a dose pass book is foreseen. Workers in workplaces with Radon, workers in NORM industries, air/space crews and emergency workers are consistently treated according to the occupational radiation protection regime. In the protection of members of the public special emphasis is given to protection from natural sources of radiation (e. g. Radon), to <b>existing</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> (e. g. contaminated areas) and planned <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> (e. g. environmental monitoring). The protection of patients is improved by strenthening the safety culture in the medical area (e. g. justification, risk analysis, informed consent). Deliberate exposures of individuals for non-medical purposes (e. g. detection of concealed objects in or on the human body) are restricted and need a sound justification. Emergency preparedness demands e. g. the risk assessment of potential emergency sitiuations, the establishment of reference levels and the establishment of emergency response plans. In emergency response an immediate notification of the event. assessment of the consequences, appropriate protective measures to mitigate the consequences and information of the public is foreseen...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{deals with}} the option of {{employing}} the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic (ACR) when a radiation emergency is imminent. Primarily, it focuses on evaluation of selected devices designed for radiation reconnaissance; summarising of radiation protection related legislation; and study of approved procedures. At its beginning, this Thesis tracks the origin of early detection systems at {{the territory of the}} then Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and their gradual evolution into the the existing form. From the radiation emergency point of view, this nationwide system represents a priceless help for monitoring of radioactive contamination dispersion and for warning. The following part sums up basic information on what is an ionizing radiation, how it comes into being and which basic quantities describe it. This part also contains basic type distinction, description of consequences for human organism and the most significant interactions of sources of ionizing radiation that could be misused with the most probability. This specific topic is introduced here because of the subsequent part of this Thesis being named Radiological Dispersion Device, or the dirty bomb. The significant part of this Thesis is the summary and classification of related legislation. The first documents referred to are two international standards. Publication 103 the 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection is dealing, inter alia, with dosing limits determining dose levels in planned <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> and reference levels used for emergency <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> and <b>existing</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>situations.</b> Publication 96 Protecting People against Radiation Exposure in the Event of a Radiological Attack is more substantial for this Thesis since it partly copes with the protection of front-line units including Integrated Rescue System (IRS) components and it specifies maximum exposure time for intervening personnel. Based on the IRS Catalogue of Typical Activities (STC 01 /IZS), Materialised and Verified Use of a Radiological Weapon, the ACR {{would be one of the}} intervening components in such an attack. This Thesis analyses in detail individual ACR procedures starting with activities before employment, through threat prevention, event reaction to post-event activities like decontamination followed by monitoring of personnel contamination and their health condition. The practical part deals mainly with one of the Thesis´s goals which was evaluation of selected dosimetric devices used by the military for radiation reconnaissance. For this purpose, the quantitative research processing their main parameters was applied. The analysis within a selected sample was used for comparing and the sumary index IVi then showed the status of device applicability for contemporary use in radiation emergency. The pre-defined goals of this Thesis have been met implementing the above methods. The comparison of individual devices and their evaluation in respect to their applicability in joint radiation emergency operation with other IRS components has been carried out via discussion. It has been found out that some of the devices are obsolete and do not comply with the requirements for this job. This fact reflects the reality that these devices were designed in the period of a potential nuclear war. This corresponds with their robust structure and high level of sensitivity which is not desirable for a radiation emergency. The most severe problem, however, seems to be the fact that some devices measure quantities in old, no more used, units which could cause misinterpretation. On the other hand, other devices are modern, sensitive at low levels of dose input and offer real-time information on a well organised LCD display. To answer the question of ACR´s readiness to intervene in a radiation emergency one has to say that the ACR is ready to meet its rescue and consequence management tasks at a satisfactory level...|$|R

Currently, the Techa Cascade of Water Reservoirs is the only source of contamination of this river that could be managed. In February 2016 the Chief Executive Officer of the State Corporation “ROSATOM” approved the «Strategic master-plan on {{the solution of the}} problems of the Techa Reservoir Cascade» providing a novel look at an issue of remediation of the Techa river. The aim of the article is the implementation of the modern radiation protection system to the <b>existing</b> or potential <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> of public residing near the Techa river and an analysis of possible features, events, and processes considered in the longterm forecasts performed in the field of public radiation safety. Although the current radiation state of the Techa River is relatively stable, the task of refining the traditional phenomenological retrospective analysis covering the assessment of the past and current radiation exposure and environmental impacts is considered quite relevant. The Calculation- monitoring complex “TCR-Prognoz” was developed in the framework of the “Strategic Master Plan”.  This complex enables to evaluate multivariate scenario calculations resulting in long-term forecasts of radioactive contamination levels in the Techa River and its floodplain, depending on various sets of environmental conditions and anthropogenic factors. Complex radiation surveys to define the detailed character and the time frames of economic activities permitted under the existing radiation safety requirements in the floodplain of the Techa river are recommended to be started after 2020.

Nevertheless, efforts to assess and quantify deleterious effects at low exposure levels are directed mainly towards radiation as a single isolated agent, and rarely towards the concomitant presence of other natural and anthropogenic toxicants. Only these combined exposures may lead to observable health risk effects. In addition they might differ from those expected from simple addition of the individual risks due to potential interaction. The existing data base on combined effects is rudimentary, mainly descriptive and rarely covers exposure ranges large enough to make direct inferences to present day low <b>exposure</b> <b>situations.</b> Therefore, any risk assessment will have to consider the question whether combined effects, i e. interaction between two or more agents will influence the health outcome from specific <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> {{in such a way that}} predictions derived from simple standard <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> would have to be revised.

In the European Union (EU), the practice of risk assessments for chemicals is laid down in a Technical Guidance Document; it is designed to consider environmental and human occupational and residential exposure. Almost 70 EU risk assessment reports (RARs) have been finalized for high-production-volume chemicals during the last decade. In the present study, we analyze the assessment of occupational and consumer exposure to trichloroethylene and phthalates presented in six EU RARs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Occupational {{exposure}} to manufactured nano-objects and their agglomerates, and aggregates (NOAA) {{has been described}} in several workplace air monitoring studies. However, data pooling for general conclusions and exposure estimates are hampered by limited exposure data across the occupational life cycle of NOAA and a lack in comparability between the methods of collecting and analysing the data. By applying a consistent method of collecting and analysing the workplace exposure data, this study aimed {{to provide information about}} the occupational NOAA exposure levels across various life cycle stages of NOAA in the Netherlands which can also be used for multi-purpose use. METHODS: Personal/near field task-based exposure data was collected using a multi-source exposure assessment method collecting real time particle number concentration, particle size distribution (PSD), filter-based samples for morphological, and elemental analysis and detailed contextual information. A decision logic was followed allowing a consistent and objective way of analysing the exposure data. RESULTS: In total, 46 measurement surveys were conducted at 15 companies covering 18 different <b>exposure</b> <b>situations</b> across various occupational life cycle stages of NOAA. Highest activity-effect levels were found during replacement of big bags (< 1000 - 76000 # cm(- 3)), mixing/dumping of powders manually (< 1000 - 52000 # cm(- 3)) and mechanically (< 1000 - 100000 # cm(- 3)), and spraying of liquid (2000 - 800000 # cm(- 3)) showing a high variability between and within the various <b>exposure</b> <b>situations.</b> In general, a limited change in PSD was found during the activity compared to the background.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of risks to human health from chemicals is of major concern for policy and industry and ultimately benefits all citizens. In this process, exposure assessment is {{generally considered to be}} the weakest point, because currently available tools show major flaws such as lack of integrated approach for {{assessment of}} combined stressors (i. e. a number of potential pollutants), widespread use of 'worst-case' scenarios leading to over-conservative results and lack of uncertainty/sensitivity tools that allow identifying the important exposure drivers. To overcome these drawbacks, the FP 6 project 2 -FUN produced prototype software containing a library of models for exposure assessment, coupling environmental multimedia and pharmacokinetic models. The objective of the 4 FUN project is to demonstrate, innovate and exploit this prototype software, to standardise it, to transfer it to stakeholders and guarantee its long term technical and economic viability.
