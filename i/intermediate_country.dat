60|$|So Marco {{went and}} found Forester. When Forester {{heard of the}} plan he was quite {{inclined}} to accede to it. He had been much engaged in studying for some time, and had had very little exercise and recreation, {{so that he was}} easily persuaded to undertake an expedition. The plan was all soon agreed upon. The horses had been put out to pasture at a farmer's up the river about twelve miles. In going that twelve miles the river took a great turn, so that in fact the farm where the horses were pastured was not, in a straight line, more than four miles from Mr. Forester's house. But the <b>intermediate</b> <b>country</b> was a desolate and almost impassable region of forests and mountains. There was, indeed, a sort of footpath by which it was possible for men to get through, but this path was dangerous, and in fact almost impracticable for horses. So James had formed the plan of walking through the woods by the path, and then of coming home by the road, riding one of the horses and leading the other.|$|E

6000|$|The next turn in {{the road}} brought them within view of the open country again. Ahead of the carriage, Captain Wragge saw a long dark line against the sky--the line of the sea-wall which protects the low coast of Essex from inundation. The flat <b>intermediate</b> <b>country</b> was intersected by a {{labyrinth}} of tidal streams, winding up from the invisible sea in strange fantastic curves--rivers at high water, and channels of mud at low. On his right hand was a quaint little village, mostly composed of wooden houses, straggling down {{to the brink of}} one of the tidal streams. On his left hand, further away, rose the gloomy ruins of an abbey, with a desolate pile of buildings, which covered two sides of a square attached to it. One of the streams from the sea (called, in Essex, [...] "backwaters") curled almost entirely round the house. Another, from an opposite quarter, appeared to run straight through the grounds, and to separate one side of the shapeless mass of buildings, which was in moderate repair, from another, which was little better than a ruin. Bridges of wood and bridges of brick crossed the stream, and gave access to the house from all points of the compass. No human creature appeared in the neighborhood, and no sound was heard but the hoarse barking of a house-dog from an invisible courtyard.|$|E
60|$|As soon as Harold had {{completed}} his encampment, he {{expressed a desire}} to Gurth to ride across the <b>intermediate</b> <b>country</b> and take a view of William's lines. Such an undertaking was less dangerous then than it would be at the present day; for now, such a reconnoitering party would be discovered from the enemy's encampment, at a great distance, by means of spy-glasses, and a twenty-four-pound shot or a shell would be sent from a battery to blow the party to pieces or drive them away. The only danger then was of being pursued by a detachment of horsemen from the camp, or surrounded by an ambuscade. To guard against these dangers, Harold and Gurth took the most powerful and fleetest horses in the camp, and they called out a small but strong guard of well-selected men to escort them. Thus provided and attended, they rode over to the enemy's lines, and advanced so near that, from a small eminence to which they ascended, they could survey the whole scene of William's encampment: the palisades and embankments with which it was guarded, which extended for miles; the long lines of tents within; the vast multitude of soldiers; the knights and officers riding to and fro, glittering with steel; and the grand pavilion of the duke himself, with the consecrated banner of the cross floating above it. Harold was very much impressed with the grandeur of the spectacle.|$|E
60|$|Monte Hermoso {{is between}} fifty and sixty miles distant in a S.E. {{line from the}} Ventana, with the <b>intermediate</b> <b>country</b> gently rising towards it, and all {{consisting}} of the Pampean formation. What relation, then, do these beds, {{at the level of}} the sea and under it, bear to those on the flanks of the Ventana, at the height of 840 feet, and on the flanks of the other neighbouring sierras, which, from the reasons already assigned, do not appear to owe their greater height to unequal elevation? When the tosca- rock was accumulating round the Ventana, and when, with the exception of a few small rugged primary islands, the whole wide surrounding plains must have been under water, were the strata at Monte Hermoso depositing at the bottom of a great open sea, between eight hundred and one thousand feet in depth? I much doubt this; for if so, the almost perfect carcasses of the several small rodents, the remains of which are so very numerous in so limited a space, must have been drifted to this spot from the distance of many hundred miles. It appears to me far more probable, that during the Pampean period this whole area had commenced slowly rising (and in the cliffs, at several different heights we have proofs of the land having been exposed to sea-action at several levels), and that tracts of land had thus been formed of Pampean sediment round the Ventana and the other primary ranges, on which the several rodents and other quadrupeds lived, and that a stream (in which perhaps the extinct aquatic Hydrochoerus lived) drifted their bodies into the adjoining sea, into which the Pampean mud continued to be poured from the north. As the land continued to rise, it appears that this source of sediment was cut off; and in its place sand and pebbles were borne down by stronger currents, and conformably deposited over the Pampean strata.|$|E

6000|$|The {{existence}} of any place called Gergesa, however, is declared by the weightiest authorities whom I have consulted {{to be very}} questionable; and no such town is mentioned {{in the list of}} the cities of the Decapolis, in the territory of which (as it would seem from Mark v. 20) the transaction was supposed to take place. About Gerasa, on the other hand, there hangs no such doubt. It was a large and important member of the group of the Decapolitan cities. But Gerasa is more than thirty miles distant from the nearest part of the Lake of Tiberias, while the city mentioned in the narrative could not have been very far off the scene of the event. However, as Gerasa was a very important Hellenic city, {{not much more than a}} score of miles from Gadara, it is easily imaginable that a locality which was part of Decapolitan territory may have been spoken of as belonging to one of the two cities, when it really appertained to the other. After weighing all the arguments, no doubt remains on my mind that [...] "Gadarene" [...] is the proper reading. At the period under consideration, Gadara appears to have been a good-sized fortified town, about two miles in circumference. It was a place of considerable strategic importance, inasmuch as it lay on a high ridge at the point of intersection of the roads from Tiberias, Scythopolis, Damascus, and Gerasa. Three miles north from it, where the Tiberias road descended into the valley of the Hieromices, lay the famous hot springs and the fashionable baths of Amatha. On the north-east side, the remains of the extensive necropolis of Gadara are still to be seen. {546} Innumerable sepulchral chambers are excavated in the limestone cliffs, and many of them still contain sarcophaguses of basalt; while not a few are converted into dwellings by the inhabitants of the present village of Um Keis. The distance of Gadara from the south-eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias is less than seven miles. The nearest of the other cities of the Decapolis, to the north, is Hippos, which also lay some seven miles off on the south-eastern corner of the shore of the lake. In accordance with the ancient Hellenic practice that each city should be surrounded by a certain amount of territory amenable to its jurisdiction,[154] and on the other grounds, it may be taken for certain that the <b>intermediate</b> <b>country</b> was divided between Gadara and Hippos, and that the citizens of Gadara had free access to a port on the lake. Hence the title of [...] "country of the Gadarenes" [...] applied to the locality of the porcine catastrophe becomes easily intelligible. The swine may well be imagined to have been feeding (as they do now in the adjacent region) on the hillsides, which slope somewhat steeply down to the lake from the northern boundary wall of the valley of the Hieromices (Nahr Yarmuk), about half-way between the city and the shore, and doubtless lay well within the territory of the polis of Gadara.|$|E

40|$|The Paleoproterozoic Misi region {{forms the}} northeastern {{part of the}} Peräpohja Schist Belt in {{northern}} Finland. The area comprises mafic volcanic and sedimentary rocks, differentiated gabbros, and late-orogenic granitoids. Three geochemically different mafic volcanic units were recognised: LREE-depleted amygdaloidal lavas, slightly LREE-enriched lavas, and mafic tuffs that have a flat REE pattern. Sedimentary rocks include arkosites, mica gneisses, dolomitic marbles, quartzites, tuffites, mica schists, calc-silicate rocks and graphite-bearing schists. Two types of gabbros wereidentified: one with a LREE-enriched pattern and another with flat REE pattern. The age of the former is according to Perttunen and Vaasjoki (2001) 2117 ± 4 Ma, whereas there is no age determination for the latter. The granitoid intrusions belong to the ca. 1800 Malate-orogenic group of the Central Lapland Granitoid Complex. The geochemistry and the stable isotope data on mafic lavas and dolomitic marbles show similarities with the mafic volcanic rocks and marbles of {{the lower part of}} the Kivalo group in the western part of Peräpohja Schist Belt. Peak metamorphic conditions in the region vary from upper-greenschist to upper-amphibolite facies. Three major stages of deformation were distinguished: N-S compressional D 1 with ductile deformation, NE-SW compressional D 2 with ductile to brittle-ductile deformation, and E-W compressional D 3 with brittle deformation. Several magnetite occurrences are known in the region and four of those have been mined for iron. The ores are mainly composed of magnetite with minor haematite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and bornite. Besides iron, the ores contain small amounts of P, S and V aswell as trace amounts of Cu, Co, Te and Au. The magnetite bodies are hosted by skarnoids within the ca. 2220 – 2120 Ma dolomitic marble-quartzite sequence, and highly differentiated, intensely albitised, LREE-enriched gabbro. Multistage and -type alteration is characteristic for the entire region. The styles of alteration in the region are: scapolitisation, regional and local albitisation, sericitisation and silicification associated with a major shear zone, and late carbonatisation and carbonate veining associated with brecciation of the ores and their wall rocks. Local intense albitisation and formation of skarnoids and magnetite ores took placeduring the pre-D 1 or D 1 faulting or shearing which postdate the intrusion of 2120 Ma gabbros. The iron was mobilized from the mafic to <b>intermediate</b> <b>country</b> rocks and/or marble sequence which possibly contained sedimentary iron formation.

40|$|International {{trade is}} indeed an {{essential}} policy formulation {{for the growth}} and development of a country. Developmental theories and Economic Adjustment Programmes have cited trade liberalisation {{as one of the}} policy reforms necessary for the growth of developing countries. The growing trend in world trade shows bilateral and regional agreements taking greater precedence over global or inter-regional trade and to that effect every continental region has at least one major integration movement. Almost all countries are members of at least one trade bloc and now one third of world trade takes place within such agreements. Despite these gradual developments in regional trade, economic integration of developing countries has been a failure owing to poverty, political turmoil, overlapping membership and differences in economic structure of members. Researchers have advocated for regional cooperation agreements, rather than regional trade blocs, as better schemes for developing regions. Sub-Saharan Africa is no exception. Since the early 80 s there have been major developments in the trade integration policy of Southern Africa. Efforts started with the creation of a regional cooperation scheme and a preferential trade area whose transformation into trade blocs, the current SADC and COMESA respectively, in the 90 s seem to bear good results. SADC {{is one of the few}} regional economic bodies internationally regarded as having the potential to become a success in Sub-Saharan Africa. The member countries in the two trade blocs have taken bold steps towards integration through, in the case of SADC, the creation of a trade protocol in 2000 that envisaged the formation of a free trade area by 2008 while COMESA implemented its free trade area in 2000. The consequential effects on member countries of such developments remain an interesting but debatable issue especially given a history of unsuccessful attempts to achieve economic integration. This study gives both a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of the trade blocs in Southern Africa on Zimbabwe s external trade. The motivation is to establish and possibly quantify the possible gains and costs of regional integration on member countries by looking at Zimbabwe as a case study. Particular emphasis is however put on membership in SADC. The econometric estimation carried out, through running an extended gravity model on Zimbabwe s trade volumes, reveals that economic integration can result in trade creation. There is a potential increase both in exports to and imports from the SADC region. Zimbabwe is more abundant in land and unskilled labour than it is in capital. According to the Heckshcer Ohlin Samuelson (H. O. S) theorem, Zimbabwe is expected to be exporting land and unskilled labour-intensive goods while importing capital intensive goods, so that trade would be determined by factor endowments. Models of regional integration based on factor endowments differences, for example the Venables model discussed in the thesis, predict that countries that are intermediate in terms of factor endowment ratios would gain more from integration. In the present context, South Africa and to a lesser extent Zimbabwe could be interpreted as intermediate, with some other SADC countries having less capital or skilled labour. Due to this, regional integration will promote Zimbabwe s exports even to poorer countries in the region. The results show that Zimbabwe export goods like food and live animals, crude products and beverages and tobacco (which basically are land and labour intensive) and it imports transport and machinery, chemical related products as well as mineral fuels (capital intensive goods). Such type of trade is called inter-industry trade. As pointed out in the Venables model, the effects of regional integration on trade depend on the relative position of each country with respect to others in terms of factor endowment ratios. Countries with the highest capital-labour ratio in a trade bloc benefit from integration since regional integration will divert some imports of capital-intensive goods from outside countries. In SADC, this could particularly be countries like South Africa and Botswana. Given that Zimbabwe is ranked as a lower <b>intermediate</b> <b>country</b> in terms of capital-labour ratio in the region, the major effect of regional integration might be to increase further Zimbabwe s imports of skill-capital intensive goods from South Africa and other countries with higher ratios. But there are some countries in SADC that have even less capital and skilled labour than Zimbabwe, and in that case integration may boost Zimbabwe s exports of skill and capital intensive goods to these countries. On the whole, however, one would expect regional integration to strengthen Zimbabwe s current specialisation trend, with more exports of land and labour-intensive goods. Given such a trade pattern, Intra- Industry Trade (IIT) - trade in the same type of goods that is driven by imperfect competition and market size- is limited in Zimbabwe s external trade, despite the fact that Zimbabwe is intermediate in SADC in terms of market size (although far behind South Africa). But, the econometric analysis suggests the existence of home market effect in Zimbabwe s trade: Zimbabwe is importing more differentiated goods from large countries and exporting more of such goods to small countries. According to recent theories of integration, market access as well as the size of the home market matters strongly for the production of differentiated goods. Theories predict that regional integration will transfer production of differentiated goods from outside countries to the bloc (production shifting), and from smaller to larger countries in the bloc. While Zimbabwe is a net importer of such goods, there is also here the possibility that regional integration will promote Zimbabwe s exports of such goods to smaller countries in SADC, contributing to some diversification of Zimbabwe s exports. Whether trade in scale goods could be explained by the endowment effect or scale effects may be difficult to prove empirically due to a collinearity problem. Nevertheless, both H. O. S- based theories and new trade theories predict that integration will on one hand increase Zimbabwe s imports of differentiated goods or skill/capital intensive goods from especially South Africa, but there may also be a diversification effect by promoting Zimbabwe s exports of such goods to other SADC countries. Zimbabwe s imports were observed to be decreasing with tariff. Integration and subsequent elimination of tariff will thus increase Zimbabwe s trade. A crude estimation of the potential trade creation shows that elimination of tariff may increase imports by about 50. 4 %; with 12. 1 % of this having been realised already after the partial decrease in SADC tariff while 33. 9 % is the expected increase for the remaining tariff reduction. In carrying out the analysis the thesis starts by giving a historical background of regional economic integration as well as the macroeconomic overview of Zimbabwe (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 reviews the major trade blocs in Southern Africa with greater emphasis on SADC given its importance, in terms of achievements and membership, in the region. A theoretical perspective on regional integration is presented in Chapter 3. In this chapter the trade creation and trade diversion effects of trade are discussed; the neo-classical theory of trade - the H. O. S theory-, the Venables model; the new trade theory model which include the Dixit-Norman and the Markusen and Venables models, are all discussed. The H. O S theory is ideally noted to be the most suitable theory to explain Zimbabwe s trade. Chapter 4 carries out the econometric estimations by running the natural log-linear form of the gravity equation, using the standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. Chapter 5 dwells on the critical analysis of the findings in light of the theoretical expectations. The main implication drawn is that integration, which seeks to remove tariff (and non tariff barrier), could create a potential increase in trade. A country like Zimbabwe has a chance to dominate exports of unskilled labour and land-intensive goods especially agriculture products to the SACU market which is the major importer within the region. The discussion concludes with Chapter 6 by noting that indeed Regional Economic Integration has a potential of creating more trade for Zimbabwe. Increased trade is likely to create welfare gains, but this is not examined specifically in this analysis. However, realisation of such gains depends on certain qualitative factors which this thesis cited as critical issues. These are (i) a quick resumption of political and economic stability and improvement in infrastructure in Zimbabwe to overcome supply side constraints (ii) the removal of non-tariff barriers and the opening up of the SACU market, which is the centre of trade in Southern Africa and Zimbabwe s major trading partner (iii) full commitment to the free trade blocs by member states through ratification of the agreed trade protocols and abiding by the new trade regulations...|$|E

Picture postcards allowed and encouraged many individuals to send images across national borders, and the legal availability of a postcard image in one country did not guarantee that the card would be considered [...] "proper" [...] in the destination country, or in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>countries</b> that the card would have to pass through. Some countries refused to handle postcards containing sexual references (such as of seaside scenes) or images of full or partial nudity (including images of classical statuary or paintings). Many French postcards featured naked women in erotic poses. These were described as postcards but whose primary purpose was not for sending by post because they would have been banned from delivery. Street dealers, tobacco shops, {{and a variety of other}} vendors bought the photographs for resale to tourists. The sale of erotica was banned, and many of these postcards were sold [...] "under the counter".|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Many {{medical centers}} {{routinely}} culture bronchoscopy samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, even when tuberculosis is not strongly suspected. The {{value of this}} practice, however, is controversial. We evaluated the role of that procedure in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in an <b>intermediate</b> tuberculosis-burden <b>country.</b> Patients and Methods: A prospective, observational {{study was conducted in}} a tertiary referral center and included 733 consecutive patients who underwent bronchoscopy examination. Results: M. tuberculosis was isolated in 47 patients (6. 4 %). According to radiographic features, the rate of positive culture for M. tuberculosis was relatively high in patients with atelectasis (5 / 33, 15. 2 %) and those with pulmonary infiltrations of suspicious infections (26 / 183, 14. 2 %). M. tuberculosis was isolated even in patients with pulmonary masses (9 / 266, 3. 4 %) and those with pulmonary nodules (5 / 175, 2. 9 %). In 16 / 47 (34. 0 %) patients with positive cultures for M. tuberculosis, active pulmonary tuberculosis was not suspected at the time of bronchoscopy. Conclusion: These results suggest that routinely culturing for M. tuberculosis during bronchoscopy is still useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in an <b>intermediate</b> tuberculosis-burden <b>country...</b>|$|R
