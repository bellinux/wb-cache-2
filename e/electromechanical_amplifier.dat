50|$|An {{amplidyne}} is an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>amplifier</b> invented {{prior to}} World War II by Ernst Alexanderson. It {{consists of an}} electric motor driving a DC generator. The signal to be amplified {{is applied to the}} generator's field winding, and its output voltage is an amplified copy of the field current. The amplidyne is used in industry in high power servo and control systems, to amplify low power control signals to control powerful electric motors, for example. It is now mostly obsolete.|$|E
40|$|Physics at the {{nanoscale}} {{is concerned}} with the properties of objects like single atom or a single molecule. These properties range from mechanics (external or internal) to electronics (tunnel transport, switching, amplification). Starting from the mi scopy), the conditions to slide, pull or push an adsorbate will be given for a molecule. The controllabiblity of intramolecular mechanic will be discussed. Electrical contact on a single atom (or molecule) will be shown opening experiments on ball na through atomic and molecular wire. Finally, a nanoscale <b>electromechanical</b> <b>amplifier</b> using a single molecule (with again of 5) will be described...|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} instruments derived {{power to}} move the pen directly from the sensed process signal, which limited their sensitivity and speed of response. Friction between the marking device and paper would reduce {{the accuracy of the}} measurements. Instruments with pneumatic, mechanical, or <b>electromechanical</b> <b>amplifiers</b> decoupled pen movement from process measurement, greatly increasing the sensitivity of the instrument and the flexibility of the recorder. Directly-driven pens often moved in the arc of a circle, making the scale difficult to read; pre-printed charts have curvilinear scales printed on them that compensated for the path of the marking pen.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical or <b>electromechanical</b> <b>amplifiers</b> can {{exploit the}} high-Q and low noise {{features}} of mechanical resonance, in particular when parametric excitation is employed. Multi-frequency parametric excitation introduces tunability {{and is able}} to project weak input signals on a selected resonance. The present paper addresses multi degree of freedom mechanical amplifiers or resonators whose analysis and features require treatment of the spatial as well as temporal behavior. In some cases, virtual electronic coupling can alter the given topology of the resonator to better amplify specific inputs. An analytical development is followed by a numerical and experimental sensitivity and performance verifications, illustrating {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} such topologies...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the growing}} demand for low noise signal amplification, {{developing}} mechanical and <b>electromechanical</b> parametric <b>amplifiers</b> is a topic of interest. Parametric amplification in mechanical domain refers to the method for amplifying the dynamic response of a mechanical sensor by modulating system parameters such as effective stiffness. Most of the studies in this regard have been focused on truncating equation of motion such that only linear terms remain. In this chapter, mathematical models of mechanical and <b>electromechanical</b> parametric <b>amplifiers</b> in the literature are reviewed. Then, the effect of nonlinearity is investigated by including a cubic nonlinearity on the governing equation of a classical degenerate parametric amplifier. To this end, the method of multiple scales (perturbation) has been utilized to calculate steady state solution of the nonlinear Mathieutype equation. In addition, by determining the nature of singular points, stability analysis over the steady state response is performed. All the frequency response curves demonstrate a Duffing-like trend near the primary resonance of the system; however, the number of stable solutions changes with {{the parameters of the}} system. Furthermore, performance metrics of the system is analyzed in the presence of nonlinearity. The findings indicate that even very small nonlinearity term can dramatically decrease system performance as well as changing the relative phase in which maximum gain occurs...|$|R
40|$|Outer {{hair cells}} (OHC) serve as <b>electromechanical</b> <b>amplifiers</b> that {{guarantee}} the unique sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the mammalian cochlea. It is unknown whether the afferent fibres connected to adult OHCs are functional. If so, voltage-activated Ca 2 + channels {{would be required}} for afferent synaptic transmission. In neonatal OHCs, Ca 2 + channels seem {{to play a role}} in maturation since OHCs from Cav 1. 3 -deficient (Cav 1. 3 −/−) mice degenerate shortly after the onset of hearing. We therefore studied whole-cell Ca 2 + currents in outer hair cells aged between postnatal day 1 (P 1) and P 8. OHCs showed a rapidly activating inward current that was 1. 8 times larger with 10 mm Ba 2 + as charge carrier (IBa) than with equimolar Ca 2 + (ICa). IBa started activating at − 50 mV with Vmax = − 1. 9 ± 6. 9 mV, V 0. 5 = − 15. 0 ± 7. 1 mV and k = 8. 2 ± 1. 1 mV (n = 34). The peak IBa showed negligible inactivation (3. 6 % after 300 ms) whereas the ICa (10 mm Ca 2 +) was inactivated by 50. 7 %. OHC IBa was reduced by 33. 5 ± 10. 3 % (n = 14) with 10 μm nifedipine and increased to 178. 5 ± 57. 8 % (n = 14) by 5 μm Bay K 8644. A dose-response curve for nifedipine revealed an IC 50 of 2. 3 μm, a Hill coefficient of 2. 7 and a maximum block of 36 %. Average IBa density in OHCs was 24. 4 ± 10. 8 pA pF− 1 (n = 105) which is only 38 % of the value in inner hair cells. Single cell RT-PCR revealed expression of Cav 1. 3 in OHCs. In OHCs from Cav 1. 3 −/− mice, Ba 2 + current density was reduced to 0. 6 ± 0. 5 pA pF− 1 (n = 9) indicating that > 97 % of the Ca 2 + channel current in OHCs flows through Cav 1. 3...|$|R
