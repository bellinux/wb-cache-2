We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E
5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he <b>invited</b> <b>us</b> to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

He <b>invited</b> <b>U.S.</b> officials to closely examine Unomásuno {{and the rest of his}} businesses, and stated that his newspapers were critical of drug trafficking groups for years, including Los Cuinis and the CJNG. In the report, he mentioned Unomásuno, Diario Amanecer, and Aerolineas Amanecer, but gave no mention to his investment group Valgo Grupo de Inversión. He stated that it was likely that Mexican officials wanted to censor Unomásunos anti-organized crime publications by providing U.S. officials with false information to link them to drug trafficking and thereby discredit their information. He concluded his statement by saying that he was open to sharing information on his businesses because the accusations affected his integrity.|$|E

500|$|Evan Gutierrez from AllMusic {{considered}} the record's instrumentation, performance, and overall sonic palette to be [...] "minimalist" [...] and [...] "unassuming". Arjona experimented with prominent Latin sounds for Adentro, such as Mexican and Tejano music on [...] "Mojado", {{a duet with}} Mexican band Intocable about immigration. Ricky Muñoz, the vocalist of the group, said that the group met Arjona in Monterrey, {{and that they were}} in contact with Arjona through Carlos Cabral, one of Adentro producers, who had also worked with them formerly. Muñoz additionally reflected: [...] "We admire Arjona. We liked the song and then we recorded it [...] It is very cool that he <b>invited</b> <b>us</b> [...]" [...] "Adiós Melancolía" [...] is mainly composed as a bachata song with Colombian influences. [...] "No Te Cambio Por Nada" [...] is intermittently rock-dabbled. The lyrics of [...] "De Vez En Mes" [...] pertain to a woman's menstruation.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{magazine}} {{reported that}} Los Tigres del Norte {{was set to}} record a MTV Unplugged album for MTV Tr3s. The album was to be taped {{in the first quarter}} of 2011, and would feature special guests including Juanes, Calle 13, Andrés Calamaro and Zack de la Rocha. By February 2011, it was announced that Paulina Rubio and Diego Torres would join the band for the album recording session. For the band this presented a unique opportunity to re-invent their music and share the stage with talented performers. [...] "When MTV <b>invited</b> <b>us</b> to record the show, we were a little tense, this was something different for us because Unplugged albums on MTV are usually recorded by artists from different genres from us," [...] the band said about the recording. Jesús Lara of MTV Tr3s called the production [...] "historic", since the band has been culturally a part of the life of the Hispanic community in Mexico and the US.|$|E
500|$|Paul Knauls, a local {{resident}} and entrepreneur who {{was described as}} the [...] "unofficial mayor" [...] of Northeast Portland, was [...] "instrumental" [...] in securing funding for the sculpture's design. Cheryl Perrin and Betsy Brumm coordinated fundraising, with assistance from Charles Lewis; before Lewis <b>invited</b> <b>U.S.</b> Senator Mark Hatfield, for whom he had worked as an intern, to speak at a breakfast fundraiser, fundraising efforts had stalled for eight years.

If you were looking around for a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings {{you might call it}} 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But then that would be too simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely <b>invited</b> <b>us</b> to learn more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into strange new places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 1886, {{a meeting}} {{was held at}} the home of P.N. Clausen at which the Danebod {{congregation}} was formally organized with fifteen members. The church council consisted of its president, P.N. Clausen, secretary M.Lauritsen, and treasurer Jørgen Jacobsen. At first there were no regular church services and no resident pastor. Instead, the people met in various homes to sing Danish hymns and listen to a reading of the sermon by a layman. The pastor of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, S.C. Madsen, and other ministers occasionally conducted services in town. The congregation later hired the Danish settler, pastor Hans Jørgen Pedersen (1851–1905) of Gowen, Michigan. He arrived with his family on April12, 1888. Pedersen had a humble upbringing in Denmark, where he later studied at Ryslinge Folk High School before emigrating to America in 1875. He was an eloquent preacher, resourceful, and became involved in community activities throughout the area. He quickly assumed leadership and thus, in a sense, became the founder of Danebod. One of the pastor's six children, Sigurd Pedersen, described their first arrival in Danebod in his autobiography: [...] "It was a chilly morning, when the committee stood on the platform to bid welcome to the new pastor and his wife, trailed by six children, and the rear held up by the trusty hired man, Søren Olsen, who was to keep count of the straying flock and see that the last luggage was not forgotten. Friends <b>invited</b> <b>us</b> over for breakfast in the home of H.J. Nelsen, the merchant. Then the committee guided us to a small house on the corner just west of the present-day Chevrolet dealer, where businessman Carl Cold Sorensen brought the first automobiles to the area in the early 1900's. The committee had left no kindling in this small house, but Søren Olsen soon discovered that the kitchen range was in place and claimed to be able to manipulate the same if kindling could be provided. Across the street was a large general store, and father sent us there to beg Mr.Lauritsen for some kindling. We were given old boxes to break up, and we soon had our arms full and Søren had a blazing fire in a few minutes." [...] In September 1888, it was decided at a convention in Elk Horn, Iowa, to give the congregation at Danebod [...] of land, and the Danebod Lutheran Church was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895. Pedersen died in 1905, and the Reverend Thorvald Knudsen succeeded him at Danebod.|$|E
