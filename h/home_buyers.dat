At the election the Labor Party increased its margin by 5 seats, leaving a comfortable majority in the new parliament, although its success was attributed to the unpopularity at the time of Sir Robert Menzies' federal Liberal government following the 1961 credit squeeze.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, housing {{inequality}} {{is often}} relative to racial discrimination {{and differences in}} wealth. Banks and other mortgage lenders evaluate people according to where they live and their credit rating. In a capitalist country such as USA companies lend money to <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> {{for the purpose of}} making a profit from interest on the loan. In China, racial issues are less important because the population is mostly Chinese. Instead the fast changing economy in China has led to investors taking advantage of outdated and incomplete real estate legislation. The ensuing real estate bubble which priced many genuine <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> out of the market has been addressed by placing a heavy tax on homes resold within 3 months of purchase.|$|E

25|$|This {{was further}} amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were {{guaranteed}} by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{proposed}} several {{amendments to}} the bill directed at increasing the share of tax cuts and downsizing spending as well as decreasing the overall price.

25|$|Another {{issue in}} Ybor City after World War II was {{the aging of}} the area’s housing stock.

As a result, Shaker Heights avoided many of the problems created from practices such as blockbusting and white flight. In 1986, the city began a Fund for the Future of Shaker Heights, offering loans for down payments for residents buying homes in segregated neighborhoods, creating multi-ethnic neighborhoods. Today, the city maintains a housing assistance office that works with <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> to achieve and maintain neighborhood integration.|$|E

25|$|As of December 2005, Monterey County {{ranked among}} America's ten most {{expensive}} counties, with Santa Barbara County topping the list {{with a median}} home price of $753,790. In Monterey County, the median home price was $699,900. In the northern, more densely populated part in the county, the median home price was even higher, at $712,500, making it the fourth most expensive housing market in California. The disparity between the median household income of roughly $48,305 and the median home price of $700k has been cause for recent concern over excluding potential <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> from the market. The end of the United States housing bubble has caused prices to drop substantially, with median home prices having fallen to $280,000 as at September 2008.|$|E

Askin accused the state government of allowing the transport infrastructure of the state to decline and promised to build the Newcastle freeway without a toll, to construct the Eastern Suburbs Railway and to plan for a second crossing of Sydney Harbour. Askin also made promises for more resources in mental health and district hospitals.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{analysis}} of cost effectiveness the Council of American Building Officials` 1993 Model Energy Code (MEC) building thermal-envelope requirements for single-family houses and multifamily housing units in New Jersey. Goal was to compare the cost effectiveness of the 1993 MEC to the alternate allowed in the 1993 Building Officials & Code Administrators (BOCA) National Energy Conservation Code [...] American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90 A- 1980 [...] based on {{a comparison of the}} costs and benefits associated with complying with each. This comparison was performed for Camden, New Brunswick; Somerville, and Sparta. The analysis was done for two different scenarios: a ``move-up`` <b>home</b> <b>buyer</b> purchasing a single-family house and a ``first-time`` financially limited <b>home</b> <b>buyer</b> purchasing a multifamily unit. For the single-family <b>home</b> <b>buyer,</b> compliance with the 1993 MEC was estimated to increase first costs by $ 1028 to $ 1564, resulting in an incremental down payment increase of $ 206 to $ 313 (at 20 % down). The time when the homeowner realizes net cash savings (net positive cash flow) for houses built in accordance with the 1993 MEC was from 1 to 5 years. The <b>home</b> <b>buyer</b> who paid 20 % down had recovered increases in down payments and mortgage payments in energy cost savings {{by the end of the}} fifth year or sooner and thereafter will save more money each year. For the multifamily unit <b>home</b> <b>buyer</b> first costs were estimated to increase by $ 121 to $ 223, resulting in an incremental down payment increase of $ 12 to $ 22 (at 10 % down). The time when the homeowner realizes net cash savings (net positive cash flow) for houses built in accordance with the 1993 MEC was 1 to 3 years...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{being less}} than {{five percent of the}} total {{municipal}} population, foreign residents have considerable cultural and economic impact. Most foreign residents are retirees from the United States, Canada and Europe attracted by the mild climate, cultural opportunities and low crime. It is only a ten-hour drive to the U.S. border. Many of the <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> are from this segment of the population as well. Estimates of foreign residents range from 5,000 to 8,000 with at least half of these from the United States. The large foreign presence has established a number of institutions here. The most noted one is the Biblioteca Publica, which has the second largest English language book collection in Mexico, located in the former convent of Santa Ana. It acts as the community center for foreigners. There is also a chapter of the Lion's Club (est. 1987). A post of The American Legion and The Veterans of Foreign Wars is located there , and Mexico's only Audubon Society chapter.|$|E
25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E
500|$|One {{day after}} the Housing and Economic Recovery Act was signed into law, Representative Al Green of Texas {{introduced}} {{a bill that would}} have permitted the FHA to insure mortgage loans that had seller-funded down payments, so long as the <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> had FICO credit scores that were above a specified minimum (but, in some cases, the buyers would have been assessed higher mortgage-insurance premiums by the FHA). [...] Nehemiah supported this legislation and established a web site—the now-defunct dpagroundswell.org—that sought to generate public support through various means, including a letter-writing campaign to members of Congress. [...] Although the bill succeeded in getting approval from the House Committee on Financial Services, it was never voted on by the entire House and, hence, did not become law. [...] With this legislative failure, the seller-funded down-payment industry, including Nehemiah, ceased operations as of October 1, 2008.
