5|$|Ambulance {{services}} that have historical origins {{such as the}} Order of St John, the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and Malteser International often use the Maltese cross to identify their ambulances.

Waterfowl observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, tundra swan, long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern shoveler.|$|E
5|$|Music {{and dance}} were popular {{entertainments}} {{for those who}} could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and imported lutes and lyres from Asia. The sistrum was a rattle-like musical instrument that was <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in religious ceremonies.|$|E

There may also be equipment linked to this such as winches which are designed to pull heavy patients into the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|The diet {{typically}} {{includes a}} large variety of plants, and invertebrates and small mammals, {{as well as}} birds. The olive baboon eats leaves, grass, roots, bark, flowers, fruit, lichens, tubers, seeds, mushrooms, corms, and rhizomes. Corms and rhizomes are <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in times of drought, because grass loses {{a great deal of}} its nutritional value. In dry, arid regions, such as the northeastern deserts, small invertebrates like insects, spiders, and scorpions fill out its diet.|$|E

5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
5|$|Animals form another {{important}} part of the house sparrow's diet, chiefly insects, of which beetles, caterpillars, dipteran flies, and aphids are <b>especially</b> <b>important.</b> Various noninsect arthropods are eaten, as are molluscs and crustaceans where available, earthworms, and even vertebrates such as lizards and frogs. Young house sparrows are fed mostly on insects until about 15 days after hatching. They are also given small quantities of seeds, spiders, and grit. In most places, grasshoppers and crickets are the most abundant foods of nestlings. True bugs, ants, sawflies, and beetles are also important, but house sparrows take advantage of whatever foods are abundant to feed their young. House sparrows have been observed stealing prey from other birds, including American robins.|$|E

5|$|Berneray and Mingulay form an {{important}} breeding site for around {{a hundred thousand}} pairs of seabirds, and are <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> for the razorbill, the two islands having at least 2.0% of the UK's breeding population in 1985. Other species present include a variety of gulls, guillemots, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and (since 1899) fulmars. The island is largely covered by maritime grassland, with some machair and heath. Primrose, violets, yellow flag iris and celandine grow abundantly and grey seals are regularly seen by the landing cove. The island is designated as an SSSI and (with Mingulay) is a Special Protection Area.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine as a {{manufactured}} {{medication is}} sold under the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is most commonly used as a stimulant drug {{in the treatment of}} severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. It is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short—approximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn infants and up to five minutes in preterm infants—it is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection.|$|E

5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young black oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa {{is readily}} grown in {{cultivation}} given a sunny position and fair drainage, though it tolerates {{a range of}} soils and some shade. Its flowers attract birds, <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> as this can provide a source of food year-round. The plant responds well to pruning. Seeds germinate within 25 to 60 days of sowing, and firm young growth makes the best cutting material for propagation. Fertilisers generally are not needed, but slow release low-phosphorus fertilisers are tolerated. The species is frost-hardy and grows in temperate to subtropical climates.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-five {{per cent}} of bird species are {{socially}} monogamous. These species pair {{for at least}} the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.|$|E
