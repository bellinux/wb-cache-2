25|$|At the party, Bender is overheard {{saying that}} all the robots are doomed, causing panic. Farnsworth arrives with Fry and Leela and {{delivers}} {{a solution to the}} robots; <b>every</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> needs to blast their exhaust vents at the same time, straight up in the sky, in order to push the Earth farther from the Sun, thus cooling the Earth and causing the EMP cannon to miss its target. During the panic Bender and the turtle are knocked onto their backs and cannot get up, leaving not enough exhaust to move the Earth. As Bender is lamenting his fate, the turtle rocks from side to side and rolls to its feet. Shocked and inspired, but not to be shown up, Bender does the same, allowing him to release his massive exhaust, just barely saving the robots from the EMP. Farnsworth receives a medal of pollution for his work, and the extra week caused by the new orbit of the Earth is declared Robot Party Week.|$|E

According to the music journalist Robert Christgau, The New York Times was subsequently [...] "deluged with letters, many abusive and <b>every</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> in disagreement", a backlash that he credits as [...] "the largest response to a music review" [...] in the newspaper's history. Goldstein published a defence of his review in which he explained that, although the album was not on-par {{with the best of}} the Beatles' previous work, he considered it [...] "better than 80 per cent of the music around", but felt that underneath the production when [...] "the compositions are stripped to their musical and lyrical essentials" [...] the LP is shown to be [...] "an elaboration without improvement" [...] on the group's music. In Christgau's 1967 column for Esquire magazine, he described Sgt. Pepper as [...] "a consolidation, more intricate than Revolver but not more substantial", suggesting that Goldstein had fallen [...] "victim to overanticipation", identifying his primary error as [...] "allow all the filters and reverbs and orchestral effects and overdubs to deafen him to the stuff underneath, which was pretty nice".|$|E

[...] However, The Daily Telegraph gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "The Layton charm is undoubtedly still present, but it's not enough to carry the series by itself.

2500|$|By {{the time}} the 2008 primary season began, McCain's media {{coverage}} had shifted and he was now viewed as a [...] "comeback" [...] story. In addition, McCain returned to his long-standing practice of granting almost unlimited media access to him on this bus; this {{as well as the}} notion that he engages in [...] "straight talk" [...] free of political calculation gave him a positive personal sentiment in the press. Reflecting this feeling, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough joked of the media, [...] "I think <b>every</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> of them would move to Massachusetts and marry John McCain if they could."

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{researchers}} and network operators have examined networks of DDoS agents, more recently called botnets due to their connection to Internet Relay Chat (IRC). In the continued quest to take down these networks of bots, two important questions arise: how many bots are there, and how to find <b>every</b> <b>last</b> bot?

40|$|Mŏkpang (loosely {{translated}} as “eating broadcasts”) is a compound word {{made of the}} verb mokta (eating) and the noun pangsong (broadcasting). The term mŏkpang is {{used to describe the}} activities of Broadcasting Jockeys (BJs) who televise themselves while eating online and is generally broadcasted <b>every</b> night, <b>lasting</b> <b>one</b> to three hours. The mŏkpang shows are interesting from many points of view. The food and the diners are both the stars of these shows. BJs usually follow {{at least one of the}} three rules: ppalli mokki (eat fast), manhi mokki (eat a lot) and masikke mokki (enjoy eating). The analysis of this recent media has inspired many questions, some of which we addressed in this paper. This paper aims to demonstrate that mŏkpang is far more than what media scholars refer to as simply “porno food” or “gastronomic voyeurism”. Instead, we suggest that the commercial aspects of mŏkpang (for example, causal advertisement of shops where food that will be eaten during the broadcast can be bought) combined with the various eating methods used by the BJs create an imagined community and a space for participants both behind the screen and watching it. This paper also suggests that the “star balloon”, a pay item sold in Afreeca TV, should not be viewed solely from an economic perspective but should also be recognized for its unique cultural aspects. ...|$|R
