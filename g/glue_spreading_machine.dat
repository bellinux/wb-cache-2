30|$|Fire retardancy of melamine-modified urea–formaldehyde resin (MUF) {{containing}} intumescent fire-retardant ammonium polyphosphate (APP) (MUF/APP) {{was conducted}} by cone calorimeter with surface treatment of medium density fiberboard (MDF). The {{results showed that the}} six MUF resins synthesized with different F/(M + U) and M/U molar ratios containing APP significantly improved the fire retardancy of the MDF by prolonging ignition time, reducing heat release rate and total heat release, and decreasing mass loss rate. The fire-retardant properties of the six synthesized MUF/APP acted differently even though each MUF resin containing the same mass ratio of APP. The melamine content in the MUF should not be too high, otherwise it would decrease the fire-retardant properties of MUF/APP. Based on this study, the higher the APP amounts, the better the fire-retardant performance of the resin was. The fire retardancy of MUF/APP increased with the increase in the amount of <b>glue</b> that <b>spread</b> on the material surface.

40|$|Abstract: Spur and {{helical gears}} {{can be used}} to {{transmit}} very large power between two parallel shafts. However in spur gears the engagement between two meshing teeth is sudden line contact over entire face width which results in generation of noise and higher dynamic load. In helical gears the engagement between two meshing teeth begins with point contact and gradually extends diagonally along the gear tooth surface, resulting in quiet operation. Hence normally spur gears are used for low speed power transmission (20 m/s) and helical gears are preferred for high speed. A considerable {{research in the area of}} bending stress analysis of involute spur gear has been carried out. However it is seen that a very little work has been carried out on stress analysis of involute helical gears. For finding stress concentration & stress pattern in the body, experimental stress analysis is very useful & is employed extensively. In Eco Board Industries Limited., Islampur (Maharashtra), <b>spreading</b> <b>machine</b> is used to spread bagasse in the formation of particle board.
