5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal ductwork for <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E
25|$|Until 1943, keepers {{had lived}} there alone or with their wives. In 1943, Laurent LeClerc moved in {{with his wife and}} three children. During their time, further {{amenities}} were introduced, such as household electricity, running water and modern <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> heating.|$|E

25|$|All {{amplifiers}} generate {{heat through}} electrical losses. The amplifier must dissipate this heat via convection or <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> cooling. Heat can damage or reduce electronic component service life. Designers and installers must also consider heating effects on adjacent equipment.|$|E
25|$|The anode {{is often}} treated {{to make its}} surface emit more {{infrared}} energy. High-power amplifier tubes are designed with external anodes which can be cooled by convection, <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> or circulating water. The water-cooled 80kg, 1.25MW 8974 is among the largest commercial tubes available today.|$|E
25|$|A UVGI {{system is}} {{designed}} to expose environments such as water tanks, sealed rooms and <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> systems to germicidal UV. Exposure comes from germicidal lamps that emit germicidal UV at the correct wavelength, thus irradiating the environment. The forced flow of air or water through this environment ensures exposure.|$|E

25|$|Copper has {{excellent}} {{heat sink}} properties {{in terms of}} its thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, biofouling resistance, and antimicrobial resistance (see Main Article: Copper in heat exchangers). Copper has around twice the thermal conductivity of aluminium and faster, more efficient heat absorption. Its main applications are in industrial facilities, power plants, solar thermal water systems, HVAC systems, gas water heaters, <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> heating and cooling systems, geothermal heating and cooling, and electronic systems.|$|E
25|$|Air-source {{heat pumps}} {{have been used}} for {{residential}} and commercial heating and cooling for many years. These units rely on air-to-air heat exchange through evaporator units similar to those used for air conditioners. Finned water to air heat exchangers are most commonly used for <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> heating and cooling systems, such as with indoor and outdoor wood furnaces, boilers, and stoves. They can also be suitable for liquid cooling applications. Copper is specified in supply and return manifolds and in tube coils.|$|E
25|$|In 1902 {{the lantern}} was changed again from solid red to flashing. Apart from routine {{reinforcement}} to the riprap and {{replacement of the}} dock no changes {{were made to the}} lighthouse building itself until the 1940s, when modern sanitary facilities were added. In 1947, an electrical connection was installed, eliminating the need for the kerosene lamps that had provided routine illumination within the lighthouse. During the next decade, the original coal-fired steam heating system was replaced with modern <b>forced</b> <b>air,</b> and the sanitary facilities were further upgraded.|$|E

25|$|The boiler used a ‘Forced Draught’ {{provided}} by a mechanical blower (the triangular structure on the right in the illustration). This <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> along a pipe and into the sealed ashpan (below the fire). Very few steam locomotives have ever used a forced draught like this, the main reason is {{that in order to}} add fuel either the draft must be stopped or some form of airlock fitted. Novelty used an airlock to feed the fuel in, but there was still a chance of flame and hot gases being blown into the face of the fireman.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the rotor}} is much lighter in weight (mass) than a {{conventional}} rotor formed from copper windings on steel laminations, the rotor can accelerate much more rapidly, often achieving a mechanical time constant under one ms. This {{is especially true}} if the windings use aluminum rather than the heavier copper. But {{because there is no}} metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink, even small coreless motors must often be cooled by <b>forced</b> <b>air.</b> Overheating might be an issue for coreless DC motor designs. Modern software, such as Motor-CAD, can help to increase the thermal efficiency of motors while still in the design stage.|$|E
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E

500|$|The VRDK was a motorjet, a {{rudimentary}} type of jet engine where an external power source drove the engine's compressor.

The air for the compressor was fed through a long duct that ran from the inlet underneath the propeller spinner, thence under the engine and through the belly of the aircraft. This duct also fed air to the oil cooler near the engine, but the water radiator was positioned behind the compressor to maximize airflow over it. A secondary duct led from the main duct to the VK-107's supercharger; when the VRDK was running the secondary duct diverted some of that additional air to the supercharger which boosted the engine's output to [...] at [...] The increased airflow over the engine radiator helped to dump the engine's excess heat into the exhaust stream.
