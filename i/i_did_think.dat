In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> {{it was a shame}} that it's not been recognised. You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think people are doing that. I get told that every day on Twitter, or in meetings." [...] A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television".|$|E
500|$|Reservoir Dogs was, {{according}} to Tarantino, influenced by Stanley Kubrick's The Killing. Tarantino said: [...] "I didn't {{go out of}} my way to do a rip-off of The Killing, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> of it as my [...] "Killing," [...] my take on that kind of heist movie." [...] The film's plot was suggested by the 1952 film Kansas City Confidential. Additionally, Joseph H. Lewis's 1955 film The Big Combo and Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django inspired the scene where a police officer is tortured in a chair. Tarantino has denied that he plagiarized with Reservoir Dogs and instead said that he does homages. Having the main characters named after colors (Mr. Pink, White, Brown, etc.) was first seen in the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The film also contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam's 1987 film City on Fire.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Rachel and {{eliminate}} Sarah, saying [...] "I {{have to think}} as a producer and I do think Rachel was rock solid, and there were moments that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that maybe you were a bit fragile", adding [...] "but you were wonderful and you did exactly what I asked." ...|$|E

It's hardly fair of you, sir, {{to make a}} ignorant man conwict {{himself in}} this way, but <b>I</b> <b>DO</b> <b>think</b> so. <b>I</b> am as respectful disposed to you, sir, as a man can be; but <b>I</b> <b>DO</b> <b>think</b> so.' ...|$|R

"That was {{the number}} one thing I got hit with in the first fight, so I did work a lot against guys with good kicks and was working on {{checking}} them a lot. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that if he's going to go that hard on kicks, as he usually does, if I catch it on my knee it could really hurt him. But it's still crazy how that happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I just couldn't {{believe there}} was no flag", Clark said after the game, in {{reference}} to Davis' contact with him. [...] "I mean, I just assumed it would be thrown. When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and it looks like they pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots. We just didn't make the plays we had to." ...|$|E

"Well, well! <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> {{that you}} {{was a gentleman}} that would not go back from your word. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that you would never put a young lady to the {{necessity}} of bringing forward her own letters to prove {{that she is not}} expecting more than she has a right! You don't know! And that, after all that has been between us! John Eames!" [...] And again it seemed to him as though she were about to fly.|$|E

She hasn't another human being to look after her, and, therefore, he is obliged to do it.
