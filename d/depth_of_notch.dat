40|$|Fundamental {{asymmetric}} lamb wave’s {{interactions with}} rectangular notches in a steel plate are investigated in this paper. Elastodynamic finite integration technique previously mainly {{used to study}} wave propagation in elastic media is adopted to study lamb wave interaction with defects. Simulation examples are presented to illustrate the reflection and transmission coefficients’ variations with defect’s height, for both symmetric and asymmetric modes. Results show as the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>notch</b> increases reflection coefficients for both symmetric mode and asymmetric mode increase. However, when the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>notch</b> increases transmission coefficient for asymmetric mode decreases which means {{the main part of}} transmitted energy is carried by symmetric mode generated when the fundamental asymmetric mode interacts with defect. This simulation could be a valuable tool for the research of lamb wave’s applications in nondestructive testing (NDT) field, as the problem of lamb wave interaction with discontinuities can be used to study defect sizing problem...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes the {{principle}} for rotation sensing {{based on an}} open-ended microstrip line loaded with a split ring resonator (SRR). It is shown that the variations in {{the depth of the}} resonance notch in the reflection coefficient of the structure can be used to sense the rotation angle of the SRR. This effect arises from the rotation-induced break of symmetry for the geometry. The proposed sensor benefits from a compact size and a higher dynamic range compared to previously published rotation sensors based on <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>notch.</b> The sensor also benefits from immunity to the environmental changes such as temperature variations.

40|$|The {{electronic}} and magnetic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons with asymmetric notches along their edges are investigated by first principle density functional theory calculations. It is {{found that the}} {{electronic and}} magnetic properties of the asymmetrically-notched graphene nanoribbons are closely related with the depth of notches, but weekly dependent {{on the length of}} notches. As the relative <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>notch</b> increases, the energy level of spin-up and spin-down becomes greatly shifted, associated with the gradual increase of magnetic momentum. The asymmetric band shift allows the asymmetrically notched graphene nanoribbons to be a spintronic semiconductor, through which an N- or P-type spin-semiconductor can be obtained by doping B or N atoms...|$|E
40|$|The {{fracture}} {{parameters and}} fracture relational curves {{of the concrete}} containing nano-SiO 2 and fly ash with different relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>notched</b> beam specimens were measured by means of three-point bending method. The {{results indicate that the}} relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>notched</b> specimens has great effect on ac, KICini, KICun, GF, CMODc, and the fracture relational curves of the concrete containing nano-SiO 2 and fly ash. There is a tendency of increase in ac and CMODc with the increase <b>of</b> relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth,</b> while KICini, KICun, and GF are decreasing gradually with the increase <b>of</b> relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>notched</b> beam specimens. Besides, when the relative notch depth increases from 0. 2 to 0. 5, the nonlinear stage of the curve becomes shorter and shorter, and the descent stage of the curve becomes sharper and sharper. The fracture parameters of ac, KICini, KICun, GF, and CMODc and the fracture curves are sensitive to the relative notch depth, while CTODc may be not sensitive to the relative <b>notch</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the specimens of the concrete containing nano-SiO 2 and fly ash...|$|R

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to study the {{fracture}} behavior of ferrocement beams using J-integral and critical crack opening displacement approaches. Ferrocement beams with three different relative notch depths and different percentages of mesh reinforcement were tested in four-point bending (third-point loading). The experimental results were {{used to evaluate the}} apparent J-integral and CODc values. Results show that the apparent J-integral does not seem to follow any particular trend in variation with notch depth, but is sensitive to the increase of mesh reinforcement. Hence, the apparent J-integral appears to be a useful fracture criterion for ferrocement. The computed values of CODt are found to be dependent on the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>notch</b> and, thus, cannot possibly be considered as a suitable fracture criterion for ferrocement...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the dynamic behavior of notched beam for various distances and notch size and their effect on natural frequency. In this project, six beams are used to perform in simulation and experimental hammer test. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) comprise of a computer model of a material that is stressed and analyzed for specific results. ALGOR Fempro is used to analyze the model that build in SOLIDWORK. After modeling the beam with dimension as desired in Solidwork software, CAE Analysis or ALGOR Fempro used to simulate the beam to obtain natural frequency. The finite element model of the components was analyzed using the Natural Frequency (modal) approaches. Finally, the natural frequency obtain from the result of analysis are known as simulation result. In the experimental hammer test, natural frequencies are obtained from Frequency Response Function (FRF) graph using PULSE Labshop Software.

40|$|Notch stress {{intensity}} factors (NSIFs) {{of a number}} of flat plates with periodic sharp V-notches under a remote applied normal stress are calculated. The main objective {{of this study is to}} take advantage of the local strain energy density (SED) averaged on a control volume surrounding the tip <b>of</b> the middle <b>notch</b> and estimate the NSIF of each component by using a relatively coarse mesh. The unique advantage of the SED method is the most prominent application of such a technique in the current study.

40|$|AbstractStress-notches cutting {{is one of}} the key {{processes}} in fracture splitting processing of connecting rod. This paper has put forward a new process <b>of</b> WEDM <b>notches</b> cutting, with the advantages of free threading, low cost, high efficiency and convenient maintenance. In order to obtain stable cutting quality and higher processing efficiency, studies are carried out on the machine tool power supply and control system. Higher-voltage circuit for the pulse power supply is design ed in the form of switching power supply with dual-controller, which brings the advantages of higher degree of integration, less weight, smaller volume, and cost reduction. Moreover, the output voltage is continuously adjustable and has the function of voltage regulator, thus better processing quality can be achieved. The control system is designed to obtain constant <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>notches</b> while cutting, regardless of various sizes and tolerances of inner holes of the connecting rods, thus it can eliminate the negative influences on fracture splitting process caused by inconsistency <b>of</b> stress <b>notches.</b> Experimental results show that the presented WEDM power supply and control system can fully meet the requirements <b>of</b> <b>notches</b> cutting in fracture splitting processing of connecting rod...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} for {{the suppression}} of narrow-band interference in direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) systems, based on the open loop adaptive IIR notch filtering. The center frequency of the interference is monitored on-line by the adaptive lattice IIR notch filter in [6] or by time-frequency analysis in [3]. The power of the interference signal is also estimated from the adaptive filters. Another lattice IIR notch filter is {{placed in front of}} the receiver, the <b>notch</b> <b>of</b> which is controlled by the frequency estimate to remove the interference. However, the IIR notch filter with the zeros on the unit circle also removes the information signal at the notch frequency while removing the interference and causes data distortion. Hence, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>notch</b> should also be adjusted for the trade-off between data distortion and effective interference reduction. The objective function for adjusting the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>notch</b> is defined as the overall signal to noise ratio (SNR). The SNR is expressed as a function of filter parameters and the notch depth that maximizes the SNR is found. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields better performance than the existing FIR notch filter [3] and the conventional FIR LMS algorithm with very long taps [1]...|$|R

40|$|Concrete sawing {{operations}} are performed at pre-determined locations {{within the first}} 24 hours to prevent random cracking on jointed plain concrete pavements. In current construction procedures, the depth and {{the timing of the}} saw is usually established by the contractor based on experience. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the effect of several concrete mixture proportions and constituents on the early-age fracture properties and their effect on saw cut timing and depth for concrete pavements with several slab geometries. Concrete pavement mixtures with different coarse aggregate size and cementitious content were evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the measured fracture properties on saw cut model predictions. Finite element analysis was used to derive the geometric correction factors necessary to characterize the fracture properties of concrete based on the wedge plitting test configuration. A saw cut depth model proposed by Zollinger was modified to determine the timing and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>notches</b> on jointed plain concrete pavements. The theoretical analysis and practical example lead to the observation that if greater time is desired before saw cutting, the design should favor concrete materials with slower development of fracture properties. Larger coarse aggregate tends to increase concrete fracture toughness, and therefore will require deeper saw cuts. Thinner concrete pavements also require significantly deeper notch depth ratios relative to thicker slabs...|$|R
