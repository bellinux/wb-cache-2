5|$|From their {{discovery}} by numismatists, 1804 dollars have commanded high prices. Auction prices reached $1,000 by 1885, {{and in the}} mid-twentieth century, {{the coins}} realized over $30,000. In 1999, a Class I example sold for $4.14 million, then the highest price paid for any coin.

The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's Take-Away Shows, its appeal compounded by the shock of seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment. It's all quite endearing and personal â€“ two words one might not often associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple.|$|E

50|$|In 1949 the British pound was devalued from US$4.03 to US$2.80.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature.

5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} of Hong Kong, the Japanese army committed atrocities against civilians and POWs, {{such as the}} St. Stephen's College massacre. Local residents also suffered widespread food shortages, limited rationing and hyper-inflation arising from the forced exchange of currency from Hong Kong <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> Japanese military banknotes. The initial ratio of 2:1 was gradually devalued to 4:1 and ownership of Hong Kong dollars was declared illegal and punishable by harsh torture. Due to starvation and forced deportation for slave labour to mainland China, the population of Hong Kong had dwindled from 1.6 million in 1941 to 600,000 in 1945, when the United Kingdom resumed control of the colony on 2 September 1945.|$|E
