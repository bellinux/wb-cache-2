5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold.

5|$|Sheffield {{remained}} a major industrial city throughout {{the first half}} of the 20th century, but the <b>downturn</b> <b>in</b> world trade following the 1973 oil crisis, technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching restructuring of steel production throughout the European Economic Community led to the closure of many of the steelworks from the early 1970s onward.

40|$|In {{responding}} to a view that attributes sharp <b>downturns</b> <b>in</b> the Chinese economy in late 2008 and early 2009 to the "collapse of external demand," the present paper scrutinizes three relevant issues: How have large Chinese importers behaved in a demand-price setting? How have Chinese commodity imports and exports interacted in recent years? Did the <b>downturns</b> <b>in</b> China's export growth come earlier and were they deeper than those in Chinese import growth? All answers appear to suggest a conclusion contrary to the abovementioned view: sharp <b>downturns</b> <b>in</b> China's trade and economy during the recent global financial crisis were, to a large extent, caused by certain domestic factors, or by factors {{that should not be}} regarded as entirely "external. " Insomuch as globalization has advanced, a large economy like China's today faces new potential sources of macroeconomic disturbances, from inside and outside.

Payments for these aircraft together with a <b>downturn</b> <b>in</b> transatlantic traffic, increased competition on the transatlantic route by additional carriers equipped with jet aircraft, and {{a whole host of}} additional costs associated with the Vickers VC10 and Bristol Britannia purchase would result in BOAC becoming extremely unprofitable from late 1961 onwards.|$|E

5|$|Although Roanoke {{has never}} had {{international}} passenger service, in 2001, the Airport Commission was prepared to change the airport's name to Roanoke International Airport.

40|$|Do {{economic}} <b>downturns</b> <b>in</b> the Global North undermine worker {{safety in}} the Global South? Literature suggests that bilateral trade linkages lead to the diffusion of “good” labor standards from importing countries of the Global North to exporting countries of the Global South. The crucial mechanism is the ability and willingness of importing firms to deploy their market leverage and ask for improved labor standards from their overseas suppliers. Yet, cost-cutting pressures emanating from economic downturns might lead the same importing firms to give lower priority to worker {{safety in the}}ir overseas supply chains. When importing firms demand price reductions, overseas suppliers might respond by reducing wages, ignoring safety regulations, and working their labor force for longer hours. The observable implication is that worker safety in the Global South may deteriorate during economic <b>downturns</b> <b>in</b> their export markets located in the Global North. We evaluate our hypothesis using a panel of 83 developing countries for the period during 1980 – 2009, and find that economic <b>downturns</b> <b>in</b> developed country markets are associated with significant increases in non-fatal occupational injury rates in developing countries. The injury-increasing effect is more pronounced in developing countries with weak workers' rights protection...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that {{displaced}} workers experience substantial wage reductions that are strongly related to their predisplacement job tenure and experience. This paper is an assessment of whether firm closures or <b>downturns</b> <b>in</b> more broadly defined labor markets drive the extreme wage losses of high tenure, high experience displaced workers. I show that the relatively high wage losses of high experience displaced workers are primarily due to their heightened sensitivity to <b>downturns</b> <b>in</b> their state, industry, and occupation. However, the large wage losses of high tenure displaced workers are not explained by their sensitivity to these local downturns. One interpretation of these facts is that firm specialization is linked primarily to firm-specific experience, but not to general labor market experience. ...|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp <b>downturn</b> <b>in</b> international market prices of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{successful}} stint in Spain, Areola returned to PSG for the 2016–17 Ligue 1 season.
