5000|$|Görgei {{conducted}} the Spring Campaign in April and May 1849 brilliantly, defeating Windisch-Grätz, {{and when the}} latter, because of these defeats, was replaced with Ludwig von Welden, the new commander was also vanquished in a several battles. Görgei won at Hatvan (2 April), Tápióbicske (4 April), Isaszeg (6 April), Vác (10 April), Nagysalló (19 April), and relieved Komárom (26 April). The brilliant pincer maneuvers of Görgei's troops and the incertitude created in the enemy {{about the direction of}} the attack of his troops, corroborated with the successes of the Hungarian armies in the other fronts, forced the much superior armies of the Austrian Empire and its allies, which at the beginning of March, controled around 3/4 of Hungary, to evacuate the country, excepting a narrow landstrip in its western part, Croatia and a few land pockets and forts. In the battle of Isaszeg, Görgei was close to encircle and completely destroy the main Austrian army led by Windisch-Grätz (which could bring with it Hungary's decisive victory in the war), but the refusal of one of his army corps commanders, András Gáspár, to attack from the north, made possible the escape of the enemy. For the failure of making the best of this opportunity, Görgei also had a responsibility, because he did not urged Gáspár to attack, thinking that the latter already started it. Although in the liberation of the country took an important part also the troops of Józef Bem who liberated Transylvania, and Mór Perczel, who liberated much of Southern Hungary, excepting Croatia, Görgei was the commander who achieved the greatest success by defeating the main Austrian armies representing the most operational, and best equipped forces and its main commanders, regarded as among the best commanders which Austria had at that time, forcing them to retreat from the most <b>developped</b> central and western parts of the country, including the capitals. [...] We have to notice that Görgei achieved his successes with a numerically, technologically inferior army (47 500 Hungarian soldiers, having 198 cannons vs 55 000 Austrian soldiers with 214 cannons and rockets), which lacked heavy cavalry (relying almost completely on the light Hussar cavalry), and having very few soldiers fighting in the other types of units common in the armies of that period (chasseurs, grenadiers, lancer cavalry, dragoons, cuirassiers) in comparison with the Austrian army, which had plenty of these, and being every time in shortage of weapons and ammunition, which situation caused that during the battles, the Hungarian infantry to not to engage in long shooting duels with the imperials (which were usually well equipped with bullets and ammunition) but to start bayonet charges, which were repeated if the initially attempt to break through was unsuccessful, which caused of course heavy casualties for them, so the Hungarian infantry had to move forwards and backwards under continuous enemy fire.|$|E
