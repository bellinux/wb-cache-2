5|$|One of {{the reasons}} White sought to leave Harveys was {{that the size of}} the kitchen was {{insufficient}} to allow him to expand the range of techniques in the dishes he served. With the move to The Restaurant, he added <b>dishes</b> <b>with</b> techniques such as confit, braising and en vessie highlighted. The move also saw an expansion to the number of different options served; while Harveys may have had a handful of main courses, this was increased to around 15 or more at The Restaurant. White's concept for the food was simplified versions of classical French cuisine.|$|E

5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to <b>dishes</b> <b>with</b> vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|E

25|$|At mealtimes {{very dry}} wines with little {{minerals}} are recommended with oysters and seafood: their acidity reveals the salinity of the shellfish. The most fragrant wines go well with shellfish, fish, or poached white meat. For stews the acidity {{of white wine}} counterbalances the weight of fat. If the sauce is well balanced with an intense ingredient (lemon juice or mustard) a more opulent wine can be recommended: sweet or dry wine aged in barrels. Sweet wines either just sweet or fortified are a good option for exotic <b>dishes</b> <b>with</b> sweet spices (<b>dishes</b> <b>with</b> cinnamon, vanilla etc.). Fortified white wines are recommended with foie gras. Sparkling wines can be taken {{at any time during}} the meal, their diversity allows this. A choice of sparkling wine also allows the retention of the same wine from the beginning to the end of the meal.|$|E

25|$|Brâncuși always {{dressed in}} the simple ways the Romanian peasants did.

25|$|A regular Bihari meal {{consists}} of rice, lentil soup, chapatis, vegetable curry etc. Bihari cuisine is predominantly vegetarian because traditional Bihar society, influenced by Buddhist and Hindu values of non-violence, did not eat eggs, chicken, {{fish and other}} non-vegetarian fare. However, {{there is also a}} tradition of meat-eating, and fish dishes are especially common due to the number of rivers in Bihar. There are also numerous Bihari meat <b>dishes,</b> <b>with</b> chicken and mutton being the most common.|$|E
25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} served with {{some type of}} sauce; the sauce {{and the type of}} pasta are usually matched based on consistency and ease of eating. Northern Italian cooking uses less tomato sauce, garlic and herbs. In Northern Italy white sauce is more common. However Italian cuisine is best identified by individual regions. Pasta <b>dishes</b> <b>with</b> lighter use of tomato are found in Trentino-Alto Adige and Emilia Romagna. In Bologna, the meat-based Bolognese sauce incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called pesto originates from Genoa. In Central Italy, there are sauces such as tomato sauce, amatriciana, arrabbiata and the egg-based carbonara.|$|E
