Accordingly, the level of stress experienced in the environment can act as a strong selective pressure that drives the evolution of life histories...|$|E

The research {{was based on the}} cognitive-structural approach. The research focused on beliefs of both children and adults on the intergenerational transmission of personality traits and specific activities associated with gender roles (both male and female) and roles in the family, i. e. the stereotypical assigning of certain values and skills to the generation of parents and grandparents. The survey covered 200 respondents who were classified into five age groups (with the distinction of sex), ranging from the pre-school period up to middle adulthood. The diagnostic-poll method was used. Interview techniques and the <b>enquiry</b> <b>form</b> were applied, a questionnaire designed by the author inclusive. The qualitative and quantitative analyses was carried out. The results suggest that the age and sex of the respondents has a significant impact on their knowledge about the content of intergenerational communications.

40|$|As {{part of a}} SERC funded project {{this study}} aims to {{summarise}} the most relevant and recent literature with respect to outlier detection for time series and missing value estimation in traffic count data. Many types of transport data are collected over time and are potentlally suited to the application of time series analysis techniques. including accident data, ticket sales and traffic counts. Missing data or outliers in traffic counts can cause problems when analysing the data, for example {{in order to produce}} forecasts. At present it seems that little work has been undertaken to assess the merits of alternative methods to treat such data or develop a more analytic approach. Here we intend to review current practices in the transport field and summarise more general time series techniques for handling outlying or missing data. The literature study forms the fist stage of a research project aiming to establish the applicability of time series and other techniques in estimating missing values and outlier detection/replacement in a variety of transport data. Missing data and outliers can occur for a variety of reasons, for example the breakdown of automatic counters. Initial enquiries suggest that methods for patching such data can be crude. Local authorities are to be approached individually usinga short questionnaire <b>enquiry</b> <b>form</b> in order to attempt to ascertain their current practices. Having reviewed current practices the project aims to transfer recently developed methods for dealing with outliers in general time series into a transport context. It is anticipated that comparisons between possible methods could highlight an alternative and more analytical approach to current practices. A description of the main methods ior detecting outliers in time series is given within the first section. In the second section practical applications of Box-Jenkins methods within a transport context are given. current practices for dealing with outlying and missing data within transport are discussed in section three. Recommendations for methods to be used in our current research are followed by the appendices containing most of the mathematical detail...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} creation of a new integrated Information Technology (IT) system that assisted in the collection of data about the behaviour of website visitors as well as sales and marketing data for those visitors who turned into customers. A key contribution to knowledge was {{the creation of}} a method to predict the outcome of visits to a website from visitors’ browsing behaviour. A new Online Tracking Module (OTM) was created that monitored visitors’ behaviour while they browsed websites. When a visitor converted into a customer, then customer and marketing data as well as sales activity was saved in a new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that was implemented in this research. The research focused on service websites. The goal of these websites was to promote products and services online and turn enquiries into offline sales. The challenge faced by these websites was to convince as many visitors as possible to enquire. Most websites relied on Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and Pay Per Click (PPC) advertising for traffic generation. This research used PPC advertising to generate traffic. An important aspect of PPC advertising was landing page optimisation. The aim of landing page optimisation was to increase the number of visitors to a website who completed a specific action on the website. In the case of the websites investigated in this research the action consisted of completing and sending an <b>enquiry</b> <b>form</b> from the websites. The research looked for meaningful commonalities in the data collected by MS CRM and the OTM and combined this with feedback from the collaborating company’s sales team to create two personas for website visitors who had enquired. Techniques for improving landing pages were identified and these led to changes to landing pages. Some of these changes were targeted at a particular visitor persona. The effect of changes made to a landing page was measured by comparing its conversion rate and bounce rate before and after the changes. Behavioural data collected by the OTM was then analysed using a data mining engine to find models that could predict whether a user would convert based on their browsing behaviour. Models were found that could predict the outcome of a visit to a service website. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis explores the governance within Islamic thought {{in the case of}} the institution of hisbah as well as exploring the episteme that is the cause of the recognised and unrecognised incoherencies and inconsistencies in the theories, regulations, and laws associated to the institution of hisbah. The analysis is based on conducting an epistemological examination in moral philosophical dialect in relation to the historical regulative institution of hisbah. Institution of hisbah constitutes the focus of this research, because this institution was politically structured, theologically positioned and theoretically entrusted to maintain public law and order, with the objective of supervising the behaviour in society and market from an Islamic perspective by using Islamic legal theories within its own theoretical framework with the aim of subscribing good and forbidding evil. The analysis presented found that the institution of hisbah was subject to continuous institutional failures throughout its history. In advancing the analysis, the research deconstructs the theoretical framework upon which the institution of hisbah located its operations for the moral governance of the market and the society. The deconstruction of theoretical frameworks point to the use of Islamic legal theory and juristic subjectivity for judging the moral conduct of activities as the root cause of the problem. The study further deconstructed the Islamic legal theory along side exploring for the alternative episteme within the broader view of Islamic thought, given the diversity of philosophical standpoints on good and evil within Islamic discourse. However, the result of this exploration suggests that epistemological crisis embodies the whole of Islamic tradition, which pave the way to a rise in crisis in morality and crisis in legitimacy within the tradition, which resulted in institutional failures, such as the ones witnessed in the operations of institution of hisbah. The study further discovers that consequent to the crisis in the Islamic tradition, the key questions on good and evil, within the realm of governance can no longer be settled by using the historically established tradition’s epistemological sources, because within the current settings of tradition, there is insufficient or no method of <b>enquiry,</b> <b>form</b> of argumentation and episteme that can address the crises, or through which a solution for the crises can be derived. By using MacIntyre’s work as a conceptual structure, this research attempts to construct a new epistemological source that may address the crises by specifying a model justified through model-dependent realism with the objective of creating a new point of orientation through which reality and dichotomy of good and evil can be objectively understood, whilst safeguarding the life form of the fabric of belief that is central to the traditional Islamic thought. Such episteme can then be used as an ethical theory by the institution of hisbah for judging the moral conduct of activities in the market and society. The new episteme is constructed, while preserving the tradition’s consequential essence. The consequential essence is inferred down to morality based on objectiveness and universality, and away from public choice, along with the notion of survival as episteme for philosophical perspective and theological stance. The consequential essence of tradition is maintained by using objectivist ethics and environmental sustainability within the outlines of classic theories on sovereignty of internal and external realm, as a foundational framework to construct the proposed model of ‘objective subjectivism’ as a theory of normative ethics. This proposed episteme as an Islamic ethical theory asserts that standard of value is life and measure of value and purpose of life is sustainability, and through this notion good and evil can be objectively distinguished for each realm, and therefore institutionally subscribed or prohibited for that realm, thus providing a workable framework for the operations of hisbah. As a research methodology and model construction process, the research {{presented in this}} research utilises discursive reasoning to conduct an epistemological enquiry based on critical discourse analysis, which is ontologically justified by model-dependent realism and epistemologically framed under consequentialism. ...|$|E

The original objective was to improve and evaluate my teaching strategy. I wanted to allow the {{students to participate in}} the curriculum planning and decision making process. This interaction took place through social discourse and resulted in reciprocal communication and learning. My research began with many working questions: Can students and teachers collaborate and set objectives for a unit of teaching? Are we, as educators, aware of their individual needs in this artistic process? Are we getting through to the students? How do we know? My role as a teacher/researcher internalized a self-reflective process of my teaching practice.

Kew has recently received extra funds to expand the database, which now contains information on approximately 6, 000 useful dryland species, excluding major crops. The SEPASAL database is widely used by aid agencies, development organizations, governmental and non-governmental organizations and individual research workers and growers. The data includes: scientific name (including synonyms); plant family, vernacular and trade names, plant description; geographical distribution (to country or state level) and status (native or introduced, etc.); distribution map; conservation status; life cycle and regeneration; uses of plants; use-related properties and chemical analysis; ecological data including climatic tolerances, soil preferences, topography and associated species; physiology; cultivation details, pests and diseases; production; seed sources; and colour images. With the unique resources of Kew at its disposal, the SEPASAL team is currently revising and increasing the information available. The expanded database will allow more accurate assessments of the economic value and potential of individual plant species. It will also enable the handling of a wider range of enquiries in more detail than was previously possible. Requests for information should be made on the <b>Enquiry.</b> <b>Forms</b> which SEPASAL provides, and should include as much detail as possible, such as: information on the type of plant; the environmental parameters concerned; the uses required of the plants; and the country or area. The more detailed the enquiry, the more accurate will be the response. No charges will normally be made for information supplied to NGOs involved in development. However, SEPASAL charges commercial enquirers, consultancies and third parties who have secured funds for data acquisition. At present, requests should be made in writing, but SEPASAL is looking at CD-ROM and other electronic media as options for the future. Licensing agreements for the specially developed software are also a possibility. SEPASAL depends on feedback from its users, and welcomes the results of field trials or other research on species of potential value.

The study relied on basic data collected from <b>enquiry</b> <b>forms</b> which were applied to stochastic sample of air conditioned and non-air conditioned green houses.

The sample included 62 projects of non-air conditioned projects and 22 projects of air conditioned ones in the summer and autumn of 2007. the study made use of stochastic frontier functions of production according to actual hypotheses {{about how to deal with}} the stochastic errors. Based on standard estimates of the stochastic frontier function of the non-air conditioned green houses it appears that the increase in any of the green houses areas the number of employees or the variable costs of 10 %, leads to an increase in the producing of vegetable by a percentage of 9 %, 0. 7 % and 0. 2 % respectively. On the other hand, the increase in the fixed cost, by a percentage of 10 %, leads to a decrease in the vegetable producing by 0. 6 %. the estimated technical efficient by use of the stochastic frontier function for the non-air conditioned green houses ranged from a minimum of 0. 10 %, a maximum of 0. 97 % and an average of 0. 46 %. as for the air conditioned green houses, it appears that an increase in any of the fixed costs, the areas of the greenhouses and the variable costs by 10 %, leads to an increase of vegetable producing at percentages of 10. 6 %, 11. 1 % and 2. 9 % respectively. In addition, the estimated technical efficiency of the stochastic frontier function of air conditioned green houses ranged from a minimum of 0. 13 % a maximum of 0. 99 % and an average of 0. 59. The study recommended upgrading the administrative efficiency of the green house managers in order to increase producing vegetable of the air conditioned and non-air conditioned green houses by a percentage of 50. 4 % and 41. 4 respectively without any increase in the economic resources. Furthermore, the study recommended to expand the green houses projects for producing vegetables since they represent a developed technical approach to increase the producing of the vegetables in both quantity and quality, and helps to produce vegetables in other seasons. Accordingly the fluctuations in prices can be eliminated. In addition, green houses rationalize the consumption of water they save about 60 % of water used in open air agriculture.

We map out the prevailing epistemological orientation of social learning research through the de-construction of the methodological choices reported in current social learning literature. Based on an analysis of 54 empirical investigations of social learning and natural resources published after peer review, we investigated aspects of research design that include data collection methods, evidence types and the researcher's role. We consider these against different research-orientations (positivist, interpretive, critical, and post-normal). We discuss which research-orientation appears most congruent with the overall commitment and premises of social learning studies. In line with initial expectations this study shows that positivist stances are hardly present, however research that follows a postnormal approach is less frequent than initially assumed.
