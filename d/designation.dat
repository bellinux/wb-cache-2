5|$|A {{discontinuous}} {{section of}} M-78 freeway east of Flint {{was completed in}} 1969. The same year, I-475 was named the David Dunbar Buick Freeway, after the founder of Buick Motor Company in Flint; the same legislation, House Concurrent Resolution22 of 1969 named the M-78 freeway through Flint for Louis Chevrolet. In 1970, the I-496 freeway was completed and the Bus. M-78 <b>designation</b> was removed through Lansing. A freeway segment between Flint and Lapeer opened in 1971. M-21 was routed down M-13 to the new freeway where it joined the M-78 <b>designation</b> from M-13 east. The section of M-21 formerly between M-13 and Bus. M-54 was redesignated M-56. The M-78 <b>designation</b> was replaced by I-69 in 1973 after a Temporary I-69 (Temp. I-69) <b>designation</b> was extended northward from Charlotte through Lansing to Perry. On September 4 of that year, I-69's <b>designation</b> was officially extended by Congress to end at I-475 {{on the east side}} of Flint; this extension, and all subsequent ones, was of non-chargeable mileage, or segments not financed through the Interstate Highway fund.|$|E
5|$|A former Highway55 <b>designation</b> {{connected}} Highway6 and the QEW with Highway53, {{passing through}} the Mountain district of Hamilton; this route was decommissioned in 1961. The more recent <b>designation</b> was applied in late 1970, following the establishment of Niagara Region.|$|E
50|$|The Latin-letter {{extended}} <b>designations</b> {{are not as}} {{commonly used}} as the Greek-letter ones (especially in constellations with Flamsteed <b>designations),</b> {{but there are some}} exceptions such as h Persei (which is actually a star cluster) and P Cygni. Uppercase Latin Bayer <b>designations</b> in modern use do not go beyond Q; names such as R Leporis and W Ursae Majoris are variable star <b>designations,</b> not Bayer <b>designations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Survey <b>designations</b> do {{not follow}} the rules for new-style {{provisional}} <b>designations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bayer <b>designations</b> {{added by}} later astronomers {{generally}} were ordered by magnitude, but care was usually taken to avoid conflict with <b>designations</b> already assigned. In Libra, for example, the new <b>designations</b> sigma, tau, and upsilon {{were chosen to}} avoid conflict with Bayer's earlier <b>designations,</b> even though several stars with earlier letters are not as bright.|$|R
5|$|A former Highway55 <b>designation</b> {{connected}} Highway6 with Highway53, {{passing through}} the Mountain district of Hamilton. The more recent <b>designation</b> was applied in 1970, following {{the establishment of the}} Regional Municipality of Niagara. On April1, 1997, Highway55 was transferred to Niagara and designated as Niagara Regional Road55.|$|E
5|$|After 1938, the M-111 <b>designation</b> {{was given}} to an old M-6 routing in the Keweenaw Peninsula that ran between Eagle River and Phoenix along what is, now, modern-day M-26 {{parallel}} to Eagle River. That incarnation lasted two years until M-111 was deleted and M-26 was realigned over it. The M-111 <b>designation</b> has not been used since being deleted in 1940.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{original}} proposal of a belt route through Salt Lake City, the southeastern quadrant received the <b>designation</b> of I-415. To maintain continuity in the belt route, the 415 number was replaced in favor of the I-215 <b>designation</b> covering the entire route in 1969.|$|E
50|$|Gould <b>designations</b> first {{appeared}} in Uranometria Argentina, a catalogue published in 1879 by Benjamin Apthorp Gould. Many of these <b>designations</b> have fallen out of use, though for many relatively bright southern stars (which are too far south to bear Flamsteed <b>designations),</b> Gould numbers remain the only simple <b>designations</b> available without referring to cumbersome catalogue numbers.|$|R
50|$|Stars with {{existing}} Greek letter Bayer <b>designations</b> {{are not given}} new <b>designations.</b>|$|R

5|$|As the Interstate was completed, the {{highways}} that it replaced {{were removed from}} the state highway system. In 1973, the SR84 <b>designation</b> was removed from the highway from Gila Bend to the split where I-8 followed a new alignment southwest of Stanfield. In 1977, the US80 <b>designation</b> was removed from this stretch in favor of I-8.|$|E
5|$|BQ-6A - Army <b>designation</b> for TD3R-1. No {{aircraft}} produced.|$|E
5|$|By 1929, {{the first}} highway <b>designation</b> along the current M-247 was assigned. That first number was M-111, which lasted until 1937 {{when all of}} M-111 became part of M-47. In early 1961, the roadway changed numbers once more. This time M-47 was realigned to a former section of US Highway 10 (US10), and the {{connection}} to the state park was assigned the M-247 <b>designation.</b> This was the highest highway number in the state, excluding Interstates, until the 1998 <b>designation</b> of M-553 in the Upper Peninsula.|$|E

5000|$|Variable {{stars that}} do not have Bayer <b>designations</b> are {{assigned}} <b>designations</b> in a variable star scheme that superficially extends the Bayer scheme with capital Latin letters in front of the constellation name, starting with letters R to Z. Such <b>designations</b> mark them as variable stars, examples are R Mira, RR Lyrae, etc. (Many variable stars also have <b>designations</b> in other catalogues.) ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are over}} 208 <b>designations</b> {{available}} for financial-services professionals. These {{are some of}} the more common <b>designations.</b>|$|R
5|$|By 1942, the M-10 <b>designation</b> in Flint was renumbered Bus. US10, {{eliminating}} the second M-10 <b>designation</b> from the maps. The last segments of US10 that were gravel-surfaced were paved by 1948. The last section paved was between Chase and Reed City.|$|E

50|$|On December 17, 2009 {{the runway}} <b>designations</b> were changed, the former runway <b>designations</b> were: 9L-27R, 9R-27L and 13-31.|$|R
50|$|<b>Designations</b> for provincial-level and federal-level expressways in Shanghai had {{the letter}} prefix A before {{the number of}} the expressway. Starting at the Yingbin Expressway, which was {{designated}} the number 1, the numbers increased clockwise around the city. For ring expressways, the <b>designations</b> A20, A30, A40, etc., were used. For expressways connecting to other provinces which already had national <b>designations</b> (beginning with the letter G), <b>designations</b> with the letter A were attached.|$|R

5|$|During planning, {{the route}} {{was known as}} the West Durham Link. Its <b>designation</b> as Highway 412, the first new 400-series <b>designation</b> in several decades, was {{confirmed}} along with Highway 418 on February 6, 2015.|$|E
5|$|EAV-8B Matador II: Company <b>designation</b> for the Spanish Navy version.|$|E
5|$|From its {{inception}} until 1934, M-95 held the M-45 <b>designation.</b> It was renumbered to avoid confusion with the then new US 45 <b>designation</b> in the Upper Peninsula. The original M-95 was an access route to Onaway State Park which was redesignated as M-211.|$|E
50|$|The IET also grants Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Engineering Technician, and ICT Technician {{professional}} <b>designations</b> {{on behalf}} of the Engineering Council UK. IEng is roughly equivalent to North American Professional Engineer <b>designations</b> and CEng is set at a higher level. Both <b>designations</b> have far greater geographical recognition.|$|R
50|$|The R27s {{were the}} first cars to not use the {{numerical}} route <b>designations</b> used on former BMT lines; the cars ushered in letter <b>designations</b> for such routes (continuing where the IND <b>designations</b> ended). The IND routes either then or previously in use ran from A to HH; the BMT <b>designations</b> now ran from J to TT. After the merger in late 1967, many IND and BMT routes were joined together by some lines.|$|R

5|$|In 1971, M-21 was rerouted in the Flint area. After the change, {{it turned}} south along M-13 on the Shiawasseeâ€“Genesee county {{line to the}} M-78 freeway and then routed eastward to replace M-78. The former routing of M-21 {{on the western side}} of the county into {{downtown}} was redesignated M-56. When the M-21 <b>designation</b> was replaced with the I-69 <b>designation</b> in 1984, the M-56 <b>designation</b> was retired and M-21 was restored in its place.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} runs are shown below with the PW <b>designations</b> for Army aircraft and the FB <b>designations</b> being for the Navy.|$|R
5|$|Seven {{memorial}} <b>designations</b> {{have been}} applied to sections of US41. Some of these <b>designations</b> follow other highways that run concurrently with US41. Most of the <b>designations</b> {{are no longer in}} use, but the Jacobetti and Veterans memorial highways still have signage posted {{on the side of the}} road.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>designations</b> for the {{adjacent}} HRI are MFR, PNO or P/N, and SER. MIL-STD-130N narrowed up the choices significantly, so drawings from pre-2008 may now show <b>designations</b> no longer preferred. Some companies simply use the <b>designations</b> 17V, 1P and S, which are surprising easy to adjust to.|$|R
