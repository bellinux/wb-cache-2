50|$|The new {{facility}} is designed according to Moringa Project's principles of sustainability, incorporating <b>environmental</b> <b>architecture</b> {{and renewable energy}} sources such as wind and solar power. The clinic {{will be able to}} treat up to 20 people at one time, allowing the treatment of up to 300 people per day. To begin with, the clinic will focus on acupuncture as the primary treatment because resources and practitioners are already available. However, Moringa Project wants to expand to incorporate a wider range of treatments. A class room, co-ordinator's office, medicinal herb garden and volunteer accommodation has been incorporated into the design. Construction began in January 2010 and continues with a team working in Datom during January 2012.|$|E

Located in the Ventura County portion of the Santa Monica Mountains, northwest of the city of Malibu, California, the house has been widely publicized internationally because of its unique design, its sustainable use of recycled materials, the dramatic transportation of the wings to the building site that was completed by a truck and helicopter, and its creative repurposing of abandoned infrastructure to achieve an architectural work of significance. The project was completed by American architect David Randall Hertz, a fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and his firm, the Studio of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Architecture,</b> in 2011. Working with associate Lucas Goettsche, Hertz assembled a team that was able to realize the project after many years of waiting on government approvals.|$|E
5000|$|The RIA {{centers and}} the Digital Libraries act as {{community}} spaces for shared learning {{and as part}} of the online global culture. Due to their modular and <b>environmental</b> <b>architecture</b> they were included in the OECD’s 4th Compendium of Exemplary Educational Facilities (http://edfacilitiesinvestment-db.org/facilities/38). Designed by Ludens, the RIA centers provide an environment conducive to learning through spaces that are sustainable, comfortable, secure and strategically located. The registration desks and the interior walls are built with a modular design that allows them to be easily moved, opened and closed or disassembled when changing the configuration of a center. Moreover, in order to minimize waste, the dimensions of the modules are based on the materials’ industrial measurements; this way, little to no material goes unused.The location of each RIA center is determined through an [...] "urban acupuncture" [...] process that analyzes population density, income levels, educational attainment levels, the location of schools and major transportation routes. This process has aided to maximize the impact of its projects. Each RIA center benefits an average of 10.7 schools in a radius of 2 kilometers and provides services to an average of 5,000 users per year. The Digital Libraries focus on the target population by being inside public schools and combining digital learning tools, fostering reading skills and providing cultural services.|$|E
5000|$|The Mac {{provides}} the teaching required for registration {{as an architect}} in the United Kingdom, and is recognised by the Architects Registration Board (ARB) and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), in programmes that may be taken in full-time or part-time modes. [...] Many schools of architecture claim to balance art with science. It does this by juxtaposing our involvement {{in the community of}} artists, designers and architects that comprises the GSA, with their own dedicated science-led 'green' research unit within the school - MEARU (Mackintosh <b>Environmental</b> <b>Architecture</b> Research Unit). This research unit is also increasingly taking on consultancy to practitioners at feasibility or early design stage, which is then fed into the teaching from first year to postgraduate level. [...] The School collaborates in teaching with the world recognised Department of Urban Studies at Glasgow University, and runs a studio based courses for students of engineering for the universities of Glasgow and Paisley. [...] The Mac's teaching staff come {{from a wide variety of}} backgrounds and specialist subject areas and are all active in research, teaching development. The School also offers consultancy services and where possible this has involved students and staff in a number of commissions, the results of which are often fed back into the teaching and learning environment. [...] The School was recently awarded the highest rating classification by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) for the quality of its teaching, and in the last research assessment exercise The Glasgow School of Art's research activity was noted as being of national importance. [...] At the Mackintosh School of Architecture, the emphasis is on student-centred learning, which means involving students in a wide range of experiences and exercises where the individual progressively is encouraged to develop their own direction and solutions. This is achieved through set studio design projects, supported by both full-time studio tutors and leading practitioners, in a rigorous but supportive critical environment. [...] The curriculum is organised in Five Stages, covering design, construction, structures, environmental science, history, sociology, economics, law and management, as well as skills in hand drawing, computer-aided drawing, three-dimensional visualisation, modelmaking and workshop techniques, photography, audiovisual and verbal presentation, and core skills including problem solving and working with other people. [...] Students present their studio work for review by a group of their peers, staff and invited critics. The staff give a formative assessment from the reviews and a summative assessment at the end of the academic year, with continuous feedback from tutorials. The lecture courses are assessed by essay, coursework and formal written examinations. The courses contained within the programmes are necessarily wide ranging, to nurture aptitude, enthusiasm and commitment for the demands of professional practice in the contemporary world. [...] Complementing the studio-based work, there are integrated lectures, seminars and practical courses taught by both full-time and visiting lecturers. The Mackintosh School attracts the foremost international architects, designers and critics, adding value to the teaching and learning opportunities throughout the course, and balanced by a programme of staff and student exchanges with leading international schools in Australia, Barcelona, Berlin, Lusanne, Madrid, Mendrisio, Paris, Urbana-Champaign, and Vienna. Students also become involved in live projects, field and study visits, research and competitions. Recently organised study visits include Amsterdam, Aarhus, Barcelona, Paris, Copenhagen, Graz, Oporto and Stockholm.|$|E

40|$|Martin and Eaves (Heredity 38 (1) : 79 - 95, 1977) {{proposed}} a multivariate model for twin and family data {{in order to}} investigate potential differences in the genetic and <b>environmental</b> <b>architecture</b> of multivariate phenotypes. The general form of the model is the independent pathway model, which differentiates between genetic and environmental influences at the item level, and therefore permits the decomposition to differ across items. A restricted version is the common pathway model, where the decomposition {{takes place at the}} factor level. The paper has spurred numerous studies, and evidence for differences in genetic and <b>environmental</b> <b>architecture</b> has been established for personality and several other psychiatric phenotypes by showing a better fit of the independent pathway model compared to the common pathway model. We show that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that use an aggregate score computed from multiple questionnaire items as a univariate phenotype implicitly assume a similar structure as the common pathway model. It has been shown that in case of a differential genetic and <b>environmental</b> <b>architecture,</b> multivariate GWAS methods can outperform the univariate GWAS approach. However, current multivariate methods rely on the assumptions of phenotypic and genetic homogeneity, that is, item responses are assumed to have the same means and covariances, and genetic effects are assumed to be the same for all subjects. We describe a distance-based regression technique that is designed to account for subgroups in the population, and that therefore can account for differential genetic effects. A first evaluation with simulated data shows a substantial increase of power compared to univariate GWAS. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E
