40|$|Abstract—Demand {{response}} programs seek to ad-just {{the normal}} consumption patterns of electric power consumers {{in response to}} incentive payments that are offered by utility companies to induce lower consumption at peak hours or when the power sys-tem reliability is at risk. While prior studies have extensively studied the capacity of offering demand response in buildings by controlling the load at air conditioners, water heaters, and various home appli-ances, they lack to offer methods to also utilize the full <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> of automatic lighting control systems. Since lighting systems consume {{a large amount of}} the total energy used in buildings, addressing this shortcoming is an important research problem. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to take a systematic optimization-based approach to assess <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> of automatic lighting con-trol systems in commercial and office buildings...|$|E
40|$|Before a {{building}} {{can participate in}} a demand response program, its facility managers must characterize the site's ability to reduce load. Today, this is often done through manual audit processes and prototypical control strategies. In this paper, we propose {{a new approach to}} estimate {{a building}}'s <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> using detailed data from various sensors installed in a building. We derive a formula for a probabilistic measure that characterizes various tradeoffs between the available <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> and the confidence level associated with that curtailment under the constraints of building occupant comfort level (or utility). Then, we develop a data-driven framework to associate observed or projected building energy consumption with a particular set of rules learned from a large sensor dataset. We apply this methodology using testbeds in two buildings in Singapore: a unique net-zero energy building and a modern commercial office building. Our experimental results identify key control parameters and provide insight into the available demand response strategies at each site.

With the advancement of the communication technologies and smart load monitoring devices, access to this information become simpler.

A smart monitoring and controlling system is integrated into a household's electric appliances to study their daily energy consumption profiles and identify their potential <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> <b>capacity.</b> This paper intends to draw interest on the benefits from using the smart monitoring and controlling system, for instance, it provides real-time energy consumption feedbacks, standby power consumption information and remote load control flexibility.

40|$|Recently, {{a massive}} {{focus has been}} made on <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> (DR) programs, aimed to {{electricity}} price reduction, transmission lines congestion resolving, security enhancement and improvement of market liquidity. Basically, <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> programs are divided into two main categories namely, incentive-based programs and time-based programs. The focus {{of this paper is}} on Interruptible/Curtailable service (I/C) and capacity market programs (CAP), which are incentive-based <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> programs including penalties for customers in case of no responding to load reduction. First, by using the concept of price elasticity of demand and customer benefit function, economic model of above mentioned programs is developed. The proposed model helps the independent system operator (ISO) to identify and employ relevant DR program which both improves the characteristics of the load curve and also be welcome by customers. To evaluate the performance of the model, simulation study has been conducted using the load curve of the peak day of the Iranian power system grid in 2007. In the numerical study section, the impact of these programs on load shape and load level, and benefit of customers as well as reduction of energy consumption are shown. In addition, by using strategy success indices the results of simulation studies for different scenarios are analyzed and investigated for determination of the scenarios priority.

40|$|Demand {{response}} is believed {{by some to}} become a major contributor towards system balancing in future electricity networks. Shifting or reducing demand at critical moments can {{reduce the need for}} generation capacity, help with the integration of renewables, support more efficient system operation and thereby potentially lead to cost and carbon reductions for the entire energy system. In this paper we review the nature of the response resource of consumers from different non-domestic sectors in the UK, based on extensive half hourly demand profiles and observed demand responses. We further explore the potential to increase the <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> through changes in the regulatory and market environment. The analysis suggests that present demand response measures tend to stimulate stand-by generation capacity in preference to load shifting and we propose that extended response times may favour load based demand response, especially in sectors with significant thermal loads...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of Electric Vehicles (EVs) {{together with the}} implementation of smart grids will raise new challenges to power system operators. This paper proposes a demand response program for electric vehicle users which provides the network operator with another useful resource that consists in reducing vehicles charging necessities. This demand response program enables vehicle users to get some profit by agreeing to reduce their travel necessities and minimum battery level requirements on a given period. To support network operator actions, the amount of demand response usage can be estimated using data mining techniques applied to a database containing a large set of operation scenarios. The paper includes a case study based on simulated operation scenarios that consider different operation conditions, e. g. available renewable generation, and considering a diversity of distributed resources and electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capacity and <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> in a 33 bus distribution network...|$|E
40|$|To ensure {{stability}} of the power grid, electricity supply and demand must remain in balance in real time. Traditionally utilities, call upon peaking power plants to increase power generation to meet the peak demand during the afternoons of the hot summer months. Demand-side management (DSM), which includes energy efficiency and demand response (DR), works {{from the other side}} of the equation - instead of adding more generation to the system, it pays energy users to reduce consumption as it is cheaper and easier to procure than traditional generation. As a consequence, demand-side management allows utility customers to act as a 2 ̆ 2 virtual power plant 2 ̆ 2 : by voluntarily lowering their demand for electricity, they help stabilize the grid, and they are paid for providing this important service. Utilities and grid operators treat <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> as a dispatchable resource that is called upon only when needed. This thesis reviews the different DMS methods, and then it evaluates one possible means of reducing demand by operating at the low end of the acceptable voltage supply a method known as Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR). This method was used effectively in the past to conserve energy and it is still being applied in some regions. But as the load is becoming more and more nonlinear and more energy efficient, the CVR is becoming a less effective tool for demand-side management...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the research work performed {{to show the}} capability {{of a combination of}} tools based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Physically Based Load Models (PBLM) to classify and extract pat-terns from distributor, aggregator and customer electrical demand databases (the objective known as data mining). This approach basically uses low cost information avail-able for almost all supply side agents: historic load curves of several kinds of customers. The first objective is to find a correlation between demand and the evolution of energy prices in short-term energy markets. A SOM was trained that should allow to select the most suitable customer clusters whose demand modification would benefit cus-tomer and supply-side agents through, for example, energy efficiency, distributed generation or <b>demand</b> <b>response.</b> After a previous evaluation through PBLM of different possible strategies to reduce demand during consumption peaks, a SOM was trained to detect opportunities among users with high reduction capabilities during periods when day-ahead prices are lower than shorter-term prices. The results obtained clearly show the suitability of SOM ap-proach to find easily coherent clusters between electrical users with high <b>demand</b> or available <b>response</b> <b>capacity,</b> and therefore a possible way to promote customer partici-pation in electrical energy markets is opened...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{from the}} U. S. {{and some other}} {{countries}} indicates that organized wholesale markets for electrical energy and operating reserves do not provide adequate incentives to stimulate the proper quantity or mix of generating capacity consistent with mandatory reliability criteria. A {{large part of the}} problem can be associated with the failure of wholesale spot market prices for energy and operating reserves to rise to high enough levels during periods when generating capacity is fully utilized. Reforms to wholesale energy markets, the introduction of well-design forward capacity markets, and symmetrical treatment of <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> and generating <b>capacity</b> resources to respond to market and institutional imperfections are discussed. This policy reform program is compatible with improving the efficiency of spot wholesale electricity markets, the continued evolution of competitive retail markets, and restores incentives for efficient investment in generating capacity consistent with operating reliability criteria applied by system operators. It also responds to investment disincentives that have been associated with volatility in wholesale energy prices, limited hedging opportunities and to concerns about regulatory opportunism. ...|$|R
30|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{and distributed}} generation are increasingly {{integrated into the}} electricity customer side, which increases diversity and uncertainty of electricity demand. Evaluating energy efficiency, safety and <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> of electricity users becomes correspondingly more essential and complicated. The major issue for SEU is how to enhance energy efficiency and demand response capability of electricity users while ensuring electricity safety. Thus, proper evaluation indices for electricity users are crucial in SEU. Much research on evaluation indices has been reported, focused {{on the performance of}} either single pieces of electrical equipment [1] or the entire system [2, 3]. In [4], demand response strategies applied to air-conditioning peak load in Australia were described. Reference [5] evaluated the impact of electrical substations on the static and dynamic performance of electric power systems, while considering their possible operating states. Economic and low-carbon day-ahead Pareto-optimal scheduling was discussed in [6] for wind farms integrated into power systems with the use of demand response. The future evolution of automated demand response systems in smart grids for a low-carbon economy was presented in [7]. However, existing literature rarely evaluates electricity users according to their distinct features such as load aggregation, regularity, and deferability, and pay very limited attention to the changing characteristics of electricity users in various scenarios. In addition, existing research largely ignores the interaction between electricity users and distributed generation and other new energy equipment when evaluating the demand response capability of electricity users.|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in reducing the environmental and human-­‐health impacts resulting from electricity generation. Renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy conservation are all commonly suggested solutions. Such interventions may provide health and environmental benefits by displacing emissions from conventional power plants. However, the generation mix varies considerably from region to region and emissions vary by the type and age of a generator. Thus, the benefits of an intervention {{will depend on the}} specific generators that are displaced, which vary depending on the timing and location of the intervention. Marginal emissions factors (MEFs) give a consistent measure of the avoided emissions per megawatt-­‐hour of displaced electricity, which can be used to evaluate the change in emissions resulting from a variety of interventions. This thesis presents the first systematic calculation of MEFs for the U. S. electricity system. Using regressions of hourly generation and emissions data from 2006 through 2011, I estimate regional MEFs for CO 2, NOx, and SO 2, as well as the share of marginal generation from coal-­‐, gas-­‐, and oil-­‐fired generators. This work highlights significant regional differences in the emissions benefits of displacing a unit of electricity: compared to the West, displacing one megawatt-­‐hour of electricity in the Midwest is expected to avoid roughly 70 % more CO 2, 12 times more SO 2, and 3 times more NOx emissions. I go on to explore regional variations in the performance of wind turbines and solar panels, where performance is measured relative to three objectives: energy production, avoided CO 2 emissions, and avoided health and environmental damages from criteria pollutants. For 22 regions of the United States, I use regressions of historic emissions and generation data to estimate marginal impact factors, a measure of the avoided health and environmental damages per megawatt-­‐ hour of displaced electricity. Marginal impact factors are used to evaluate the effects of an additional wind turbine or solar panel in the U. S. electricity system. I find that the most attractive sites for renewables depend strongly on one’s objective. A solar panel in Iowa displaces 20 % more CO 2 emissions than a panel in Arizona, though energy production from the Iowa panel is 25 % less. Similarly, despite a modest wind resource, a wind turbine in West Virginia is expected to displace 7 times more health and environmental damages than a wind turbine in Oklahoma. Finally, I shift focus and explore the economics of small-­‐scale cogeneration, which has long been recognized as a more efficient alternative to central-­‐station power. Although the benefits of distributed cogeneration are widely cited, adoption has been slow in the U. S. Adoption could be encouraged by making cogeneration more economically attractive, either by increasing the expected returns or decreasing the risks of such investments. I present a case study of a 300 -­‐kilowatt cogeneration unit and evaluate the expected returns from: <b>demand</b> <b>response,</b> <b>capacity</b> markets, regulation markets, accelerated depreciation, a price on CO 2 emissions, and net metering. In addition, I explore the effectiveness of feed-­‐in tariffs at mitigating the energy-­‐price risks to cogeneration projects...|$|E
30|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} of a smart grid, there have been growing interests in the flexibility of <b>demand</b> <b>response.</b> The total <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> from different types of demand side resources (DSRs) is considerable [13, 14]. Among all the DSRs, the DG is able to decrease its power generation [15], and the electric vehicle (EV) is able to operate as a mobile energy storage unit with its rapid charging and discharging capabilities [16], and the thermostatically-controlled load (TCL) can respond to the power variations by switching between “ON” and “OFF” [17]. These available DSRs with different response characteristics have been proven to be effective resources for <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> at the <b>demand</b> side. Thus, a number of DSRs are able to provide various types of ancillary services for the power grid. Considering the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> from the EVs [16] and TCLs [17], these resources were able to mitigate the voltage variations in the distribution network with DGs. Meanwhile, the power loss of the distribution network was minimized based on a real-time coordination of the EV charging load [18, 19]. The EVs were able to operate as an EES to reshape the load profile and alleviate the peak load relying on their rapid responding capability [20, 21]. The TCLs, such as heat pumps, were able to smooth the power fluctuations of the tie-line with DGs [22, 23].|$|R

Considerable {{progress has been}} made in recent years to harness <b>demand</b> <b>response.</b> However, most of this potential remains to be developed. The paper draws from IEA experience to identify barriers to <b>demand</b> <b>response,</b> and possible enablers that can encourage more timely {{and effective}} <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> including cost reflective pricing, retail market reform, and improved load control and metering equipment. Governments have a key role to play in developing and implementing the policy, legal, regulatory and market frameworks needed to empower customer choice and accelerate the development and deployment of cost-effective <b>demand</b> <b>response.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} is an energy intensive process which, together with water treatment, comprises about {{three percent of}} U. S. annual energy use. Yet, since wastewater treatment facilities are often peripheral to major electricity-using industries, they are frequently an overlooked area for automated <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> opportunities. <b>Demand</b> <b>response</b> {{is a set of}} actions taken to reduce electric loads when contingencies, such as emergencies or congestion, occur that threaten supply-demand balance, and/or market conditions occur that raise electric supply costs. <b>Demand</b> <b>response</b> programs are designed to improve the reliability of the electric grid and to lower the use of electricity during peak times to reduce the total system costs. Open automated <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> is a set of continuous, open communication signals and systems provided over the Internet to allow facilities to automate their <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> activities without the need for manual actions. Automated <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> strategies can be implemented as an enhanced use of upgraded equipment and facility control strategies installed as energy efficiency measures. Conversely, installation of controls to support automated <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> may result in improved energy efficiency through real-time access to operational data. This paper argues that the implementation of energy efficiency opportunities in wastewater treatment facilities creates a base for achieving successful demand reductions. This paper characterizes energy use and the state of <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> readiness in wastewater treatment facilities and outlines automated <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> opportunities...|$|R
40|$|Open Automated <b>Demand</b> <b>Response</b> (OpenADR), an XML-based {{information}} exchange model, {{is used to}} facilitate continuous price-responsive operation and <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> participation for large commercial buildings in New York who {{are subject to the}} default day-ahead hourly pricing. We summarize the existing <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> programs in New York and discuss OpenADR communication, prioritization of <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> signals, and control methods. Building energy simulation models are developed and field tests are conducted to evaluate continuous energy management and <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> capabilities of two commercial buildings in New York City. Preliminary results reveal that providing machine-readable prices to commercial buildings can facilitate both <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> participation and continuous energy cost savings. Hence, efforts should be made to develop more sophisticated algorithms for building control systems to minimize customer's utility bill based on price and reliability information from the electricity grid...|$|R

From an economic point of view, <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> can shift energy use from high-cost to low-cost periods, thus reducing the costs of generation. From a power system reliability point of view, <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> can help maintain the system frequency and supply-demand balance.|$|R
