2500|$|He {{has opposed}} the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would amend the US Constitution to define {{marriage}} as {{the union of}} one man and one woman, because <b>he</b> <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> with its passage “liberal social engineers who wish to use federal government power to redefine marriage {{will be able to}} point to the constitutional marriage amendment as proof that the definition of marriage is indeed a federal matter! [...] I am unwilling either to cede to federal courts the authority to redefine marriage, or to deny a state’s ability to preserve the traditional definition of marriage.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Nancy and Darren marry. Fox {{explained}} that [...] "getting married {{is important to}} Nancy. For all her wanting to be alternative and different, she really just wants to be loved". Dawson said that Darren is relieved that the wedding goes ahead as <b>he</b> <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> Nancy is [...] "too good for him". On how marriage will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "the only way it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves {{to both of them}} how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Commenting on the couple's future Dawson said that children are [...] "definitely something that they both want, as everything's going well [...] Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future". Fox said that Nancy's life is going well and she has a [...] "got this big family that care about her, having had no-one for so long". She added that her character [...] "loves Darren to pieces" [...] and she wanted to get married and then [...] "have babies and be happy. I think that's what she really wants".

2500|$|Justice Alito wrote a {{concurrence}} {{joined by}} Justice Thomas, {{in which he}} agrees with the Court's primary reasoning, but separately emphasizes that, he believes, the Court's holding [...] "does {{not and should not}} extend beyond employees who testify in internal investigations or engage in analogous purposive conduct." [...] Alito disagrees with the Sixth Circuit that [...] "opposition" [...] must be consistent and initiated by the employee, but writes that the opposition must be [...] "active and purposive." [...] Alito finds the majority's definition of oppose could also [...] "embrace silent opposition," [...] and it is questionable whether that is protected. <b>He</b> <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> an [...] "interpretation of the opposition clause that protects conduct that is not active and purposive" [...] would [...] "open the door to retaliation claims by employees who never expressed a word of opposition to their employers." [...] As a hypothetical, he asks if an employee would be protected in a case where the opposition was expressed in an informal [...] "water cooler" [...] chat. A fired employee could claim that the termination was retaliatory if the employers became aware of the views the employee had expressed. He notes that EEOC retaliation charges doubled between 1992 and 2007 and fears that an [...] "expansive interpretation of protected opposition conduct would likely cause this trend to accelerate." ...|$|E

50|$|Last year, {{he said in}} an {{interview}} with the ISNA news agency <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> the perception among many Iranians that Mr. Ahmadinejad had failed as president would leave people disappointed with religion. He said this was because Mr. Ahmadinejad had said his government would be based on religious values.|$|R
2500|$|Two other novelists {{should be}} mentioned, for they, like Fielding and Richardson, were in {{dialogue}} through their works. [...] Laurence Sterne's and Tobias Smollett's works offered up oppositional {{views of the}} self in society and the method of the novel. The clergyman Laurence Sterne consciously set out to imitate Jonathan Swift with his Tristram Shandy (17591767). Tristram seeks to write his autobiography, but like Swift's narrator in A Tale of a Tub, <b>he</b> <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> nothing in his life can be understood without understanding its context. [...] For example, he tells the reader that {{at the very moment}} he was conceived, his mother was saying, [...] "Did you wind the clock?" [...] To clarify how he knows this, he explains that his father took care of winding the clock and [...] "other family business" [...] on one day a month. [...] To explain why the clock had to be wound then, he has to explain his father. [...] In other words, the biography moves backward rather than forward in time, only to then jump forward years, hit another knot, and move backward again. [...] It is a novel of exceptional energy, of multi-layered digressions, of multiple satires, and of frequent parodies. Journalist, translator, and historian Tobias Smollett, on the other hand, wrote more seemingly traditional novels. [...] He concentrated on the picaresque novel, where a low-born character would go through a practically endless series of adventures. Sterne thought that Smollett's novels always paid undue attention to the basest and most common elements of life, that they emphasized the dirt. [...] Although this is a superficial complaint, it points to an important difference between the two as authors. [...] Sterne came to the novel from a satirical background, while Smollett approached it from journalism. [...] In the 19th century, novelists would have plots much nearer to Smollett's than either Fielding's or Sterne's or Richardson's, and his sprawling, linear development of action would prove most successful.|$|E

50|$|He {{warned that}} without {{lowering}} the contact rate gay men would produce {{and maintain the}} highest incidence and prevalence of STD infections in the US, which has occurred. <b>He</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> such patterns of behavior would prompt the emergence of novel STD pathogens and drug resistant forms of established STD pathogens. This has also occurred.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{everyone}} agrees with these principles. Notably, the Secretary of State {{at the time}} of the Doctrine's publishing, Secretary of State George Shultz, [...] "took strong public objection to them". <b>He</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> without credible threats of military action, [...] "American diplomacy...would be hamstrung by the military's supposed reluctance to become involved in 'limited' wars".|$|R
5000|$|According to Robert Osborne, host of Turner Classic Movies, Gish {{prepared}} for the death scene by not drinking or eating for three days.

Lily's older brother, former child actor Monty Malenfant (and an openly gay man), is suspicious of Philip but goes along to keep Lily happy.|$|R
25|$|Etheredge-Ouzts also {{chose to}} keep the killer as {{anonymous}} as possible. He wanted the audience to project their fears onto the murderer, assigning a motive and background to him themselves. Adding details seemed to rob the character of menace, he felt. This approach led Etheredge-Ouzts to cut all the killer's lines from the film, as <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> {{a portion of the}} audience would find whichever voice was used not frightening.|$|R
