If the correlation is found than it could mean that BIA might be used to point the need for extra DXA measurements, and earlier diagnosis of osteoporosis. Material and Methods: 27 young adults (11 males and 16 females) aged 19 - 23 years were measured by BIA instrument for body composition analysis, and by DXA instrument for BMD and BMC at the L 1 -L 4 vertebrae of the lumbar spine postanteriorly and the proximal femur („hip”).

The impact of severe refractory asthma (SRA) on fat free mass (FFM) has not been investigated. Methodology and Principal Findings: 213 subjects (70 healthy smokers, 71 COPD patients and 72 asthma patients) without significant comorbidities were included in the study. In all patients, body composition assessment (using bioelectrical <b>impendance</b> analysis, skinfold and anthropometric measurements) and spirometry were performed. Differences in fat free mass index (FFMI) between groups were assessed and determinants of FFMI in asthma were evaluated. Patients with SRA had lower values of FFMI compared to patients with mild-to-moderate asthma [18. 0 (17. 3 – 18. 3) – 19. 5 (18. 4 – 21. 5), p, 0. 001], {{despite the fact that they}} were more obese.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a coder and decoder of fractal signals of comb-type structure (FSCS) based on microcontrollers (MC). The coder and decoder consist of identical control modules, while their managed modules have different schematic constructions. The control module performs forming or recognition of signals, and also carries out {{the function of}} information exchange with a computer. The basic element of the control module is a PIC 18 F 2550 microcontroller from MicroChip. The coder of the system forms fractal signals of a given order according to the information bits coming from the computer. Samples of the calculated values of the amplitudes of elementary rectangular pulses that constitute the structure of fractal pulses are stored {{in the memory of}} the microcontroller as a table. Minimum bit capacity of the DAC necessary for the generation of FSCS of fourth order is four bits. The operation algorithm, "wired" into the controller of the program, provides for encoding of the transmitted information by two-bit symbols. Recognition of the start of transmission of each byte in communication channel is performed by the transmission of the timing signal. In a decoder the microcontroller carries out reception and decoding of the received fractal signals which are then transmitted to the computer. The developed algorithm of the program for the microcontroller of the decoder is carried out by determination of order of fractal impulse after the value of sum of amplitudes of elementary impulses, constituents fractal signal. The programs for coder and decoder are written in "C". In the most critical places of the program influencing on the fast-acting of chart “assembler” insertions are done. The blocks of the coder and decoder were connected with a coaxial 10 meters long cable with an <b>impendance</b> of 75 Ohm. The signals generated by the developed coder of FSCS, were studied using a digital oscillograph. On the basis of the obtained spectrums, it is possible to draw a conclusion, that the fractal signals formed by the coder are wideband and can be used in noise-resistant and protected communication systems...|$|E

Sports Physiol., Vol. 9, No. 1 pp. 1 - 6, 2003. Bielectrical <b>impendance</b> spectoroscopy (BSI) {{has been}} {{validated}} {{as a method}} to estimate total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW). Extensive studies using BIS have already been reported. BIS is a sage, noninvasive pricedure that estimates TBW and ECW in real time. There are, however, very few studies on TBW and ECW in the whole body and active muscles through maximal exercise. Examining changes in ICW and ECW and their effects in physiological function through exercise is critical. Data for changes in ICW and ECW of the whole doby and active muscles throuth excrcise of different intensity and duration using BIS {{can be used for}} the prevention of heat injury and deterioration of performance and for examining the effects of exercise during body weight reduction on ICW and ECW. There are also few studies on the cahnges in ICW and ECW of active musckes through exercise. Active thigh musckes that are heavily used for exercise {{are more likely to be}} affected gy the exercise than the whole body. The purpose of the first stage of this study was to examine the changes of ICW and ECW in the whole body and the active muscles through maximal excrcise using BIS and to obtain information of changes in ICW, ECW and TBW through exercise. Thirteen male university athletes aged 19. 1 ± 1. 5 years performed an incremental maximal exercise using an ergometer. ICW, ECW and TBW were measured before and after exercise using BIS. The subjects showed significant loss of body weight (p> 0. 01) after the exercise. ECW and TBW in the whole body did not change significantly after the exericise. ICW in the whole body increased significantly (p> 0. 05). In the right thigh ECW increased significantly) p> 0. 01), and ICW+ECW decreased significantly (p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 01 respectively). There were no significant changes in the rations of ICW and ECW to TBW in the whole body before and after the exercise, the ratios of ICW and ECW to ICW+ECW in the right thigh before and after the exercise changed sinicieantly (p< 0. 001), indicating that the ratio of ICW to ICW+ECW had decreased, and that the ratio of ECW to ICW+ECW had increased. These results indigate that in the post exercise stage, maximal exericise had little influsence on volumes of ICW and ECW and on ratios of ICW and ECW to TBW in the whole body and that ICW in active muscles is likely to decrease after between 10 to 15 minutes have elapsed following maximal exercise...|$|E
