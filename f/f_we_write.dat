Erdős: if x and y are positive integers such that for any n ≥ 1 the set of primes dividing xn− 1 {{is the same as the}} set of primes dividing yn− 1, then must x equal y? Corrales-Rodrigáñez and Schoof gave an affirmative answer to this question in [3] and also answered the corresponding question for elliptic curves; this was generalized by Banaszak, Gajda and Krasoń i...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{this paper}} K {{is a field}} of {{characteristic}} zero, ¯ K its algebraic closure and Gal(K) = Aut (¯ K/K) the absolute Galois group of K. We write k for a field of characteristic zero and k(t) for the field of rational functions over k in independent variable t. If d is a positive integer then we write k(t 1, [...] . td) for the field of rational functions over k in d independent variables t 1, [...] . td. If X is an abelian variety over ¯ K then we write End(X) for the ring of all its ¯K-endomorphisms and End 0 (X) for the corresponding Q-algebra End(X) ⊗Q; the notation 1 X stands for the identity automorphism of X. If m is a positive integer then we write Xm for the kernel of multiplication by m in X (¯ K). It is well-known [11] that Xm is a free Z/mZ-module of rank 2 dim(X). If X is defined over K then Xm is a Galois submodule in X (¯ K). Definition 0. 1. Suppose that K contains a field k and X is an abelian variety defined over K. We say that X is isotrivial over k if there exists an abelian variety X 0 over ¯ k such that X and X 0 are isomorphic over ¯ K. We say that X is completely non-isotrivial over ¯ k if for every abelian variety W over ¯ k there are no non-zero homomorphisms between X and W over ¯ K. Let f(x) ∈ K[x] be a polynomial of degree n ≥ 3 with coefficients in K and without multiple roots, Rf ⊂ Ka the (n-element) set of roots of f and K(Rf) ⊂ Ka the splitting field of <b>f.</b> <b>We</b> <b>write</b> Gal(f) = Gal(f/K) for the Galois group Gal(K(Rf) /K) of f; it permutes roots of f and {{may be viewed as}} a certain permutation group of Rf, i. e., as as a subgroup of the group Perm(Rf) ∼ = Sn of permutation of Rf. (Gal(f) is transitive if and only if f is irreducible.) Suppose that p is a prime that does not divide n and a positive integer q = pr is a power of p then we write Cf,q for the superelliptic K-curve yq = f(x) and J(Cf,q) for its jacobian.

40|$|Given a DG-category A we {{introduce}} the bar category of modules Modbar(A). It is a DG-enhancement of the derived category D(A) of A which is isomorphic to {{the category of}} DG A-modules with A-infinity morphisms between them. However, it is defined intrinsically {{in the language of}} DG-categories and requires no complex machinery or sign conventions of A-infinity categories. We define for these bar categories Tensor and Hom bifunctors, dualisation functors, and a convolution of twisted complexes. The intended application is to working with DG-bimodules as enhancements of exact functors between triangulated categories. As a demonstration we develop homotopy adjunction theory for tensor functors between derived categories of DG-categories. It allows us to show in an enhanced setting that given a functor F with left and right adjoints L and R the functorial complex FR [...] > FRFR [...] > FR [...] > Id lifts to a canonical twisted complex whose convolution is the square of the spherical twist of <b>F.</b> <b>We</b> then <b>write</b> down four induced functorial Postnikov towers computing this convolution.

40|$|AbstractLet r, n and n 1,…,nr be {{positive}} integers with n=n 1 +⋯+nr. Let X be a connected graph with n vertices. For 1 ≤i≤r, let Pi be the i-th color class of ni distinct pebbles. A {{configuration of the}} set of pebbles P=P 1 ∪⋯∪Pr on X {{is defined as a}} bijection from the set of vertices of X to P. A move of pebbles is defined as exchanging two pebbles with distinct colors on the two endvertices of a common edge. For a pair of configurations <b>f</b> and g, <b>we</b> <b>write</b> f∼g if <b>f</b> can be transformed into g by a sequence of finite moves. The relation ∼ is an equivalence relation on the set of all the configurations of P on X. We study the number c(X,n 1,…,nr) of the equivalence classes. A tuple (X,n 1,…,nr) is called transitive if for any configuration f and for any vertex u, a pebble f(u) can be moved to any other vertex by a sequence of finite moves.
