500|$|By the 1960s Nelson {{had become}} so reclusive {{that he would not}} let even trusted friends visit him without first sending a {{postcard}} to ask his permission. He ventured into town once a week to check his mail at the post office, and would sometimes buy steaks, {{but for the most part}} he remained holed up in his cabin. Years later, his nephew recalled his uncle's change in personality: [...] "During the last 10 years, his <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> to lose their sparkle. He became a lonely man, and a rather sick one." ...|$|E
500|$|While English {{newspapers}} suppressed {{mention of}} the Prince's name {{in association with the}} case, Welsh-language, colonial, and American newspapers were less inhibited. The New York Times ridiculed him as a [...] "dullard" [...] and [...] "stupid perverse boy", who would [...] "never be allowed to ascend the British throne". According to one American press report, when departing the Gare du Nord in Paris in May 1890, Albert Victor was cheered by a waiting crowd of English, but hissed and catcalled by some of the French; one journalist present asked him if he would comment [...] "as to the cause of his sudden departure from England". According to the report, [...] "The Prince's sallow face turned scarlet and his <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> to start from their orbits," [...] and he had one of his companions upbraid the fellow for impertinence.|$|E
2500|$|Describing a book {{publication}} party in 1973 for Norman Mailer's : [...] " [...] {{stood in a}} slight crouch, feet apart, toes in, like a fighter; a good middleweight, over the hill, but game. His pale-blue <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> alternately to burn and disconnect, as if his circuits were overloaded...They [...] had never met in life, and here was now, revealing himself as her last, most passionate, most hopeless lover...They seemed an odd couple: Mailer so open, Marilyn so closed. He should have called their book The Naked and the Dead." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with {{expanding}} eyes and quickened breath. A globed light each soft <b>eye</b> <b>seemed</b> to him.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Peyton's <b>eye</b> <b>seemed</b> to leap up {{and hold}} Clarence's with a sudden, strange significance, {{and then looked}} down.|$|R
60|$|Then {{again he}} stood still, and again faced the Englishman, his dark enquiring <b>eyes</b> <b>seeming</b> {{to probe the}} latter's deepest thoughts.|$|R
2500|$|Lawry's men left {{directly}} for South Africa. Already tired, they confronted fast and bouncy pitches {{in contrast to}} low, slow and dusty spinning pitches in India. Upon arrival, Lawry declared Ian Chappell {{to be the best}} batsman in the world, something that would come back to haunt him. For his part, the Australian commentator Alan McGilvray said that when they arrived in Johannesburg, the Australians [...] "looked haggard. Their <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> to be standing out of their heads and some of them looked positively yellow." [...] The Australians played their first match of the tour within a week of leaving the subcontinent. Prior to this first match, most of the team were seen sleeping on the benches at the ground half an hour before play was due to start. Initially, it appeared that the Australians were unaffected by the long campaign and change in conditions; they won their first two lead-in matches against their provincial sides by an innings and ten wickets respectively, Lawry scoring 86 against North Eastern Transvaal and 157 against Griqualand West, finishing unbeaten on both occasions. They drew the third match against Eastern Province, Lawry again unbeaten twice on 9 and 43.|$|E
60|$|But the half-closed <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> {{still to}} send an agonized message.|$|E
60|$|Her <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to moisten}} and grow deeper as she gave confirmation.|$|E
6000|$|... “To me, her <b>eyes</b> <b>seem</b> more treacherous {{than those}} of Inez,” {{declared}} Arthur, who had liked the little Mexican nurse {{because she had been}} so fond of Toodlums. “They never meet your gaze frankly, those <b>eyes,</b> but <b>seem</b> always trying to cover some dark secret of which the girl is ashamed.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What, boy?--On the {{supposition}} that Monsieur de Vervillin {{did meet}} with Sir Gervaise by day-break, what, in your experienced <b>eyes,</b> <b>seem</b> {{most likely to}} be the consequences?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Gundulump - a Flanimal {{resembling}} a legged {{version of the}} Plamglotis. It has a tongue that sticks out and its <b>eyes</b> <b>seem</b> {{to be close to}} its tongue.|$|R
60|$|He stood there, {{holding her}} hands. His <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> to be devouring her.|$|E
60|$|Virginia {{shook her}} head sorrowfully. Her great <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> full of real regret.|$|E
60|$|The women's <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> to sparkle {{at these}} words, {{but they said}} nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hate 'em! Suff-gist!" [...] She looked penetratingly at Mrs. Pett. Her left <b>eye</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to pounce}} {{out from under}} its tangled brow. [...] "You S'porter of th' Cause?" ...|$|R
6000|$|CLARE'S <b>eyes</b> <b>seem</b> to {{fly from}} him, {{to appeal to}} him, to resign [...] herself all at once. Something in the YOUNG MAN responds. He [...] drops his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{near you}} been to sabbage, Michael?" [...] demanded Big Smash, her two large coal-black <b>eyes</b> <b>seeming</b> to open in a degree {{proportioned}} to her interest in the answer.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he looked}} at me, and his {{brooding}} <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> to scan my face.|$|E
60|$|Her <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to narrow}} a little, and the smile upon her lips was forced.|$|E
60|$|Sir Henry's blue <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> {{suddenly}} like {{points of}} steel {{as he leaned}} towards her.|$|E
6000|$|... "He must be right, uncle; for his <b>eye</b> <b>seems</b> {{never to}} fail. But {{it is now}} urgent to know whether we meet as friends or foes. They may be French." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{makes me}} a bit nervous, though," [...] Shepherd remarked apologetically. [...] "They're a regular keen-looking tribe, I can tell you. Their <b>eyes</b> <b>seem</b> to follow you all over the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|When I met II. at last--after {{finishing}} the survey--her cheek was flushed, and her <b>eye</b> <b>seemed</b> to swim. [...] "Well, H.," [...] said I, [...] "have you drank deep enough this time?" ...|$|R
60|$|Lassen's {{face was}} livid and his <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> like beads. Bellamy handed back the coat.|$|E
60|$|Then Arnold {{took his}} courage into both hands. Her <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{compelling}} him.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked into}} my face and smiled, and the steel-coloured <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> moist and {{singularly}} soft.|$|E
60|$|Then she blazed out. The sallowness of her cheeks, {{the little}} dip under her cheekbones--she had grown thinner {{during the last}} week or so--made her <b>eyes</b> <b>seem</b> larger and more {{brilliant}} than ever.|$|R
60|$|Petru {{returned}} to his brothers, and told them what had befallen him; but not long after it struck him that his father's left <b>eye</b> <b>seemed</b> to weep less, {{and the right to}} laugh more.|$|R
30|$|Although, {{the jitter}} is visible for the user, {{it is not}} as bad as it seems as the human <b>eye</b> <b>seems</b> to cope with it; the fovea tracks the virtual objects {{especially}} when they move.|$|R
60|$|Noel smiled, {{showing her}} upper teeth, and her <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> to swim under their long lashes.|$|E
60|$|She paused. Her <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{following}} out the mystic design painted upon her fan.|$|E
60|$|By {{the light}} of the candle in his silver {{candlestick}} her dark <b>eyes</b> <b>seemed</b> suddenly alive.|$|E
60|$|He {{came forward}} for the usual {{perfunctory}} kiss, but she recoiled, {{and it was then}} that his <b>eye</b> <b>seemed</b> to grasp the significance of her travelling suit and veil, and he glanced at her face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{he cried}} again, [...] "poor horse! Don't die!" [...] And tears {{dropped out of}} his eyes on to the horse's cheek. The <b>eye</b> <b>seemed</b> to give him a look, and became quite glazed.|$|R
60|$|Bellecour eyed them in cold disdain, until {{presently}} Charlot and {{his bride}} were abreast of him. Then his <b>eye</b> <b>seemed</b> to take {{life and his}} sallow face to kindle into expression. He leant lightly from the saddle.|$|R
