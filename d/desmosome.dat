50|$|Desmocollin-3 is a calcium-dependent {{glycoprotein}} that is {{a member}} of the desmocollin subfamily of the cadherin superfamily. These desmosomal family members, along with the desmogleins, are found primarily in epithelial cells where they constitute the adhesive proteins of the <b>desmosome</b> cell-cell junction and are required for cell adhesion and <b>desmosome</b> formation. The loss of these components leads to a lack of adhesion and a gain of cellular mobility.|$|E
40|$|<b>Desmosomes</b> in tissues are {{resistant}} to disruption by chelation of extracellular calcium. It {{has been suggested that}} this represents a hyper-adhesive state of these intercellular junctions that is crucial for the maintenance of epidermal integrity. <b>Desmosomes</b> change to a lower affinity, calcium-dependent adhesive state when cells are cultured at low density or when an intact epithelial cell sheet is wounded. Here we demonstrate that cells of the immortalized human keratinocyte line HaCaT acquire calcium-independent <b>desmosomes</b> in confluent culture. An adhesion assay shows that HaCaT cells with calcium-independent <b>desmosomes</b> are more cohesive than cells with calcium-dependent <b>desmosomes.</b> This assay relates directly to desmosomal adhesion because it involves splitting of the desmosomal adhesive material. Moreover, the difference in adhesiveness between calcium-dependent and calcium-independent <b>desmosomes</b> involves no quantitative change in the known protein composition of <b>desmosomes.</b> Instead, switching between the two adhesive states can be achieved by activation or inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), suggesting a direct effect of PKC signalling on desmosomal adhesion. These results provide direct support for the concept of hyper-adhesiveness in <b>desmosomes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is {{a chronic}} {{cutaneous}} autoimmune blistering disease that {{is characterized by}} superficial blistering of the skin, {{and according to the}} current perspective is caused by autoantibodies directed against desmoglein (Dsg) 1. Objectives To examine early acantholysis in the skin of patients with PF at an ultrastructural level. Methods Two Nikolsky-negative (N-), five Nikolsky-positive (N+) and two lesional skin biopsies from immunoserologically defined patients with PF were studied by light and electron microscopy. Results We found no abnormalities in N- PF skin, whereas all the N+ skin biopsies displayed intercellular widening between <b>desmosomes,</b> a decreased number of <b>desmosomes</b> and hypoplastic <b>desmosomes</b> in the lower epidermal layers. Acantholysis was present in two of five N+ biopsies, but only in the upper epidermal layers. The lesional skin biopsies displayed acantholysis in the higher epidermal layers. Hypoplastic <b>desmosomes</b> were partially (pseudo-half-desmosomes) or completely torn off from the opposing cell. Conclusion We propose the following mechanism for acantholysis in PF: initially PF IgG causes a depletion of nonjunctional Dsg 1, leading to intercellular widening between <b>desmosomes</b> starting in the lower layers and spreading upwards. Depletion of nonjunctional Dsg 1 impairs the assembly of <b>desmosomes,</b> resulting in hypoplastic <b>desmosomes</b> and a decreased number of <b>desmosomes.</b> In addition, antibodies might promote disassembly of <b>desmosomes.</b> In the upper layers of the epidermis, where Dsg 3 is not expressed and cannot compensate for Dsg 1 loss, ongoing depletion of Dsg 1 will finally result in a total disappearance of <b>desmosomes</b> and subsequent acantholysis...|$|R

The dynamic ultrastructural changes of FS IgG-induced acantholysis in mice {{are the subject}} of this study. FS lgG was injected IP into neonatal BALB/c mice. Skin and serum was studied at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h post injection by immunofluorescence (IF), electron microscopy (EM), and immuno-EM. Binding of ES IgG in the intercellular spaces (ICS) of the basal cell layer was seen by IF within 1 h and was strongest at 12 h. IgG binding affected the spinous and granular cell layer by 12 h, then faded and remain localized only in the basal cell layer at 24 h. By immuno-EM, IgG binding was diffuse along the keratinocyte surface. Edema of the ICS in the basal cell layer was present at 1 h by EM. At 12 h, there was microvillous formation with intact <b>desmosomes</b> {{at the tip of the}} projections. Splitting of <b>desmosomes</b> (forming half <b>desmosomes)</b> and acantholysis primarily affecting the granular cell layer were most prominent between 12 and 24 h. The plaques of the half <b>desmosomes</b> gradually disappeared and tonofilaments retracted into the cytoplasm. Detaching keratinocytes showed vacuolization, swollen mitochondria, and internalization of intact <b>desmosomes</b> and half <b>desmosomes</b> (remnants of split <b>desmosomes).</b> This investigation shows that the ultrastructural changes observed in the epidermis of patients with FS can be duplicated in experimental animals by IP injection of FS IgG.

Studies in zebrafish expressing a mutant desmocollin-2 have shed light on its function in the myocardium as a pivotal component for normal myocardial structure and function.

50|$|Plakophilin-2 is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the PKP2 gene.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{embryonic}} development tissues remain malleable {{to participate}} in morphogenetic movements but on completion of morphogenesis they must acquire the toughness essential for independent adult life. <b>Desmosomes</b> are cell–cell junctions that maintain tissue integrity especially where resistance to mechanical stress is required. <b>Desmosomes</b> in adult tissues are termed hyper-adhesive because they adhere strongly and are experimentally resistant to extracellular calcium chelation. Wounding results in weakening of desmosomal adhesion to a calcium-dependent state, presumably to facilitate cell migration and wound closure. Since <b>desmosomes</b> appear early in mouse tissue development we hypothesised that initial weak adhesion would be followed by acquisition of hyper-adhesion, {{the opposite of what}} happens on wounding. We show that epidermal <b>desmosomes</b> are calcium-dependent until embryonic day 12 (E 12) and become hyper-adhesive by E 14. Similarly, trophectodermal <b>desmosomes</b> change from calcium-dependence to hyper-adhesiveness as blastocyst development proceeds from E 3 to E 4. 5. In both, development of hyper-adhesion is accompanied by the appearance of a midline between the plasma membranes supporting previous evidence that hyper-adhesiveness depends on the organised arrangement of desmosomal cadherins. By contrast, adherens junctions remain calcium-dependent throughout but tight junctions become calcium-independent as <b>desmosomes</b> mature. Using protein kinase C (PKC) activation and PKCα−/− mice, we provide evidence suggesting that conventional PKC isoforms are involved in developmental progression to hyper-adhesiveness. We demonstrate that modulation of desmosomal adhesion by PKC can regulate migration of trophectoderm. It appears that tissue stabilisation is one of several roles played by <b>desmosomes</b> in animal development...|$|R
40|$|<b>Desmosomes</b> and corneodesmosomes are {{the most}} {{important}} adhering junctions, providing strength for the epidermal sheet structure made of living keratinocytes and enucleated stratum corneum corneocytes, respectively. These junctions are connected directly with transmembrane desmosomal cadherins, desmogleins (Dsgs), and desmocollins (Dscs); mainly Dsg 1 /Dsc 1 and Dsg 3 /Dsc 3 in <b>desmosomes,</b> and Dsg 1 /Dsc 1 with corneodesmosin in corneodesmosomes. Dsgs and Dscs are associated with several proteins at their inner cytoplasmic domains to anchor keratin intermediate filaments. <b>Desmosomes</b> are not static, but dynamic units that undergo regular remodeling to allow for keratinocyte outward-migration in the epidermis. In corneodesmosomes, this dynamic nature of <b>desmosomes</b> is lost by fixing desmosomal cadherins with corneodesmosin at the intercellular domain of <b>desmosomes</b> and possibly with the formation of peptide bonds by activation of transglutaminase- 1 at the intracellular face of <b>desmosomes.</b> Immediately after formation, corneodesmosomes normally commit to degradation, which is complicatedly regulated by proteolytic cleavage of their respective extracellular portions, via kallikrein-regulated peptidases and cathepsins. This proteolytic activity is in turn controlled by a variety of inhibitory agents, including protease inhibitors, cholesterol sulfate, and an acidic gradient. The impairment of protease control causes keratinization disorders. This review focuses on the regulation of corneodesmosome remodeling in relation to disorders of the stratum corneum...|$|R

40|$|The structure, function, and {{regulation}} of desmosomal adhesion in vivo are discussed. Most <b>desmosomes</b> in tissues exhibit calcium-independent adhesion, which is strongly adhesive or &# 8220;hyperadhesive&# 8221;. This {{is fundamental to}} tissue strength. Almost all studies in culture are done on weakly adhesive, calcium-dependent <b>desmosomes,</b> although hyperadhesion can be readily obtained in confluent cell culture.

Hyperadhesion appears {{to be associated with}} an ordered arrangement of the extracellular domains of the desmosomal cadherins, which gives rise to the intercellular midline identified in ultrastructural studies. This in turn probably depends on molecular order in the desmosomal plaque. Protein kinase C downregulates hyperadhesion and there is preliminary evidence that it may also be regulated by tyrosine kinases. Downregulation of <b>desmosomes</b> in vivo may occur by internalisation of whole <b>desmosomes</b> rather than disassembly. Hyperadhesion has implications for diseases such as pemphigus...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular calcium {{concentration}} {{has been}} shown to control the stratification of cultured keratinocytes, presumably by regulation of formation of <b>desmosomes.</b> Previous studies have shown that keratinocytes cultured in medium containing 0. 1 mM Ca++ form loose colonies without <b>desmosomes.</b> If the Ca++ is raised to 1 mM, <b>desmosomes</b> are assembled and the distribution of keratin filaments is altered. We have examined the disposition of vinculin and actin in keratinocytes under similar conditions. Using immunofluorescence microscopy we show that raising [Ca++] in the medium dramatically alters the distribution of vinculin and actin and results in the formation of adherens-type junctions within 15 min after switching to high calcium medium. Borders of cells at the edge of colonies, which are not proximal to other cells, are not affected, while cells in the interior of the colony form junctions around their periphery. Attachment plaques in keratinocytes grown in low calcium medium are located at the ventral plane of the cell, but junctions formed after switching to high calcium are not, as demonstrated by interference reflection microscopy. In cells colabeled with antibodies against vinculin and desmoplakin, vinculin-containing adherens junctions were visible before desmosomal junctions when cells were switched to high calcium. Although newly formed vinculin- containing structures in high calcium cells, like <b>desmosomes,</b> colocalize with phase-dense structures, superimposition of video fluorescence images using digitized fluorescence microscopy indicates that adherens junctions and <b>desmosomes</b> are discrete structures.
