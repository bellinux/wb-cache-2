2500|$|Nearly {{two years}} later, Carey was named referee of Super Bowl XLII. On working the NFL's {{championship}} game, Carey {{said it was}} a [...] "personal honor" [...] and understood the historical significance of being the first African American referee. On the significance of the event, he {{said it was a}} [...] "great sign of the evolution of our society that all barriers are eroding". During the fourth quarter, Carey's judgment was a factor in one of the important plays of the game. On third down, with just over a minute left in regulation, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning received the snap in a shotgun formation and looked to pass the ball. New England Patriots defenders Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green, and Adalius Thomas grabbed and attempted to tackle Manning. Manning escaped the two defenders and threw a 32-yard pass to wide receiver David Tyree. Under NFL rules, officials are required to stop play when a player is [...] "in the grasp and control" [...] of the defense. Carey determined that [...] "grasp and control" [...] was never achieved since Manning's forward momentum did not stop. Speaking about the play, Carey said, [...] "I anticipated a sack. I didn't assume that was going to happen, but rarely <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> quarterback escape when he's got that much weight on his back and being dragged by two or three guys who had a hold of him. I could see [...] head was just straight ahead. He was trying to break free with desperation. Then all of a sudden he spun out and then he started to come right back at me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff always {{considered}} aesthetic and moral {{aspects of the}} game; {{it is not just}} about winning, but about winning with [...] "right" [...] style/way. He also always spoke highly of entertaining value of the game. The beautiful game, for him, is about as much the entertainment and joy as the results. In thinking of Cruyff, the victory is truly meaningful when it can fully capture the minds and hearts of competitors and spectators. As he once noted, [...] "Quality without results is pointless. Results without quality is boring,". For Cruyff and the Cruyffistas (Cruyff's devout followers), to choose a [...] "right" [...] style of play to win is even more important than winning itself. Cruyff always believed in simplicity. He sees simplicity and beauty as inseparable. [...] "Simple football is the most beautiful. But playing simple football is the hardest thing," [...] as Cruyff once summed up his fundamental philosophy. [...] "How often <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> pass of forty meters when twenty meters is enough?... To play well, you need good players, but a good player almost always has the problem of a lack of efficiency. He always wants to do things prettier than strictly necessary." [...] Cruyff also perfected a feint now known as the [...] "Cruyff Turn". The feint {{is an example of the}} simplicity in Cruyff's football philosophy. It was neither carried out to embarrass the opponent nor to excite the watching crowd, but because Cruyff estimated that it was the simplest method (in terms of effort and risk versus expected result) to beat his opponent. Cruyff looked to pass or cross the ball, then, instead of kicking it, he dragged the ball behind his planted foot with the inside of his other foot, turned through 180 degrees, and accelerated away. As Sweden defender Jan Olsson (a [...] "victim" [...] of the Cruyff Turn at the 1974 World Cup) recalled, [...] "I played 18 years in top football and seventeen times for Sweden but that moment against Cruyff was the proudest moment of my career. I thought I'd win the ball for sure, but he tricked me. I was not humiliated. I had no chance. Cruyff was a genius." [...] With its high effectiveness and unpredictability, the Cruyff Turn remains one of the most commonly used dribbling moves in modern football.|$|E

How many millions of living creatures are there on that one sprig? Look here!--a brown polype, with long waving arms--a gigantic monster, actually a full half-inch long. He is Hydra fusca, most famous, and earliest described (I think by Trembley). Ere we go home I may show you perhaps Hydra viridis, with long pea-green arms; and rosea, most beautiful in form and colour of all the strange family. You see that lump, just where his stalk joins his bell-head? That is a budding baby. Ignorant of the joys and cares of wedlock, he increases by gemmation. See! here is another, with a full-sized young one growing on his back. You may tear it off if you will--he cares not. You may cut him into a dozen pieces, they say, and each one will grow, as a potato does. I suppose, however, that he also sends out of his mouth little free ova--medusoids--call them what you will, swimming by ciliae, which afterwards, unless the water beetles stop them on the way, will settle down as stalked polypes, and in their turn practise some mystery of Owenian parthenogenesis, or Steenstruppian alternation of generations, in which all traditional distinctions of plant and animal, male and female, are laughed to scorn by the magnificent fecundity of the Divine imaginations.|$|E
