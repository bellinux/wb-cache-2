Versatility is enhanced with variable horizontal pitch, a full 128 -US ASCII-character set, and flexible interfacing. by Todd M.

At present, devices that produce these pages fall into the general cate gory of printers.

40|$|Abstract. The Big-character printer is a <b>dot-matrix</b> <b>print</b> {{equipment}} {{used in industry}} field. The print head is the key part of it. Sixteen jet valves are arranged in three lines alternated regular framework. Every valve is driven by giant magnetostractive actuator (GMA). The dynamic characters of valve body and GMA have been studied in the paper. The square wave response experiment shows that the valve bandwidth is more than 400 Hz. The response plot has a good agreement with the simulation result. Meanwhile, the print dots are clear. Therefore, the BCP based on GMA could fulfill the requirement...|$|R
5000|$|Early {{personal}} computer software {{focused on the}} processing of text, but as graphics displays became ubiquitous throughout the {{personal computer}} world, users wanted to print both text and images. Ironically, whereas the daisy-wheel printer and pen-plotter struggled to reproduce bitmap images, the first dot-matrix impact printers (including the MX-80) lacked the ability to print graphics. Yet the <b>dot-matrix</b> <b>print</b> head was well-suited to this task, and the capability, referred to as [...] "dot-addressable" [...] quickly became a standard feature on all dot-matrix printers intended for the personal and home computer markets. In 1981, Epson offered a retrofit EPROM kit called Graftrax to add the capability to many early MX series printers. Banners and signs produced with software that used this ability, such as Broderbund's Print Shop, became ubiquitous in offices and schools throughout the 1980s.|$|R
2500|$|Printing of {{documents}} was initially accomplished using IBM Selectric typewriters modified for ASCII-character input. These were later replaced by application-specific daisy wheel printers, first developed by Diablo, {{which became a}} Xerox company, and later by Qume. For quicker [...] "draft" [...] <b>printing,</b> <b>dot-matrix</b> line printers were optional alternatives with some word processors.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{manufacturers}} implemented color <b>dot-matrix</b> impact <b>printing</b> {{through a}} multi-color ribbon. Color was achieved through a multi-pass composite printing process. During each pass, the print head struck a different {{section of the}} ribbon (one primary color). For a 4-color ribbon, each printed line of output required up to 3 passes depending on color. In some color printers, such as the Apple ImageWriter II and Star Micronics NX-1000C [...] "Rainbow" [...] or the optional color kits for the NEC Pinwriter series, the printer moved the ribbon vertically relative to the fixed print head assembly. In other models, the print head was tilted against a stationary ribbon.|$|R

Demand for using {{more than one of}} these sets of letters at the same time led to the 16 bit Unicode. Demand for Chinese characters led to 20-bit Unicode, which clearly is impossible for any typewriter like formed character mechanical teleprinter, although <b>dot-matrix</b> printers can <b>print</b> Chinese characters.) ...|$|R
50|$|By 1980 daisy wheel {{printers}} {{had become}} the dominant technology for high-quality text <b>printing.</b> <b>Dot-matrix</b> impact, thermal, or line printers were used where higher speed or image printing were required and poor print quality was acceptable. Both technologies were rapidly superseded for most purposes when dot-based printers - in particular laser printers - that could print any characters or graphics, rather than being restricted to a limited character set, became able to produce output of comparable quality. Daisy wheel technology is now found only in some electronic typewriters.|$|R
50|$|Comb printers, {{also called}} line matrix printers, printed {{a matrix of}} dots instead of {{individual}} characters {{in the same way}} as single-character dot matrix printers, but using a comb of hammers to print a portion of an entire row of pixels at one time (for example, every eighth pixel). By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row could be printed (continuing the example, in eight cycles). The paper then advanced and the next pixel row was printed. Because far less print head motion was involved than in a conventional dot matrix printer, these printers were much faster, and competitive in speed with formed-character line printers without being restricted to a set of available characters, thus being able to <b>print</b> <b>dot-matrix</b> graphics and variable-sized characters.|$|R
