5|$|Haraldr Guðrøðarson's reign {{was not a}} long one. In 1250, {{the chronicle}} records that he was summoned by letter to the Norwegian royal court because Hákon was displeased at how Haraldr Guðrøðarson had wrongfully seized the kingship which was not his by right. The chronicle notes that the Norwegian king {{intended}} that Haraldr Guðrøðarson should never return to Mann, and he was consequently kept from returning to the island-kingdom. Nothing further is <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1943 season, Wensloff enlisted in the United States Army and served in World War II. When the Yankees were preparing {{for the start of the}} 1944 season, the team originally had no idea where Wensloff was, as they had not <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> He was inactive for the 1944 season. In 1945, Wensloff was traded from the Yankees to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League for Johnny Kreevich, allowing him to simultaneously pitch professionally and continue serving in the war. In 10 games for the Padres, he won three and lost four with a 3.82 ERA. After the 1945 season and the war ended, Wensloff remained in military service, and as a result did not play in 1946.|$|E
5|$|By January 1967, Suharto felt {{confident}} that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> and he died in June 1970. On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto {{for the first of}} his five-year terms as President.|$|E

5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received {{a telephone call from}} him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To said this was a reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking whether they had <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the case would be closed as resolved.|$|E
25|$|First {{letter to}} the Lord Bishop of Salisbury, on that episcopal charge which the letter-writer <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> with much sorrow in 1842 (1845). The Christian Remembrancer was dismissive of this {{controversial}} work.|$|E
25|$|Cowdery met Joseph Smith on April 5, 1829—a {{year and}} a day before the {{official}} founding of the church—and <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> how he had received golden plates containing ancient Native American writings. Cowdery told Smith {{that he had seen}} the golden plates in a vision before the two ever met.|$|E

6000|$|Her father {{waited for}} her to go on, but {{apparently}} she was going to leave the word to him, now. He hesitated to take it, but he asked at last with a mildness that seemed to surprise her, [...] "Have you <b>heard</b> anything <b>from</b> <b>him</b> since?" ...|$|R

25|$|Barnet Burns' booklet was {{published}} at Rouen in about 1839 and in 1840 {{he was at}} Le Havre. Burns was apparently summoned by Queen Victoria {{to take part in}} an English expedition to New Zealand in the capacity of interpreter. Following his departure, Burns' wife, Anne never <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, Truth's son Peter {{took a job}} on a {{whaling ship}} called the Zone of Nantucket. From 1840 to 1841, she {{received}} three letters from him, though in his third letter {{he told her he}} had sent five. Peter said he also never received any of her letters. When the ship returned to port in 1842, Peter was not on board and Truth never <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, Poppo's family—including his daughter—had not <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> in over 30 years. During that time, they assumed that Poppo was dead and {{suspected}} that he had killed himself. They were shocked to learn he was still alive at {{the time of}} the incident. Poppo has since completed treatment and was last residing in a Medicaid facility. He received nutritional and occupational therapy and took up the guitar.|$|E

25|$|French police {{identified}} the perpetrator as Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, a 31-year-old man of Tunisian nationality, born in Tunisia, with a French residency permit {{and living in}} Nice. His parents live in Tunisia and rarely <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> since he moved to France in 2005. His father said Lahouaiej-Bouhlel underwent psychiatric treatment before he moved to France. He married a French-Tunisian cousin, living in Nice, {{with whom he had}} three children. According to his wife's lawyer, he was repeatedly reported for domestic violence and the couple separated.|$|E
25|$|As a {{nurse in}} a {{hospital}} ward, Lavinia speaks to wounded soldiers and prisoners of war in Washington, specifically asking about her brother, Isaac, who was imprisoned for assaulting a fellow government official. She had hoped that they had seen or <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> {{while they were in}} the prison camps. The Washington officials ignore her plea to free Isaac. Lavinia is only able to speak to the president on Isaac's behalf because of the intervention of a man, Dr. Norval's friend, Mr. Sinclair. Lavinia then realizes that her belief in being able to voice her opinions equally with men is unrealistic.|$|E
25|$|In 1525 or 1526 news of {{the rivalry}} between Alonso de Estrada and Gonzalo de Salazar in the {{government}} of New Spain reached Madrid, as did rumors of the death of Hernán Cortés {{at the hands of the}} Indigenous. (Cortés had not been killed. He was absent from the capital on an expedition to Honduras, but word had not been <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> for some time.) King Charles I (Emperor Charles V) ordered a juicio de residencia (a commission of inquiry) to investigate Cortés and ascertain the true situation in the colony, and the state of the interim government.|$|E

25|$|Ziad Jarrah, Atta, and al-Shehhi, having progressed {{in their}} training, all took foreign trips {{during the holiday}} period of 2000-2001. When Atta {{returned}} to Florida, al-Shehhi left for Morocco, traveling to Casablanca in mid-January 2001. al-Shehhi's family, concerned about not having <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> reported him missing to the UAE government. The UAE embassy in turn contacted the Hamburg police and a UAE representative tried to find him in Germany, visiting mosques and al-Shehhi's last address in Hamburg. After learning that his family was looking for him, al-Shehhi telephoned them on 20 January {{and said he was}} living and studying in Hamburg. The UAE government then told the Hamburg police they could call off the search.|$|E
25|$|A {{decade after}} the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, {{contacted}} him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project, and eventually the two settled on a sequel to The Way We Were. In it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed {{they did not want}} Pollack {{to be part of the}} equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script but, aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written, and decided she wanted to produce and direct it as well as co-star with Redford, but did not want to work with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as good as he remembered it being, and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he was interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring Kathie Lee Gifford. Laurents declined, and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo ever since.|$|E
25|$|Following the American Revolution, many ships used as privateers {{were too}} large for short voyages in the {{coasting}} trade, and their owners determined to open new avenues of trade to distant countries. The young men of the town, fresh from service on the armed ships of Salem, were eager to embark in such ventures. Captain Nathaniel Silsbee, his first mate Charles Derby, and second mate Richard J. Cleveland were not yet twenty years old when they set sail on a nineteen-month voyage that was perhaps the first from the newly independent America to the East Indies. In 1795, Captain Jonathan Carnes set sail for Sumatra in the Malay Archipelago on his secret voyage for pepper; nothing was <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> until eighteen months later, when he entered with a cargo of pepper in bulk, {{the first to be}} so imported into the country, and which sold at the extraordinary profit of seven hundred per cent. The Empress of China, formerly a privateer, was refitted as the first American ship to sail from New York to China. By 1790, Salem had become the sixth largest city in the country, and a world-famous seaport—particularly in the China Trade, along with exporting codfish to Europe and the West Indies, importing sugar and molasses from the West Indies, tea from China, and products depicted on the city seal from the East Indies – in particular Sumatran pepper. Salem ships also visited Africa – Zanzibar in particular, Russia, Japan, and Australia.|$|E

[...] However, on 22 July 2005, The Independent reported that [...] "the 17 year old mouser is alive and well and living in South London."

She felt it a real exposure: she remembered her young friends' surprised and frightened eyes, and not only had no doubt their mother would really think her too naughty to be their playfellow, but almost wished {{that it might be}} so--she could never, never bear to see them again.|$|R
