5000|$|A {{second round}} of labour {{hostilities}} broke out in March 1940. This was prompted by successful wildcat strike action by European miners at two Copperbelt mines, who demanded increased basic pay, a war bonus and a closed shop to prevent the advancement of African miners. The European strikers' demands were largely conceded, including an agreement on preventing the permanent [...] "dilution of labour". This {{was followed by a}} refusal to grant a proportionate increase of pay to African miners, who then went on strike despite the offer of slightly <b>increased</b> <b>bonus</b> payments. The government urged the mine-owners to increase the African miners' pay, but following a confrontation between workers collecting their pay and diehard strikers, it also tried to force the miners to return to work, using troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. In the violence that followed, the troops fired on the strikers, causing 13 deaths immediately and four later. The Colonial Secretary forced the governor to hold a Commission of Inquiry, which found that conditions at Nkana and Mufulira had little changed from 1935, although at Nchanga and Roan Antelope no strike had happened. It recommended increases in pay and improvements in conditions, which the mine-owners agreed, and also that African miners should be eligible for jobs previously reserved for European miners. This last recommendation was not implemented then, but was gradually introduced after 1943.|$|E

This study conducted a process of data collection, data manipulation, and data-mining algorithms executed against the entire enlisted TPU population and focused toward attrition behavior. Significant factors in determining attrition behavior included time in service, <b>increased</b> <b>bonus</b> levels and the Delayed Entry Program. Mobilizations, in and of themselves, appear to have little impact. The models we built showed significant potential for predicting behavior. We believe that this process should be continued and expanded to a tool to aid in and affect attrition. US Army (USA) author...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe surface warfare community has recently <b>increased</b> <b>bonus</b> amounts {{in an attempt}} to reward quality performance and retain superior officers. Simultaneously, the community has started to offer alternative programs and incentives that might appeal to those officers who desire a flexible career. We used survey information to determine which of these were the most appealing to the community in a way that might provide cost savings to the military when provided in conjunction with an auction bonus system. Using the standard bonus system compared to the uniform price auction, the Quality Adjusted Discount (QUAD) auction, and Combinatorial Retention Auction Mechanism (CRAM), we determined which would be most effective for maintaining quality officers in the community while meeting retention objectives and providing cost savings. We found that a quality auction system could provide cost savings as much as $ 1, 850, 000 or could increase costs by as much as $ 2, 081, 250, depending on community retention levels, even with increased individual bonus amounts. Additionally, from survey responses we were able to discern additional non-monetary incentives that surface warfare officers desire, which could be used to improve retention of quality officers in the future.

40|$|Performance {{measurement}} is {{an essential}} thing for a company. To become the winner in this global competition world, the company has to show a performance improvement from period to period. Recently, financial performance measurement {{is not enough to}} reflect the real business performance. That is why Kaplan developed Balanced Scorecard Concept. The Balanced Scorecard Concept measures the organization's performance through four perspectives they are the financial perspective, customer perspective, internal business process perspective and learning and growth perspective. This research was conducted to examine the performance of PT. Mitra Unggas Sejati using Balanced Scorecard. The result was used to formulate Balanced Scorecard so that the Overall Cost Leadership Strategy adopted could formulate the goals, mission, and vision of the company. The data were collected from all the respondents, 32 respondents for customers perspective and 96 employees concerning each for internal business process perspective and learning and growth perspective, all of the year 2002, hence a census. The data were computed with the SPSS computer program. The result of the analysis showed that the 2000 - 2002 financial ratio increased because company growth rate can be achieved. Other result is that it needs to improve the four perspectives so that company strategy can achieve the corporate goals, mission, and vision with <b>increased</b> <b>bonus</b> program and credit agreement, speedy settlement of customers' complaint, improvement of standard operating procedure which less than maximum, and enhancement of employee training so that employee satisfaction can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|A {{majority}} of the bridges and viaducts in the Netherlands {{were built in the}} sixties and seventies of the last century and many of them will need to be replaced in the near future due to technical or functional reasons. This is a replacement issue, faced by many countries worldwide. But what about the concrete structures? Should we replace them with the same structural systems and by using the same conventional concrete as used before? Or do we apply the newly developed concrete types, such as Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) and Strain Hardening Cementitious Composites (SHCC) and install them with structural health monitoring techniques? In the paper the findings of several exploratory studies, performed at Delft University of Technology, are presented. In general, but especially for the replacement of existing structures, there is a tendency for increasing the slenderness of the concrete structures. In tenders it is even seen that contractors can get an <b>increased</b> <b>bonus</b> when building with reduced heights. A driving force is the fact that piers in roads are highly undesirable (freedom in space), while, in order to reduce additional costs, the new bridge should stay aligned with the existing roads. Most of the existing viaducts in the Netherlands are three or four span plate bridges with a total span between 20 and 60 m. Is it feasible to replace these by single span bridges with slenderness as high as 60 ? In a feasibility study, the possibilities for this are investigated and steps to be made are addressed. The exploratory study focuses on long, slender concrete structures, which can be obtained by applying Advanced Cementitious Materials (ACMs) while furthermore new building methods are explored. In general, the idea is to make steps towards our future SMART bridges for which structural health monitoring, sustainability, no hinder, zeroenergy, no maintenance and aesthetics are keywords.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between discretionary accruals (DAs) and audit fees and whether this relationship is affected by the chief financial officer's (CFO) compensation structure. Design/methodology/approach – Using a large sample of cross-sectional firms over the period 2000 - 2006, multiple ordinary least square regression models are estimated. Findings – The paper finds that there is a positive and significant association between DAs and audit fees. Evidence shows that this relationship is significantly higher as CFO's <b>bonuses</b> <b>increase</b> and that this relationship is moderated as CFO's salaries increase. It is also found that income-increasing DAs are positively and significantly related with audit fees and that <b>increase</b> in CFO's <b>bonuses</b> signifies this positive relationship. Research limitations/implications – Results may change during the current financial crisis (i. e. 2007 -present) due to the increased regulatory scrutiny of executive compensation. Practical implications – The study has regulatory implications because of the recent calls to require a mandate regulating executive compensation practices. The results support these calls as data show that <b>increased</b> <b>bonuses</b> are associated with higher discretionary accruals and thus higher audit fees. There is also a call to limit executive compensation to fixed amounts and data support that increase in salaries moderates the positive association between discretionary accruals and audit fees. These results can also be used by independent auditors when assessing risks and thus the results have practical audit implications. Originality/value – The paper uses a large sample of public firms in years leading to the current financial crisis and contributes to the literature in executive compensation and audit practiceAuditor's fees, Bonuses, Chief executives, Remuneration, United States of America...|$|R
