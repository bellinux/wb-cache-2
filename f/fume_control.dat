40|$|The {{main concern}} with welding {{processes}} {{has in the}} past, generally, concentrated on productivity and quality. However, the occupational health of the welder {{has become a major}} focal area in the last decade, and the working environment of the welder is becoming a more important area of investigation. One particular area of interest is the amount of fume present in the operator’s breathing zone. With the potentially hazardous material present in the breathing environment of the welder, an effective method of controlling this airborne contaminant must be adopted to limit exposure levels to within occupational health and safety limits and to ensure the well being of the worker. This investigation examines the distribution of fume and breathing zone concentration within a controlled space using the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. The controlled working environment provided the basis for quantifying breathing zone exposure concentrations, and the ability to predict operator exposure. The initial evaluation focused on determining the breathing zone concentration and the welding fume plume dispersal within a confined enclosure. Within a sealed environment GMA welding was performed for approximate 100 % duty cycle with two types (copper and non-copper coated) of ER- 70 S filler wire. The breathing zone and background enclosure concentrations were measured. The purpose of this initial investigation was to evaluate the breathing zone concentration within a confined environment, and to determine a fundamental concentration for direct evaluation of control procedures. The inclusion of the non-copper (low-fuming) coated electrode was to validate the measurements obtained during the study. The low-fuming electrode provided the expected reduction in exposure concentrations in comparison with the copper coated wire, however the concentrations measured over a 15 minute welding cycle were substantial higher than Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) exposure limits. To aid the evaluation of <b>fume</b> <b>control</b> effectiveness, various ventilation strategies were incorporated into the controlled environment. Utilising various modes of general and local extraction enabled an evaluation of the measured breathing zone concentration to be compared with the non-ventilated situation, as well as indicating their relationship with the occupational exposure limits for welding fume. This enabled the breathing zone exposure concentration to be effectively reduced to meet the OHS exposure limits. Although all techniques significantly reduced the exposure concentration, in direct comparison with the confined ‘fundamental’ concentrations, only an appropriately installed local extraction technique provided the required reduction. As well as the breathing zone evaluation, a model to predict the initial dispersion of GMAW fume was developed, aiding in better determining welding fume plume flow behaviour characteristics. This analysis, in addition with classical plume theories, enabled a model of the fume plume characteristics to be developed...|$|E

This study complements previous results obtained using other eagents (H 2 SO 4, C 1 HSO 3). After HNO 3 exposure the microhardness of polyethylene decreases very rapidly, instead of increasing after the first hours of treatment. The hardness decrease is correlated to the volume fraction of interlamellar microvoids arising through selective acid digestion. For longer treatment times (t> 40 h) {{the fragility of the}} materialincreases and the sample collapses under the indenter. The hardening of the degraded material fter recrystallization from the melt is followed as a function of treatment time.

40|$|Controversy {{exists as}} to why silica fume {{increases}} the strength of concrete when it {{is used as a}} partial replacement for cement. Some evidence supports the view that the increase in strength is due to an increase in the strength of the cement paste constituent of concrete. However, con-tradictory evidence exists that shows no increase in the strength of cement paste, but substantial increases in concrete strength, when silica fume is used. The latter evidence is used to support the theory that silica fume strengthens concrete by strengthening the bond between cement paste and aggregate. This study is designed to explain the contradictory evidence and establish the role played by silica <b>fume</b> in <b>controlling</b> the strength of concrete and its constituent materials. These goals are ac-complished using cement pastes, mortars, and concretes with water-cementitious material ratios ranging from 0. 30 to 0. 39. Mixtures incorporate no admixtures, a superplasticizer only, or silica fume and a superplasticizer. The research demonstrates that replacement of cement by silica fume and the addition of a superplasticizer increases the strength of cement paste. It also demonstrates that cement paste specimens, with or without silica fume, can exhibit reduced strength compared to other specimens with the same water-cementitious material ratio if the material segregates during fabrication, thus explaining some earlier experimental observations. The segregation of cement paste is caused by high superplasticizer dosages that do not cause segregation of concrete with the same water-cementitious material ratio. Concrete containing silica fume as a partial replacement for cement exhibits an increased compressive strength because of the improved strength of its cement paste constituent. Changes in the paste-aggregate interface caused by silica fume appear to have little effect on the uniaxial compressive strength of concrete...|$|R

The silica fume contents were 5, 10, 15 and 20 %, by weight of cement. Four different curing conditions were used: air curing, control curing and two other curing conditions recommended by BS 8110 and ACI 308 - 81. The cementitious material (binder) content was constant (400 kg/m 3); the water/cement (w/c) ratio was also maintained at a constant value of 0. 35; while the water/binder (w/b) ratio ranged from 0. 35 to 0. 28.

An in vitro lipolysis model was used to quantify the lipase-mediated digestion kinetics {{of a series of}} lipid vehicles formulated with caprylic/capric triglycerides: lipid solution, submicrometer lipid emulsions (in the presence and absence of silica), and SLH microcapsules. The importance of emulsification on lipid digestibility is evidenced by the significantly higher initial digestion rate constants for SLH microcapsules and lipid emulsions (> 15 -fold) in comparison with that of the lipid solution. Silica particles exerted an inhibitory effect on the digestion of submicrometer lipid emulsions regardless of their initial location, i. e., aqueous or lipid phases. This inhibitory effect, however, was not observed for SLH microcapsules. This highlights the importance of the matrix structure and porosity of the hybrid microcapsule system in enhancing lipid digestibility as compared to submicrometer lipid emulsions stabilized by silica. For each studied formulation, the digestion kinetics is well correlated to the corresponding in vivo plasma concentrations of a model drug, celecoxib, via multiple-point correlations (R 2 > 0. 97). This supports the use of the lipid digestion model for predicting the in vivo outcome of an orally dosed lipid formulation.

Though {{recent studies have shown}} correlation between manganese exposure and both nail tissue concentration as well as concentrations in dopaminergic regions of the brain, concerns of the validity of nail tissue as a biomarker have arisen due to the potential for exogenous contamination of Mn to undermine the quantization of endogenous Mn in nail. Previous studies have used a cleaning method of 1 % Triton X- 100 surfactant plus sonication in order to attempt to remove exogenous welding fume contamination. Determination of the potential level of exogenous Mn from welding fume on welder nail tissue was investigated. In addition, an intentional welding fume contamination methodology was developed in order to deposit welding <b>fume</b> Mn onto <b>control</b> nail samples in a within-subject design in order to test the efficacy of the prior nail tissue cleaning method. Paired sample fingernails from welders exposed to gas metal arc welding (GMAW) welding fume were digested and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Uncleaned welder fingernails had a mean of 8. 78 µg/g Mn (LCL = 5. 58, UCL = 11. 99) while those cleaned via the prior cleaning method showed a mean of 3. 22 µg/g Mn (LCL = 3. 07, UCL = 3. 37). Results of a Cochran method two-sample t-test between cleaned and uncleaned welder fingernails showed significance at p= 0. 0117 and a Wilcoxon t-distribution 2 -sided test approached significance at p= 0. 0671, indicating that exogenous Mn contamination is likely a threat to validity of nail tissue as a biomarker of body burden. GMAW welding <b>fume</b> exposed uncleaned <b>control</b> subject nails (at twice the level of exogenous Mn seen in the welder fingernails) had a mean concentration of 11. 35 µg/g Mn (LCL 95 = 9. 41, UCL 95 = 13. 30) while unexposed uncleaned control nails had a mean concentration of 0. 42 µg/g Mn (LCL 95 = 0. 23, UCL 95 = 0. 60). Results of a Cochran method two-sample t-test between exposed and unexposed uncleaned control fingernails showed significance at p= 0. 0001 and a Wilcoxon t-distribution 2 -sided test approached significance at p= 0. 0172, indicating that the method of GMAW welding fume contamination effectively contaminated the tissue with welding fume Mn. Exposed cleaned control fingernails had a mean of 0. 63 µg/g Mn (LCL 95 = 0. 48, UCL 95 = 0. 79), while those unexposed prior to cleaning showed a mean of 0. 14 µg/g Mn (LCL 95 = 0. 12, UCL 95 = 0. 17). Results of a Cochran method two-sample t-test between exposed and unexposed cleaned control nails showed significance at p= 0. 0002 and a Wilcoxon t-distribution 2 -sided test approached significance at p= 0. 00027, indicating that while not all exogenous Mn contamination was eliminated by the cleaning method,, the residual contamination amounted to only 4. 45 % ± 1. 23 % (95. 55 % of the contamination was removed). The results indicate that nail tissue can be cleaned effectively of the majority of exogenous Mn exposure, pointing to the utility of nail tissue as a biomarker for welding fume Mn internal exposure and likely occupational and environmental exposures to additional metals as well. ...|$|R

Results revealed that urinary Al (UAl) was significantly higher in Al workers compared with controls (p < 0. 05). How-ever, spirometric measures showed no significant difference between the exposed group and the controls. A 1 AT was significantly lowered in Al workers compared with the controls (p < 0. 000). Serum CRP was positive in only two (3. 6 %) of the exposed workers. Smokers of both groups (exposed and controls) showed signifi-cantly higher UAl and lower A 1 AT compared with nonsmokers. There was only significant negative correlation between the duration of exposure and A 1 AT (p < 0. 05). There was a positive significant correlation between smoking index (SI) and UAl. There was also significant negative correlation between SI and some of the pulmonary function tests namely the percentage of predicted forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in the first second and peak expiratory flow in the exposed group. Those correlations point to the importance of the combined effect of smoking and Al exposure on the impairment of lung functions. The study recommends the determination of CRP and A 1 AT in Al-exposed workers. It is expected that those parameters may undergo changes before reduction in pulmonary functions takes place...|$|R
40|$|Tungsten {{inert gas}} (TIG) welding {{represents}} {{one of the most widely}} used metal joining processes in industry. It has been shown to generate a large majority of particles at the nanoscale and to have low mass emission rates when compared to other types of welding. Despite evidence that TIG fume particles may produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), limited data is available for the time course changes of particle-associated oxidative stress in exposed TIG welders. Twenty non-smoking male welding apprentices were exposed to TIG welding fumes for 60  min under controlled, well-ventilated settings. Exhaled breathe condensate (EBC), blood and urine were collected before exposure, immediately after exposure, 1  h and 3  h post exposure. Volunteers participated in a control day to account for oxidative stress fluctuations due to circadian rhythm. Biological liquids were assessed for total reducing capacity, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) concentrations at each time point. A linear mixed model was used to assess within day and between day differences. Significant increases in the measured biomarkers were found at 3  h post exposure. At 3  h post exposure, we found a 24  % increase in plasma-H 2 O 2 concentrations ([95 %CI: 4  % to 46  %], p[*]=[*] 0. 01); a 91  % increase in urinary-H 2 O 2 ([2  % to 258  %], p[*]=[*] 0. 04); a 14  % increase in plasma- 8 -OHdG ([0  % to 31  %], p[*]=[*] 0. 049); and a 45  % increase in urinary- 8 -OHdG ([3  % to 105  %], p[*]=[*] 0. 03). Doubling particle number concentration (PNC) exposure was associated with a 22  % increase of plasma- 8 -OHdG at 3  h post exposure (p[*]=[*] 0. 01). A 60 -min exposure to TIG welding <b>fume</b> in a <b>controlled,</b> well-ventilated setting induced acute oxidative stress at 3  h post exposure in healthy, non-smoking apprentice welders not chronically exposed to welding fumes. As mass concentration of TIG welding fume particles is very low when compared to other types of welding, it is recommended that additional exposure metrics such as PNC are considered for occupational risk assessments. Our findings highlight the importance of increasing awareness of TIG welding fume toxicity, especially given the realities of welding workplaces that may lack ventilation; and beliefs among interviewed welders that TIG represents a cleaner and safer welding process...|$|R
40|$|Concern {{regarding}} the hazardous health effects {{from exposure to}} chemicals in bitumen fumes has been expressed {{and there is a}} great deal of interest for data on profile of individual compounds in the gas and particulate phases. The purpose of the study was to evaluate a method for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOC), semi-volatile and particulate polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAH) and sulfur poly-heterocylic (PASH) compounds in bitumen fumes. The methylated derivatives of PAH are of particular interest since many of them exhibit carcinogenic activities while the parent compound does not. Bitumen fumes were laboratory generated at 170 °C using a <b>fume</b> generator with <b>controlled</b> characteristics. Sampling of bitumen fumes was carried out with XAD- 2 Orbo tubes for the gas phase chemicals and semi-volatile PAH or PASH. Glass Fiber GF/B were used to sample the fumes aerosol particulates at a flow rate of 1. 2 L/min. PAH profiles and PASH in bitumen fumes were determined by GC-MS further to a multi-step sample treatment and automatic clean-up procedure. The internal standard was added to 0. 1 to 0. 3 g of raw bitumen or bitumen fumes filter samples which were then extracted twice with 25 mL toluene by sonication for 10 min each. The reduced extract was partitioned between cyclohexane and dimethylformamide before elution on a SiO 2 micro column. The eluent was reduced and fractionated by HPLC. The PAH fraction of interest which also contained PASH was separated by capillary column GC-ion trap MS. Quantification was made relative to the respective calibration curves between compounds of interest and the internal standard. The semi-volatile SVPAH and SVPASH were determined by separate desorption of the two distinct parts of the XAD- 2 by 5 mL CS 2 and sonication for 30 min. Microliters of the combined filtered extract were then injected into a GC column and quantified by ion trap MS. Standard reference compounds were used for comparisons of respective spectra. The purified extract enables the determination of PAH profile from 2 to 7 rings including their methyl derivatives and 3 carcinogenic benzonaphthothiophene isomers. The reproducibility of the method was estimated by analyzing 6 bitumen replicates and is around the 30 % overall uncertainty or less. In bitumen fumes generated at 170 °C under standardized conditions, VOC and semi-volatile PAH were sampled with XAD- 2 tubes and were also determined in six replicates. The VOCs are mainly monoaromatic derivatives (4 % of fumes) and aliphatics essentially from C 6 to C 17 (27 %). With regards to the particulate phase PAC, the coefficients of variation from 6 replicates are 5 - 24 % for PAH and 6 - 10 % for PASH. Data on VOC and PASH represent new contribution in the characterization of bitumen fumes...|$|R

Summary of results VOC: Aliphatic alkanes from C 6 to C 17 amount to several hundreds mg per equivalent gram of particulate fumes collected on the filter. Most of the other volatile present are benzene derivatives and total VOC amounts to 42 mg/g of fumes. Surprisingly, no benzene was detected in all the samples. PAH: Methylnaphthalene substitutes are quantitatively predominant. The well known trend is observed with light semi-volatile PAH found mainly in the gas phase. The trend is being reversed in the particulate phase from the methylphenanthrene and the four ring PAH to heavier molecular weight PAH. The naphthalene and its derivatives account for 93 % of the total (both gas and particulate) PAH from 2 to 7 ring PAH. Methylchrysene derivatives are at higher levels than benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in the fumes. The 6 - 7 rings PAH are not detected. PASH: The carcinogenic benzo[b]naphtho[2, 1 -d]thiophene is found in the fumes in higher amount than its two other isomers but less than the predominant dibenzothiophene. The sum dibenzonaphthothiophenes represents 16 % of PASH analysed in the filter, gas phase not included. In conclusion, our analytical procedure is valid and robust enough for the determination of PASH and PAH in bitumen fumes with a relatively low uncertainty (< 35 % for light PAH and < 15 % for higher MW PAH. New data are now available with the numerous methylnaphthalene derivatives and methylchrysene derivatives. VOC data and profile may be of interest for the interpretation of irritation effect The data may be useful for emission modelling purposes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Electric {{arc welding}} {{is the most}} {{prevalent}} welding type in industry. It creates two main groups of health hazards for workers; fumes and gases, and radiant energy. Shielded Metal Arc (SMA) welding is {{the most widely used}} welding method in industrial plant welding shops. The main chemical health hazards associated with this type of welding are fumes. Fumes are particles formed when the electrode and base metal constituents are vaporized and condensed in the welding area. Potential health problems can be anticipated by measuring the concentration of fumes in the welding space and comparing these data to established exposure standards. If high concentrations of these <b>fumes</b> are present, <b>control</b> measures should be undertaken to reduce the potential toxic effect to workers. Most of the studies have been done on mild (carbon) steel welding where it is generally necessary to monitor only the total amount of fumes. Stainless steel welding differs from carbon steel welding in that it generates considerable fume concentrations of chromium and nickel, which are suspected human carcinogens. The first part of this study evaluated the health risks posed to workers exposed to chromium and nickel fumes from routine stainless steel welding procedures. All the welding was performed in an industrial plant welding shop by one experienced welder. The welded piece was a three-part stainless steel cylinder. The whole period of welding lasted almost three weeks, although the actual welding was done in eleven days during that period. All sampling was performed with filter cassettes connected to personal air pumps. Sampling was performed in welder's breathing zone, in the general area (background sample), and at conveniently located points outside the breathing zone for evaluation of ratios of chromium and nickel to total fumes. The results indicated that at this particular industrial plant, exposure levels did not exceed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLVs). The results also indicated that it was not necessary to monitor the general area because of very low concentrations of chromium and nickel fumes. Rather, it is suggested that the monitoring focuses on the welder's breathing zone where it is important to sample hexavalent chromium (chromates) because of its proven carcinogenic effect and therefore very low TLV. Also, it was found that if TLV for chromates is not exceeded, then levels of total chromium and nickel are also likely to be below limits. The second part of the study sought to devise a simplified method of monitoring of welding operations. The results suggested that it is not always necessary to sample for all the components (total fumes, total chromium, chromates, and nickel) when estimating worker's exposure. Rather, it is possible to simplify the process by establishing the ratios of fume constituents during a period of heavy welding, thus enabling the industrial hygienist to make a reasonable estimate of exposure that occurs at other times. The estimate can be made by sampling either the main constituent (chromates) or total fumes, and predicting the exposure to remaining constituents of interest from these data. In addition, and in contrast to previous studies, it has been concluded that when fume concentrations are low, a welder's helmet does not provide any additional protection against fumes. Additional protection can be provided with the use of proper local ventilation, such as with a flexible hose, to reduce exposure well below suggested limits...|$|R
