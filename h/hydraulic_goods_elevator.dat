Besides, the number and location of the used sensors is highly correlated with the definition of such patterns.

40|$|The Filakopi Pumice Breccia (FPB) is a {{very well}} exposed, Pliocene volcaniclastic unit on Milos, Greece, and has a minimum bulk volume of 1 km 3. It {{consists}} of three main units: (A) basal lithic breccia (4 – 8 m) mainly composed of angular to subangular, andesitic and dacitic clasts up to 2. 6 m in diameter; (B) very thickly bedded, poorly sorted pumice breccia (16 – 17 m); and (C) very thick, reversely graded, grain-supported, coarse pumice breccia (6. 5 – 20 m), at the top. The depositional setting is well constrained as shallow marine (up to a few hundred metres) by overlying fossiliferous and bioturbated mudstone. This large volume of fine pumice clasts is interpreted to be {{the product of an}} explosive eruption from a submarine vent because: (1) pumice clasts are the dominant component; (2) the coarse pumice clasts (> 64 mm) have complete quenched margins; (3) very large (> 1 m) pumice clasts are common; (4) overall, the formation shows <b>good</b> <b>hydraulic</b> sorting; and (5) a significant volume of ash was deposited together with the coarsest pyroclasts. The bed forms in units A and B suggest deposition from lithic-rich and pumiceous, respectively, submarine gravity currents. In unit C, the coarse (up to 6. 5 m) pumice clasts are set in matrix that grades upwards from diffusely stratified, fine (1 – 2 cm) pumice clasts at the base to laminated shard rich mud at the top. The coarse pumice clasts in unit C were settled from suspension and the framework was progressively infilled by fine pumice clasts from waning traction currents and then by watersettled ash. The FPB displays important features of the products of submarine explosive eruptions that result from the ambient fluid being seawater, rather than volcanic gas or air. In particular, submarine pyroclastic deposits are characterised by the presence of very coarse juvenile pumice clasts, pumice clasts with complete quenched rims, and <b>good</b> <b>hydraulic</b> sorting...|$|R

Later effort in the project was directed at development of a two-phase, supercritical flow simulation package (EOS 1 sc) to accompany the Tough 2 flow simulator.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{commercial}} 3 D Navier-Stokes CFD-solver Ansys CFX {{was used to}} investigate the flow through a horizontal shaft bulb turbine in a stationary and transient way. The draft tube {{is one of the}} most critical parts for the performance of bulb turbines and highly influences the efficiency of the whole configuration with a level of several percent of the total efficiency. A calculation of the existing situation was the basis for a modification and adaptation of the draft tube geometry to realize a shorter machine construction and also to compare the results with hydraulic model tests from a closed loop turbine test stand. For all influences on the draft tube rotor stator effects are decisive – in reality as well as in numerical simulations. In a first part, several modifications were analyzed, e. g. inlet variations, as those cause different space requirements of the generator as far as the flow rate is concerned, the operating points differ more than 300 %. For the flow through the runner the meridional velocity was analyzed on 5 different planes around the runner. In front and also after the runner the flow over the radius was nearly on an equal level – this means that the <b>hydraulic</b> is <b>good</b> and that no fluid transport in radial direction is needed. In a second part, an investigation of different influences of rotor stator interactions was carried out, based on a large full 360 °-model of the whole machine configuration of this 3 -blade runner and 16 guide vane turbine.

Field measurements were performed through an experimental design made of plots measuring 1 m 2 each and established on three sites of the watershed: three plots on an erosion crust (PZN), three plots on a desiccation crust supported herbaceous (PZD) and three plots on an area cultivated in sorghum (PZC). Each site was equipped with tensiometric and neutron tubes to measure pressure head and water content of the soil. Results showed that PZN was characterized by a low infiltration capacity enhancing runoff.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a linear perturbation {{analysis of a}} horizontal two-dimensional mathematical model for the flow and bed topography in straight alluvial rivers with dominant bed-load. A sediment transport model including effects of transverse bed slope, secondary (helical) flow and secondary flow inertia is employed. The stability and the propagation velocity of an unsteady perturbation is investigated. This stability analysis predicts wave lengths which are in good agreement with the wave lengths of alternate bars in straight laboratory flumes. The analysis predicts rather large propagation velocities of the perturbations. Several investigations have assumed the instability to cause meandering and braiding of rivers. However, {{in view of the}} corresponding large propagation velocity of the perturbation and the generally low erodibility of the banks, a non-propagating perturbation offers a more adequate explanation of the initiation of meanders and braids. In order to investigate this hypothesis a linear steady state perturbation analysis is carried out.
