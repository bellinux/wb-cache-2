The key advantages of the Marantz portable recorders were the accommodation of professional microphones with an XLR connector, normal and <b>double</b> <b>tape</b> speed recording for extended frequency response, Dolby and dbx noise reduction systems, manual or automatic gain control (AGC) level control, peak limiter, multiple tape formulation accommodation, microphone and line level input connections, unbalanced RCA stereo input and output connections, live or tape monitoring, VU meter, headphone jack, playback pitch control, and operation on AC power or batteries optimized for long duration. Unlike less-expensive portable recorders that were limited to automatic gain control (AGC) recording schemes, the manual recording mode preserved low noise dynamics and avoided the automatic elevation of noise.|$|E

He called the result his Nightmare mix, and borrowed money from a friend to press 500 copies. When BMG, and thus the Eurythmics, learnt of this, Annie Lennox wanted to prevent the sale of what was in effect an unlicensed version of their song; however, her partner Dave Stewart liked the mix, and persuaded her to allow Angel to go ahead. The track, involving elements of jazz, Detroit techno, and breakbeat hardcore, was successful, reaching number twenty-three in the United Kingdom charts.|$|E

40|$|Neste trabalho foi investigada a obtenção de eletrólitos bicamadas a partir da técnica de colagem de fitas. Esses eletrólitos foram compostos por uma camada de céria dopada com 10 % mol de gadolínia (CDG) e outra de zircônia estabilizada com 8 % mol de ítria (ZEI- 8). Fitas de CDG foram preparadas com pó da Fuel Cell Materials (FCM) e pó obtido por mistura de óxidos. Fitas de ZEI- 8 foram obtidas a partir de pó da Tosoh Corporation. Na primeira etapa do trabalho foram obtidas fitas individuais que, após sinterização resultaram em placas densas de CDG e de ZEI- 8. Essas placas foram caracterizadas por espectroscopia de impedância e microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV). A 350 C, a máxima condutividade elétrica de placa CDG preparada com pó obtido por mistura de óxidos foi 3, 37 x 10 - 4 S. cm- 1 e com pó FCM foi 4, 33 x 10 - 4 S. cm- 1, para placas sinterizadas a 1600 e 1500 C, respectivamente. Para ZEI- 8, a 350 C, a condutividade elétrica máxima obtida foi 9, 6 x 10 - 5 S. cm- 1, em placas sinterizadas a 1600 C, cujo valor está em acordo com a literatura. Placas bicamadas CDG/ZEI- 8 foram preparadas de duas maneiras, por laminação de fitas e por dupla colagem e sinterizadas a 1600 C/ 2 h. As placas produzidas por dupla colagem foram caracterizadas por espectroscopia de impedância e, a 350 C, a condutividade foi 8, 82 x 10 - 5 S. cm- 1, mais de três vezes menor que a da placa mono camada CDG (3, 21 x 10 - 4 S. cm- 1), devido à característica resistiva da {{interface}} estabelecida entre CDG e ZEI- 8 durante a sinterização. Análise das placas bicamadas por MEV mostrou que as espessuras de CDG e de ZEI- 8 foram 140 e 24 &# 956;m, respectivamente. A adesão entre as camadas de CDC e ZEI- 8 foi atribuída à formação de segunda fase na interface que foi responsável pela característica resistiva da interface. In {{this work}} it was investigated bi-layer electrolytes {{prepared by the}} tape casting technique. These electrolytes were composed of one layer of 10 mol% gadolinia doped ceria (CDG) and another one of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (ZEI - 8). CDG tapes were prepared with powder from Fuel Cell Materials (FCM) and powder obtained by oxide mixing. ZEI- 8 tapes were prepared with powder from Tosoh Corporation. In the first step, CDG and ZEI- 8 tapes were prepared and dense plates were obtained after sintering. Sintered plates were characterized by impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At 350 C, the highest electrical conductivity of CDG samples prepared with powder obtained by oxide mixing and sintered at 1600 C was 3. 37 x 10 - 4 S. cm- 1 and with FCM powder sintered at 1500 C was 4. 33 x 10 - 4 S. cm- 1. At the same temperature, ZEI- 8 samples sintered at 1600 C showed 9. 6 x 10 - 5 S. cm- 1, which agrees with literature results. CDG/ZEI- 8 bilayers plates were prepared either by lamination or by <b>double</b> <b>tape</b> casting, followed by sintering at 1600 C/ 2 h. Sintered bi-layers prepared by <b>double</b> <b>tape</b> casting were characterized by impedance spectroscopy. Electrical conductivity at 350 C was 8. 82 x 10 - 5 S. cm- 1, three times lower than CDG mono layer (3. 37 x 10 - 4 S. cm- 1) due to high resistivity of CGD/ZEI- 8 interface. The bi-layers SEM analysis showed that layers thickness of CDG and ZEI- 8, were 140 &# 956;m and 24 &# 956;m respectively. The adherence between CDG and ZEI- 8 layers was attributed to secondary phase in the interface which was responsible for high resistivity of the CGD/ZEI- 8 interface...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{intended}} to explain the implementation of word wall media to teach vocabulary {{in the first grade}} student of SMP N 1 Prigen. It was conducted {{based on the fact that}} the teaching and learning process in the classroom was in passive condition. Teaching English using word wall media was chosen by the English teacher to facilitate and help students’ to achieve the aim of teaching learning process. It is one of the important aspects for the teacher to solve some problems that student face, especially in memorizing vocabulary. By applying word wall media in teaching learning process, it is hoped that student will be interested and easy in understanding the teaching material and memorizing vocabulary. This research used qualitative research design to investigate the implementation of word wall media, teacher’s problem and how to cope with the problem in teaching vocabulary using word wall media in the first grade student of SMP N 1 Prigen. The subject in this study was the teacher who taught English using word wall media. The data was collected from interview and observation. The study found that the teacher applied word wall media which involved several steps, they were, (1) giving word wall card to the students (2) giving a clue of word to the student based on the material (3) asking students to guess what the word is (4) asking students to answer what the word is (5) asking student to write word in word card. (6) asking students to glue the word card to the word wall. (7) asking the students to spell the word that have been written. (8) drilling the word. the teacher’s problem in teaching vocabulary using word wall media were, pronunciation, grammar, student’s motivation, the ways in applying word wall media, and the egibility student’s handwriting, to cope with the problem, the teacher were consulting the dictionary, practicing English everyday, sharing with other English teacher, using simple sentences to avoid the mistake, giving motivation and brainstorming to the students, giving <b>double</b> <b>tape</b> in word wall media to make word wall media stock on the whiteboard, and the teacher rewrite the students writing...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the effects of}} the <b>double</b> counter twisted <b>tapes</b> on heat transfer and fluid friction characteristics in a heat exchanger tube. The <b>double</b> counter twisted <b>tapes</b> were used as counter-swirl flow generators in the test section. The experiments were performed with <b>double</b> counter twisted <b>tapes</b> of four different twist ratios (y = 1. 95, 3. 85, 5. 92 and 7. 75) using air as the testing fluid in a circular tube turbulent flow regime where the Reynolds number was varied from 6950 to 50, 050. The experimental results demonstrated that the Nusselt number, friction factor and thermal enhancement efficiency were increased with decreasing twist ratio. The results also revealed that the heat transfer rate in the tube fitted with <b>double</b> counter twisted <b>tape</b> was significantly increased with corresponding increase in pressure drop. In the range of the present work, heat transfer rate and friction factor were obtained to be around 60 to 240 % and 91 to 286 % higher than those of the plain tube values, respectively. The maximum thermal enhancement efficiency of 1. 34 was achieved by the use of <b>double</b> counter twisted <b>tapes</b> at constant blower power.
