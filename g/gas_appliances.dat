5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} {{poisoning}} include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of <b>gas</b> <b>appliances,</b> keeping chimneys clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This should generally {{be carried out}} until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%. While hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E

40|$|Ventilation systems play an {{important}} role in the energy consumption of heating and cooling, defining hygrothermal conditions and air quality of dwellings. Among other functions, they are absolutely necessary to ensure oxygen levels needed for household combustion appliances. In Portugal in multifamily housing and with natural ventilation systems, installing a mechanical exhaust fan in every kitchen (decentralized ventilation) is common. In this paper, the impact of such a device is evaluated regarding the performance of a water heating appliance for heating the indoor environment or for domestic hot water (B-type <b>gas</b> <b>appliance</b> usually installed in the kitchen). The combination of natural or mechanical ventilation in the kitchen with the natural exhaust of the <b>gas</b> <b>appliance’s</b> combustion products were tested as well as the evaluation of critical conditions that lead to stopping the <b>gas</b> <b>appliance</b> safely or to reversing the combustion products in the respective exhaust duct. One of the main conclusions to be drawn is that in the case of mechanical exhaust in the kitchen simultaneously with the natural exhaust of the <b>gas</b> <b>appliance’s</b> combustion products, the kitchen’s exterior air inlet is a key device for ensuring proper exhaust of combustion products. In extreme situations, reduced air intake by other means or high extraction flows, they can prevent safely stopping the appliance or even reversing the flow of the combustion products. For this purpose, the maximum flow of mechanical exhaust should also be limited...|$|R
25|$|It {{should be}} remembered {{that in the early}} part of the 20th century matches were a {{necessity}} for smoking and the lighting of stoves and <b>gas</b> <b>appliances</b> among other uses and therefore demand for them was highly inelastic, meaning that a monopolist could raise prices (and hence profits) significantly without much affecting the quantity sold.|$|E
25|$|Metal liners may be {{stainless}} steel, aluminum, or {{galvanized iron}} {{and may be}} flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with firewood, wood pellet fuel, and non-condensing oil appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with non-condensing <b>gas</b> <b>appliances.</b> Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, double wall stainless steel pipe or triple wall, air-insulated pipe often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos. Class B are uninsulated double wall pipes often called B-vent, and are only used to vent non-condensing <b>gas</b> <b>appliances.</b> These may have an aluminum inside layer and galvanized steel outside layer. Condensing boilers do not need a chimney.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{conversion}} of the Geelong system to natural gas was estimated at $2.5 to $3 million, with a likely completion date of 1971. The conversion entailed building a new pipeline from Melbourne, purging the old gas from the mains, change over of all burners in all <b>gas</b> <b>appliances,</b> changes to valves in the distribution network to permit the higher pressures, and removal of the now-unneeded gasworks.|$|E

In 1985 a modern <b>gas</b> <b>appliance</b> manufacturing facility was built replacing the old car factory site.

25|$|The {{education}} and training of the large workforce, the attempts to standardise manufacturing and commercial practices and the moderating of commercial rivalry between supply companies prompted the founding of associations of gas managers, first in Scotland in 1861. A British Association of Gas Managers was formed in 1863 in Manchester and this, after a turbulent history, became {{the foundation of the}} Institute of Gas Engineers (IGE). In 1903, the reconstructed Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) initiated courses for students of gas manufacture in the City and Guilds of London Institute. The IGE was granted the Royal Charter in 1929. Universities were slow to respond {{to the needs of the}} industry and it was not until 1908 that the first Professorship of Coal Gas and Fuel Industries was founded at the University of Leeds. In 1926, the Gas Light and Coke Company opened Watson House adjacent to Nine Elms Gas Works. At first, this was a scientific laboratory. Later it included a centre for training apprentices but its major contribution to the industry was its gas appliance testing facilities, which were made available to the whole industry, including gas appliance manufacturers. Using this facility, the industry established not only safety but also performance standards for both the manufacture of <b>gas</b> <b>appliances</b> and their servicing in customers' homes and commercial premises.|$|E
