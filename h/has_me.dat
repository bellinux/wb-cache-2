Without wanting to put down all the people I have collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people who go to see Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those who go to see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on the finishing touches.|$|E

Knowles performed it as part of a medley with American experimental rock band Dirty Projectors' track [...] "Stillness Is the Move" [...] (2009) while dancing on top of washing machines. Concerning this, the singer confessed, [...] "This laundromat <b>has</b> <b>me</b> feeling the drama queen, so excuse my theatrics". Knowles sang both Nivea and R. Kelly's parts, while accompanied by a six-person band. Additionally, the song was altered to better fit her style.|$|E
500|$|While the Browns {{came into}} 1954 {{as one of}} the top teams in the NFL, the future was far from certain. Graham, whose {{leadership}} and throwing skills were instrumental in the Browns' championship runs, said he planned to retire after the season. Motley, the team's best rusher and blocker, retired at the beginning of the season with a bad knee. Star defensive lineman Bill Willis also retired before the season. Still, Cleveland finished the regular season 9–3 and met Detroit the day after Christmas in the championship game for a third consecutive time. This time Cleveland dominated on both sides of the ball, intercepting Bobby Layne six times while Graham threw three touchdowns and ran for three more. The Browns, who lost the last game of the regular season to the Lions only a week before, won their second NFL championship 56–10. [...] "I saw it, but still hardly can believe it", Lions coach Buddy Parker said after the game. [...] "It <b>has</b> <b>me</b> dazed." ...|$|E

500|$|In a DVD {{review of}} the first season, Jason Bovberg of the DVD Talk was {{disappointed}} on the set, saying [...] "Where is it? This is perhaps the only disappointment of the set. I was a little aggravated by the loooong animated menus that introduce all the characters, one by one, but it's really that missing episode that <b>has</b> <b>me</b> upset." [...] Bovberg described the set as [...] "annoying" [...] for missing the episode. Bill Treadway of the DVD Verdict, on {{the exclusion of the}} episode on the DVD, said [...] "It's a small flaw in an otherwise top notch package." [...] In a DVD {{review of the}} third season, Bryan Pope of the DVD Verdict, on the episode as a bonus feature, said [...] "The most intriguing extra is the series' pilot episode, 'Help Wanted'."

500|$|The {{album was}} first {{released}} in the United States on July 27, 1983 by Sire Records. It was originally slated to be titled Lucky Star, after the track of the same name, but eventually titled simply Madonna, perhaps that this singular name could have star power. The album's artwork was shot by photographer Gary Heery and directed by Carin Goldberg. The front cover shows Madonna with short-cropped platinum hair, wearing a number of black rubber bangles {{on her hands and}} a dog chain around her throat. Her navel is also prominent on the inner sleeve of the album. Madonna commented: [...] "The picture inside the dust of sleeve of my first album <b>has</b> <b>me,</b> like, in this Betty Boop pose with my belly button showing. Then when people reviews the album, they kept talking about my cute belly button. [...] I think there are other unobvious places on the body that are sexy and the stomach is kind of innocent."

Competing against Bruno Brodd of the Irish American Athletic Club and J. Bredemus of Princeton University, he won seven of the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three. With a total point score of 7,476points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385points set in 1909, (also set at Celtic Park), by Martin Sheridan, the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club. Sheridan, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, was present to watch his record broken, approached Thorpe after the event and shook his hand saying, [...] "Jim, my boy, you're a great man. I never expect to look upon a finer athlete." [...] He told a reporter from New York World, [...] "Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever lived. He <b>has</b> <b>me</b> beaten fifty ways. Even when I was in my prime, I could not do what he did today." ...|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B+, {{explaining}} [...] "It was the atmosphere that sold me on [...] "Northwest Passage", an episode {{with a fairly}} middling mystery and only minimal advancement of the master-plot. (Though the end-point of that advancement was a doozy, and <b>has</b> <b>me</b> eating a little crow.) At times tonight the show almost felt like a backdoor pilot for a new series, with Peter tooling around the Pacific Northwest meeting local law enforcement and cracking cases. And while that's a show I'd definitely watch, I confess I'm anxious to jump ahead to next week, when there'll be inter-dimensional conflict and doppelgangers galore". Murray considered the ending {{with the appearance of}} Walternate a [...] "strong finish to a mostly strong episode". IGN's Ramsey Isler gave it 7.8/10, writing that [...] "Fringe sophomore season is building up to an epic 2-part finale. This episode doesn't reveal much in terms of overall Fringe mythology until the very awesome ending, and even then it just confirms what we already knew or suspected. Still, this installment deserves credit for using a different formula and giving Joshua Jackson some much-deserved time in the spotlight all by himself".|$|E
500|$|Danny Hale at Flickering Myth said [...] "Lockup" [...] is [...] "a really, {{really fun}} episode", and was thankful that Johnson rejoining S.H.I.E.L.D. was not [...] "resolved without the {{appropriate}} time for the audience to feel her absence". Hale also noted {{the introduction of the}} Darkhold, Coulson and May's interactions, and the added mystery to Mace's character as all things that make [...] "for good viewing and <b>has</b> <b>me</b> hooked for next week." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow scored the episode three stars out of 5, feeling the season was lacking a [...] "truly compelling villain" [...] and saying the ghost effects look [...] "absolutely terrible". Meslow said the prison scenes had [...] "quippy dialogue" [...] and [...] "solid action scenes", but was more interested in the Mace/Simmons storyline. For Nerdist, Joseph McCabe said, [...] "When S.H.I.E.L.D. is at its best, it doesn’t offer viewers much to dissect. Because it’s all about its momentum, [...] is a textbook example: forty-two minutes of adrenaline without a single wasted moment." [...] He felt the episode had several satisfying character-based moments, especially the scenes between Coulson and May, and though McCabe felt Woods was not the most [...] "adept at staging fight sequences", he still praised the choreography of Johnson's action scenes.|$|E
500|$|... "The Day We Died" [...] has {{generally}} received positive reviews from television critics. Sam McPherson from TV Overmind graded the finale with an A, writing [...] "From a show {{known for its}} mindbending episodes came the most mindbending episode of all. 'The Day We Died'... not only reinvigorated the show's fantastic (but inevitably aging) premise, but gave the show a breath of life that <b>has</b> <b>me</b> waiting -- no, begging -- for the show's fourth season." [...] Though he wouldn't call the finale the best Fringe episode yet, McPherson referred to the season as {{the best of the}} three and [...] "probably the best season of television that's aired in recent years". Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker lauded the finale, commenting in his review's conclusion [...] "Consider about the whole arc of this season and tell me this wasn’t one of the most moving, thrilling, funny, inspiring chunks of television you’ve watched. The performances by Noble, Torv, and Jackson were extraordinarily adroit, never showy or merely clever. I was so glad that, by season’s end, Jackson/Peter had once again taken center-stage — a central importance — to a season that, by the nature of its design, needed to concentrate a lot on Walter(s) and Olivia(s)." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{particularly for the}} work of its technical crew. In 2006, W.Chandrakanth of The Hindu wrote: The greatness of the director lies here– he successfully reduces all characters to ordinary mortals displaying all the follies of human beings except Ghatothkacha or Krishna. And then he injects into the Yadava household a Telugu atmosphere, full with its simile, imagery, adage, sarcasm and wit. The result– a feast for the eyes and soul. That is Mayabazar for you. Vijaysree Venkatraman wrote for The Hindu in 2008 that the [...] "special effects in this summer's Hollywood superhero movies were spectacular, but, for me, the mythological [...] hasn't lost any of its magic", adding, [...] "If watching the genial half-demon polish off a wedding feast single-handedly remains a treat, seeing the greedy duo from the groom's side get whacked alternately by the furniture and the wilful carpet <b>has</b> <b>me</b> in splits". The Hindu film critic M.L. Narasimham wrote: [...] "Though there were several movie versions in various Indian languages, the 1957 Vijaya Productions' Mayabazar is still considered the best for its all round excellence". According to The Times of India, [...] "With a powerful cast and a strong script, this movie is a stealer. Savitri, NTR , ANR , SVRangarao and not to mention Suryakantam add layers to their characters. Of course, the language and the dialogues, simply unbeatable. Some of the scenes are simply hilarious." ...|$|E

Students at Duke University, and with Yale University's Asian American Cultural Center and the South Asian Society, created videos and ran photo campaigns denouncing the social media attacks, while Miss Kansas Theresa Vail blogged and gave interviews to discredit the comments about both herself and Davuluri. Actor and civil-rights activist George Takei (the original Hikaru Sulu in [...] ) posted a comment on Facebook stating that while he normally doesn't [...] "care about Miss America … the uproar over an Indian-American winning (whom many decried for being 'Arab') <b>has</b> <b>me</b> shaking my head.

All cause for celebration." [...] Finally, Immediate Past President, Young Democrats of America, Atima Omara, argued that [...] "a sexist, racist, xenophobic attack against one prominent woman of color is an attack against us all, and it shouldn't be tolerated just because we disdain that woman's choices.

500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really <b>has</b> <b>me</b> sold." ...|$|E
