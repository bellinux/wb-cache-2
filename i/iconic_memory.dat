25|$|A {{recent study}} has {{obtained}} evidence that could support {{the existence of}} an intermediate visual store with characteristics of both <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> and VSTM (Sligte et al., 2008). This intermediate store is proposed to have high capacity (up to 15 items) and prolonged memory trace duration (up to 4 seconds). It coexists with VSTM but unlike it visual stimuli can overwrite the contents of its visual store (Pinto et al., 2013). Further research suggests an involvement of visual area V4 (Sligte et al., 2009).|$|E

For example, Marr proposed a sequence of representations with images, edges, 2 1 2 D sketch, and a 3 D surfaces [7].

25|$|The term VSTM refers in a theory-neutral {{manner to}} the non-permanent storage of visual {{information}} {{over an extended}} period of time. The visuospatial sketchpad is a VSTM subcomponent within the theoretical model of working memory proposed by Alan Baddeley. Whereas <b>iconic</b> <b>memories</b> are fragile, decay rapidly, and are unable to be actively maintained, visual short-term memories are robust to subsequent stimuli and last over many seconds. VSTM is distinguished from long-term memory, on the other hand, primarily by its very limited capacity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is {{the visual}} {{part of the}} sensory memory system. <b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is {{responsible}} for visual priming, because it works very quickly and unconsciously. <b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> decays very quickly, but contains a very vivid image of the surrounding stimuli.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> plays a role in providing continuity of experience during saccadic eye movements. These rapid eye movements occur in approximately 30 ms and each fixation lasts for approximately 300 ms. Research suggests however, that memory for information between saccades is largely dependent on VSTM and not <b>iconic</b> <b>memory.</b> Instead of contributing to trans-saccadic memory, information stored in <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is thought to actually be erased during saccades. A similar phenomenon occurs during eye-blinks whereby both automatic and intentional blinking disrupts the information stored in <b>iconic</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is {{only limited}} to field of vision. That is, {{as long as}} a {{stimulus}} has entered the field of vision there is no limit to the amount of visual information <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> can hold at any one time. As noted above, sensory registers do not allow for further processing of information, and as such <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> only holds information for visual stimuli such as shape, size, color and location (but not semantic meaning). As the higher-level processes are limited in their capacities, not all information from sensory memory can be conveyed. It has been argued that the momentary mental freezing of visual input allows for the selection of specific aspects which should be passed on for further memory processing. The biggest limitation of <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is the rapid decay of the information stored there; items in <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> decay after only 0.5-1.0 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Echoic {{memory is}} one of the sensory memory registers; a {{component}} of sensory memory (SM) that is specific to retaining auditory information. The sensory memory for sounds that people have just perceived is the form of echoic memory. Unlike visual memory, in which our eyes can scan the stimuli over and over, the auditory stimuli cannot be scanned over and over. Overall, echoic memories are stored for slightly longer periods of time than <b>iconic</b> <b>memories</b> (visual memories). Auditory stimuli are received by the ear one at a time before they can be processed and understood. For instance, hearing the radio is very different from reading a magazine. A person can only hear the radio once at a given time, while the magazine can be read over and over again. It can be said that the echoic memory is like a [...] "holding tank" [...] concept, because a sound is unprocessed (or held back) until the following sound is heard, and only then can it be made meaningful. This particular sensory store is capable of storing large amounts of auditory information that is only retained {{for a short period of}} time (3-4 seconds). This echoic sound resonates in the mind and is replayed for this brief amount of time shortly after the presentation of auditory stimuli. Echoic memory encrypts only moderately primitive aspects of the stimuli, for example pitch, which specifies localization to the non-association brain regions.|$|R
40|$|We tested 44 {{participants}} {{with respect to}} their working memory (WM) performance on alcohol-related versus neutral visual stimuli. Previously an alcohol attentional bias (AAB) had been reported using these stimuli, where the attention of frequent drinkers was automatically drawn toward alcohol-related items (e. g., beer bottle). The present study set out to provide evidence for an alcohol memory bias (AMB) that would persist over longer time-scales than the AAB. The WM task we used required memorizing 4 stimuli in their correct locations and a visual interference task was administered during a 4 -sec delay interval. A subsequent probe required participants to indicate whether a stimulus was shown in the correct or incorrect location. For each participant we calculated a drinking score based on 3 items derived from the Alcohol Use Questionnaire, and we observed that higher scorers better remembered alcohol-related images compared with lower scorers, particularly when these were presented in their correct locations upon recall. This provides first evidence for an AMB. It is important to highlight that this effect persisted over a 4 -sec delay period including a visual interference task that erased <b>iconic</b> <b>memories</b> and diverted attention away from the encoded items, thus the AMB cannot be reduced to the previously reported AAB. Our finding calls for further investigation of alcohol-related cognitive biases in WM, and we propose a preliminary model that may guide future research...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere {{is a large}} {{projection}} of neurons from Layer VI of V 1 that makes excitatory connections on LGN relay cells. It has been proposed that this circuit is involved in signal processing and thalamic sensitivity regulation. Alternatively, Crick {{has suggested that the}} circuit could be a reverberatory loop—a site for very short term (<b>iconic)</b> visual <b>memory.</b> This hypothesis is shown to be plausible if the reverberation is keyed to the onset of neurally initiated visual disruptions such as blinks and saccades. Neural mechanisms suppress perception during these events but little is known about temporal filling-in processes analogous to the mechanisms that fill-in spatial scotomas. Crick's reverberatory loop could provide a process for filling-in temporal scotomas with information acquired just before the disruption, thus maintaining the continuity of visual experience. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

50|$|The brief {{representation}} in <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> {{is thought to}} {{play a key role}} in the ability to detect change in a visual scene. The phenomenon of change blindness has provided insight into the nature of the <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> store and its role in vision. Change blindness refers to an inability to detect differences in two successive scenes separated by a very brief blank interval, or interstimulus interval (ISI). As such change blindness can be defined as being a slight lapse in <b>iconic</b> <b>memory.</b> When scenes are presented without an ISI, the change is easily detectable. It is thought that the detailed memory store of the scene in <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is erased by each ISI, which renders the memory inaccessible. This reduces the ability to make comparisons between successive scenes.|$|E
50|$|A visual form {{of memory}} known as <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> has been {{described}} as the cause of this phenomenon. Although psychologists and physiologists have rejected the relevance of this theory to film viewership, film academics and theorists generally have not. Some scientists nowadays consider the entire theory of <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> a myth.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is {{the visual}} sensory memory (SM) {{register}} {{pertaining to the}} visual domain and a fast-decaying store of visual information. It is {{a component of the}} visual memory system which also includes visual short-term memory (VSTM) and long-term memory (LTM). <b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is described as a very brief (<1000 ms), pre-categorical, high capacity memory store. It contributes to VSTM by providing a coherent representation of our entire visual perception for a very brief period of time. <b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> assists in accounting for phenomena such as change blindness and continuity of experience during saccades. <b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is no longer thought of as a single entity but instead, is composed of at least two distinctive components. [...] Classic experiments including Sperling's partial report paradigm as well as modern techniques continue to provide insight into the nature of this SM store.|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the data}} from the Safien valley, the {{following}} categories of traditional environmental knowledge were identified: agricultural and forestry use, weather patterns, and natural hazards. These strategies for local resource use necessitate very detailed knowledge about environmental conditions, including awareness about linkages between certain weather conditions during particular times in the year in certain localities and the occurrence of specific natural hazards, such as avalanches or mudslides. The fact that potentially dangerous areas generally carry a name related to a particular hazard event that happened there in the past demonstrates the important role played by an <b>iconic</b> cultural <b>memory</b> (Assmann 2011) in the context of disaster mitigation strategies. A further example of the differentiated environmental knowledge of the valley’s small-scale, topographically structured landscape is that particular, often small localities (from mountain peaks to individual plots) have their own local names (flurnamen). These names provide a meaningful orientation within the cultural landscape.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{working memory}} {{provides}} an essential link {{between past and}} future events. Despite recent efforts, capacity limits, their genesis and the underlying neural structures of visual working memory remain unclear. Here we show that performance in visual working memory - but not <b>iconic</b> visual <b>memory</b> - can be predicted by the strength of mental imagery as assessed with binocular rivalry in a given individual. In addition, for individuals with strong imagery, modulating the background luminance diminished performance on visual working memory and imagery tasks, but not working memory for number strings. This suggests that luminance signals were disrupting sensory-based imagery mechanisms and not a general working memory system. Individuals with poor imagery still performed above chance in the visual working memory task, but their performance was not affected by the background luminance, suggesting a dichotomy in strategies for visual working memory: individuals with strong mental imagery rely on sensory-based imagery to support mnemonic performance, while those with poor imagery rely on different strategies. These findings could help reconcile current controversy regarding the mechanism and location of visual mnemonic storage...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{attention}} modulates {{signal processing}} within visual nuclei of the thalamus—but do other nuclei govern {{the locus of}} attention in top-down mode? We examined functional MRI (fMRI) data from three subjects performing a task requiring covert attention to 1 of 16 positions in a circular array. Target position was cued after stimulus offset, requiring subjects to perform target detection from <b>iconic</b> visual <b>memory.</b> We found positionally specific responses at multiple thalamic sites, with individual voxels activating at more than one direction of attentional shift. Voxel clusters at anatomically equivalent sites across subjects revealed {{a broad range of}} directional tuning at each site, with little sign of contralateral bias. By reference to a thalamic atlas, we identified the nuclear correspondence of the four most reliably activated sites across subjects: mediodorsal/central-intralaminar (oculomotor thalamus), caudal intralaminar/parafascicular, suprageniculate/limitans, and medial pulvinar/lateral posterior. Hence, the cortical network generating a top-down control signal for relocating attention acts in concert with a spatially selective thalamic apparatus—the set of active nuclei mirroring the thalamic territory of cortical “eye-field” areas, thus supporting theories which propose the visuomotor origins of covert attentional selection...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> begins at birth and continues as {{development of}} the primary and secondary visual system occurs. By 6 months of age, infants' <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> capacity approaches adults'. By 5 years of age, children have developed the same unlimited capacity of <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> that adults possess. The duration of informational persistence however increases from approximately 200 ms at age 5, to an asymptotic level of 1000 ms as an adult (>11 years). A small decrease in visual persistence occurs with age. A decrease of approximately 20 ms has been observed when comparing individuals in their early 20s to those in their late 60s. Throughout one's lifetime, mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) may develop such as errors in episodic memory (autobiographical memory about people, places, and their contex), and working memory (the active processing component of STM) due to damage in hippocampal and association cortical areas. Episodic memories are autobiographical events that a person can discuss. Individuals with MCIs have be found to show decreased <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> capacity and duration. <b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> impairment in those with MCIs {{may be used as}} a predictor for the development of more severe deficits such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia later in life.|$|E
50|$|Although less {{research}} exists {{regarding the}} neural representation of informational persistence compared to visual persistence, new electrophysiological techniques {{have begun to}} reveal cortical areas involved. Unlike visible persistence, informational persistence is thought to rely on higher-level visual areas beyond the visual cortex. The anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), {{a part of the}} ventral stream, was found to be active in macaques during <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> tasks. This brain region is associated with object recognition and object identity. Iconic memory's role in change detection has been related to activation in the middle occipital gyrus (MOG). MOG activation was found to persist for approximately 2000ms suggesting a possibility that <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> has a longer duration than what was currently thought. <b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is also influenced by genetics and proteins produced in the brain. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) {{is a part of the}} neurotrophin family of nerve growth factors. Individuals with mutations to the BDNF gene which codes for BDNF have been shown to have shortened, less stable informational persistence.|$|E
5000|$|Baddeley's {{model of}} working memory {{consists}} of the visuospatial sketchpad which is related to <b>iconic</b> <b>memory,</b> and a phonological loop which attends to auditory information processing in two ways. The first is a phonological store which {{has the capacity to}} retain information for 3-4 seconds before decay, which is a much longer duration than <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> (which is less than 1000ms). The second is a sub-vocal rehearsal process to keep refreshing the memory trace by the using one's [...] "inner voice". However, this model fails to provide {{a detailed description of the}} relationship between the initial sensory input and ensuing memory processes.|$|E
50|$|In {{more recent}} studies, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} find the neurological explanation of the enactment effect, and the reason why memory is enhanced after enactment. It was shown that not mere physical motor information leads to the enactment effect, but that the semantic content of the gesture plays a role as well. <b>Iconic</b> gestures enhance <b>memory</b> compared to meaningless gestures which have no positive effect on memorization. Event-related potentials showed that enactment leads to deeper processing of new information, eliciting the assumption that by using gestures, the meaning of the new word is connected with an already existing concept in one’s native language.|$|R
40|$|Mushroom {{bodies are}} the <b>iconic</b> {{learning}} and <b>memory</b> centers of insects. No previously described crustacean possesses a mushroom body {{as defined by}} strict morphological criteria although crustacean centers called hemiellipsoid bodies, which serve functions in sensory integration, have been viewed as evolutionarily convergent with mushroom bodies. Here, using key identifiers to characterize neural arrangements, we demonstrate insect-like mushroom bodies in stomatopod crustaceans (mantis shrimps). More than any other crustacean taxon, mantis shrimps display sophisticated behaviors relating to predation, spatial memory, and visual recognition {{comparable to those of}} insects. However, neuroanatomy-based cladistics suggesting close phylogenetic proximity of insects and stomatopod crustaceans conflicts with genomic evidence showing hexapods closely related to simple crustaceans called remipedes. We discuss whether corresponding anatomical phenotypes described here reflect the cerebral morphology of a common ancestor of Pancrustacea or an extraordinary example of convergent evolution...|$|R
40|$|While {{the lateral}} {{occipital}} complex (LOC) {{has been shown}} to be implicated in object recognition, it is unclear whether this brain area is responsive to low-level stimulus-driven features or high-level representational processes. We used scrambled shape-from-motion displays to disambiguate the presence of contours from figure-ground segregation and to measure the strength of the binding process for shapes without contours. We found persisting brain activation in the LOC for scrambled displays after the motion stopped indicating that this brain area subserves and maintains figure-ground segregation processes, a low-level function in the object processing hierarchy. In our second experiment, we found that the figure-ground segregation process has some form of spatial constancy indicating top–down influences. The persisting activation after the motion stops suggests an intermediate role in object recognition processes for this brain area and might provide further evidence for the idea that the lateral occipital complex subserves mnemonic functions mediating between <b>iconic</b> and short-term <b>memory...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> enables {{integrating}} {{visual information}} along a continuous stream of images, for example when watching a movie. In the {{primary visual cortex}} new stimuli do not erase information about previous stimuli. Instead {{the responses to the}} most recent stimulus contain about equal amounts of information about both this and the preceding stimulus. This one-back memory may be the main substrate for both the integration processes in <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> and masking effects. The particular outcome depends on whether the two subsequent component images (i.e., the [...] "icons") are meaningful only when isolated (masking) or only when superimposed (integration).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cultural {{memory is}} the {{starting}} point for studying culture. Theatre, on the other hand, is a multidimensional play with memory; it is an emblem of a certain culture, and of the overall blending of various discourses within it. Hence the relation between theatre and memory is rather complex and multifaceted. Theatre is a medium synthesising text and performance, speech and gesture (play, acting), as well as establishing direct, at least doubly articulated communication: among the actors on stage on the one hand, and between the actors and the audience on the other. They are all subjects of theatrical memory. Theatre not only uses memory in order to create the plot, develop the characters or establish communication with the audience, but also becomes a figure of memory itself: a culturally modelled, socially mandated (<b>iconic,</b> narrative, etc.) <b>memory</b> image (Assman). Additionally, theatre may be considered a place of memory, as well. But theatre is not a simple mnemonic of repeating reality—it is not merely a simulacrum, but also a quotation of reality; it does not aim to copy or memorise reality, but to represent it and interpret it critically. This is particularly true of the contemporary rough theatre of brutality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One basic {{capability}} of interactive and mobile systems {{to cope with}} unknown situations and environments is active, sequence-based visual scene analysis. Image sequences provide static as well as dynamic and also 2 D as well as 3 D information about a certain scene. However, {{at the same time}} they require efficient mechanisms to handle their large data volumes. In this paper we introduce a new concept of a visual scene memory for interactive mobile systems that supports these systems with a space- and time-efficient data structure for representing <b>iconic</b> information. The <b>memory</b> is based on a new kind of mosaic images called multi-mosaics and allows to efficiently store and process sequences of stationary rotating and zooming cameras. Its main key features are polytopial reference coordinate frames and an online data processing strategy. The polytopes provide euclidean coordinates and thus allow the application of standard image analysis algorithms directly to the data yielding easy access and analysis, while online data processing preserves system interactivity. Additionally, mechanisms are included to properly handle multi-resolution data and to deal with dynamic scenes. The concept has been implemented in terms of an integrated system that can easily be included as an additional module in the architecture of interactive and mobile systems. As one prototypical example for possible fields of application the integration of the memory into the architecture of an interactive multi-modal robot is discussed emphasizing the practical relevancy of the new concept. ...|$|R
40|$|Fatima Gallaire’s plays {{from the}} 1990 s {{belong to the}} {{category}} of testimonial literature: her female protagonists reveal aspects of Algerian women’s restricted lives under shari’a and the negotiations made {{in the interests of}} self-autonomy and increased agency. For example, in Princesses, the main character returns to her Algerian homeland after living for an extended period in France. The play describes her seemingly peaceful reception by the townspeople, who later become violent because Princesse has not observed Muslim values in her life abroad. Les Co-épouses illustrates the practice of polygamy and the interactions between a man’s co-wives for mutual protection. As in Princesses, the female characters rely on one another for emotional and even material support as they divulge the difficulties of their daily lives. Besides her plays containing multiple female characters, Fatima Gallaire has written one-act plays in which a single woman performs all the roles: in Rimm la Gazelle, an Algerian-born French woman reminisces as she tells her mother why she will be returning to her birthplace; in Molly des Sables, an Algerian Jewish woman plays 14 different roles as she reveals her psychological maladjustment to her marriage and new country. Relying on Lacan’s concepts of le corps morcelé, I will analyze the performance element as a means of revealing trauma and acquiring greater mental health. Cathy Caruth’s work on trauma will also be invaluable to my study, as will information on drama therapy. The latter {{has been shown to be}} an effective means of beginning the recovery process from catastrophic events: by en-enacting scenes from one’s past, one is able to move the instances “recorded” in the brain from <b>iconic</b> to semantic <b>memory,</b> thereby adding to one’s life story. It is this very process that is healing for the actor in question...|$|R
5000|$|As {{psychological}} {{research has}} improved immensely since Broadbent's time, more sophisticated measures indicate {{that we do}} have an attentional filter, though it is integrated into a broader cognitive system. This system compensates for the controversies of limited parallel processing in Broadbent's original findings. A major component of the system entails sensory memory, which is broken down into <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> and echoic memory. The aforementioned represent visual and auditory memory respectively, which function preattentively. Given the existence of such a preattentive memory store makes it possible for preattentive stimuli to work in a serial manner. [...] Research on <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> has provided a visual hierarchy of the visual system, which indicates specific neurons are activated before stimulus recognition, supporting Broadbent's theory of preattentive processing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> {{provides}} a smooth stream of visual {{information to the}} brain which can be extracted {{over an extended period}} of time by VSTM for consolidation into more stable forms.

50|$|Following Sperling's (1960) {{procedures}} on <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> tasks, {{future researchers}} {{were interested in}} testing the same phenomenon for the auditory sensory store. Echoic memory is measured by behavioural tasks where participants are asked to repeat a sequence of tones, words, or syllables that were presented to them, usually requiring attention and motivation. The most famous partial report task was conducted by presenting participants with an auditory stimulus in the left, right, and both ears simultaneously. Then {{they were asked to}} report spatial location and category name of each stimulus. Results showed that spatial location was far easier to recall than semantic information when inhibiting information from one ear over the other. Consistent with results on <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> tasks, performance on the partial report conditions were far superior to the whole report condition. In addition, a decrease in performance was observed as the interstimulus interval(ISI) (length of time between presentation of the stimulus and recall) increased.|$|E
50|$|Echoic memory, {{coined by}} Ulric Neisser, refers to {{information}} that is registered by the auditory system. As with <b>iconic</b> <b>memory,</b> echoic memory only holds superficial aspects of sound (e.g. pitch, tempo, or rhythm) {{and it has a}} nearly limitless capacity. Echoic memory is generally cited as having a duration of between 1.5 and 5 seconds depending on context but has been shown to last up to 20 seconds in the absence of competing information.|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} sensory {{memories}} exist. <b>Iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is a fast decaying store of visual information; {{a type of}} sensory memory that briefly stores an image which has been perceived for a small duration. Echoic memory is a fast decaying store of auditory information, another type of sensory memory that briefly stores sounds that have been perceived for short durations. Haptic memory {{is a type of}} sensory memory that represents a database for touch stimuli.|$|E
5000|$|The {{occurrence}} of a sustained physiological {{image of an}} object after its physical offset has been observed by many individuals throughout history. One of the earliest documented accounts of the phenomenon was by Aristotle who proposed that afterimages {{were involved in the}} experience of a dream. [...] Natural observation of the light trail produced by glowing ember {{at the end of a}} quickly moving stick sparked the interest of researchers in the 1700s and 1800s. They became the first to begin empirical studies on this phenomenon which later became known as visible persistence. In the 1900s, the role of visible persistence in memory gained considerable attention due to its hypothesized role as a pre-categorical representation of visual information in visual short-term memory (VSTM). In 1960, George Sperling began his classic partial-report experiments to confirm the existence of visual sensory memory and some of its characteristics including capacity and duration. It was not until 1967 that Ulric Neisser termed this quickly decaying memory store <b>iconic</b> <b>memory.</b> Approximately 20 years after Sperling's original experiments, two separate components of visual sensory memory began to emerge: visual persistence and informational persistence. Sperling's experiments mainly tested the information pertaining to a stimulus, whereas others such as Coltheart performed directs tests of visual persistence. [...] In 1978, Di Lollo proposed a two-state model of visual sensory memory. Although it has been debated throughout history, current understanding of <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> makes a clear distinction between visual and informational persistence which are tested differently and have fundamentally different properties. Informational persistence which is the basis behind <b>iconic</b> <b>memory</b> is thought to be the key contributor to visual short term memory as the precategorical sensory store.A similar storage area serves as a temporary warehouse for sounds.|$|E
