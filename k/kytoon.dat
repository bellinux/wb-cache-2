5000|$|Gas {{inflatable}} kytoons. These are variously inflated with air, helium, hydrogen. When {{the kite}} wing is heavier-than-air, then the <b>kytoon</b> needs relative wind to fly. When the kite wing is lighter-than-air then the <b>kytoon</b> will stay aloft when the relative wind is below {{what is needed}} for kiting.|$|E
50|$|The <b>kytoon</b> {{has been}} used for many {{purposes}} both civil and military.|$|E

50|$|Energy can be {{captured}} {{from the wind}} by kites, <b>kytoons,</b> tethered gliders, tethered sailplanes, aerostats (spherical as well as shaped <b>kytoons),</b> bladed turbines, airfoils, airfoil matrices, drogues, variable drogues, spiral airfoils, Darrieus turbines, Magnus-effect VAWT blimps, multiple-rotor complexes, fabric Jalbert-parafoil kites, uni-blade turbines, flipwings, tethers, bridles, string loops, wafting blades, undulating forms, and piezoelectric materials, and more.|$|R
50|$|The kite can be {{used for}} many {{applications}}. Air kites, water kites, bi-media kites, fluid kites, gas kites, <b>kytoons,</b> paravanes, soil kites, solid kites, and plasma kites have niche applications that are furthering the interests of humans in both peace and conflict. Non-human-made kites have applications; some spiders make use of kiting.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Kytoons</b> and balloon kites are {{inflatable}} kites. Kites sometimes combine ram-air inflation {{as well as}} closed-bladder inflation. The {{shape is}} loosely derived from an airfoil with air inlets usually at the front, and a bridle which distributes the tether line loads evenly across the whole base of the kite. These kites have no rigid spars.|$|R
50|$|Balloon kites: Applies to both lighter- and heavier-than-air kite types. The lighter-than-air balloon kite is the <b>kytoon,</b> {{which is}} aloft {{whether or not}} the wind blows. When the <b>kytoon</b> is not kiting, it floats aloft as a pure balloon; when it is kiting, it is a true kite. Kytoons are used to loft radio antennas, rescue signals, and kite-line laundry.|$|E
50|$|A {{kite balloon}} is {{distinct}} from a <b>kytoon,</b> which obtains a portion of its lift aerodynamically.|$|E
50|$|A {{captive balloon}} tends to drift down {{the wind and}} the harder the wind blows, the further the balloon drifts. This leans the tether over at an angle, pulling the balloon lower. On a <b>kytoon,</b> the kite action lifts the balloon, counteracting this pull and holding the <b>kytoon</b> in position. As the wind blows harder, the kite action lifts harder. This can provide good {{stability}} even in strong winds.|$|E
50|$|Kites are {{aircraft}} that are {{tethered to the}} ground or other object (fixed or mobile) that maintains tension in the tether or kite line; they rely on virtual or real wind blowing over and under them to generate lift and drag. <b>Kytoons</b> are balloon-kite hybrids that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deflections, and can be lighter-than-air, neutrally buoyant, or heavier-than-air.|$|R
50|$|In {{the modern}} era the British Army used kites to haul human lookouts into the air for {{observation}} purposes, using the kites developed by Samuel Franklin Cody. Barrage kites were used to protect shipping during the Second World War.Kites were also used for anti-aircraft target practice.Kites and <b>kytoons</b> were used for lofting communications antenna. Submarines lofted observers in rotary kites.|$|R
50|$|In {{more modern}} times the British navy also used kites to haul human lookouts {{high into the}} air to see over the horizon and {{possibly}} the enemy ships, for example with the kite developed by Samuel Franklin Cody. Barrage kites were used to protect shipping during the Second World War. Kites and <b>kytoons</b> were used for lofting communications antenna. Submarines lofted observers in rotary kites. The Rogallo parawing kite and the Jalbert parafoil kite were used for governable parachutes (free-flying kites) to deliver troops and supplies.|$|R
5000|$|Kytoon:A shaped balloon that kites (two general types: 1) lighter-than-medium, {{in which}} it moves within a gravity field 2) heavier-than-air <b>kytoon,</b> or heavier than the medium {{in which it}} flies. Density is implied when saying [...] "heavier"-than-the-ambient medium). For air, some kytoons are less dense than air (using hydrogen, helium, heated air); other kytoons filled with, for example, {{unheated}} air are not buoyant in still air but are still kited. Includes barrage kites of the <b>kytoon</b> type that Domina Jalbert designed for defense purposes and peacetime antenna-lifting by ham-radio operators. Car dealers raise advertisements with kytoons (see Observation balloon. [...] The <b>kytoon</b> is a true kite in flight in an appropriate moving stream of material, fluid, gas, or air; {{it is also a}} true balloon ...|$|E
50|$|A hybrid {{tethered}} craft comprising both a lighter-than-air balloon {{as well as}} a kite lifting {{surface is}} called a <b>kytoon.</b>|$|E
50|$|A hybrid {{tethered}} balloon or <b>kytoon</b> {{is shaped}} to provide aerodynamic lift {{similar to a}} kite, {{as well as to}} reduce drag.|$|E
50|$|Kites are {{aircraft}} that are tethered {{to some other}} object (fixed or mobile) or other means that maintain tension in the kite line; and rely on virtual or real wind blowing over and under them to generate lift and drag. <b>Kytoons</b> are balloon kites that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deflections, and can be lighter-than-air, neutrally buoyant, or heavier-than air. Kites {{have been developed for}} commercial applications using kite control systems, including the airborne wind energy systems of high altitude wind power.|$|R
50|$|Various {{mechanisms}} are proposed for capturing the kinetic energy of winds such as kites, <b>kytoons,</b> aerostats, gliders, gliders with turbines for regenerative soaring, sailplanes with turbines, or other airfoils, including multiple-point building- or terrain-enabled holdings. Once the mechanical energy {{is derived from}} the wind's kinetic energy, then many options are available for using that mechanical energy: direct traction, conversion to electricity aloft or at ground station, conversion to laser or microwave for power beaming to other aircraft or ground receivers. Energy generated by a high-altitude system may be used aloft or sent to the ground surface by conducting cables, mechanical force through a tether, rotation of endless line loop, movement of changed chemicals, flow of high-pressure gases, flow of low-pressure gases, or laser or microwave power beams.|$|R
50|$|Airborne wind {{turbines}} may operate in low or high altitudes; {{they are part}} of a wider class of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) addressed by high-altitude wind power and crosswind kite power. When the generator is on the ground, then the tethered aircraft need not carry the generator mass or have a conductive tether. When the generator is aloft, then a conductive tether would be used to transmit energy to the ground or used aloft or beamed to receivers using microwave or laser. Kites and 'helicopters' come down when there is insufficient wind; <b>kytoons</b> and blimps may resolve the matter with other disadvantages. Also, bad weather such as lightning or thunderstorms, could temporarily suspend use of the machines, probably requiring them to be brought back down to the ground and covered. Some schemes require a long power cable and, if the turbine is high enough, a prohibited airspace zone. As of July 2015, no commercial airborne {{wind turbines}} are in regular operation.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of a <b>kytoon</b> is that it remains in a reasonably stable position above the tether point, irrespective {{of the strength of}} wind, whereas ordinary balloons and kites are less stable.|$|E
50|$|A <b>kytoon</b> or {{kite balloon}} is a {{tethered}} aircraft which obtains {{some of its}} lift dynamically as a heavier-than-air kite and the rest aerostatically as a lighter-than-air balloon. The word is a portmanteau of kite and balloon.|$|E
2500|$|Although the British War Cabinet {{proposed}} convoys in March 1917, the Admiralty still refused. It was {{not until}} [...] of shipping were lost to U-boats in April (and British Isles grain reserves had dropped to a six-week supply) that the Admiralty approved convoying all shipments coming through {{the north and south}} Atlantic. Rear Admiral Alexander Duff, head of the Antisubmarine Division, suggested it on 26 April, and the First Sea Lord, Admiral John Jellicoe, approved it the next day. Escorts were to be composed of obsolete cruisers, armed merchant cruisers and pre-dreadnought battleships for the oceanic portion of the routes, while in the more dangerous waters around Britain they were composed of destroyers. Observation balloons, especially <b>kytoons,</b> were used to help spot submarines beneath the surface, the aircraft carrier not then being developed. During discussions in March, it was determined that 75 destroyers were needed, but only 43 were available. The first experimental convoy of merchant vessels left Gibraltar on 10 May 1917 and arrived at the Downs on 22 May, having been accompanied by the last leg of its journey by a flying boat from the Scillies.|$|R
5000|$|When {{flying a}} world-record-sized {{recreation}} kite, a famous professional kite flier lost {{his life as}} he became an accidental mooring of the large kite. When extreme-sport kitesurfers are themselves the dynamic mooring gone astray, they sometimes slam into rocks, buildings, people, thorns, trees ...that end up in minor to fatal injuries. The kite system called paraglider has the human pilot as the dynamic mooring; when collapse of the kite's wing occurs too near the ground {{and there is not}} time to use a parachute, injury results to person and property. When a statically moored kite-type hang glider is moored improperly, gusts sometimes lift the kite and the kite hang glider gets into a lockout condition and slams into the ground, breaking itself and sometimes causing injury to persons and other property. Mooring kites so the kite can reach electric high voltage powerlines can cause outages in electrical service and sometimes injury or death to persons. Most every recreational kite sold has a tag that refers to where to fly the kite; this is implicitly telling the operator to keep the kite moored in a safe manner. Humans are responsible for the kites they anchor or set into free-flight. One of the downsides to the war-time use of barrage balloon (<b>kytoons)</b> involved cut tether [...] cables that dragged into power lines causing loss of production of other needed goods. See the safety list at National Kite Month: ...|$|R
5000|$|When a {{recreation}} kiting person {{is holding a}} kite line {{in his or her}} hand to moor a kite, then the hand moves, even if slightly; but the hand may move greatly to control the kite in kite fighting or stunt-kite flying. Also, the person may walk windward or oppositely for various reasons. That all {{is an example of a}} well-known mobil kite mooring. Other well-noted mobile kite moorings include a towing scooter, a towing bicycle, a skate board, a wave-moved surfboard or kiteboard, a cargo-ship, a boat, a horse, a dog, a raft, ...and many other moving vehicles or machines. Some kiters moor a kite to a floating object and let the kite tow the object across ponds, lakes, bays; some persons moor themselves to kites and let the kite tow them across water bodies, sand expanses, and grass fields. Others have historically found ways to safely moor themselves to kite lines where the kite is a very large wing while they jump off hills and mountains to fly their kites in the special kiting mode that is then called hang gliding; since the pilot is mobile, then the mooring is a dynamic mooring. U.S. FAR 101 covers the dynamically moored manned hang gliders without using the word [...] "mooring" [...] in the regulation; some hang gliders are not kites; some hang glider are kites. The engineering challenges for mooring cargo-ship moored kite system are daunting. Mooring the war time barrage balloons and <b>kytoons</b> challenged engineers and operators. Accidents in mooring have killed people.|$|R
50|$|In low or gusty winds a kite can nose-dive, {{losing a}} large amount of height even if it recovers. Because a <b>kytoon</b> is buoyant it does not nose-dive and remains in {{position}} even in relatively still air.|$|E
50|$|A hybrid type uses both static {{buoyancy}} {{and dynamic}} airflow to provide lift. The dynamic movement may be created either using propulsive {{power as a}} hybrid airship or by tethering in the wind like a kite, as a <b>kytoon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A captive {{plane is}} an {{aircraft}} (kite, powered, <b>kytoon,</b> kiteplane) {{which does not}} fly free, but is held like a kite by a rope from the [...] "pilot" [...] or mooring. The rope or line is not only used for holding the aircraft, but it also allows steering the plane.|$|E
40|$|Ozone is {{the most}} harmful air {{pollutant}} for plant ecosystems in the Mediterranean and Alpine areas due to its biological and economic damage to crops and forests. In order to evaluate the relation between ozone exposure and vegetation injury under on-field conditions, suitable ozone monitoring techniques were investi-gated. In {{the framework of a}} 5 -year research project aimed at ozone risk assessment on forests, both continuous analysers and passive samplers were employed during the summer seasons (1994 � 1998) in different sites of a wide mountain region (80 x 40 km 2) on the southern slope of the European Alps. Continuous analysers allowed the recording of ozone hourly concentration means necessary both to calculate specific exposure indexes (such as AOT, SUM, W 126) and to record daily time-courses. Passive samplers, even though supplied only weekly mean concentration values, made it possible to estimate the altitude concentration gradient useful to correct the altitude dependence of ozone concentrations to be inserted into exposure indexes. In-canopy ozone profiles were also determined by placing passive samplers at different heights inside the forest canopy. Vertical ozone soundings by means of tethered balloons (<b>kytoons)</b> allowed the measurement of the vertical concentration gradient above the forest canopy. They also revealed ozone reservoirs aloft and were useful to explain the ozone advection dynamic in mountain slopes where ground measurement proved to be inadequate. An intercomparison between passive (PASSAM, CH) and continuous measurements highlighted the necessity to accurately standardize all the exposure operations, particularly the pre- and postexposure conservation at cold temperature to avoid dye (DPE) activity. Advantages and disadvantages from each mentioned technique are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The Helikite {{is a type}} of kite-balloon or <b>kytoon</b> {{designed}} by Sandy Allsopp in the UK in 1993. Allsopps UK Patent No.2280381 and US Patent No.6016998A. The Helikite comprises a combination of a helium balloon and a kite to form a single, aerodynamically sound tethered aircraft, that exploits both wind and helium for its lift.|$|E
50|$|An aerostat-type {{wind power}} system relies {{at least in}} part on {{buoyancy}} to support the wind-collecting elements. Aerostats vary in their designs and resulting lift-to-drag ratio; the kiting effect of higher lift-over-drag shapes for the aerostat can effectively keep an airborne turbine aloft; a variety of such kiting balloons were made famous in the <b>kytoon</b> by Domina Jalbert.|$|E
50|$|Self-erecting {{collapsible}} kites:Collapsible kites that self-erect upon a triggering {{event to}} full kite form have special niche uses and appeal. Positive-inflated kytoons would be typed here, if a triggering erected the <b>kytoon.</b> Already-erected kites like the parafoil are self-inflating, but not usually considered as needing erecting (since {{they are already}} softly finished in form, except for placing them in the wind).|$|E
50|$|Kites {{have been}} used for {{military}} uses in the past for signaling, for delivery of munitions, for free-flight kiting payloads from aircraft to ground positions, for kiting troops to points where they could parachute to destinations, for underwater kiting via paravanes to perform various underwater duties, for lifting payloads from one point to another, for raising rescue signals from rafts or stressed areas, for raising communications antenna, and for observation by lifting an observer above the field of battle, and by using kite aerial photography. Barrage kites {{have been used}} in both open frame kites and <b>kytoon</b> types to defend against enemy aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|On 24 March 1960 Twin Falls Victory was {{withdrawn}} from James River and {{delivered to the}} Air Force. [...] She was converted to a missile range instrumentation ship and served {{as part of the}} Eastern Test Range. The U.S.Army had funded the purchase under the Pershing Missile Project for the Atlantic Missile Range to prove the aiming accuracy of the Pershing missile. The ship was modified by equipping it with special navigation systems, AN/FPS-16 monopulse missile tracking radar, telemetry receiving equipment, AN/SPN-8 splash detection radar, AN/GMD-1A Rawinsonde tracking equipment and a balloon hangar, to house a <b>Kytoon</b> tethered blimp and as a weather balloon inflation shelter. The ship eventually was delivered to the Atlantic Missile Range and operated by merchant marine crewmen and contractor technical staff. Pan American World Airways and its subcontractor RCA MTP operated the radar, telemetry, navigation and weather instrumentation aboard the ship. The ship was operated under the name USAF Twin Falls Victory until turned over to MSTS on 1 July 1964 at which time the ship was redesignated T-AGM-11 Twin Falls and continued to serve as a mobile tracking platform for recording data on missiles and satellites that were out of range of land-based tracking stations.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn experiment to measure atmospheric extinction, along a slant {{path in the}} marine boundary layer, was devised and partially constructed. The slant path is from a <b>kytoon,</b> flown from a ship in motion, to a gyro-stabilized platform mounted on shipboard. The light source on the <b>kytoon</b> is an omni-directional high pressure xenon flash lamp, with a quartz envelope, to provide radiation from the visible to the middle IR regions of the spectrum. Wavelengths of 0. 4880 µn, 0. 6328 µm, 1. 06 µm, 1. 25 µm, 1. 60 µm, 2. 20 µm, and 3. 80 µm are isolated by use of interference filters. The range, needed {{in the process of}} determining extinction is obtained by a ranging system composed of a GaAs pulsing laser with optics mounted on the gyro-platform on shipboard, a retro-reflecting system on the <b>kytoon,</b> a receiver coaxial with the transmitter on shipboard, and a HP- 1743 A 100 MHz ocsilloscope.
