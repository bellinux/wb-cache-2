5|$|Wolin was {{the major}} stronghold of the Volinian tribal territory, {{comprising}} the island and a broad stretch of the adjacent mainland, with its frontier guarded by a string of gords. The city's peak of prosperity occurred around and after year 900, when a new seaport was built (the municipal complex had now four of them) and the metropolitan area was secured by walls and embankments. The archeological findings there include {{a great variety of}} imported <b>goods</b> (<b>even</b> <b>from</b> the Far East) and locally manufactured products and raw materials; amber and precious metals figure prominently, as jewelry was one of the mainstay economic activities of the Wolinian elite.|$|R

40|$|Good morning, everyone. As always, {{we gather}} in God’s {{presence}} and in God’s {{gift of the}} presence of one another. Let us pray. Great and gracious God, author of all that is good. We thank You for the beauty of this day and for the gift of life within and all around us. As we dedicate this day to You, help us to use it to the fullest so that at day’s end, we may rest in the assurance that this, our home, is just a little bit better than when the day began. We lift up to you both our successes and our failures this day, trusting that you can bring forth <b>good</b> <b>even</b> <b>from</b> bad, wheat <b>even</b> <b>from</b> weeds. Bless the Nevada Senate this day and all their deliberations and all their work in committees. May they be strengthened in their leadership and in doing good for all whom they serve. May obstacles in their work this day not be overwhelming, but challenge them to new possibilities. And as the week begins to draw to a close, may they, and all Your people, find some rest in the Sabbath days ahead, and some time to praise and give thanks. We make this prayer as your instruments of peace. AMEN...|$|R

The film went on to complete 100 days run at various cinema halls. The film got very <b>good</b> response <b>even</b> <b>from</b> Non-Bhojpuri speaking audience and film was running well after one year {{in many parts of}} Northern India. This was the first Bhojpuri film to get a simultaneous release in overseas market like Nepal, Fiji, Mauritius and Guiana.|$|R
50|$|He {{relocated}} to the University of Washington in 1948, where he applied Skinner's techniques on {{children at the}} Institute of Child Development, and wrote several textbooks in the field together with Donald Baer. Studies he performed there showed that encouragement of good behavior would elicit more <b>good</b> behavior <b>even</b> <b>from</b> unruly children.

50|$|Claims {{that the}} mountain's viewshed {{is the largest}} in the worldor second largest after Mount Kilimanjaroare ill founded. It does boast one of the largest viewsheds in the Western United States and {{played a key role in}} California history. Countless peaks in the state are taller, but Mount Diablo has a {{remarkable}} visual prominence for a mountain of such low elevation. Its looming presence over much of the bay area, delta, and Central Valley, and <b>good</b> visibility <b>even</b> <b>from</b> the Mother Lode, all key regions during the gold rush and early statehood, made it an important landmark for mapping and navigation. The summit is used as the reference datum for land surveying in much of northern California and Nevada.|$|R
40|$|Dynamical {{models of}} inter- and intra-cellular {{processes}} contain the rate constants of the biochemical reactions. These kinetic parameters {{are often not}} accessible directly through experiments, {{but they can be}} inferred from time-resolved data. Time resolved data, that is, measurements of reactant concentration at series of time points, are usually affected by different types of error, whose source can be both experimental and biological. The noise in the input data makes the estimation of the model parameters a very difficult task, as if the inference method is not sufficiently robust to the noise, the resulting estimates are not reliable. Therefore "noise-robust" methods that estimate rate constants with the maximum precision and accuracy are needed. In this report we present the probabilistic generative model of parameter inference implemented by the software prototype KInfer and we show the ability of this tool of estimating the rate coefficients of models of biochemical network with a <b>good</b> accuracy <b>even</b> <b>from</b> very noisy input data...|$|R
6000|$|One great <b>good</b> arises <b>even</b> <b>from</b> {{the first}} step in figure drawing, that it gets the student quit at once of the notion of formal symmetry. If you learn only to draw a leaf well, you are taught in some of our schools to turn it the other way, {{opposite}} to itself; and the two leaves set opposite ways are called [...] "a design:" [...] and thus it is supposed possible to produce ornamentation, though you have no more brains than a looking-glass or a kaleidoscope has. But if you once learn to draw the human figure, you will find that knocking two men's heads together does not necessarily constitute a good design; nay, that it makes a very bad design, or no design at all; and you will see at once that to arrange a group of two or more figures, you must, though perhaps it may be desirable to balance, or oppose them, at the same time vary their attitudes, and make one, not the reverse of the other, but the companion of the other.|$|R
30|$|Chemical {{structure}} of coal macerals can be well examined {{by means of}} FTIR spectroscopy which {{makes it possible to}} obtain <b>good</b> quality spectra <b>even</b> <b>from</b> relatively small grains (Painter et al. 1978, 1980, 1981 a, b; Bouwman and Freriks 1980; Painter and Rhoads 1981; Solomon 1981; Kuehn et al. 1982; Meyer 1982; Solomon and Carangelo 1982, 1988; Mastalerz and Bustin 1993 a, b, 1995, 1996; Guo and Bustin 1998; Bustin and Guo 1999; Walker and Mastalerz 2004; Singh et al. 2015). Therefore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is used as a physical detection technique and is widely applied in characterizing the chemical structures of coal. Besides, to quantify the mineralogical transformation X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) analysis has been done on the samples.|$|R
40|$|Derelict waterbodies {{could be}} an {{important}} source to boost fish production for meeting the future fish demand of the country. The study has shown that fish yield from these waterbodies {{could be as high}} as 4. 6 t/ha. Overall, net income per hectare through scientific management of derelict waterbodies {{has been found to be}} Rs 104443, with maximum and minimum net incomes per hectare being Rs 207416 and Rs 64033, respectively. Benefit–cost analysis has indicated that all waterbodies are favourable for aquaculture. Overall B-C ratio under the project has been found to be 3. 82 and interestingly, scientific management of waterbodies could yield <b>good</b> income <b>even</b> <b>from</b> low level of investment. Such an activity can provide enormous income and employment opportunities in the rural areas. To encourage large-scale utilization of available derelict waterbodies for aquaculture, a prudent and well-conceived policy for leasing out derelict waterbodies and transfer of relevant technologies to the needy and interested farmers should be evolved. These steps would not only boost fish production in the rural areas, but would also provide much needed impetus to the growth and diversification of rural economy.

40|$|Sharing {{information}} between multiple tasks enables al-gorithms {{to achieve}} <b>good</b> generalization performance <b>even</b> <b>from</b> {{small amounts of}} training data. However, in a realistic scenario of multi-task learning not all tasks are equally re-lated to each other, hence it could be advantageous to trans-fer information only between the most related tasks. In this work we propose an approach that processes mul-tiple tasks in a sequence with sharing between subsequent tasks instead of solving all tasks jointly. Subsequently, we {{address the question of}} curriculum learning of tasks, i. e. finding the best order of tasks to be learned. Our approach is based on a generalization bound criterion for choosing the task order that optimizes the average expected classi-fication performance over all tasks. Our experimental re-sults show that learning multiple related tasks sequentially can be more effective than learning them jointly, the order in which tasks are being solved affects the overall perfor-mance, and that our model is able to automatically discover a favourable order of tasks. 1...|$|R
