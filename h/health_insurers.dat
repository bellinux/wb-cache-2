40|$|Background Several western {{countries}} have introduced managed competition in {{their health care}} system. In the Netherlands, a new health insurance law was introduced in January 2006 {{making it easier to}} switch <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> each year. Objective The objective was to measure peoples intention to switch <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> and actual switching behaviour. We also examined whether some groups were less inclined to switch <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> and ⁄ or had more difficulty to exert their intention to switch. Design In October 2006, members of three Dutch panels indicated whether they intended to switch <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> during that year's open enrolment period. In the beginning of 2007, the same people were asked whether they indeed switched <b>health</b> <b>insurer.</b> Results Only 1 % intended to switch <b>health</b> <b>insurer.</b> Women, older people, lower educated people, people who were insured for a longer period and people who reported a bad or moderate health were less inclined to switch <b>health</b> <b>insurer.</b> The amount of switching was higher among individuals who intended to switch (31 %) than among individuals who did not know whether they would switch (7 %) and individuals with no intention to switch (2 %). Among those who intended to switch <b>health</b> <b>insurer,</b> women and people who reported a good <b>health</b> switched <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> more often. The years of enrolment were also associated with actual switching behaviour. Discussion and Conclusions We might have to temper the optimistic expectations on enhanced choice. Future research should determine why people do not switch <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> when they intend to and which barriers they experience. ...|$|R

40|$|In 2006, {{a number}} of {{far-reaching}} reforms have been implemented in the Dutch health insurance system. Giving Dutch consumers the freedom to change health plans every year increases consumer mobility. The idea is that especially consumers who are dissatisfied with their insurer will decide to switch health plan, thereby improving {{the efficiency of the}} health care system. Up to date, however, it is unknown why consumers change <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> or decide to be loyal to their insurer. The present study aimed to examine the influence of insurer trust, experiences with a health plan, and identification with a <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> on <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> loyalty. Methods: An access-panel consisting of over 10 000 people insured at one particular <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> was used. A subgroup of members (N ¼ 1500) was approached to answer questions on insurer trust, identification with the insurer, and past experiences with the insurer. In addition, questions on insurer loyalty were posed. Respondents indicated whether they intended to stay with their <b>health</b> <b>insurer</b> or considered changing <b>health</b> <b>insurer.</b> Results: Preliminary results show that most people (72 %) were insured at the health plan in question for 10 years or more. This suggests that people are loyal to their health plan. People mostly reported positive experiences with their health plan providing an explanation for this loyalty. Conclusions: People appear to be loyal to their <b>health</b> <b>insurer,</b> partly because they are satisfied with the provided service. The question, however, remains whether people will stay insured at the same health plan when changing health plan becomes easier. To answer this question, the relationships between insurer trust, past experiences with the insurer, identification with the insurer, and insurer loyalty are currently examined. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

In 2011, {{there were more}} than one million users, and insurance companies have estimated that two-thirds of German users are women. As a result of the trials, German public <b>health</b> <b>insurers</b> began to cover acupuncture for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee, but not tension headache or migraine. This decision was based in part on socio-political reasons. Some insurers in Germany chose to stop reimbursement of acupuncture because of the trials. For other conditions, insurers in Germany were not convinced that acupuncture had adequate benefits over usual care or sham treatments. Highlighting the results of the placebo group, researchers refused to accept a placebo therapy as efficient.|$|E

25|$|While {{a health}} care {{provider}} visit with a patient may result in the patient leaving with a prescription for medication, not all patients will fill the prescription at a pharmacy. In the U.S., 20-30% of prescriptions are never filled at the pharmacy. There are many reasons patients do not fill prescriptions including {{the cost of the}} medication, doubting the need for medication, or preference for self-care measures other than medication. Cost may be a barrier to prescription drug adherence, but convenience, side effects and lack of demonstrated benefit are also significant factors to a complex situation. A US nationwide survey of 1,010 adults in 2001 found that 22% chose not to fill prescriptions because of the price, which is similar to the 20-30% overall rate of unfilled prescriptions. However, analysis by <b>health</b> <b>insurers</b> suggest that patient co-payment requirements can be reduced to $0 with little or no improvement in long-term adherence rates.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{continue}} {{to claim that}} they had a workable bill to extend coverage to all Americans and not cost the taxpayer anything, though nothing has been publicly presented to back the claim. The Empowering Patients First Act which was proposed as a replacing amendment to the Senate Bill during the bill mark-up. However, this alternative bill was rejected by the Senate Finance Committee. The Congressional Budget Office said that it would not reduce the percentage of working age people who do not have insurance over the next 10 years, and that it estimated it would encourage <b>health</b> <b>insurers</b> to reduce rather than increase insurance coverage as it would remove mandated coverage rules that currently apply in some states. This bill would have given the insurance industry greater access to government funds through new insurance subsidies. It did not have any taxation provisions and though it would reduce the deficit over 10 years by $18 billion, this was a considerably smaller deficit reduction than either the House or the Senate bills.|$|E
