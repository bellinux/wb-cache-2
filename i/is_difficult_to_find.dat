5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is redundant because {{the island is}} accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of the tiny island to use a kayak to access the island because the island is heavily wooded and it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a spot to dock.|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E

25|$|A {{laparoscopy}} or laparotomy {{can also}} be performed to visually confirm an ectopic pregnancy. This is generally reserved for women presenting with signs of an acute abdomen and/or hypovolemic shock.

25|$|The typical {{signs of}} {{malignant}} hyperthermia {{are due to}} a hypercatabolic state, which presents as a very high temperature, an increased heart rate and abnormally rapid breathing, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, mixed acidosis, rigid muscles, and rhabdomyolysis.

It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> confirmed cases in the postoperative period more than several minutes after discontinuation of anesthetic agents.|$|E
25|$|Following local custom/There is no fixed date line. As noted above, {{according}} to this point of view, Shabbat is simply observed on the date previously established as Shabbat by the local community—uniformly, local Saturday—without any need for any further observance. This {{appears to be the}} default practice for residents of such places as Japan, New Zealand and Hawaii. At minimum, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> evidence of other practices by residents of those areas.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a present-day parallel. The {{withholding}} of copyright, {{though only}} an indirect financial penalty, was both an official act and a hostile signal. We {{do not seem}} to have a word for this kind of indirect pressure, though suppression of dissent comes closer than censorship. Perhaps the modern 'naming and shaming' comes closest. The importance of respectability, reputation and public standing were critical in this case, as so often in traditional societies.|$|E

25|$|Anthropologists {{claim that}} many of the Dongba rituals show strong {{influences}} from the Bön religion, and are not native in origin. Bön lamas are believed to have settled among the Nashi as farmers, and to have begun to practise exorcisms as a way of earning a little money on the side; they were thus in competition with the native ritual specialists, locally known as Llü-bu, or Ssan-nyi. This is disputed, largely because the Bon religion is so adulterated by Tibetan Buddhism today that it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> pure and authentic practitioners to use as a basis for comparison.|$|E
25|$|Although it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{conspicuous}} variations amongst {{individuals with}} bare eyes, definite features {{are unique to}} each individual. For example, the abdominal spots on males of P. dominula vary in sizes, locations, and patterns. They act as sexually selective signals and also are used to determine social hierarchy within the colonies. Males with smaller, regular patterns of spots were more aggressive and dominant over those that had larger, irregular patterns. Similarly, morphology of females also varies between individuals. The larger and the more scattered the clypeus marks on the foundress are, the higher the chance {{for her to be}} dominant over other females.|$|E
25|$|Veratrum nigrum {{was used}} as an {{ornamental}} plant in European gardens at least as far back as 1773. It was in common use in 1828, and Charles Darwin grew it in his garden in the 1840s. The plant is still widely used in gardens in Europe and Asia because of its striking black flowers. It is also used to add height to a garden, and as a means of providing a darker backdrop to more brightly colored plants and flowers. The large seed pods weather winter well (tending not to drop in high wind), and it can be a striking winter ornamental seedpod plant as well. However, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and very expensive in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Other {{studies of}} the {{fighting}} at Kursk suggest that very few of German armour losses were caused by the IL-2 or any other Soviet aircraft. In fact, total German tank losses in Operation Citadel amounted to 323 totally destroyed, the vast majority to anti-tank guns and armored fighting vehicles. In addition it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any first-hand accounts by German panzer crews on the Eastern Front describing anything more than the occasional loss to direct air attack. The vast majority, around 95%–98%, of tank losses are due to enemy anti-tank guns, tanks, mines, artillery, and infantry assault, or simply abandoned as operational losses like mostly happened during the last eleven months of the war.|$|E
25|$|But {{his only}} signed {{pictures}} {{of this period}} are the Neptune and Amphitrite of 1516 at Berlin, and the Madonna, with a portrait of Jean Carondelet of 1517, at the Louvre, both of which suggest that Vasari only spoke by hearsay of the progress made by Gossaert in the true method of producing pictures full of mythological nude figures and poesies. It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> anything more coarse or misshapen than the Amphitrite, unless it is the grotesque and ungainly drayman who figures for Neptune. In later forms of the same subject—the Adam and Eve at Hampton Court, or its feebler replica at Berlin and Venus and Amor (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels)—there is more nudity, combined with realism of the commonest type.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the mysteries}} about Leptictidium is whether it moved by running or by jumping. Because {{there are very few}} {{completely}} bipedal mammals, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an appropriate living model to compare it with. If the kangaroo is used, it is probable that Leptictidium hopped along with its body tilted forward, using its tail as a counterweight. On the other hand, elephant shrews combine both types of locomotion; they usually move on four legs, but they can run on two legs to flee from a predator. Studies of the bone structure of Leptictidium have yielded contradicting information: its leg articulations appear too weak to have supported the shock of repeated jumps, but its long feet were obviously adapted for jumping rather than running.|$|E
