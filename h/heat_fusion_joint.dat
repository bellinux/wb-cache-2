A {{finite element model}} was built to mimic the transient heat transfer in PE pipes, in which constant heat flux boundary condition {{was applied to the}} inner surface of the PE pipes. Various defects with different diameters and depths were simulated in PE pipes and they would affect the thermal distributions from which the relation between thermal images and defect sizes and locations would be established. An electrical heating bar, as the novel thermal excitation source, was employed in active infrared thermography experimental system. The finite element simulation results are well agreed with the one obtained from the infrared imaging experiments and it demonstrated that finite element numerical method can be an effective method to analyze infrared imaging.

30|$|Fusion {{welding process}} uses the heat source such as arc, laser, and {{electron}} beam to heat and melt the materials to be joined. Although perpetual joint with acceptable tensile strength can be attained in some cases, fusion welding still has inherent disadvantages. Due {{to the influence}} of high temperature thermal cycle by centralized <b>heat</b> source during <b>fusion</b> welding, solidification problems, such as as-cast microstructure and weld defects are always occurred in the weld seams as reported by Kou [6], Li et al.

This non-homogeneous microstructure combined with weld defects and residual stresses is probably harmful to the mechanical performance of <b>fusion</b> <b>joints,</b> especially to the fatigue property [8 – 10].

In the {{automotive}} industry, {{there is a}} big push to improve performance, fuel efficiency and other tailor-made engineering properties of vehicles. Manufacturers are now looking at other better, lightweight materials like magnesium and aluminum to use alongside steel. Traditional joining methods like welding are not suitable for these dissimilar materials. The friction stir forming process was developed and was able to create a single-pin <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> between aluminum and steel. This research now focuses on the issues that stemmed from the newly developed friction stir forming process. The first part studies the corrosion that occurred due to the usage of dissimilar metals. Friction stir formed samples were deployed to three different test sites, each with different atmospheric conditions for an 8 -month period. The corrosion products were characterized and the effects of these were related to the mechanical properties of the joints. Zinc was discovered to be the first metal to be attacked, followed by aluminum, and formed corrosion products in the joint. Higher chloride concentrations proved to be a more corrosive environment. Corrosion caused significant decrease in the strength of the joints. The second part of the research aimed to change the structure and makeup of the previous single-pin <b>fusion</b> <b>joint.</b> By developing a new anvil and the usage of a different tool, a new joint called the clinch joint was produced. The optimal parameters for the friction stir clinching process were determined.

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has a multi-year {{program at}} the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to provide {{engineering}} studies and assessments of {{issues related to the}} use of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods for the reliable inspection of nuclear power plant components. As part of this program, there is a subtask 2 D that was set up to address an assessment of issues related to the NDE of high density polyethylene (HDPE) butt <b>fusion</b> <b>joints.</b> This work is being driven by the nuclear industry wanting to employ HDPE materials in nuclear power plant systems. This being a new material for use in nuclear applications, {{there are a number of}} issues related to its use and potential problems that may evolve. The industry is pursuing ASME Code Case N- 755 entitled “Use of Polyethylene (PE) Plastic Pipe for Section III, Division 1, Construction and Section XI Repair/Replacement Activities” that contains the requirements for nuclear power plant applications of HDPE. This Code Case requires that inspections be performed after the <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> is made by visually examining the bead that is formed and conducting a pressure test of the joint. These tests are only effective in general if gross through-wall flaws exist in the <b>fusion</b> <b>joint.</b> The NRC wants to know whether a volumetric inspection can be conducted on the <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> that will reliably detect lack-of-fusion conditions that may be produced during joint fusing. The NRC has requested that the work that PNNL is conducting be provided to assist them in resolving this inspection issue of whether effective volumetric NDE can be conducted to detect lack of fusion (LOF) in the butt HDPE joints. PNNL had 24 HDPE pipe specimens manufactured of 3408 material to contain LOF conditions that could be used to assess the effectiveness of NDE in detecting the LOF. Basic ultrasonic material properties were measured and used to guide the use of phased arrays and time-of-flight diffraction (TOFD) work that was conducted. Millimeter (mm) waves were also used to inspect these assemblies. Fluor and NDE Innovations, Inc. conducted TOFD inspections using their commercially available equipment on all 24 specimens. These NDE inspection results were reviewed and several of the specimens were selected for destructive evaluation using a microtome to slice small blocks of blank and <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> material. This interim report provides a status/summary of the work that has been conducted to date. In the areas selected for destructive testing where there were strong acoustic responses, LOF was verified. In areas where there were no NDE responses, no LOF was found. It needs to be noted that only a small amount of material has been destructively characterized at this point and further work is planned to determine if these trends hold up. Some of the material from three of the assemblies was sent off for mechanical testing but the results were not available to be included in this status report. The initial work shows that at least some of the LOF is providing NDE responses that have been verified through destructive testing. Thus, there is promise that a volumetric examination can be conducted on HDPE butt <b>fusion</b> <b>joints.</b> The future work will lead to quantifying what various NDE methods can detect, what they miss, and what they incorrectly characterize as defective...|$|R

Previous results obtained with strains carrying transcriptional fusions of gnd to the structural genes of the lactose operon suggested that the growth rate-dependent regulation of gnd expression is at the post-transcriptional level. To characterize the regulation further, we prepared with phage MudII a set of eight independent gnd-lac gene (protein) fusions. We showed through genetic analysis and DNA sequencing that each <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> was located within the 6 PGD-coding sequence {{between the first and second}} base pair of a codon, the reading frame required for production of a hybrid 6 PGD-beta-galactosidase. Strains harboring the gnd-lac fusion plasmids produced proteins whose mobility in a NaDodSO 4 /polyacrylamide gel agreed with the molecular weights predicted from the DNA sequence for the respective hybrid proteins.

In addition, a clone containing only the first two cysteine residues of OprF demonstrated reactivity with monoclonal antibodies MA 4 - 4 and MA 7 - 8 that was destroyed by 2 -mercaptoethanol treatment, as was reactivity with intact OprF.

The focus of the work is on the effect of moisture content of molten salts on latent heat measurements using a differential scanning calorimetry.
