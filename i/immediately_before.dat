Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 15 male athletic voluntaries to participate in this study and did two intensive aerobic and anaerobic tests in a 2 experimental trials separated by at least 10 day. Blood sample were taken <b>before,</b> <b>immediately,</b> 1 and 24 hours after tests to analysis number of circulating leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes. Results: A significant difference was found between number of leucocytes <b>before,</b> <b>immediately,</b> 1 and 24 hours after aerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant difference was found between number of neutrophils <b>before,</b> <b>immediately,</b> 1 and 24 hours after aerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant difference was found between number of monocytes <b>before,</b> <b>immediately,</b> 1 and 24 hours after aerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant difference was found between number of leukocytes <b>before,</b> <b>immediately,</b> 1 and 24 hours after anaerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant difference was found between number of neutrophils <b>before,</b> <b>immediately,</b> 1 and 24 hours after anaerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant difference was found between number of monocytes <b>before,</b> <b>immediately,</b> 1 and 24 hours after anaerobic test (P 0. 05). These data demonstrate that intensive aerobic test was inducing increase leucocytes, neutrophils and monocytes, spatial in macrophage system. And also demonstrate that intensive anaerobic test was not inducing signification varied in immune system. Conclusion: The result is that a maximal aerobic test increase and strength the immune system and anabolic state can exercise testosterone and research has shown that this hormone can reduce immune system components...|$|R
