40|$|The <b>tank</b> <b>capacity</b> chart {{calibration}} {{problem of}} two oil tanks with deflection was studied, {{one of which}} is an elliptical cylinder storage tank with two truncated ends and another is a cylinder storage tank with two spherical crowns. Firstly, the function relation between oil reserve and oil height based on the integral method was precisely deduced, when the storage tank has longitudinal inclination but has no deflection. Secondly, the nonlinear optimization model which has both longitudinal inclination parameter α and lateral deflection parameter β was constructed, using cut-complement method and approximate treatment method. Then the deflection <b>tank</b> <b>capacity</b> chart calibration with a 10 [*]cm oil level height interval was worked out. Lastly, the <b>tank</b> <b>capacity</b> chart was corrected by BP neural network algorithm and got proportional error of theoretical and experimental measurements ranges from 0 % to 0. 00015 %. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method has better performance in terms of <b>tank</b> <b>capacity</b> chart calibration accuracy compared with other existing approaches and has a strongly practical significance...|$|R
