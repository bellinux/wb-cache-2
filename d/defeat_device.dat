2500|$|For the {{emission}} standards to deliver real emission reductions {{it is crucial}} to use a test cycle that reflects real-world driving style. It was discovered that vehicle manufacturers would optimise emissions performance only during the test cycle, whilst emissions from typical driving conditions proved to be much higher than tested. Some manufacturers were also found to use so-called defeat devices where the engine control system would recognise that the vehicle was being tested, and would automatically switch to a mode optimised for emissions performance. The use of a <b>defeat</b> <b>device</b> is expressly forbidden in EU law.|$|E
2500|$|Environment: US {{authorities}} {{announce that}} German vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen had fraudulently installed ECU software designed to circumvent environmental regulations on emissions of NOx. United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said Volkswagen had {{for almost a}} year been denying that it deliberately gamed emissions testing, by suggesting that the discrepancies were caused by [...] "technical" [...] reasons. Questions have been raised about methods and accuracy of emission controls within the European Union and also if other European car-manufacturers had resorted to similar malpractice. Richard Corey, the executive officer of California Air Resources Board, revealed how they detected the scam: [...] "We conducted a series of tests that allowed us to expose the <b>defeat</b> <b>device.</b> There were some testing outfits in Europe that had conducted some tests that got our attention." [...] The scandal has been disastrous for Germany's image in export markets and comes {{in the run-up to the}} 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference scheduled to be held in Paris from 30 November to 11 December 2015.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2014, the EPA {{was first}} alerted {{to the issue}} by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), {{reporting}} results of research commissioned for them by West Virginia University's Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines and Emissions (CAFEE). After 15 months of denying the emissions control systems were deliberately gamed and instead claiming discrepancies due to [...] "technical" [...] reasons, on August 21 Volkswagen acknowledged to the EPA and California Air Resources Board (CARB) their emission controls systems were rigged. This {{was followed by a}} formal announcement of admission to regulators on September 3 which took place immediately after the EPA threatened to withhold approval for their 2016 cars. Volkswagen's initial public response came on 20 September, when a spokesman said they would stop all US sales of the diesel models affected. Chairman Martin Winterkorn issued an apology and said Volkswagen would cooperate with investigators. Since emission standards in Canada are close to those in the US, Volkswagen Canada also halted sales of the affected diesel models. on 22 September 2015, Volkswagen spokesman admitted that the <b>defeat</b> <b>device</b> is installed in ~11 million vehicles with Type EA 189 diesel engines worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 September 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said {{beginning}} in 2008 the automaker improperly installed {{engine control unit}} (ECU) software determined to be a [...] "defeat device", {{in violation of the}} Clean Air Act to circumvent environmental regulations of NOx emissions by diesel engine 2009-2015 model year Volkswagen and Audi cars. The software detects when the cars were being subject to emissions testing, and then fully enabled ECU emission controls to successfully pass. However, during normal driving conditions, emission control software was shut off in order to attain greater fuel economy and additional power, resulting in as much as 40 times more pollution than allowed by law. Consumer Reports tested a 2011 Jetta SportWagen TDI and found in emissions mode its 0-60mph time increased by 0.6 seconds and its highway fuel economy dropped from 50 mpg to 46 mpg. Volkswagen admitted to using the <b>defeat</b> <b>device,</b> and has been ordered to recall approximately 482,000 cars with four-cylinder 2.0-liter TDI engines. United States federal penalties may include fines ranging up to US$18billion, and possibly criminal charges. On June 28, 2016, Volkswagen agreed to pay a settlement of $15.3 billion, the largest auto-related consumer class-action lawsuit in the United States history.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{high-profile}} {{corporate scandals}} have exposed failures in Corporate Social Responsibility [...] (CSR) wherein large conglomerates based within the European Union have manipulated and illegally bypassed health, safety, environmental or financial regulations. The 2013 meat adulteration scandal, Libor fixing scandal and 2008 Siemens bribery scandal {{are examples of}} recent scandals involving unethical business practices by European multinational corporations which have inveigled unsuspecting customers. In March 2015, Finnwatch a NGO based in Finland accused Finnish multinational engineering company Wärtsilä of suspect labour practices which included paying workers subsistence minimum wage salaries which are barely enough to live on. Human rights groups and the International Labour Organization have been deeply critical {{of the use of}} forced labour provided by the military junta {{in the construction of the}} Yadana natural gas pipeline by the French oil giant Total S.A. in Myanmar. In September 2015, US investigators revealed that German car-maker Volkswagen had illegally installed [...] "defeat devices" [...] in vehicles with the aim of cheating pollution control lab tests on cars that in reality emitted between 10 and 40 times the US emissions standard. [...] "Using a <b>defeat</b> <b>device</b> in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health," [...] said Cynthia Giles, the assistant administrator for enforcement at US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of the Center of Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen said: [...] "This disaster is beyond all expectations,". According to US law firm Hagens Berman who has launched a class-action suit against Volkswagen: [...] "While Volkswagen tells consumers that its diesel cars meet emissions standards, vehicle owners are duped into paying for vehicles that do not meet this standard and unknowingly pay more for quality they never receive,".|$|E

The West Virginia scientists {{did not identify}} the <b>defeat</b> <b>device,</b> but they reported their findings in a study they presented directly to the EPA and CARB in May 2014. Colorado's RapidScreen real-world emissions test data reinforced the suspected abnormally high emissions levels. After a year-long investigation, an international team of investigators identified the <b>defeat</b> <b>device</b> {{as a piece of}} code labelled [...] "acoustic condition" [...] which activated emissions-curbing systems when the car's computer identified it was undergoing a test.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2016 {{documents}} {{leaked to}} the press indicated that European Commission officials had been warned in 2010 by their in-house science team {{that at least one}} car manufacturer was possibly using a NOx-related <b>defeat</b> <b>device</b> in order to bypass emission regulation. Kathleen Van Brempt, the chair of the EU inquiry into the scandal, found the documents [...] "shocking" [...] and suggested that they raised serious concerns with regard to the future of commission officials: [...] "These documents show that there has been an astonishing collective blindness to the <b>defeat</b> <b>device</b> issue in the European commission, as well as in other EU institutions".|$|E

5000|$|Sensors and {{electronic}} components in modern light-duty vehicles {{are capable of}} 'detecting' the start of an emissions test in the laboratory (e.g., based on acceleration sensors or not-driven/not-rotating wheels).

While the use of <b>defeat</b> <b>devices</b> is generally prohibited, exceptions exist in cases where it is necessary to protect the engine against damage and to ensure safe vehicle operation (EC, 2007).
