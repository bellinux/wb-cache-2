40|$|Results: Pathologic upstaging {{occurred}} in 42 % of patients, and pathologic downstaging {{occurred in}} 22 %. Forty {{percent of patients}} with non-muscle-invasive clinical stage had muscle-invasive pathologic stage. Thirty-six percent of patients with organ-confined clinical stage had non-organ-confined pathologic stage (> or = pT 3 N 0 or pTanyN-positive). Patients with higher clinical stage {{were more likely to}} be upstaged to non-organ-confined disease (p < 0. 001). Patients were stratified into three groups: pathologically upstaged, same clinical and pathologic stage, and pathologically downstaged. When adjusted for the effects of standard postoperative features, upstaged patients were at a significantly higher risk of disease recurrence and bladder cancer-specific death than patients who had the same pathologic and clinical stage, who in turn were at significantly higher risk than downstaged patients. This observation remained true within each clinical stage strata. Within each pathologic stage strata, clinical stage did not substratify into different risk groups.

40|$|This paper aims at {{examining}} the practical use of valuation models by European biotechnology analysts. The study {{is based on}} a self-administered questionnaire with 39 sell-side analysts, and is complemented with semi-structured face-to-face interviews. We find that most professional analysts prefer the risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV) model. The main reasons to the popularity of the rNPV model seem to be <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> both client-driven preferences and the ability of the analyst not to be restricted in changing its forecasts. We also find evidence, using a non linear variant of the Principal Components Analysis, of four ways of valuing biotechnology firms. These variations in valuation models seems to some extent be <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> the maturity <b>stage</b> of the company, but also by preferences of the users (analysts). The preferences of the users become even more apparent when analysts determine critical input parameters to the valuation models. Some of these clearly deviate from what classical financial theory suggests.

40|$|Comparison of stratigraphic, faunal, and paleomagnetic {{characteristics}} of the Stikine terrane of British Columbia with other terranes in the Cordilleran collage reveals broad similarities {{with a group of}} terranes that formed a volcanic belt marginal to North America in Paleozoic and early Mesozoic time.

In the Columbia embayment region, the marginal volcanic and melange belts are missing, and rocks of the outermost major component of the collage, the Wrangellia superterrane, are juxtaposed directly against cratonic rocks.

40|$|Advances in {{semiconductor}} fabrication {{have enabled}} the shrinking of digital systems {{dramatically over the}} years. Although digital circuitry benefits tremendously from the constant shrinking of the device sizes, the benefits for analog circuits are not quite so dramatic. Low power is of critical importance in all mobile devices. Any reduction in power in the embedded analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in such devices can help prolong the battery life. A technique is proposed {{that can be used}} to reduce power dissipation in ADCs that use switched-capacitor gain stages. It is shown for a pipeline ADC that the signal charge stored across the feedback capacitor from the first stage can be reused in the second stage at the end of the first stage 2 ̆ 7 s amplify phase. The extra overhead of an extra capacitor is justified by the power savings of the proposed scheme;A well known approach for reducing the power dissipation in pipelined ADCs is the scaling down of capacitors progressively down the pipeline stream. The proposed technique combines the scaling of the capacitors with charge reuse. This combination inherits the power saving benefits of capacitor scaling and adds to the power saving by sharing the capacitor in two consecutive stages. Due to the highest power budget allocated to the first two stages, the sharing 2 is limited to the first two stages. Additionally, it is shown that the charge reuse results in reducing the total capacitive load <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> a <b>stage</b> 2 ̆ 7 s opamp, potentially reducing the current requirements of the opamp;The proposed technique has been adapted for use in cyclic ADCs.

30|$|The cell's activities, such as mitosis, morphogenesis, cell orientation, cell motility, and survival, {{depend on}} the {{attachment}} to the extracellular matrix or neighboring cells. Characterization of adhesion strength at the single cell level provides an effective approach to elucidate these activates. Micropipette aspiration is one traditional technique for cell-cell adhesion study [48]. In this method, two aspiration pipettes are assembled on two micromanipulators. Then, the pipettes are used to handle and separate two single cells <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> the micromanipulator. In this process, the cell-cell adhesion strength can be calculated from the suction pressure applied through the pipette. The AFM system is another powerful system for the single-cell-adhesion characterization, which enables to measure the cell-substrate or the cell-cell adhesion force. For example, one common method {{is to put the}} cell on the AFM sample stage, which is taken as the micromanipulator (x-y-z). Then, the cell is moved against the AFM cantilever <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> the <b>stage,</b> and the adhesion strength can be measured from the deflection of the AFM cantilever [49]. Puech reports a method to measure the cell-cell adhesion strength [50],[51]. Here, one cell is immobilized on a modified AFM cantilever tip by chemical glue. Then, the adhesion force between this cell and the other cell on AFM sample <b>stage</b> is obtained <b>by</b> separating these two cells. The AFM system also allows the measurement of the adhesive molecules on the cell membrane [52],[53]. Comparing with the aspiration pipette, the AFM system has the advantages of higher positioning accuracy and higher force resolution. However, one drawback is that the manipulation depends on the movement of the AFM sample stage, which is not as flexible as end-effector manipulators. Another issue is that the AFM system cannot scan the sample to get a high resolution image during the characterization process. Environmental SEM (ESEM) is one special type of SEM that can maintain a wet environment within the sample chamber, which provides a novel platform for single cell analysis. Shen reports a single-cell-adhesion study system based on the nanorobotic manipulation system inside ESEM, which can measure both the cell-cell adhesion and cell-substrate adhesion strength [45],[54]-[56]. This manipulation system has seven DOFs in total and has the positioning resolution approximately 30  nm. More important, this system allows the real-time imaging at nanometer resolution during the manipulation and characterization. These features could provide more information in the characterization process, which could benefit the dynamic single cell study in the future.|$|R
