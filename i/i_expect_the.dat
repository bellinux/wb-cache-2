500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put your finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E
2500|$|... {{stated that}} the article was [...] "Sound, original, and of interest. With {{revisions}} <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> paper to be suitable for publication." [...] The paper was accepted by the journal seven months later.|$|E
2500|$|Early in July 2013, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmström, {{wrote to}} two U.S. {{officials}} that [...] "mutual {{trust and confidence}} have been seriously eroded and <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> U.S. {{to do all that}} it can to restore them".|$|E
60|$|In a word, {{it never}} {{lightened}} or thundered, but <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>the</b> next flash would penetrate my vitals, and melt the sword (soul) in this scabbard of flesh; it never blew {{a storm of}} wind, but <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>the</b> fall of some stack of chimneys, or {{some part of the}} house, would bury me in its ruins; and so of other things.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>the</b> Story Girl would {{overwhelm}} {{him with}} scorn and indignation. But {{she took it}} very coolly.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} pause. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>the</b> man, whoever he might be, to run, {{but he held}} his ground. Indeed, he edged forward.|$|R
2500|$|They {{acknowledge}} {{the inspiration of}} 1970s punk groups and The Sharp. Billboards review of Roll On described their sound as [...] "Aussie punkabilly", while the group's lyrics show a [...] "socially progressive attitude, discussing prejudice, racism, and political conflict" [...] The Worldwide Home of Australasian Music and More Online website reviewed their early releases, with The Living End described as [...] "anthemic and attitudinous brand of rockabilly-meets-punk (circa Clash not SoCal)"; Roll On had them as [...] "kings of rockapunkerbilly"; for Modern Artillery Cheney's lyrics were lauded with [...] "every time <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> quality to wane, a new level is reached" [...] and the band itself showed that [...] "Nobody plays nitro-powered punkabilly faster or tighter than this combo and Modern Artillery represents the band's finest hour". However Allmusic's Johnny Loftus found that album showed that the [...] "bawdy gang vocals of 2001's Roll On {{have been replaced by}} sculpted multi-tracking ... guitars punch mightily, and the choruses detonate, but they do in colors easily identifiable to a throng of American baby punks with silver safety pins in their mouths".|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{rather more}} than <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>The</b> lad {{must have done}} his share, but {{it might have been}} better if you had started him at {{something}} easier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "I {{can hear}} the river, though it doesn't seem to be quite where <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>The</b> others {{will be on the}} beach by now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, but this, you see, was a straits, Master Ruthven, just {{a narrow}} straits, and <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> creatures {{took it for}} a river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Carrie, [...] "that's good news! You {{can trust}} Martin. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> company has {{straightened}} {{up because they}} made him a director." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What the dickens {{does that}} matter?" [...] Julian objected. [...] "It's the doctor we want. The dyke's flooded, and <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> {{supports}} gave way." ...|$|E
60|$|Dolly {{was carried}} off immediately, as <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>The</b> doctor and Worthington and Fitzhugh were already there, and waiting. I stood by Mr. Carvel's chair, {{receiving}} the guests, and presently came Mr. Swain and Patty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Luce--we've done it!" [...] he said. [...] "Yes--the {{thing is}} as <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>The</b> spell, that <b>I</b> foresaw might be worked, has worked. She's done it, and done it well. Where is she--Grace, I mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hemlock Jim {{deliberately}} {{set down}} his tray, the Ontario bushman seemed gathering himself together for some purpose, {{and there was an}} ominous glitter in Johnston's eyes, while just as <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>the</b> fray to begin, the proprietor called out laughingly: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think he}} had. He bought some shares {{that have gone}} down sharply, and since he's a bank-clerk <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> loss is a serious thing for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} of you!" [...] said the young man. [...] "I had a {{different}} plan. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>the</b> servant would take in my card, and that you would put your heads together, before admitting me, and make out my identity." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was three}} days ago, and I have not {{tried to see}} her again. I have written her a line, to say that I shall not forget her, and to take the blame upon myself. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>the</b> {{impossible}} of her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, but I'm afraid I can't {{stay here}} {{as long as}} <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>The</b> steamer's in Loch Ryan. We went in to make some repairs after a {{hammering}} we got. Now, perhaps we had better join the others." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I haven't engaged any yet," [...] he answered. [...] "Don't look so startled. I {{can arrange}} it {{directly}} we're off. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> sailing lists will be looked through pretty carefully." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{handbook}} {{reviews the}} most recent and state-of-the-art advances in transportation eco-nomics. The 37 papers by the leading {{experts in the field}} cover the most important policy is-sues in all transport sectors. The papers are grouped into five parts. Of course <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>the</b> papers in each part to share a common theme, and the five themes together to cover the scope of research in transportation economics. As the volume is a handbook, <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>the</b> papers to review current research topics, recent advances in research methodologies and theories that are relevant to the topics, and {{the most recent}} findings. With such an expectation in mind, I will review the book part by part, and also discuss the current status of transportation economics research...|$|R
