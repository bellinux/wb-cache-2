40|$|New pressure-swing {{adsorption}} (PSA) {{processes and}} PSA hybrids are developed for several commercially relevant gas separations. The Combination Cycles and Cycling-Zone Pressure-Swing Adsorption (CZPSA), respectively, use feed purge to supplement and replace product purge and are high recovery {{alternatives to the}} Skarstrom Cycle when lower product purities are acceptable. For air separation, the Skarstrom Cycle produces ∼ 88 % O 2 with pressurized O 2 recovery of ∼ 44 % while CZPSA produces ∼ 72 % O 2 with pressurized O 2 recovery of 75 % at the same productivity. To achieve high purity O 2 and N 2, CZPSA is coupled with cryogenic distillation to form a hybrid air separation process. By removing excess N 2, the CZPSA unit decreases the size of downstream equipment, thereby decreasing costs. When capital costs dominate, placing the CZPSA unit after the main air compressor (MAC) in a hybrid air separation plant reduces capital cost by up to ∼ 27 %, but power increases by ∼ 16 %. When both capital and operating costs dominate, placing the CZPSA unit before the MAC reduces operating cost by up to ∼ 7 % and capital costs by up to ∼ 9 %. An existing 1000 mtpd air separation plant can be retrofitted with a pre-MAC CZPSA unit to increase the plant capacity by ∼ 12 % with a 6 % increase in incremental capital costs and a 55 % increase in <b>incremental</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> For dilute binary gas separation, hybrid SMB/PSA processes are developed by combining stripping-type PSA with a gas-phase SMB. As conceived, SMB/PSA has two advantages: low pressure purge and internal desorbent generation. For the two-zone, two-train SMB/PSA process, binary separation of enflurane into its 99 % pure R- and S-enantiomers is achieved at D/F ∼ 15. 0; the gas-phase SMB achieves this with D/F ∼ 54. 0. Stripping- and rectifying-type PSA typically {{are not used to}} achieve complete binary separation because of low productivities. The gas-phase SMB is combined with these processes to achieve binary separation of a concentrated feed of H 2 and CH 4 with zeolite 5 A. An eight-bed combination of stripping- and rectifying- type SMB/PSA processes produces 99. 99 % H 2 with 99. 6 % H 2 recovery and 99 % CH 4 with 99. 9 % CH 4 recovery with productivity of 9. 37 E- 5 mol/kg-s and an energy requirement of 260. 9 kJ/mol. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} feasibilities of geologic CO 2 sequestration and stakeholder {{acceptance of}} the technology must account for the risk of leakage from the target formation. The standard approach to geologic sequestration assumes that CO 2 will be injected as a bulk phase. In this approach, the primary driver for leakage is the buoyancy of CO 2 under typical deep conditions (depths> 800 m). An alternative approach is to dissolve the CO 2 into brine at the surface, then inject the saturated brine into deep subsurface formations. The CO 2 -laden brine is slightly denser than brine containing no CO 2, so ensuring the complete dissolution of all CO 2 into brine at the surface prior to injection will eliminate the risk of buoyancy-driven leakage. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of dissolution of CO 2 in surface facilities and injection of the saturated brine. We compute the incremental cost of the additional processes and facilities relative to injecting bulk phase CO 2. We also estimate the power requirements to determine the <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> The <b>incremental</b> capital and <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> {{can be regarded as}} the price of this form of risk reduction. A full cost-benefit assessment requires an estimate of the cost of long-term monitoring for leakage. Such an estimate {{is beyond the scope of}} this study...|$|R

40|$|Consumption of raw or lightly cooked alfalfa sprouts {{has been}} a concern of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in recent years due to {{connections}} between sprouts and foodborne illnesses. Researchers have identified, contaminated seeds as {{the primary source of}} alfalfa sprouts contamination. Contamination of alfalfa seeds can originate in the field, harvesting, storing, or sprouting. Two pathogens of particular concern on alfalfa seeds are Escherichia coli 0157 :H 7 (E. coli) and Salmonella. These pathogens are capable of producing biofilms that provide protection for individual cells and allow for survival in otherwise hostile environments, including some disinfectant washes. Other factors that contribute to contamination are the crevices of the seed surface, which provide opportunities for the protection of organisms. Various disinfection options have been evaluated and the use of a 20, 000 ppm calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl) 2)) solution is the most effective disinfectant for satisfying the requirements of Task 2. Continued outbreaks of food poisoning indicate current disinfecting procedures are inadequate. In an effort to improve disinfection procedures, three bench scale apparatuses were constructed and tested to provide options for the commercial range of seed sanitation rates (from about 75 to 600 lb/week). Experiments were conducted to determine the disinfecting effectiveness of the apparatuses, as well as the current sanitization practices in industry. Experiments included dye removal tests where non-uniform dye removal indicated ineffective contacting. Similar experiments were performed using E. coli inoculating and post-contacting culturing. One bench scale apparatus constructed was a model of the rotary drums widely used in industry. After a 30 minute treatment in the rotary drum, the seeds were found to be free of dye, indicating good contacting. The seeds were also sprouted showing sanitation did not damage the seeds. However, due to the capital expense of 14, 000, the drum is not a viable option for small-scale sprout producers. For sprout growers who currently own rotary drums, drum use is recommended for seed sanitation. Another bench scale apparatus was designed to improve the current industry practice of hand dunking seed-filled mesh draw-string bags. Through experimentation, it was determined. the current hand dunking procedure, with little or no agitation, produces inadequate, non-uniform contact of the seeds and sanitizer. Therefore, the hand dunking procedure was modified to include agitation to effectively suspend the seeds throughout the bag to obtain good contact of the sanitizer solution with the seeds. The agitation-in-bag method is recommended for use in small volume sprout facilities, which currently employ the hand dunking procedure for sanitizing. A modest investment of 113 is needed to implement the agitation-in-bag sanitizing method. Since no additional <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> are accrued in implementation, no incremental costs are required. Finally, an auger system was designed to sanitize one ton per hour of alfalfa seeds. The one ton per hour rate exceeds the demand of any individual sprout producer. Thus, the auger system is applicable to a partnership of sprout growers. Individual sprout growers within the mung bean industry, with much larger production volumes than the alfalfa industry, could economically use the auger system. However, the auger system can be scaled to sanitize any feed rate. A 1 3 / 82 ̆ 2 diameter, 42 ̆ 7 long auger bench scale model was constructed and tested at 4. 5 lbs/hr rate with a contact time of 15 minutes. Scale-up of this bench scale sanitizer to a 2000 lb/hr rate requires a 162 ̆ 2 diameter by 202 ̆ 7 auger. The entire full-scale sanitizing system, which includes a vibrating screen washer, will handle 5, 000, 000 lb/yr of seeds, operating 8 2 ̆ 7 hr/day, with a capital investment of 227, 000 and an <b>incremental</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> (primarily labor) of 214, 000 /yr...|$|R
