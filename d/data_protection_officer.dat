5000|$|In the [...] "supervisory" [...] {{role the}} EDPS' core {{task is to}} monitor the {{processing}} of personal data in European institutions and bodies. The EDPS does so in cooperation with the <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>officers</b> (DPO) present in each European institution and body. The DPO has to notify the EDPS about any processing operations involving sensitive personal data or likely to pose other specific risks. The EDPS then analyses this processing in relation to the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Regulation and issues a [...] "prior check" [...] opinion.

3000|$|We find it {{interesting}} that the Norwegian <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Authority uses the phrase ‘best insurance’ in their 2013 report Big Data - privacy principles under pressure. Risk minimisation is {{the word of the}} day now as industry and public organisations alike for some time, under threats of heavy fines, have prepared for compliance with GDPR, setting up accountability systems, documenting what information one holds, assigning <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>officers,</b> and taking other organisational measures. However, risk management is a different strategy than invoking rights, and such a strategy certainly chooses the organisational perspective, as opposed to the individual perspective that comes with arguing from rights. So, what does it mean when the Norwegian <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Authority states as their primary recommendation {{to meet the challenges of}} big data: ‘consent [is] still the point of departure’ (Datatilsynet 2013)?

30|$|A comprehensive, {{detailed}} {{interpretation of}} the new GDPR {{is beyond the scope}} of the present publication. Several organisations such as the NHS European Office, the Wellcome Trust and the Westin Research Center have provided in-depth analyses [2 – 4], and guidelines based on the GDPR are currently being formulated by working groups with regard to specific topics and frequently asked questions, e.g. about <b>data</b> portability, <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>officers,</b> and other specific topics [5]. The GDPR is not specifically designed for health data, and interpretations for certain applications may differ. Associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors are encouraged to prepare codes of conduct, or amend or extend such codes, for the purpose of specifying the application of the GDPR (Article 40 / 2). The purpose of this publication is to summarise some important elements of the <b>protection</b> of digital <b>data</b> concerning health in the framework of the new GDPR, and to make radiologists aware of some key provisions of the new GDPR that should be taken into account in daily practice, clinical research and public health projects.|$|R

5000|$|The Bahamas has an {{official}} {{data protection law}} that protects the personal information of its citizens in both {{the private and public}} sector: Data Protection Act 2003 (the Bahamas Law). The Bahamas Law appoints a data protection commissioner to the Office of Data Protection to ensure that data protection is being held. Even though there is legislation enforced in the Bahamas through the Data Protection Act 2003, the act lacks many enforcements since a <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>officer</b> doesn't need to be in office nor does any group or organization need to notify the Office of Data Protection when a hacker has breached privacy law. Also, there are no requirements for registering databases or restricting data flow across national borders. Therefore, the legislation does not meet European Union standards, which was the goal of creating the law in the first place.|$|E

40|$|The {{reform of}} the EU’s {{personal}} data protection regulations introduces {{the institution of the}} <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Officer,</b> assigning it {{a key role in the}} new personal data protection system thereto. Regulation (EU) 2016 / 679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95 / 46 /EC, builds the personal data protection model, wherein the main responsibility for adequate assessment of the risk associated with the processing of personal data and for the implementation of internal procedures to assure compliance of the referenced operations with the personal data protection regulations rests with a database administrator. Simultaneously, a database administrator should be capable of proving that he/she has duly met the requirements under the regulations, thus following the crucial rule for the processing of personal data, i. e. data accountability. The EU regulations describe the means and mechanisms to be used by a data processor to a lesser extent than those in force hitherto, focusing more on ensuring the standard of the protection of individual rights through data controllers' ethical and responsible activities. The key part in the new personal data protection model will be played by the institution of the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Officer,</b> intended to become a real guarantor of due observance of the personal data protection regulations. In this context, the appointment of the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Officer</b> by database administrators, not bound to do so by law, should be judged a sign of the organization's corporate social responsibility for the impact of its decisions and activities on society through transparent and ethical conduct. It is therefore essential to emphasize the important function to be performed, the authority to be had, and the necessary preparatory action to be taken by the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Officer</b> to that effect. The new regulations should be regarded as a chance to professionalize both the individuals, serving as information security officers and, in the near future, the data controllers, as well as the entire occupational group.

30|$|Personal {{data breach}} means {{a breach of}} {{security}} leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. In addition to the obligations to communicate a personal data breach to the data subject, data breaches must be notified within 72  h to the supervisory authority. Larger institutions as defined in the legislation should designate a <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>officer.</b> Where breaches are not notified in situations where derogations exist, records {{still need to be}} kept.

30|$|Key {{elements}} of the new regulation include, for example: the need for clear and affirmative consent by the data subject concerned, destruction of data if storage is no longer necessary for the initial purpose or after withdrawal of consent by the data subject (‘the right to be forgotten’); the right to obtain rectification of his/her personal data; {{the right of the}} data subject to transfer personal data to another service provider (‘data portability’); the right of the data subject to be informed when his/her data have been hacked. The new GDPR implies that all organisations processing personal data must be able to prove that they comply with the rules. It also proposes a European Data Protection Board and requires institutions which process certain types or volumes of data to have a designated <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>officer</b> (DPO), who is in contact with the national data protection authorities. The legislation also specifies that ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’ penalties or financial fines may apply in the case of non-compliance with the data protection rules.|$|E

Included were only those patients treated with extracorporeal lung assist devices, i.e., veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) or pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (pECLA) for more than 2  days. Excluded were patients who underwent VV-ECMO/pECLA for less than 2  days. ARDS treatment followed our local SOPs describing differential indications and duration of advanced therapeutic interventions following specified response criteria as published previously [11]. In short, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (pECLA) was used as rescue therapy for severely hypoxemic and/or hypercapnic patients, when conservative treatment strategies such as prone positioning or inhalation of nitric oxide (NO) fail to improve the situation.

40|$|Zurich is {{the largest}} Swiss city with {{approximately}} 400, 000 inhabitants and an annual public procurement budget of over  1. 6 billion. Sustainability has been a specific target on the City's political agenda since 1998. In 2008, the City's Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP) policy was introduced, and since its introduction, Zurich has successfully carried out many SPP procedures. For example, in 2009, the City conducted a successful pilot {{which led to the}} procurement of 100 % organic cotton shirts for the City's police force. The ZOOM (Zurich Optimised Output Management) concept was first launched in 2008 as part of the City's IT strategy, which saw the introduction of standardised multifunctional devices in the municipal workplace. The location and specification of multifunctional devices was outlined through the ZOOM concept to maximise efficiency. Overall, the ZOOM concept estimated significant annual savings for the City. In order to deliver even greater financial and environmental savings, in 2012 the Organisation and Informatics Department (OIZ) of the City of Zurich took the ZOOM concept a step further when they decided to switch from buying (or renting) machines to procuring an optimised Output Management Service from an external provider. As part of this procurement procedure, the devices were no longer the focus but rather the services (i. e. printing, copying, scanning, etc.). The City now only pays per printed page and no longer invests in hardware. Both the ZOOM concept and this procurement were prepared by the OIZ together with the IT Conference Members, the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Officer,</b> and the Environmental and Health Departments...|$|E
