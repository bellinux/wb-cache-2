50|$|The <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> was {{initially}} developed to detect analytically defined shapes (e.g., line, circle, ellipse etc.). In these cases, we have {{knowledge of the}} shape and aim to find out its location and orientation in the image. The Generalized <b>Hough</b> <b>Transform</b> (GHT), introduced by Dana H. Ballard in 1981, is the modification of the <b>Hough</b> <b>Transform</b> using the principle of template matching. This modification enables the <b>Hough</b> <b>Transform</b> {{to be used for}} not only the detection of an object described with an analytic function. Instead, it {{can also be used to}} detect an arbitrary object described with its model.|$|E
5000|$|The {{classical}} <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> {{was concerned}} with the identification of lines in the image, but later the <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> has been extended to identifying positions of arbitrary shapes, most commonly circles or ellipses. The <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> as it is universally used today was invented by Richard Duda and Peter Hart in 1972, who called it a [...] "generalized Hough transform" [...] after the related 1962 patent of Paul Hough. The transform was popularized in the computer vision community by Dana H. Ballard through a 1981 journal article titled [...] "Generalizing the <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> to detect arbitrary shapes".|$|E
50|$|The circle <b>Hough</b> <b>Transform</b> (CHT) {{is a basic}} {{technique}} used in Digital Image Processing, for detecting circular objects in a digital image.The circle <b>Hough</b> <b>Transform</b> (CHT) is a feature extraction technique for detecting circles. It is a specialization of <b>Hough</b> <b>Transform.</b> The purpose of the technique is to find circles in imperfect image inputs. The circle candidates are produced by “voting” in the Hough parameter space and then select the local maxima in a so-called accumulator matrix.|$|E

It includes linear, circular and other analytical curves. Using HT, extraction of basic curves is possible. In a separate section, the application of different <b>Hough</b> <b>Transforms</b> is investigated. Experimental results show the efficiency of proposed method.

30|$|In {{the next}} section, <b>Hough</b> <b>transforms</b> and {{multiscale}} derivatives are put {{together to form}} an effective framework for line and circle detection.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{much of the}} {{efficiency}} of the <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> is dependent {{on the quality of the}} input data: the edges must be detected well for the <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> to be efficient. Use of the <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> on noisy images is a very delicate matter and generally, a denoising stage must be used before. In the case where the image is corrupted by speckle, as is the case in radar images, the Radon transform is sometimes preferred to detect lines, because it attenuates the noise through summation.|$|E

5000|$|Hough {{transforms}} are {{techniques for}} object detection, a critical step in many implementations of computer vision, or data mining from images. Specifically, the Randomized <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> is a probabilistic variant {{to the classical}} <b>Hough</b> <b>transform,</b> and is commonly used to detect curves (straight line, circle, ellipse, etc.) The basic idea of <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> (HT) is to implement a voting procedure for all potential curves in the image, and at the termination of the algorithm, curves that do exist in the image will have relatively high voting scores. Randomized <b>Hough</b> <b>transform</b> (RHT) is different from HT in that it tries to avoid conducting the computationally expensive voting process for every nonzero pixel in the image {{by taking advantage of}} the geometric properties of analytical curves, and thus improve the time efficiency and reduce the storage requirement of the original algorithm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{technique}} for automatic face recognition using integrated peaks of the <b>Hough</b> <b>transformed</b> significant blocks of the binary gradient image. In this approach firstly the gradient of an image is calculated and a threshold is set to obtain a binary gradient image, which is less sensitive to noise and illumination changes. Secondly, significant blocks are extracted from the absolute gradient image, to extract pertinent information {{with the idea of}} dimension reduction. Finally the best fitted Hough peaks are extracted from the <b>Hough</b> <b>transformed</b> significant blocks for efficient face recognition. Then these Hough peaks are concatenated together, which are used as feature in classification process. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the experiment on 1100 images from the FRAV 2 D face database, 2200 images from the FERET database, where the images vary in pose, expression, illumination and scale and 400 images from the ORL face database, where the images slightly vary in pose. Our method has shown 93. 3 %, 88. 5 % and 99 % recognition accuracy for the FRAV 2 D, FERET and the ORL database respectively.

30|$|We have {{presented}} in this paper a unified framework for computing dense <b>Hough</b> <b>transforms</b> directly from the greyscale images, without reducing the support to contour or interest points. By being independent {{on the quality of the}} contours or any other pre-processing step, the voting process is less sensitive to image perturbations. By allowing all the pixels to vote, it is more statistically significant. The weight of the vote can be softly adjusted by using the significance of the contrast or the curvature, provided by the gradient magnitude or the Frobenius norm of the Hessian matrix.|$|R
