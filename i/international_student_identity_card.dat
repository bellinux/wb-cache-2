5000|$|Following World War II and the Cold War, the Western {{world was}} focused on mutual {{cooperation}} and understanding {{in order to prevent}} a resurgence of fascism. This atmosphere gave impetus for student organisations to form, with the aim of working together for peace and cooperation throughout the world. One such student organisation, the International Student Conference (ISC) held their 3rd ISC at the Studenterforeningen’s Hus in Copenhagen. It was attended by National Unions of Students and Coordinating Secretariat of National Unions of Students (COSEC), Denmark, amongst others. The attending student organisations made the decision to establish a single international identity document valid for the perceived need of travel concessions. This is the first documented mention of the <b>International</b> <b>Student</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Card</b> (ISIC).Representatives of the ISC were also representatives of the International Student Travel Conference (ISTC). At the 4th International Student Travel Conference (ISTC), and following the decision made at the 3rd International Student Conference (ISC), the Norwegian and Netherlands Union of Students, in co-operation with COSEC, presented a document based on a Survey of the Council of Europe. The document concluded that the formation of an international student card would be of benefit to students while travelling. The Norwegian and Netherlands Union of Students, in co-operation with COSEC accepted responsibility to form a Travel Aids Commission and “take the necessary steps to ensure that an <b>International</b> <b>Student</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Card</b> be made available as soon as possible in as large {{a part of the world}} as possible”. [...] Thus, the <b>International</b> <b>Student</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Card</b> was founded with the aim to provide students worldwide with access to student facilities, wherever they travelled. It was agreed that the real value of the card would prove that the holder was a “bona fide” student. [...] The first ISIC cards were produced by the Travel Aids Commission managed by the ISTC. 56,000 cards were issued amongst 31 countries in the first year.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of smart}} cards and {{supporting}} devices {{to support the}} reform of urban public transportation does not stop at the ticket machine alone, {{as it has been}} successfully developed for the bus transit system Trans Jogja. The development is also aimed for the use of Prambanan Express train and Trans Batik Solo bus services, resulting in the integration of the three modes using a single smart card ticket. The smart card system needs to be improved so that the <b>Student</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Card</b> of Gadjah Mada University is accepted and {{can be used as a}} smart card for the bus and train services. For short-term period, this study aimed to estimate the number of students who will use the <b>Student</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Card</b> to buy Trans Jogja bus tickets, while for long-term period the results of this study can be used to provide direction for the development of Trans Jogja bus routes in the future. Survey was conducted through interviews with 500 students of Gadjah Mada University. The results indicate that there is a significant number of students who will use the bus service of Trans Jogja system, amounting to 890 people. For long-term period, the results suggest that the bus route development, based on the potential demand, should reach the north area of the Gadjah Mada University campus...|$|R

With this, the students and staff can keep track of their attendance in a much easier and simpler manner and thus reducing the manual paper work.|$|R
