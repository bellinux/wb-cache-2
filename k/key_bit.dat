40|$|The {{block cipher}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} primitives in modern cryptography, information and network security; one of the primary purposes of such ciphers is to provide confidentiality for data transmitted in insecure communication environments. To ensure that confidentiality is robustly provided, it is essential to investigate the security of a block cipher against a variety of cryptanalytic attacks. In this thesis, we propose a new extension of differential cryptanalysis, which we call the impossible boomerang attack. We describe the early abort technique for (related-key) impossible differential cryptanalysis and rectangle attacks. Finally, we analyse the security of a number of block ciphers that are currently being widely used or have recently been proposed for use in emerging cryptographic applications; our main cryptanalytic results are as follows. An impossible differential attack on 7 -round AES when used with 128 or 192 <b>key</b> <b>bits,</b> and an impossible differential attack on 8 -round AES when used with 256 <b>key</b> <b>bits.</b> An impossible boomerang attack on 6 -round AES when used with 128 <b>key</b> <b>bits,</b> and an impossible boomerang attack on 7 -round AES when used with 192 or 256 <b>key</b> <b>bits.</b> A related-key impossible boomerang attack on 8 -round AES when used with 192 <b>key</b> <b>bits,</b> and a related-key impossible boomerang attack on 9 -round AES when used with 256 <b>key</b> <b>bits,</b> both using two keys.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing a black-box symmetric cipher that leaks information subliminally and exclusively to the designer. We show how to construct a cipher which we call ‘Monkey’ that leaks one <b>key</b> <b>bit</b> per output block to the designer of the system (in any mode). This <b>key</b> <b>bit</b> is leaked only if a particular plaintext bit is known to the designer (known bit/message attack which is typically available in plain ASCII). The attack is of kleptographic nature as it gives a unique advantage to the designer while using strong (e. g., externally supplied) keys. The basic new difficulty with the design of spoofable block ciphers {{is that it is}} a deterministic function (previous attacks exploited randomness in key generation or message encryption/signature), and the fact that we do not want easy (statistical) observability of the spoofing (e. g., the variability of ciphertexts should be noticeable when keys change etc.). We distinguish between three entities: the designer, the reverse-engineer and the user. We show a design methodology that assures that: (1) if the device is not reverse-engineered, the attack is secure (namely, the cipher is good) and undetectable, (2) if the device is reverse-engineered, then the reverse-engineer learns at most one plaintext bit from every ciphertext (but no past/future keys), and (3) the designer learns one plaintext bit and one <b>key</b> <b>bit</b> from each ciphertext block (say in ECB mode). The method is therefore highly robust against reverse-engineering.

We find {{that there is a}} fundamental tradeoff between reliability and secrecy. We then explore this framework within the context of reciprocal wireless channels. In this setting, the users transmit pre-arranged excitation signals to each other. When the fading is Rayleigh, the observations of the users are jointly Gaussian sources. We show that an on-off excitation signal with an SNR-dependent duty cycle achieves the secret key capacity of this system. Furthermore, we characterize a fundamental metric [...] minimum energy per <b>key</b> <b>bit</b> for reliable key generation [...] and show that in contrast to conventional AWGN channels, there is a non-zero threshold SNR that achieves the minimum energy per <b>key</b> <b>bit.</b> The capacity achieving on-off excitation signal achieves the minimum energy per <b>key</b> <b>bit</b> at any SNR below the threshold.

40|$|We {{propose a}} rotationally-invariant quantum key {{distribution}} scheme that uses a pair of orthogonal qubit trines, realized as mixed states of three physical qubits. The measurement outcomes do not depend on how Alice and Bob choose their individual reference frames. The efficient key generation by two-way communication produces two independent raw <b>keys,</b> a <b>bit</b> <b>key</b> and a trit key. For a noiseless channel, Alice and Bob get a total of 0. 573 <b>key</b> <b>bits</b> per trine state sent (98...|$|R
