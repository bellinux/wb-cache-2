On his return, {{he found that the}} flock had not left the {{invisible}} boundary. This miracle may have taken place in a field near Chidham, which for centuries was known as ‘St Cuthman’s Field’ or ‘St Cuthman’s Dell.’ It was said that a large stone in the field, ‘on which the holy shepherd was in the habit of sitting,’ held miraculous properties.|$|E

[...] Willes played for Kent county cricket teams and was a fast underarm or, when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it, roundarm bowler.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{commencement}} address {{he delivered}} at Queens College on June 1, 2006, Hevesi told his audience that U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) was so tough he would [...] "put a bullet between the President's eyes if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it." [...] Several hours after his remarks, Hevesi apologized for his comments, calling them [...] " [...] beyond stupid, beyond moronic, totally offensive," [...] and [...] "incredibly moronic." ...|$|E

[...] "I have an idea that when first El Greco came to the city it was by such a night, and it made so vehement an {{impression}} upon him that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Calamity Jane : In the comic, Calamity Jane {{was an ugly}} {{old woman}} who lusted after Punaniska. Because of her appearance, Punaniska despised her, and did {{everything}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from her. However, like the real Calamity Jane, the character was good with a shotgun and had ways of getting her man.|$|R
2500|$|Angellica laments {{that no one}} {{has taken}} her up because of the high price, but when she learns of Don Pedro and Don Antonio, both of whom are rich, she decides to pursue them, then goes back inside. Pedro soon enters {{from one side of the}} stage, and Antonio enters from the other; both men are masked. [...] Antonio is also struck by Angellica's {{portrait}} and wonders out loud if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with sleeping with Angellica and still marry Florinda. At the mention of Florinda, Pedro recognises Antonio.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley Nowell and his sister, Kellie, {{were born}} and raised in the Belmont Shore {{neighborhood}} of Long Beach, California to Jim and Nancy Nowell. As a child, he enjoyed surfing and sailing, often participating in boat races. Nowell became a difficult child and was often hyperactive and disruptive; his mother recalled that he was [...] "very emotional, very sensitive, very artistic, but he was needy...He was always testing just to see what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with". After his parents' divorce when he was ten, Nowell's behavior worsened. His mother was awarded custody, but found him too difficult to control, and at the age of ten he moved in full-time with his father.|$|E
2500|$|Harrison {{returned}} to New York City. Having learned from Quigley what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with legally, Harrison struck {{out on his}} own with a series of non-pornographic [...] "cheesecake" [...] magazines. His first was Beauty Parade (1941–1956), started in October 1941. It contained, as its subtitle suggests ("The World's Loveliest Girls"), pictures of attractive models who had the [...] "girl-next-door" [...] look. Beauty Parade also began the photo-story format that would be repeated by other Harrison publications. Using the facilities of Quigley Publishing surreptitiously at night, Harrison used the photos from his Hollywood visit to paste together his galleries. When he was caught and fired on Christmas Eve, 1941, his sisters Edith and Helen rallied around him and raised several thousand dollars in capital, $400 of it from his favorite niece, Marjorie, who would later become a central figure in his most famous enterprise.|$|E
60|$|The Belgian nodded. He was {{thinking}} rapidly. If <b>he</b> <b>could</b> persuade Achmet Zek {{to send him}} {{in command of the}} party which took Lady Greystoke north it would give him the opportunity he craved to make his escape from his chief. He would forego a share of the gold, if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> but <b>get</b> <b>away</b> unscathed with the jewels.|$|R

60|$|A sudden {{desire for}} flight seized him. The clouds sank lower and lower, till he {{imagined}} he must bend {{his head to}} avoid them. If <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> <b>away</b> for a little, he might regain his calm. At least, absence, he thought bitterly, {{was the only way}} to restore the old affection between him and his father.|$|R
2500|$|Kelly {{also became}} famous for making unusual plays. He {{seems to have}} {{performed}} most just {{a few times and}} probably made a bigger mark with verbal trickery, while catcher or coacher at first or third base. Right after his death, his longtime captain-manager in Chicago, Cap Anson, said he was a [...] "genius" [...] as a coacher. [...] Apparently referring to Kelly's ability to distract opposing fielders, Anson said, [...] "Many a run has been scored through Kelly's trickiness. He was a rattling all-around man, but his cleverest work was done behind the plate [...] He was full of tricks and was never so happy as when playing a practical joke." [...] A year later, Anson said, [...] "Mike Kelly was the prince of base runners. I've never seen a man equal to him in that line, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with more sharp tricks than any man who ever wore a baseball uniform." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{learned from}} Quigley what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with legally, Harrison struck {{out on his}} own with a series of non-pornographic [...] "cheesecake" [...] magazines. His first was Beauty Parade (1941–1956), started in October 1941.

When he was caught and fired on Christmas Eve, 1941, his sisters Edith Tobias and Helen Studin rallied around him and raised several thousand dollars in capital, $400 of it from his favorite niece, Marjorie Tobias, who would later become a central figure in his most famous enterprise. Harrison had great success with Beauty Parade and five sister magazines, but their circulation declined in the post-war years. Harrison had a distaste for full nudity and refused to follow the trend of magazines such as Playboy. By early 1952 his accountant told him that he was broke.|$|E
2500|$|Under Winchell's sponsorship, Howard Rushmore {{became the}} chief {{editor of a}} New York scandal magazine, Confidential. Its publisher, Robert Harrison, began as an office boy and later writer for Bernarr McFadden's New York Graphic during the 1920s, an {{ancestor}} of the supermarket tabloids that would emerge in the 1960s. It was at the Graphic where the young Harrison first met Walter Winchell. As an adult Harrison was on the editorial staff of the Motion Picture Herald, a trade publication whose conservative Catholic owner, Martin Quigley, Sr., had {{close ties to the}} Hays Office. Having learned from Quigley what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with legally, Harrison struck out on his own with a series of non-pornographic [...] "cheesecake" [...] magazines. Supposedly inspired by the Kefauver Committee hearings, Harrison later launched a tabloid-style gossip magazine. It concentrated on exposing the substance abuse habits, criminal records and hidden political and sexual preferences of celebrities. Film historian Mary Desjardins described Confidentials editorial style as using [...] "research methods and writing techniques that recycled old stories or created 'composite' facts as the basis of new ones." [...] Robert Harrison himself described it thus: [...] "Once we establish the star in the hay and that's documented, we can say anything we want and I think we make them {{a hell of a lot}} more interesting than they really are. What's a guy gonna do, sue us and admit he was in the hay with the dame, but claim he didn't do all the other things we dress the story with?" [...] Before Rushmore's tenure at Confidential, Harrison published stories like “Is It True What They Say About Johnnie Ray?" [...] and [...] "Why Joe DiMaggio Is Striking Out with Marilyn Monroe!" [...] With [...] "Winchell Was Right About Josephine Baker!", Harrison came out in support of his childhood mentor at the Graphic during the Stork Club controversy. Though Harrison would publish non-show business stories involving [...] "racketeering, consumer scams and politicians' peccadilloes," [...] "exposés of star secrets" [...] became Confidentials prime focus.|$|E
60|$|Poor old gentleman! I {{am afraid}} he heard some irrepressible laughter, {{and it was}} very sore to him to be ridiculous. His grave dignity and politeness when he came down very late the next morning were {{something}} awful, and it must have been very dreadful to him that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>away</b> till half the day was over.|$|R
60|$|Hans {{did not get}} far, for a foot {{send him}} sprawling, {{and by the time}} he was again on his feet four masked cadets had him by the hands and arms, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>away.</b> <b>He</b> started to yell when of a sudden {{somebody}} threw a handful of dry flour into his wide open mouth.|$|R
5000|$|Sleight of hand: In {{concert with}} the rigged dealing box, the dealer <b>could,</b> when <b>he</b> knew the next card to win, surreptitiously slide a player's bet off of the winning card if {{it was on the}} dealer's side of the layout. At a hectic faro table <b>he</b> <b>could</b> often <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with this, though it was {{obviously}} a risky move.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away,</b> of course. Anytime {{he wanted}} to <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away.</b> All {{he had to do}} was to leap into the crystal cage and turn the handles. But he had a job, an {{important}} job. He had to be here, here at this place, at this time.|$|E

60|$|Shortly after this, Mr. Stubbs having again been coaxed {{down from}} his lofty position, Toby took his departure, {{promising}} to call as often during the week as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from his exacting employers.|$|E
60|$|Hilda {{scribbled}} a line {{in pencil}} to the doctor, saying that Netta was back {{and that she had}} obtained some news of a favorable description, and that, as she knew that at this hour <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>away,</b> she would come over with Netta at once to tell him what they had learned, and would be in Harley Street within half an hour of his getting the message.|$|R
50|$|Fleek {{joined the}} Army from Cincinnati, Ohio, and by May 27, 1969 was {{serving as a}} Sergeant in Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. During a firefight on that day, in Bình Dương Province, Republic of Vietnam, Fleek used his helmet to scoop an enemy-thrown hand grenade with his helmet. The grenade {{exploded}} before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> it <b>away</b> from his body, sacrificing his life to protect those around him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is good.
