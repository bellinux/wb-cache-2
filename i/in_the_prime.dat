5|$|Ministers may be {{designated}} by the Prime Minister {{to be in charge}} of particular ministries, or as Ministers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister's Office. Such Ministers were formerly known as Ministers without portfolio. The Prime Minister may retain any department or subject in his charge. Some Ministers are appointed as Second Ministers for portfolios other than their own to assist the primary Minister in his or her duties. For instance, with effect from 1 April 2009 during the 11th Parliament, Lim Hwee Hua, who was a Minister <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister's Office, also held the posts of Second Minister for Finance and Second Minister for Transport.|$|E

40|$|The root of <b>the</b> {{divergence}} problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current {{quantum field}} theory seems to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> special theory of relativity.

The modified special relativity theory involves {{two versions of the}} light speed, infinite speed c-prime <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primed</b> inertial coordinate system and finite speed c <b>in</b> <b>the</b> usual inertial coordinate system. The physical principle is: the c-prime-type Galilean invariance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>primed</b> inertial coordinate system plus the transformation from <b>the</b> <b>primed</b> to <b>the</b> usual inertial coordinate systems.

One of the driving philosophies is to identify precisely what the obstructions could be that prevent <b>the</b> <b>primes</b> (or any other set) from behaving “randomly”, and then either show that the obstructions do not actually occur, or else convert the obstructions into usable structural information on <b>the</b> <b>primes...</b>|$|R

She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to the parallel universe shortly after Ella answers.

5|$|By early 1952, Robey was {{becoming}} noticeably frail, {{and he lost}} interest in many of his sporting pastimes. Instead, he stayed at home and drew comic sketches featuring the Prime Minister of Mirth. In May he filmed The Pickwick Papers, in which he {{played the role of}} old Tony Weller, a part which he had initially turned down on health grounds. The following year, and in aid of the games fund, he starred as Clown in a short pantomime at the Olympic Variety Show at the Victoria Palace Theatre.

Meanwhile, Frank discovers Fauxlivia is pregnant; the adrenaline had induced morning sickness symptoms. At the hospital, the fetus is found to be six weeks old. Frank realizes he was away at that time, accuses Fauxlivia of sleeping with another man, and leaves her. Fauxlivia cries to herself, realizing her child's father is Peter (Joshua Jackson) from her time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> universe.|$|E

Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E

The alternate Superman attempts to destroy the Watchtower, but fails when Deathstroke overcharges its core, setting off a massive explosion. Luthor tries to use the kryptonite weapon to kill Superman, but Shazam (Joey Naber) stops him, allowing Superman to execute him. Now aware of humanity's determination to depose him, Superman decides to destroy Gotham and Metropolis to demonstrate the chaos that would arise in his absence and murders Shazam when the latter protests, causing Flash (Neal McDonough) to defect and fight {{his way to the}} Insurgency.|$|E

When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies that they seem to have fallen through the balcony, as if it momentarily ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> one, with the building occupying a weak spot between universes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the dynamic characteristic of the spacecraft propulsion system, numerical simulation was carried out based on the modular and extensible simulation model UPSSim. The model accurately predicts the global behavior of the spacecraft propulsion system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>priming</b> and shutdown process, and also correctly describes the transient behavior of the subsystems. Due to the distributaries of the attitude control thruster supply pipelines, the propellant flow fluctuation attenuates rapidly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>priming</b> process and <b>the</b> waterhammer peak pressure of main engine supply pipelines decreases significantly. The waterhammer waves of the main supply pipelines propagate to the attitude control thruster supply pipelines and dissipate gradually. The farther from the main engine, the later the pressure fluctuates...|$|R
5|$|Walter and Walternate (Noble) {{start the}} Machine {{equipment}} to overload, {{which will take}} several minutes, after which they can pull the power and deactivate the Machine. Lee states to Peter (Joshua Jackson) {{that he will be}} staying in the parallel universe, where he feels at home, reflecting a previous conversation Peter had with Lee about staying with Olivia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> universe. Walter and Walternate have a heartfelt discussion over Peter, and Walter expresses concern that if the bridge disappears, so will Peter. The other Fringe members say their goodbyes to their counterparts. Eventually, the Machine is overloaded and deactivated, and the parallel universe aspects of the room disappear; Walter is pleased to see Peter remains.|$|E
5|$|When {{a second}} {{simultaneous}} set of earthquakes occur, the parallel universe's version of Nick Lane (David Call) approaches Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) {{of the prime}} universe, believing {{him to be the}} parallel universe's version of Lee. Lee feigns familiarity, learning that Nick had visions of being at the epicenter of the quake before it began. When Lee reports this to Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> universe, she suddenly recalls her Cortexiphan trials including fellow subject Nick Lane, and with the team's help, identifies that other Cortexiphan subjects are the epicenter of these quakes, linking to their parallel universe versions to achieve synchronization.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> universe, Nina Sharp {{helps to}} set up Massive Dynamic's {{resources}} to track these occurrences, preparing to deploy limited supplies of the amber substance to contain them if needed. Nina advises Olivia to find Sam Weiss, a man that William Bell had trusted and instructed Nina to also listen to. However, Sam has disappeared and cannot be found. Walter and Peter, along with Massive Dynamic staff, debate how to disable the machine, but Peter realizes that he himself is the only option. Walter comes {{to recognize that the}} Observer's efforts from earlier ("The Firefly") were to prepare him to lose Peter. After preparing himself, Peter goes to touch the machine, but is sent flying by an electrical spark, wounding him and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital chapel, Walter tries to find repentance from God for his actions, while Olivia arrives after hearing the news. She steps outside to observe the sunset when Sam Weiss runs up to her and demands to be taken to the machine to stop what is already happening.|$|E
