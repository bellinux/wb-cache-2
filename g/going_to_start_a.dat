2500|$|Simmons and Stanley did not renew Criss' {{contract}} when it {{expired in}} March 2004. Criss, on his website, stated that [...] "No one, again, {{no one has}} called me, or my attorney about an extension for future touring. As a founding member I find this to be disrespectful to me, and to the fans that have made us {{one of the biggest}} bands in the world." [...] Criss stated in a radio interview in 2004 with Eddie Trunk that Simmons and Stanley were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>a</b> new Kiss, and felt that he was getting too old to play the drums for two hours (Criss was almost 59 at this time).|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, {{to promote}} her latest film Vampires Suck, Anneliese van der Pol {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} that a That's So Raven film had been written but failed to go into production. [...] "The storyline saw us going to France. [...] was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>a</b> fashion line in France. Eddie and [...] were going to fly out and meet her. Of course, something tragic happens. We have to rescue the situation." [...] Van der Pol admitted that Raven's schedule at the time was booked solid for a year and the possibility of the film seemed unlikely. [...] "But no, It's not ever happening. If I hear something, I {{will be the first to}} sign on." [...] She also commented on reprising her role of Chelsea Daniels.|$|E

2500|$|Page {{was first}} {{attracted}} to computers {{when he was}} six years old, as {{he was able to}} [...] "play with the stuff lying around"—first-generation personal computers—that had been left by his parents. He became the [...] "first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor". His older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking [...] "everything in his house apart to see how it worked". He said that [...] "from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became really interested in technology and business. Probably from when I was 12, I knew I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>a</b> company eventually." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band Jones & Giftet (Jones & the Poison) {{was formed}} with members Joakim [...] "Jocke" [...] Berg, Martin Sköld, Markus Mustonen, Sami Sirviö and Thomas Bergqvist (synthesizers). It {{all started with}} Berg going to London and buying two guitars, one for Sirviö and one for himself. Sirviö and Berg had a band that rehearsed at Bålsta Musikslott which {{consisted}} of three people. Inspired by My Bloody Valentine, Sköld and Berg decided they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>a</b> new band. This happened at the school S:t Eskils cafeteria Grönan. Berg and Sköld met up with a very drunk Mustonen outside of the Restaurant Vildsvinet in Eskilstuna. Whilst drunk, he promised to join the band and play the drums. Thomas Bergqvist, a friend of Martin Sköld, was invited {{to come along and}} play the synth. The first gig was played in [...] Lindesberg in Västmanland, and the second at Knegoffs in Eskilstuna.|$|E

60|$|Elsie's {{face looked}} her doubts. I walked across to Mrs. Evelegh's desk, and began writing a letter. It {{occurred}} to me that Mr. Hitchcock, who was a man of business, {{might be able to help}} a woman of business in this delicate matter. I put the point to him fairly and squarely, without circumlocution; we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>an</b> English typewriting office in Florence; what was the ordinary way for people to become possessed of a typewriting machine, without the odious and mercenary preliminary of paying for it? The answer came back with commendable promptitude.|$|R

But the {{gambling}} business,' says he, 'from the profitable side of the table is a good compromise between swiping silver spoons and selling penwipers at a Waldorf-Astoria charity bazar.' ...|$|E

The house owns two or three {{factories}} and at one we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>a</b> big oil-launch running to a native market up river. Then we have bought new machinery for breaking palm nuts and extracting the kernels and have fixed a site for the building at a dry, sandy spot. I don't claim the neighborhood's healthy, but it's healthier than this, and we have inquired about an engineer. Would you like the post?" ...|$|E

It is {{all very}} well {{to tell them about}} driving off the sheep and cattle and horses, and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>a</b> colony on our own account, but the {{soldiers}} would have been up to us before we had gone a day's journey. Most of the fellows would have bolted directly they saw them. As it is, I fancy only about a dozen have got away, perhaps not as many as that, and they are all men that one can rely upon. One can feed a dozen without difficulty--a sheep a day would do it--and by giving a turn to each of the settlers, the animals won't be missed. Besides, we shall want money if we are ever {{to get out of this}} cursed country. It would not be difficult to get enough for you and me, but when it comes to a large number the sack of the whole settlement would not go very far.|$|E
6000|$|About 1878, I think (I {{was now a}} slave of the quill myself), I {{received}} a brief note from Mr. Stevenson, introducing to me the person whom, in his essay on his old college magazine, he called [...] "Glasgow Brown." [...] What his real name was, whence he came, whence the money came, I never knew. G. B. was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>a</b> weekly Tory paper. Would I contribute? G. B. came to see me. Mr. Stevenson has described him, not as I would have described him: like Mr. Bill Sikes's dog, I have the Christian peculiarity of not liking dogs [...] "as are not of my breed." [...] G. B.'s paper, London, was to start next week. He had no writer of political leading articles. Would I do a [...] "leader"? But I was not in favour of Lord Lytton's Afghan policy. How could I do a Tory leader? Well, I did a neutral-tinted thing, with citations from Aristophanes! I found presently some other scribes for G. B.|$|E
60|$|Now the {{way that}} the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six {{thousand}} dollars apiece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round --more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>a</b> band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.|$|E
