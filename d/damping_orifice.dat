40|$|This paper {{deals with}} dynamic {{characteristics}} of a direct-pressure sensing water hydraulic relief valve. Four hydrostatic bearings support the main valve to reduce hysteresis of static characteristics of the valve. Hence, Coulomb friction acting on the main valve is not available as damping force. A <b>damping</b> <b>orifice</b> is inserted between the main- and pilot valves to get a damping force for the main valve, while the orifice diameter affects on stability of the main valve. In addition, {{the motion of the}} pilot valve has large effects on the response of the relief valve itself. To show these influences, we compute the response to a step input of relief flowrate with the MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the design parameters affecting the stability are followings: (1) the <b>damping</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter, (2) spring stiffness for the pilot valve, and (3) volume of a chamber between the <b>damping</b> <b>orifice</b> and the pilot valve...|$|E

Excellent agreement between the model and measurements is obtained. Most of the model parameters can be evaluated readily from measurement or calculation, though the friction factor and bulk modulus are adjusted to match the model to the measurements. The effect of the various physical parameters on {{the stability of the}} valve is discussed.

40|$|Abstract. Typical {{hydraulic}} systems with inertia executive components like hydraulic cylinders are generally low in damping {{and lack of}} stability. Adding DPD to systems is an easy and effectual method to solve these problems. The performance of a mechanical dynamic pressure feedback DPD applied in a common hydraulic system was simulated while the influences of the structure and system parameters on DPD and the system were analyzed. Further research on characteristic optimization {{was carried out by}} adding accumulators to DPD. It shows that the DPD can practically improve the system stability and contain the pressure impact. The accumulators should be set appropriately before the <b>damping</b> <b>orifices</b> and have a certain ability to absorb pressure impact...|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{protection}} is, without any doubt, a worldwide priority, {{and that is}} why one of the main preoccupations of the researchers in the field is finding some innovative concepts concerning the {{seismic protection}} of the structures. The aim of the paper consists in the analytical and numerical study of the variable <b>orifice</b> <b>damper</b> implemented in a single degree of freedom (SDOF) structure in order to increase people’s safety and reduce the seismic risk. The variable <b>orifice</b> <b>damper</b> is the common semi-active hydraulic device which may be utilized as part of seismic isolation system or within the lateral bracing of a structure.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyze the dynamic {{behavior}} of an actual electro-hydraulic injector, included into a high-pressure accumulator injection system (Common Rail). Firstly, a brief introduction of the hypotheses adopted for a lumped parameter description of each part of an industrial version of the injector (BOSCH) is outlined, together with {{the definition of the}} hypotheses assumed to treat the fuel efflux through the injection holes, through the internal mechanical couplings and the <b>damping</b> <b>orifices,</b> or to descript of the cavitations. Then, the dynamic behavior of the injector is analyzed adopting some of the command signals imposed to the pilot stage by the Electronic Central Unit (ECU), as actually implemented into the standard map of an on board ECU of a industrial diesel engine. Among others, the paper presents the results coming from the injector handling for medium values of the crank-shaft regime (1800 and 2400 rpm), for different pressure levels in the Rail and involving also the pilot injection. The reliability of the numerical results is stated through a wide numerical vs. experimental comparison, made up {{on the basis of the}} fuel mass injected for each cycle. Finally, the discharge characteristics characterizing the injection are determined, such as the effective mean velocity and the effective area of the liquid core at the holes exit, or injection holes discharge coefficient...|$|R
40|$|In Multijet Common Rail (C. R.) systems, the {{capability}} to manage multiple injections with full flexibility {{in the choice of}} the dwell time (DT) between consecutive solenoid current pulses {{is one of the most}} relevant design targets. Pressure oscillations triggered by the nozzle closure after each injection event induce disturbances in the amount of fuel injected during subsequent injections. This causes a remarkable dispersion in the mass of fuel delivered by each injection shot when DT is varied. The present works aims at investigating hydraulic circuit design keys to improve multiple injection performance of C. R. systems, by virtually removing the dependence of the injected fuel amount on DT. A Multi-Jet C. R. of the latest solenoid-type generation was experimentally tested at engine-like operating conditions on a high performance test bench. The considerable influence that the injector supplying pipe can exert on induced pressure oscillation frequency and amplitude was widely investigated and a physical explanation of cause-effect relationships was found by energetics considerations, starting from experimental tests. An optimization study was carried out to identify the best geometrical configurations of the injector supplying pipes so as to minimize pressure oscillations. The analysis was carried out with the aid of a previously developed simple zero-dimensional model, allowing the evaluation of pressure wave frequencies as functions of main system geometric data. Purposely designed orifices were introduced into the rail-pipe connectors or at the injector inlet, so as to damp pressure oscillations. Their effects on injection system performance were experimentally analyzed. Hydraulic circuit solutions that apply both optimized injector inlet-pipe sizes and oscillation <b>damping</b> <b>orifices</b> at the rail outlet were thoroughly investigated. Finally, the influence of the rail volume on pressure wave dynamics was studied to evaluate the possibility of severely reducing the rail capacitance. This would lead to a system, not only with reduced overall dimensions, but also with a prompter dynamic response during engine transient...|$|R

The three basic approaches to structural control may be defined as follows passive control systems,active control systems and semi-active control systems. These systems have received much attention recently because they have versatility and adaptability of active control systems. Although there is a wide variety of these energy absorbing devices, but all have one thing in common. they absorb energy from the structure. Semi-active control systems possess the advantages of both active and passive control systems. Variable orifice dampers are semi-active control devices that utilize the hydraulic fluid flow to generate controllable damping forces. Depending {{on the state of the}} structure, the energy absorbing property of the variable orifice dampers is changed on the fly. In this study, the proposed semi-active control algorithm and the effect of variable <b>orifice</b> <b>damper</b> for seismic response reduction is examined. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed semi-active control algorithm and the usefulness of variable orifice dampers,controlled and uncontrolled behaviour of the three story model structure subjected to earthquake forces are investigated numerically. The three story model structure in Civil Engineering Laboratory in. YTE is utilized for numerical simulations. The results indicate numerically that the proposed semi-active control algorithm with a variable <b>orifice</b> <b>damper</b> can be used effectively to reduce the earthquake induced structural vibrations...|$|R
40|$|During its {{life-cycle}} {{a structural}} system is generally subject to both static and dynamic loads: {{for the second}} type of actions inertial effects become more important resulting in dynamic amplification and cyclic response. The effects of such loads can be controlled for example by adopting passive energy dissipation that can be effective against seismic and wind induced motion requiring no kind of external supply. In this work a viscous fluid <b>damper</b> with annular <b>orifice</b> is deeply investigated with the aim to set up a reliable numerical model supporting the design phase. After giving {{a brief description of the}} basic fluiddynamic and rheological equations, analytical solution is provided for both Newtonian and Non-Newtonian incompressible viscous fluid as a reference.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{hydrodynamic}} wave loads on {{an offshore}} stationary–floating {{oscillating water column}} (OWC) are investigated via a 2 D and 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling based on the RANS equations and the VOF surface capturing scheme. The CFD model is validated against previous experiments for nonlinear regular wave interactions with a surface-piercing stationary barge. Following the validation stage, the numerical model is modified to consider the pneumatic damping effect, and an extensive campaign of numerical tests is carried out to study the wave–OWC interactions for different wave periods, wave heights and pneumatic damping factors. It is found that the horizontal wave force is usually larger than the vertical one. Also, there a direct relationship between the pneumatic and hydrodynamic vertical forces with a maximum vertical force almost at the device natural frequency, whereas the pneumatic damping has a {{little effect on the}} horizontal force. Additionally, simulating the turbine <b>damping</b> with an <b>orifice</b> plate induces higher vertical loads than utilizing a slot opening. Furthermore, 3 D modeling significantly escalates and declines the predicted hydrodynamic vertical and horizontal wave loads, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, an {{analytical}} investigation on active, semi-active and passive vibration control mechanisms {{is presented in}} order to achieve improved shock and vibration isolation of mechanical systems, especially ground vehicle applications. A hybrid active vibration isolation system, incorporating an electro-magnetic force generator along with passive damping and spring elements, is mathematically modeled based on fundamental physical laws and taking into account the generator dynamics. Complete vibration isolation characteristics of the hybrid active control system are evaluated for various feedback variables and control schemes, using numerical simulations. Influence of the force generator dynamics on vibration isolation performance is illustrated through the simulation results. A concept of tunable pressure limiting modulation is proposed in hydraulic damper systems. A hydraulic <b>orifice</b> <b>damper</b> is modified by using the proposed tunable pressure limiting modulation to achieve variable damping in vibration isolation systems, without requiring any external energy source, sophisticated control devices and feedback instrumentation that are essential for active and semi-active isolators. The fluid flow equations are employed to develop the nonlinear mathematical model of the hydraulic damper, incorporating the fluid and mechanical compliance, and the dynamics of the pressure limiting mechanism. The computer simulation reveals that the shock and vibration isolation performance of the tunable pressure limited hydraulic damper systems is comparable to that of the semi-active 'on-off' vibration control systems. A generalized harmonic linearization technique, based on a principle of energy similarity of dynamic elements, is proposed to derive equivalent linear representations of both nonlinear damping and spring elements, in the frequency domain. An analysis of the nonlinear in-plane vehicle model, with air-springs, <b>orifice</b> <b>damping</b> and pressure limiting modulation due to tunable hydraulic shock absorbers, is carried out to establish the stochastic response to random road inputs in terms of power spectral density, and to illustrate the improved vehicle ride performance due to tunable shock absorbers. An interconnected hydro-pneumatic suspension with tunable pressure limiting mechanism is presented to achieve improved vehicle ride and handling performance. Analysis of a roll plane model of a vehicle employing the tunable interconnected suspension shows that the connections of fluid flow within the interconnected suspension provide an enhanced static roll stability; while the tunable pressure limiting modulation between the strut and the accumulator of each suspension unit offers an improved vehicle ride performanc...|$|R
40|$|Article history: In this study, a shock {{absorber}} whose orifice area changes {{according to the}} oil pressure inside the absorber is developed. The orifice widens and narrows when the oil pressure is high and low, respectively; thus, the orifice area changes according to the oil pressure, in other words, according to the extension/compression velocity. It {{is well known that}} the damping force can be expressed as ·. For fluid film damping, the force is proportional to velocity, i. e.,, and for <b>orifice</b> <b>damping,</b> it is proportional to the square of velocity, i. e.,. The {{shock absorber}} proposed in this paper can exhibit different relationships between the damping force and velocity because the orifice area changes according to the induced oil pressure.
