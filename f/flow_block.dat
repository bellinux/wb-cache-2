40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic fusion bonding is a {{potential}} method for mass-production of polymer microfluidic chips. However, the micro structures in the chips are easily damaged or even destroyed due to poor controllability and uniformity of the melted energy directors in ultrasonic bonding process. In this paper, a novel micro joint including energy directors and <b>flow</b> <b>blocks</b> is presented. The flow profile of the melted energy directors {{is controlled by the}} dimensions of the <b>flow</b> <b>blocks,</b> auxiliary energy-equilibrating structures are also designed to prevent the uneven melt of energy directors. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microfluidic chips with the new joints were fabricated and ultrasonic bonding experiments were conducted. Micro channels with characteristic dimension of tens of microns were successfully sealed in 0. 3 s and free of deformation...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{sought to}} explore the {{relationship}} of workarounds related {{to the implementation of}} an electronic medication administration record and medication safety practices in five Midwestern nursing homes. DESIGN: As a part of a larger study, this qualitative evaluation was conducted to identify workarounds associated with the implementation of an electronic medication administration record. Data were collected using multimethods including direct observation, process mapping, key informant interviews, and review of field notes from medication safety team meetings. MEASUREMENTS: Open and axial coding techniques were used to identify and categorize types of workarounds in relation to work <b>flow</b> <b>blocks.</b> RESULTS: Workarounds presented in two distinct patterns, those related to work <b>flow</b> <b>blocks</b> introduced by technology and those related to organizational processes not reengineered to effectively integrate with the technology. Workarounds such as safety alert overrides and shortcuts to documentation resulted from first-order problem solving of immediate blocks. Nursing home staff as individuals frequently used first-order problem solving instead of the more sophisticated second-order problem solving approach used by the medication safety team. CONCLUSION: This study provides important practical examples of how nursing home staff work around work <b>flow</b> <b>blocks</b> encountered during the implementation of technology. Understanding these workarounds as a means of first-order problem solving is an important consideration to understanding risk to medication safety...|$|R

40|$|A {{parameter}} {{widely used}} to predict topographic <b>flow</b> <b>blocking</b> is the nondimensional mountain height or, synonymously, the inverse Froude number. Predictions using this parameter {{are based on the}} morphology of flows with uniform upstream static stability and wind speed, which rarely occur in the real world. The appropriateness of applying this theory in the presence of nontrivial background stability is therefore investigated using a numerical model. Two methods were considered to estimate the low-level stability, averaging the Brunt–Väisälä frequency below the crest and using the bulk change in � between the ground and crest level. No single best method emerged for estimating the upstream static stability and thereby mapping the simulations with inversions onto the set of solutions with constant stratification. Instead, the best method depended on the application at hand. To predict the onset of flow stagnation, averaging the low-level stability worked best, while to predict low-level flow diversion the bulk estimate of low-level stability was most appropriate. These results are consistent across a range of inversion thicknesses and strengths. In addition, it is shown that variations in static stability above the mountain crest have little impact on <b>flow</b> <b>blocking.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Ethernet {{technology}} is being deployed in metro and wide area networks. However, despite recent evolutions, Ethernet cannot {{be considered a}} carrier class technology due mainly {{to the lack of}} facilities for efficient traffic engineering (TE). In this article, we propose a Flow-aware TE approach for carrier class Ethernet networks providing services like those defined by the Metro Ethernet Forum. The flow-aware networking approach we consider is based on the Cross-protect router mechanisms, allowing satisfactory quality for streaming and elastic flows without explicitly identifying traffic classes by the combined use of fair queuing and admission control. Our proposal applies specifically to architectures where a tunnel is established between ingress and egress nodes (like Ethernet over MPLS). In this specific context, the Cross-protect mechanisms are applied on a per tunnel basis. We analyze the proposed approach in terms of <b>flow</b> <b>blocking</b> probabilities for which explicit formula are derived. We also extend the study framework to the case where several paths are established between a pair of ingress/egress nodes, and propose a simple load balancing scheme. We analyze its performance and derive approximate formula for the <b>flow</b> <b>blocking</b> probability in this case. The analysis is validated by extensive simulations...|$|R
