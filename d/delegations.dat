40|$|International audienceTask <b>delegation</b> {{presents}} one of {{the business}} process security leitmotifs. It denes a mechanism that bridges the gap between both workfow and access control systems. There are two important issues relating to <b>delegation,</b> namely allowing task <b>delegation</b> to complete, and having a secure <b>delegation</b> within a workfow. <b>Delegation</b> completion and authorisation enforcement are specied under specic constraints. Constraints are dened from the <b>delegation</b> context implying {{the presence of a}} xed set of <b>delegation</b> events to control the <b>delegation</b> execution. In this paper, we aim to reason about <b>delegation</b> events to specify <b>delegation</b> policies dynamically. To that end, we present an event-based task <b>delegation</b> model to monitor the <b>delegation</b> process. We then identify relevant events for authorisation enforcement to specify <b>delegation</b> policies. Moreover, we propose a technique that automates <b>delegation</b> policies using event calculus to control the <b>delegation</b> execution and increase the compliance of all <b>delegation</b> changes in the global policy...|$|R

Several role-based <b>delegation</b> models have been {{proposed}} in the literature. However, these models consider only <b>delegation</b> in presence of the role type, which have some inherent limitations to task <b>delegation</b> in workﬂow systems. In this paper, we address task <b>delegation</b> in a workﬂow and elaborate a security model supporting <b>delegation</b> constraints. <b>Delegation</b> constraints express security requirements with regards to task's resources, user's assignment and privileges (<b>delegation</b> of authority). Further, we show how, using a role-based security model, we inject formalised <b>delegation</b> constraints to compute <b>delegation</b> principals with their respective privileges...|$|R

In ABDM, a delegatee must satisfy <b>delegation</b> constraint (especially DAE) when assigned to a <b>delegation</b> role.

40|$|International audienceDelegation {{mechanisms}} are receiving increasing interest {{from the research}} community. Task <b>delegation</b> is a mechanism that supports organisational flexibility in the human-centric workflow systems, and ensures <b>delegation</b> of authority in access control systems. In this paper, we consider task <b>delegation</b> as an advanced security mechanism supporting policy decision. We define an approach to support dynamic <b>delegation</b> of authority within an access control framework. The novelty consists of reasoning on authorisation dependently on task <b>delegation</b> events, and specifies {{them in terms of}} <b>delegation</b> policies. When one of these events changes, our access policy decision may change proactively implying dynamic <b>delegation</b> of authority. Existing work on access control systems remain stateless and do not consider this perspective. We highlight such limitations, and propose a task <b>delegation</b> framework to support proactive enforcement of <b>delegation</b> policies...|$|R
40|$|Grid <b>delegation</b> is the {{procedure}} {{by which a}} valid user endows another user or a program or service {{with the ability to}} act on that user’s behalf. <b>Delegation</b> is the primary form of authorization in grids. The large and geographically distributed, dynamic, heterogeneous and scalable grid environment poses unique <b>delegation</b> requirements. Presently there are no standard mechanisms to guide grid <b>delegation.</b> As credential <b>delegation</b> has its own limitations in a dynamic grid environment, a new conceptual model is required to effectively formulate the grid <b>delegation</b> requirements. In this paper, we present a framework called Role-Based Grid <b>Delegation</b> Model (RB-GDM) for delegating access rights in grids. The basic unit of <b>delegation</b> in our model is role. Derived from the standard RBAC formalisms, this framework explores various approaches for authorization and revocation of <b>delegation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms must be {{provided}} to protect resources from attackers when users request access to resources in network environments. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) formulates that access decisions {{are based on the}} roles that individual users have as members of a system. In RBAC, there are role hierarchies in which a senior role inherits the permissions of a junior role. In order to allow a junior role to perform one or more tasks of a senior role, various <b>delegation</b> models have been proposed in the literature, including Role-Based Access Control Model (RBAC 96), Role-Based <b>Delegation</b> Model (RBDM 0), Attribute-Based <b>Delegation</b> Model (ABDM), Role-Based <b>Delegation</b> Model 2000 (RDM 2000) and Permission-Based <b>Delegation</b> Model (PBDM). The main work of this thesis presents a flexible conceptual <b>delegation</b> model called User-to-Role <b>Delegation</b> Model (URDM), which is based on RDM 2000. URDM supports role hierarchy, single-step <b>delegation</b> and simultaneous <b>delegation</b> by introducing a new <b>delegation</b> relation. Four situations are addressed when URDM is involved. We also implement a web application named University <b>Delegation</b> Management System (UDMS) for URDM. At the end of the thesis, we make some generalizations to the area of role-based <b>delegation</b> in access control and present directions for future research...|$|R
