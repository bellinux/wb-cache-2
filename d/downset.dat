40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} characterizing the set ε(P) of all extensions of an order P {{on a set of}} elements E, where |E|=n, |P|=m and μ is the number of extensions of the order. Initially, we describe two distinct characterizations of ε(P). The first characterization is a one-to-one correspondence between extensions of P and pairs of upsets and <b>downsets</b> of certain suborders of P. The second one characterizes the extensions of P in terms of linear extensions and sequences of <b>downsets.</b> Both characterizations lead to algorithms that generate all the extensions of P. Further, we discuss the notion of passive pairs of an order.

40|$|Stable {{matching}} is {{a classical}} combinatorial {{problem that has}} been the subject of intense theoretical and empirical study since its introduction in 1962 in a seminal paper by Gale and Shapley. In this paper, we provide a new upper bound on f(n), the maximum number of stable matchings that a stable matching instance with n men and n women can have. It has been a long-standing open problem to understand the asymptotic behavior of f(n) as n→∞, first posed by Donald Knuth in the 1970 s. Until now the best lower bound was approximately 2. 28 ^n, and the best upper bound was 2 ^n n- O(n). In this paper, we show that for all n, f(n) ≤ c^n for some universal constant c. This matches the lower bound up to the base of the exponent. Our proof is based on a reduction to counting the number of <b>downsets</b> of a family of posets that we call "mixing".

The slightly smaller object id(P) is known to be isomorphic to P if and only if P has ascending chain condition. This result is strengthened to say that the only posets P 0 such that for every natural number n there exists a poset Pn with id n (Pn) ∼ = P 0 are those having ascending chain condition. On the other hand, a wide class of cases is noted here where id(P) is embeddable in P. Counterexamples are given to many variants of the results proved...|$|R

40|$|In {{cooperative}} game theory, {{for a given}} set {{of players}} N, TU-games are functions v: 2 N → R which express for each nonempty coalition S ⊆ N of players {{the best they can}} achieve by cooperation. In the classical setting, every coalition may form without any restriction, i. e., the domain of v is indeed 2 N. In practice, this assumption is often unrealistic, since some coalitions may not be feasible for various reasons, e. g., players are political parties with divergent opinions, or have restricted communication abilities, or a hierarchy exists among players, and the formation of coalitions must respect the hierarchy, etc. Many studies have been done on games defined on specific subdomains of 2 N, e. g., antimatroids [1], convex geometries [3, 4], distributive lattices [6], or others [2, 5]. In this paper, we mainly deal with the case of distributive lattices. To this end, we assume that there exists some partial order ≼ on N describing some hierarchy or precedence constraint among players, as in [6]. We say that a coalition S is feasible if the coalition contains all its subordinates, i. e., i ∈ S implies that any j ≼ i belongs to S as well. Then feasible coalitions are <b>downsets,</b> and by Birkhoff’s theorem, form a distributive lattice...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{computational}} complexity of approximately evaluating partition functions. For various classes of partition functions, we investigate {{whether there is}} an FPRAS: a fully polynomial randomised approximation scheme. In many of these settings we also study “expressibility”, a simple notion of defining a constraint by combining other constraints, and we show that the results cannot be extended by expressibility reductions alone. The main contributions are: -� We show that there is no FPRAS for evaluating the partition function of the hard-core gas model on planar graphs at fugacity 312, unless RP = NP. -� We generalise an argument of Jerrum and Sinclair to give FPRASes for a large class of degree-two Boolean #CSPs. -� We initiate the classification of degree-two Boolean #CSPs where the constraint language consists of a single arity 3 relation. -� We show that the complexity of approximately counting <b>downsets</b> in directed acyclic graphs is not affected by restricting to graphs of maximum degree three. -� We classify the complexity of degree-two #CSPs with Boolean relations and weights on variables. -� We classify the complexity of the problem #CSP(F) for arbitrary finite domains when enough non-negative-valued arity 1 functions are in the constraint language. -� We show that not all log-supermodular functions can be expressed by binary logsupermodular functions in the context of #CSPs...|$|R
40|$|Valued {{constraint}} satisfaction problems (VCSPs) are discrete optimisation {{problems with a}} (Q∪{∞}) -valued objective function given as a sum of fixed-arity functions. In Boolean surjective VCSPs, variables take on labels from D={ 0, 1 } and an optimal assignment is required to use both labels from D. Examples include the classical global Min-Cut problem in graphs and the Minimum Distance problem studied in coding theory. We establish a dichotomy theorem and thus give a complete complexity classification of Boolean surjective VCSPs with respect to exact solvability. Our work generalises the dichotomy for { 0,∞}-valued constraint languages (corresponding to decision CSPs) obtained by Creignou and Hébrard. For the maximisation problem of Q_≥ 0 -valued surjective VCSPs, we also establish a dichotomy theorem with respect to approximability. Unlike {{in the case of}} Boolean surjective CSPs, there appears a novel tractable class of languages that is trivial in the non-surjective setting. This newly discovered tractable class has an interesting mathematical structure related to <b>downsets</b> and upsets. Our main contribution is identifying this class and proving that it lies on the borderline of tractability. A crucial part of our proof is a polynomial-time algorithm for enumerating all near-optimal solutions to a generalised Min-Cut problem, which might be of independent interest.
