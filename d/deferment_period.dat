Piata subjected to <b>deferment</b> <b>periods</b> (65, 85 and 105 days) and initial sward heights for deferment (20, 30 and 40 cm). A completely randomized block design was used in a split-plot scheme with three replications. The population density of vegetative basal and total tillers was influenced by the interaction between periods and initial heights of deferment, with lower values in the period of 85 days associated with the initial height of 40 cm and the period of 105 days associated with initial heights of 30 and 40 cm. The length of the stem and leaf blade of vegetative basal tillers increased with the raise in the <b>deferment</b> <b>periods.</b> Initial deferring heights had little effect on the structural characteristics of the tillers. The concomitant use of tall plants and long deferring periods reduces tillering of piata palisade grass.

Two fertilization strategies of marandu grass were evaluated: fertilization with 200 kg N/ha divided into three applications at intervals of 30 days (two applications before and one at the beginning of the <b>deferment</b> <b>period),</b> and fertilization with a single dose of 50 kg N/ha at the beginning of the <b>deferment</b> <b>period.</b> A completely randomized design consisting of two treatments and four replicates was used. At the beginning of the <b>deferment</b> <b>period,</b> the structural characteristics of the marandu canopy did not differ between nitrogen doses. During the <b>deferment</b> <b>period,</b> {{the production of}} forage (P= 0. 0388), green leaf blade (P= 0. 0041) and green stem (P= 0. 0095) was higher for plants fertilized with 200 kg N/ha compared to those fertilized with 50 kg N/ha. The nitrogen doses did not influence leaf blade or stem senescence, with mean values of 1, 497 and 1, 432 kg dry matter/ha, respectively. Higher (P= 0. 0265) forage accumulation was observed for marandu grass fertilized with 200 kg N/ha and predominantly occurred in the stem. At the end of the <b>deferment</b> <b>period,</b> plants fertilized with 200 kg N/ha exhibited a greater forage mass (P= 0. 04), plant height (P= 0. 0252), extended plant height (P= 0. 0488), and leaf area index (P= 0. 0098) than plants fertilized with 50 kg N/ha.

For so, the following characteristics were evaluated: masses and bulk density of forage and its morphological components, light interception by the sward, leaf area index, leaf angle, sward and extended tiller height and falling index of the deferred piatã grass. The three deferment periods assessed (65, 85 and 105 days) were randomized to the plots and the three sward heights (20, 30 and 40 cm), randomized in the subplots. The experimental design was of completely randomized blocks, with three replicates, in a subdivided plots arrangement. Masses of forage, green stem and dead tissue were higher in the piatã grass managed with <b>deferment</b> <b>period</b> of 105 days. The mass of green leaf blade was higher in the piatã grass deferred with 20 cm height associated to the <b>deferment</b> <b>period</b> of 85 days, which had, as consequence, greater bulk density of green leaf blade. The interception of light by the sward was greater in the piatã grass kept longer in deferment associated with the higher leaf area index, regardless of its initial height.

40|$|We {{explore the}} extent to which claim {{incidence}} in Disability Income Insurance (DII) is affected by changes in the unemployment rate in Australia. Using data from 1986 to 2001, we fit a hurdle model to explore the presence and magnitude of the effect of changes in unemployment rate on the incidence of DII claims, controlling for policy holder characteristics and seasonality. We find a clear positive association between unemployment and claim incidence, and we explore this further by gender, age, <b>deferment</b> <b>period,</b> and occupation. A multinomial logistic regression model is fitted to cause of claim data in order to explore the relationship further, and it is shown that the proportion of claims due to accident increases markedly with rising unemployment. The results suggest that during periods of rising unemployment, insurers may face increased claims from policy holders with shorter deferment periods for white-collar workers and for medium and heavy manual workers.

After the pasture was grazed to 10 cm of height, in March 2014, both grasses were left to rest and subjected to a 126 -day <b>deferment</b> <b>period.</b> The experimental period lasted from July to October 2014; the sward characteristics and the animal's weight were evaluated every 28 days. The highest forage mass was recorded in 'Marandu' grass, whereas the highest leaves percentage and lowest dead material percentage were observed in 'Basilisk' pastures. Similarly, the highest crude protein content (8. 1 vs. 7. 0 ± 0. 2 %), in vitro organic matter digestibility (57. 7 vs. 53. 9 ± 0. 4 %), lowest neutral detergent fiber content (69. 2 vs. 72. 7 ± 0. 4 %), and; consequently, the highest average daily gain (680 vs. 530 ± 0. 04 g animal- 1) were recorded for 'Basilisk' pastures.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} sickness absenteeism among self-employed in the Netherlands. Using {{a unique}} data set {{provided by a}} large Dutch private insurance company, we assess the determinants of sick leave durations. Our study suggests that several risk factors affect the sick leave durations of self-employed {{in a similar way}} as they influence the absence spells of employees according to the literature. For example, the recovery rate decreases with age and claimants suffering from psychological diseases have a lower recovery rate relative to claimants with other disorders. Furthermore, the sick leave durations of self-employed last longer when the economy is booming. In contrast to what the literature generally documents for employees, we do not find any evidence for moral hazard effects with respect to the benefit compensation level. Moreover, the absence spells of self-employed last longer in periods of high unemployment, whereas the opposite effect is usually documented for employees. We do not establish any significant gender differences in the sick leave durations of self-employed. Contract-specific factors Such as insurance brand and <b>deferment</b> <b>period</b> are typical characteristics of insurance contracts for self-employed and {{play an important role in}} explaining their sick leave durations. Finally, the introduction of insurer-based case management significantly increased the recovery rate of self-employed with an ongoing spell up to 1 year.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the life {{insurance}} sector has been {{faced with a}} number of challenges that emerged {{as a result of the}} growing longevity and stagnating birth rates for highly developed societies. In the field of actuarial application one could therefore ask for the implications of (long-term) mortality trends and (short-term) population fluctuation on an insurer's pricing and reserving of pension contracts, particularly in interaction with uncertainty in the capital markets. The first part of the thesis focuses on the mathematical description and projection of the mortality of homogeneous populations or insurance cohorts. Besides a survey of the most important representatives, a comprehensive analysis and comparison of stochastic and deterministic mortality forecasting models is carried out. In the second part a full stochastic model approach for two typical old-age provision products is set up and applied in terms of a management of longevity risk. On the one hand, a deferred conventional life annuity is analysed with regard to the combined effects of stochastic mortality and interest rates on different premium principles and risk capital allocation. On the other hand, a modern unit-linked annuity insurance, namely a deferred variable annuity contract, with an additional guaranteed minimum death benefit during the <b>deferment</b> <b>period</b> and a minimum income benefit at retirement is discussed. Mathematically, the guarantees represent options on the greater of the net asset value and a predetermined insurance benefit. For this reason, the existence and uniqueness of an extra fair percentage guarantee charge is proven. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the fair charge and risk neutral option prices concerning different model parameters is considered and several profitability and risk measures are determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{portfolio}} consistency fund {{studied in}} the paper is referred to a pension scheme of beneficiaries entering in the retirement state at the same time. It arises from the payment stream consisting in cash flows due {{at the beginning of}} each year in case of life of the pensioner: in the <b>deferment</b> <b>period,</b> in the form of premiums entering in the fund, and during the retirement period, in the form of instalments getting out of it. The fund dynamic as function of the time of valuation evolves increasing thanks to the interest maturing on the accumulated fund and decreasing because of the benefits paid to the survivals. Both the mortality trend, determining the number of payments at each time, and the interest maturing on the fund, are considered deterministically unknown at the moment of the contract issue. Stochastic assumptions about the behaviour of the interest rate process and the description of the mortality trend betterment, most likely to be expected in very long periods and in civilized world, provide a dynamic description of the pension scheme and in particular of the pension fund. In the paper we want to deepen the aspect of the financial and demographic basis chosen for premium calculation with respect to the impact on the portfolio fund consistency and on the risk arising from the randomness in the choice of the survival model used for the valuations. To this aim, we will assume for the fund description different projection levels for the survival probabilities and the Vasicek hypotheses for the interest rates maturing on the fund itself; moreover, we will determine the premium amounts introducing different scenarios in a safety loading perspective. As evident, in the premium quantification lower interest rate jointly with higher survival probabilities constitute a form of implied loading. The numerical application presented in the paper shows how the change in the premium calculation conditions affects the portfolio fund consistency in the different scenarios and investigates on the impact they have on the Demographic Model Risk Measure.

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{quantitative}} risk analysis of a pension scheme referred to a portfolio of beneficiaries entering in the retirement state at the same time. The analysis starts from the retirement time of the contractors and concerns the dynamic behavior of the financial periodic portfolio fund cut down year by year by the payments due to the survivals. The fund arises from the payment stream consisting in constant payments due {{at the beginning of}} each year in case of life of the pensioner in the <b>deferment</b> <b>period.</b> It gushes that the two forces operating in opposite directions from the retirement age on, in and out of the portfolio, are the increasing effect due to the interest maturing on the accumulated fund and in the outflow represented by the benefit payments due to the survival. The two processes are compared in a scenario in which the financial risk and the demographic risk are considered. Posing the time of valuation coinciding with the contract entry time, we consider deterministically unknown the dynamic of the future behavior of both the interest rates maturing on the fund and of the mortality. The mortality trend betterment in very long periods, as in the pension cases happens, leads to the need of a careful consideration of the systematic deviations of the number of deaths from the expected values. As known, if the risk arising from the accidental deviations of mortality can be hedged by pooling strategies, such that it is possible to neglect this risk source in the case of sufficiently large portfolios, the risk arising from the longevity phenomenon cannot be avoided without making dangerous mistakes consisting in underestimation of future obligations. The scenario in which the study is framed consists in stochastic hypotheses on the evolution in time of the interest rates of return on investment of the fund and in a more complex description of the mortality trend. The aim of the paper is, in particular, to study the effects of the change in the mortality description on the fund portfolio values.
