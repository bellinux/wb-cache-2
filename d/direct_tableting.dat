40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>tableting</b> {{has been}} renewed as a {{preferable}} process by simply mixing and compressing powder {{to save time}} and cost in comparison with granule tableting. Direct compression tableting as a technique has been successfully applied to numerous drugs on the industrial scale, although {{the success of any}} procedure, and resulting mechanical properties of tablets, is strongly affected by the quality of the crystals used. Good flowability, packability and compactability are prerequisite for drug to be prepared by <b>direct</b> <b>tableting.</b> When the mechanical properties of the drug particles are inadequate a primary granulation is necessary. The use of spherical crystallization as a technique appears to be an efficient alternative for obtaining suitable particles for <b>direct</b> <b>tableting.</b> Spherical crystallization is a particle design technique, by which crystallization and agglomeration can be carried out simultaneously in one step and which has been successfully utilized for improvement the micromeritic properties of crystalline drugs. In this review, we will discuss how the micromeritic properties of the particles such as flowability, packability and compactability can be improved by spherical crystallization technique...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to give an insight into the many {{potential}} applications of chitosan as a pharmaceutical drug carrier. The {{first part of this}} review concerns the principal uses of chitosan as an excipient in oral formulations (particularly as a <b>direct</b> <b>tableting</b> agent) and as a vehicle for parenteral drug delivery devices. The use of chitosan to manufacture sustained-release systems deliverable by other routes (nasal, ophthalmic, transdermal, and implantable devices) is discussed in the second part...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to prepare and evaluate mannitol and cellulose based, directly compressible excipient using freeze-thawing technique. The mannitol to cellulose ratio (50 : 50, 60 : 40, and 70 : 30) and the rotation speed of propeller stirrer (200, 600, and 1000 rpm) were selected as independent variables in a 32 full factorial design. Water acted as a good medium for mannitol as well as a bridging liquid for agglomeration of mannitol with cellulose. The agglomerates were evaluated for percentage fines and carr’s index. Tablets were prepared on a rotary tablet press, and they were evaluated for friability, tensile strength, water absorption ratio, and disintegration time. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to evolve full and reduce models. The use of composite index was demonstrated for the selection of an appropriate batch. The optimized batch was characterized by different scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectral Study, granular friability, Kawakita’s equation, Kuno’s equation and Heckle equation. The results of dilution potential study reveal that up to 30 % nimesulide, a poorly compressible drug and 50 % metformin, a hygroscopic drug, can be incorporated in the co-crystallized product. The product was less sensitive to lubricant in lubricant sensitivity test. In conclusion, the properties of agglomerated product, such as flowability, compactibility, and dissolution rate were improved profoundly using the developed technique resulting in successful <b>direct</b> <b>tableting</b> without need to additional process of physical blending of agglomerates...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} and determine the powder and compaction properties of microcrystalline starch (MCS) and compare with the properties of a well known direct compression filler-binder, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). Cassava starch was extracted from the freshly harvested tubers of Manihot esculenta Crantz and subjected to 5 hours of enzymatic hydrolysis to yield microcrystalline starch. The powder and compaction properties were evaluated and compared with MCC 101, a commercial brand of microcrystalline cellulose. Results of the powder properties of MCS revealed differences in the particle size, angle of repose, flow rate, bulk density, tapped density, true density, Hausner’s ratio, Carr’s index and powder porosity when compared to MCC. The compaction studies of both materials revealed that MCS had a faster onset of deformation and a greater extent of deformation in comparison to MCC. These results suggest that MCS has the potential of being used as a filler-binder in <b>direct</b> compression <b>tableting...</b>|$|R
40|$|A novel <b>direct</b> {{compression}} <b>tableting</b> excipient {{has been}} made by recrystallisation of lactose. The particles produced had high porosity, high specific surface area and high surface roughness. The resistance to segregation of ordered mixes formed between a model drug; potassium chloride and the excipients recrystallised lactose, spray crystallised maltose-dextrose (Emdexl and a direct compacting sugar (Dipac) was studied using a vibrational segregation model. The highly porous excipients, Emdex and recrystallised lactose formed ordered mixes which did not segregate even at high accelerations and low frequencies whereas the relatively smooth excipient, Dipac, displayed marked segregation in most vibration conditions. The vibrations were related to practical conditions measured in pharmaceutical process machinery. The time required to form an ordered mix was inversely related to {{the stability of the}} mix when subjected to vibration. An ultracentrifuge technique was developed to determine the interparticle adhesion forces holding drug and excipient particles together as ordered units. Excipient powders such as Emdex and recrystallised lactose, which formed non-segregating ordered mixes, had high interparticle adhesion forces. Other ordered mixes that segregated when subjected to different vibration conditions were found to have large quantities of weekly-bound drug particles; such mixes included those with Dipac as the carrier excipient as well as those containing a high concentration of drug. The electrostatic properties of different drug and excipient powders were studied using a Faraday well and an electrometer. Excipient powders such as Emdex and recrystallised lactose which formed stable ordered mixes also had a widely different surface charge in comparison with drug particles, whereas Dipac had a similar surface charge to the drug particles and formed unstable ordered mixes. A specially constructed triboelectric charging apparatus based on an air cyclone was developed to increase the affinity of drug particles for different excipient particles. Using triboelectrification to increase the interparticle adhesion forces, the segregation tendencies of unstable ordered mixes were greatly reduced. The stability of ordered mixes is shown to be related to both the surface physical characteristics and the surface electrical properties of the constituent carrier (excipientl particles...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to obtain directly compactible agglomerates of naproxen containing disintegrant by a novel crystallo-co-agglomeration (CCA) technique. Acetone-water containing hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) was used as the crystallization medium. Acetone acted as a good solvent for naproxen as well as a bridging liquid for agglomeration of crystallized drug with disintegrant and aqueous phase as non-solvent. The agglomerates were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD) and scanning electron microscopy. The agglomerates were compressed at different compression pressures and dissolution studies were carried out for the tablets produced at lowest compression force. The growth of particle size and the spherical form of the agglomerates resulted in formation of products with good flow and packing properties. The improved compaction properties of the agglomerated crystals were due to the fragmentation which occurred during compression. DSC and XRPD studies showed that naproxen particles, crystallized in the presence of HPC and disintegrant did not undergo structural modifications. The dissolution rate of naproxen from the agglomerates could be controlled by the amount of included disintegrant, being enhanced as the latter was increased. Moreover, the results showed that when the disintegrants were included both intragranularly and extragranularly during agglomeration of naproxen particles, tablets containing these agglomerates dissolved at a faster rate than the tablets containing crystallized naproxen with the same amount of disintegrant incorporated only extragranularly by physical mixing. In conclusion, the properties of agglomerated crystals, such as flowability, compactibility and dissolution rate were improved profoundly using the developed technique resulting in successful <b>direct</b> <b>tableting</b> without need to additional process of physical blending of agglomerates and disintegrants. © 2007 Elsevier B.
