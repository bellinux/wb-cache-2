40|$|Objective: To {{summarise}} {{findings from}} interdisciplinary {{research into the}} experiences of East Timorese women <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> residing in the Australian community, and specifically to highlight the effects of prolonged <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> status on wellbeing. ‘Wellbeing’ {{was defined as a}} holistic state that includes psychological, physical, spiritual, social and cultural welfare and contentment. Methods: A qualitative multimethod data collection tool comprised semistructured interviewing of East Timorese women <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> questionnaires to professional workers assisting East Timorese <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> at the community level, and an analysis of secondary source material. Results: Insecurity of tenure and living with the fear of forced removal from Australia was found to have significantly affected and dangerously compromised the wellbeing of the <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> The findings further revealed a flaw in current social policy with respect to the length of <b>time</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> could reside in the community without adequate supports, services and avenues for social inclusion. Conclusions: The research illustrated the necessity for faster processing of claims for <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> status, recognition of the effects of torture and trauma on <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in policy, and consequently immediate access for <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to essential and gender specific supports and services. The research provides evidence to support the East Timorese asylum seekers’ claim to permanent status in Australia on humanitarian grounds...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} how over <b>time</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> {{have been}} ‘objectivised’ by the Convention {{relating to the}} Status of Refugees 1951.

In this way, the focus of international law often turns from the ethical components of the law to terms, procedures and mechanisms. This arguably applies to Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 1951. Whilst originally conceived for Second World War refugees, it placed at the pinnacle of its preamble the moral impulse, ‘…to assure refugees the widest possible exercise of these fundamental rights and freedoms…’ The Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees 1967 removed the temporal and other limitations, however, arguably this moral impulse has waned as the words of the 1951 Convention have been used to control <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> This article argues that this has objectivised <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although the two {{political}} systems cannot be equated, the psychiatric and psychosocial {{issues raised by}} people detained under the migration regulations of the present Australian government, and those detained under the security legislation of the last apartheid government in South Africa, are similar in many aspects. We present two case scenarios representative of the cumulative clinical experience of the authors in their work (as part of their routine clinical practice and medical school experience) with <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and political detainees in acute psychiatric units in both South Africa and Australia. Similar issues raised included the validity of a psychiatric diagnosis in these patients and the debate this conundrum provoked among the multidisciplinary teams. The pressures placed on clinicians by politicians in terms of clinical management of hospitalized detainees raised similar ethical questions across both countries. The clinical syndromes of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder were similar. The effect of the 'non-person' status conferred upon refugees by the 'temporary protection visa' could be equated with the effect of 'banning orders' imposed on opponents of the Apartheid regime. In South Africa, political detainees entered into the struggle expecting to face hardship and torture {{at the hands of}} the government of the <b>time.</b> <b>Asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> flee to Australia expecting support from a democratic system and generally had not prepared themselves for further incarceration and yet another political struggle. Despite this seemingly fundamental difference, the experiences of detainees across two very different political systems are remarkably similar...|$|R

40|$|When an {{individual}} signs {{a contract for}} voluntary repatriation through a private or public body, {{there may be a}} need to draw upon principles of contract law and to test contracts for unconscionability. In the case of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees, there may be procedural unconscionability when consent is only the result of fear of deportation or imprisonment, and substantive unconscionability when conditions after return include no access to basic necessities or persecution. At the same <b>time,</b> many <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees do wish to return, despite conditions in the country of origin or because of conditions in the host country. Ethical issues regarding consent are therefore central. Yet, it is unclear how one would ensure consent under such conditions. While {{it may be possible to}} apply principles of paternalism and hypothetical consent in such cases, this may undermine the rights of those who wish to repatriate, and remove an option they otherwise would not have. This article argues that Parfit's Principle of Consent (CP) and Rights Principle (RP) may address these concerns and applies these principles to test for the unconscionability of two policies of repatriation of refugees and failed <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Israel back to countries in Africa between 2009 and 2013. One policy was implemented by an NGO that repatriated failed <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to countries deemed safe, although returnees had no legal status to stay in Israel and were therefore at risk of deportation. A second NGO returned individuals to South Sudan, even though this was considered dangerous, but only returned South Sudanese who had the legal status to stay in Israel, as this was considered criteria for true voluntariness in the decision to return. By attempting to apply CP and RP in a test for unconscionability, this article addresses both the ethical dilemmas of repatriation of failed <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees, as well as possible ways in which contracts, more generally, can be tested for unconscionability...|$|R

40|$|LIKE most Western countries, Australia removes, or ‘deports’, <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> whose {{applications}} for refugee protection are refused. This is the logical {{outcome of a}} fair and reliable refugee assessment system, an outcome that maintains the integrity and strength of refugee protection and limits potential abuse by non-refugees seeking residency. In Australia this outcome is prescribed {{as a process of}} law. But what happens to <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> while the law runs its course? Outstripping its Western counterparts, Australia maintains a range of asylum policies which contribute to the deterioration of the physical and mental health of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> while their claims for protection are being processed. Such policies include the use of mandatory, indefinite detention (both on-shore and off-shore) and bridging visas with conditions which deny access to health care, permission to work or income support. The impact of these policies are compounded by the length of <b>time</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> live under these conditions in uncertainty and fear. The government has maintained and furthered these policies despite evidence of the significant damage which is inflicted on this vulnerable population. These policies result in an <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker’s</b> right to health being left unfulfilled for years at a time. Australia fails to fulfil this responsibility in multiple and varied ways: some asylum policies and practices cultivate ill health; some limit or prevent the treatment of ill health; and some fail to prevent ill health. This strong association between ill health and the asylum process in Australia has significant implications when considering the practical and moral dilemmas involved in removal. It also introduces greater levels of responsibility for the future health of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in countries of return. For most <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> removal is a traumatic event leading to a difficult future in countries struggling to meet the basic needs of their populations. For removees who are seriously ill, removal can mark the “beginning of the end” as they anticipate the rapid deterioration of their health in places unable to provide adequate conditions of care. This is most likely when someone is removed to a country with limited basic resources, poor health care services or which {{is in the midst of}} an ongoing war or violent instability. These conditions are not generally considered adequate reasons to prevent removal, as the returned <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> are returning to the unfortunate circumstances faced by all people in their country of origin. As Australia is unable to offer visas to all individuals living in such situations, it is argued we have no responsibility to offer relief to those seriously ill individuals facing removal. Such dispassionate logic has allowed Australia to pursue removal outcomes with a serious disregard for the health and wellbeing of removees. It has also neglected our responsibility towards those whose health has deteriorated as a result of Australia’s damaging policies. Our interviews highlighted the devastating consequences of these policies for individuals. One <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> became destitute after living on a bridging visa with no work rights or income support. He took a job illegally in order to avoid starvation. As a result, he was taken into immigration detention for breaching his visa conditions. While in detention, he experienced stomach pains and was treated for ulcers. With the support of a charity, he was released from detention on another bridging visa. In the community, a doctor took pity on him and treated him as a patient for free. He was soon diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, not ulcers. The cancer progressed quickly, and as the man was ineligible for health care he struggled to obtain proper treatment. In the terminal stages of the illness, he was threatened with removal as his application for protection has been refused at all levels. Clearly unfit for travel, he lived out his remaining months in Australia living off the charity of others while his illness progressed without appropriate access to treatment or palliative care. Another man held in immigration detention for many years became severely depressed and suicidal. Such severe mental health issues have been linked to long term detention. His claims for refugee protection were finally refused at all levels. In the days before he was removed, he was held in an isolation room within the detention centre for observation as he was considered to be at a high risk of suicide. The bible was removed from the room in case he tore out the pages to choke himself to death. Two mental health professionals assessed him as being suicidal and, consequently, unfit for travel. Despite these concerns for his mental health, he was removed to a country with no arrangements for support or handover on arrival. These are two of the men who have lived out the drastic consequences of asylum policy. Recent changes within the Department of Immigration and Citizenship have made some major progress in the asylum and removal practices. However, the underlying policies remain unaltered. Changes must be made to ensure Australia’s policies are not detrimental to the health and wellbeing of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> Plans to implement removal should be reconsidered for seriously ill individuals who have no prospect of ongoing care on return. There are gross inequalities throughout the world in terms of health care, wealth and security, and the removal of seriously ill <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> from Australia brings to light these stark differences. The current system means this tragic reality is compounded by the actions of the Australian government. Removing <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> from Australia is a painful consequence of government policy. Removing those whose illness has been cultivated, or even induced, by government policy is an abhorrent neglect of responsibility. • Robyn Sampson is a research officer at the Refugee Health Research Centre at La Trobe University and has recently published the report Removing Seriously Ill <b>Asylum</b> <b>Seekers</b> from Australia in conjunction with the Asylum Seeker Project at Hotham Mission.

40|$|This {{research}} articulates a dialectical {{theory of}} the border. It argues that the border {{should be viewed as}} a ‘concrete abstraction’ that is at once reified as an ideal object, and extends both spatially and temporally to bear down on the concrete experience of day-to-day life in divisive and often malign ways. The research explores the tragedy of the border for those on whom it bears down and pushes in to destitution, and attempts to challenge this injustice. This is an ethnographic study, and particular focus is given to the experiences of destitute <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> making use of a network of night shelters provided by the Boaz Trust in Manchester, UK.

I also examine the attempts of volunteers working in the shelters to press against such injustices, exploring these attempts within an understanding of justice as coming in to being through repetitive, arduous and often banal practices of care, and as speculative, fragile and always incomplete...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{compulsory}} dispersal of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> introduced following the Immigration & Asylum Act 1999. This policy was formulated {{in an environment}} of mistrust towards <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> had an explicit deterrence element and was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> refugees without secure status were dispersed across the UK. This thesis examines the formal and informal social exclusion inherent in this system and the specific impacts on the ability of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to access services and maintain or create social networks. These were investigated in order to explore the sense of 'belonging', 'inclusion' and longer term effects on the process of resettlement for those awarded refugee status. The main methods used were qualitative combined with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software to provide a spatial analysis of dispersal. Field research carried out between November 2002 and February 2005 consisted of in-depth interviews, focus groups and participant observation with <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> refugees and key informants in three dispersal locations. Interviews were also conducted with policy makers and other key informants in London. A range of published and unpublished secondary sources have been utilised. A key finding was that multiple forms of social exclusion of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> exist. These different forms relate to the declining entitlements of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> as well as the geography, structure and process of the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) system. A significant relationship between dispersalocations and areas of deprivation combined with the tensions of the structure and process of implementing dispersal results in a system that maintains <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in a state of limbo or liminality. It was found that the system offers limited space available for the restoration of social trust and virtually no space for the restoration of political or institutional trust. It is concluded that the primary lens for understanding the experiences of social exclusion of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> throughout dispersal is policy-imposed liminality and that resistance to liminality {{is the way in which}} <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> begin to acquire a sense of 'belonging' or 'inclusion'...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on {{fieldwork}} {{carried out}} in 2002 – 2003, this paper reveals the complexity of interactions between <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in East Anglia as they negotiate the shared experience of place, the British immigration system and a common and competitive goal of attaining refugee status. There is tension and a distrust generated {{by people who are}} forced to live in an inter-ethnic community and share the competitive goal of obtaining immigration status. Yet, this forced coexistence forges strong friendships, alliances and collaboration amongst <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> It is in taking into account these seemingly contradictory interactions that marks the concern of this paper; the more that <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> attempt to distance and differentiate themselves from the collective and shared identity of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> the more entangled they become within a collective <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> identity. This struggle tells us that the very contestation of an <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> identity is a form of resistance put forth by <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to address an identity that is largely imposed by the state and host society. This has broader implications {{on the extent to which}} an imposed identity and its resistance impact on the successful integration of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees into larger society...|$|R
40|$|The {{refugee crisis}} in Europe {{has created a}} {{significant}} challenge for European policy makers, {{both in terms of}} receiving <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and integrating them into their new communities. Among other methods of refugee integration, the ability of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to find work soon after arrival is particularly important to the future welfare of refugees and of their host countries. On this issue, the European response has been mixed: for example, France has historically taken a restrictive stance to prevent <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> from working to make the country less attractive to “fake refugees,” while Sweden allows <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to work near instantly upon arrival in the hope they can find work quickly and sustain themselves as their claim is being evaluated. This paper evaluates best practices for the labor market integration of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees, before reviewing the historical development of labor market integration policies for <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in France since WWII. It uses the case of Sweden’s open labor market policy for <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to explain why France followed a different policy strategy, and finally suggest paths to improving the labor market integration of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in France.

50|$|The {{number of}} <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> {{assessed}} as genuine refugees via the Pacific Solution process {{was lower than}} for onshore processing. 68 per cent of the <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> were deemed genuine refugees and less than 40 per cent of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> sent to Nauru received resettlement in Australia. A 2006 report by the Australian Human Rights Commission showed that of the 1509 <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> sent to Nauru by that time, 586 were granted Australian resettlement (39%), 360 resettled in New Zealand (24%), 19 resettled in Sweden (1.2%), 10 in Canada (<1%) and 4 in Norway (<1%).
