5|$|Halo 3 {{does not}} {{natively}} render at true HD resolution (at least 720 lines of vertical resolution). In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was {{confirmed that the}} game renders at 1152×640 resolution <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use. This is because Halo 3 uses two frame buffers <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate. The image can be upscaled to 1080p by the Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|As a senior, he {{was named}} Indiana Mr. Basketball and led Homestead to a first-ever state title. He was ranked as a top-20 {{national}} prospect in his class. He was named a McDonald's All-American. Swanigan averaged 22.6 points and 13.7 rebounds as a senior. Academically, Swanigan maintained a 3.1 GPA and graduated in three years <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> four.|$|E
5|$|Before {{principal}} photography began, Nargis and Raaj Kumar familiarised {{themselves with}} farming {{practices such as}} ploughing the fields, reaping and sowing, and cotton picking. The extras in the song and dance sequences of the film were from local dance groups in villages where the shooting took place <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> ones from Mumbai.|$|E

5|$|Production and {{broadcast}} of the fourth season were interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and following its resolution, the writers were unable to compress the remainder of season four into the five allotted episodes and the season finale was extended by one hour. Subsequently, the production schedule was compressed and post-production work was completed in three weeks, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> two months.|$|E
5|$|The most {{striking}} sign {{of this was}} his mode of forming a board of trustees; for, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> effort to tie up the organization forever in some sect, party or clique, he had named the best men of his town — his political opponents {{as well as his}} friends; and had added to them the pastors of all the principal churches, Catholic and Protestant.|$|E
5|$|There are {{grotesque}} {{figures of}} vetalas (ghosts) on the pilasters of jaga mohan {{and on the}} faces of vimana of the temple. The figures of nagas (snake-man) and their female counterparts nagins and other females show many graceful but chaste poses. Pilgrimage is the theme of many of the scenes on the vimana. The other notable descriptive representation on the vimana is the hunting scene above the central niche on the south side, where stags are depicted running away from a hunter. On the outermost frame around the latticed window of the jaganamohana, delightful scenes of monkeys playing all manners of pranks are depicted. The vimana of the temple is a triratha with a distant semblance of a Pancharatha as evident from the projecting niches flanking the central projection. The bada of the vimana abruptly starts from the talapatna or pavement which consists of three elements <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> five and encloses a parallelepiped <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> cubic sanctum.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> {{featuring}} <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> show closing theme, Liberace's {{version of}} [...] "I'll Be Seeing You" [...] was played over the end credits.|$|R

50|$|Fit large {{horizontal}} control surfaces at <b>the</b> stern <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more <b>usual</b> bow-mounted dive planes; this improved directional stability {{and may have}} decreased turbulence-induced drag.|$|R
5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike {{at the corner}} of a square guard) <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon.|$|E
5|$|NSB soon bought all {{the shares}} of the company, and also made an {{agreement}} that operations on the Arendal Line would {{be taken over by}} Timetoget. However, the new company tried to take a short-cut in giving engineers only a six-week training program, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> 18 months. This made NSB want to discontinue operations. They bought {{out the rest of the}} shareholders, and liquidated the company. Timetoget never ran anything but trials on the Bratsberg Line.|$|E
5|$|Palace Cinema (set number 10232) was {{released}} in March 2013, and is the eighth set in the Modular Building line and the third corner building. The set contains 2194 pieces and has two floors. Palace Cinema is the first Modular Building set to be released with the LEGO Creator Expert branding on its box and so far {{is the only one}} to include stickers. Also, Palace Cinema is the second Modular Building set to have only two floors, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> 3, and include a vehicle, a black car styled loosely on a Buick.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> English {{spelling}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name, George, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> Georges, <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> French spelling, {{is explained}} by his having been named in honour of King George III.|$|R
50|$|Wong's {{growth was}} {{characterized}} by going against market trends, being more customer-service-oriented <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more <b>usual</b> self-service and investing during some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peruvian economy's hardest times.|$|R
50|$|Since that time, some {{universities}} in North America {{have taken to}} awarding a Doctor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University or D.Univ. as an honorary degree <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more <b>usual</b> LL.D.|$|R
5|$|The 300 Bloor–Danforth bus {{provides}} late-night {{service to}} {{the area around the}} stations when the subway is not in operation. This service operates frequently along Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue between East/West Mall and Kennedy Stn via Danforth Road, Brimley Road, Eglinton Avenue East, North/South Service Road, Transway Crescent and Kennedy Road. On Sundays, these routes operate through the early morning hours, because the subway starts at 9:00a.m. <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> 6:00a.m. Frequency is 6–30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|This puffball was {{originally}} described in 1790 by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard as Lycoperdon utriforme, and since then, has been variously {{placed in the}} genera Bovista, Lycoperdon, Calvatia, and Utraria. In 1989, German mycologist Hanns Kreisel described the genus Handkea to include species of Calvatia that had distinct microscopic features: Handkea species have a unique type of capillitium (coarse thick-walled hyphae in the gleba), with curvy slits <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> pores. Although accepted by some authors, the genus concept has been rejected by others.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory {{court of}} the Diocese of Worcester issued a {{marriage}} licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> three times, and {{six months after the}} marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583. Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.|$|E
50|$|This rather {{distinctive}} locomotive had plate 10 ft wheels <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more <b>usual</b> spoked ones, <b>the</b> {{carrying wheels}} being 5 ft. The 14 x 20 in cylinders were fed from a doubled-domed boiler.|$|R
50|$|The Toyota Camatte is an {{electric}} concept car unveiled at the June 2012 Tokyo Toy Show <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more <b>usual</b> Tokyo Motor Show. The name 'Camatte' {{comes from the}} Japanese word 'kamau', meaning 'care'.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{singularities}} <b>of</b> this celebration {{include the}} medieval set up <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parades where the brotherhoods use monk´s robes <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most <b>usual</b> nazareno´s conical hat, torch fire <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> candles or male choirs <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> marching bands.|$|R
5|$|By early 1952, Robey was {{becoming}} noticeably frail, {{and he lost}} interest in many of his sporting pastimes. Instead, he stayed at home and drew comic sketches featuring the Prime Minister of Mirth. In May he filmed The Pickwick Papers, in which he {{played the role of}} old Tony Weller, a part which he had initially turned down on health grounds. The following year, and in aid of the games fund, he starred as Clown in a short pantomime at the Olympic Variety Show at the Victoria Palace Theatre. Organisers asked for him to appear in the Prime Minister of Mirth costume <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> clown garb, a request the comedian was happy to fulfil.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Famicom's {{restricted}} hardware capabilities, the remake {{is entirely}} two-dimensional. Special compensation {{was made for}} some of the in-battle sprites such as Cloud Strife's, combining two 16x24 pixel sprites side-by-side <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> single sprite to account for weapons such as Cloud's sword or Barret's gun. While most Japanese games use only 8x8-pixel hiragana or katakana fonts, and most Chinese games use 4-color 16x16-pixel tiles stored in dedicated CHR ROM pages, this game uses its own several-hundred 16x16-pixel monochrome font instead. The script itself is strewn in chunks across the code; {{at the beginning of each}} piece of text for dialog boxes is a three digit number preceded by an @-symbol, signifying which character portrait to display.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of October 19, 2013, a BART employee and a contractor, who were inspecting tracks, were struck and killed near Walnut Creek by a train being moved for routine maintenance. A labor strike by BART's two major unions was underway at the time, which cause BART to use an undertrained operator. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> 14 weeks of the training, the operator only received four. The BART trainer {{was not in the}} cab with the operator at the time of impact but was instead in the passenger compartment. BART was fined $600,000 for the incident.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> title, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> {{employing}} <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> [...] "hare" [...] vs. [...] "hair" [...] pun, {{is standard}} spelling, for the expression that indicates thoughtlessness or recklessness. Elmer Fudd permanently {{goes back to}} his regular design starting with this cartoon.|$|R

50|$|The bridge had an {{important}} role during the Ottoman-Habsburg wars. After Suleiman crossed the river Drava at Osijek during his fifth imperial campaign in 1532, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> taking <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> route for Vienna, he turned westwards into Ferdinand's held Hungarian territory.|$|R
5|$|The Papuan swiftlet, Aerodramus papuensis, {{has three}} toes <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> four in this group. It {{has the ability}} to echolocate, but whereas other {{previously}} studied species use echolocation primarily while flying in their caves, the Papuan swiftlet appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses echolocation while active outside at night. It uses single, not double, clicks. DNA sequence data provides strong support for a basal relationship between A. papuensis and other Aerodramus taxa and suggest that this species and the waterfall swift Hydrochous gigas, are sister taxa, a relationship that would indicate paraphyly of the genus Aerodramus.|$|E
5|$|The {{field for}} the main event {{consisted}} only of 30 trucks <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> 36, with the top 20 trucks in the owner's points standings guaranteed a spot. To determine the field, two-lap qualifying runs were held, which determined the starting grids for five heat races of eight laps each. The top five fastest qualifiers started on the pole for the heats, and the highest non-locked-in truck were transferred in to the main event until there were 25 trucks in the field. For drivers that did not qualify via the heats, the top four in a last-chance qualifier advance, with the final spot reserved for the most recent series champion, and if that spot is vacant, the fifth-place finisher in the LCQ would qualify for the main event.|$|E
5|$|The seventh season {{saw another}} format change, as fighters had to compete to be {{official}} castmembers. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> 16 fighters, the season had 32 fighters after Dana White {{claimed that he}} was tired of fighters coming onto the show for airtime. This season was coached by UFC Light Heavyweight champion Quinton Jackson and challenger Forrest Griffin, the first season's winner. The season's final was due to be competed between Amir Sadollah, who hadn't competed in a professional fight before the show, and Jesse Taylor. However, Taylor was kicked off the show after filming had completed, when he kicked the window out of a limosine in Las Vegas. His slot was taken by C.B. Dollaway who defeated Tim Credeur for the right, but Sadollah won in the final to become The Ultimate Fighter.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> open-air service <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greenbelt festival <b>of</b> 2009, worshipers were {{encouraged}} to greet each other with <b>the</b> 'elbow bump <b>of</b> peace' <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more <b>usual</b> 'holy kiss' during <b>the</b> Christian rite <b>of</b> peace, because of concerns over swine flu.|$|R
50|$|Roughly {{opposite}} Embarkation Park, {{there is}} a terrace of homes designed in the Federation Filigree style, using woodwork <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more <b>usual</b> wrought iron. They are an unusual sight in Sydney, where terraced homes are almost invariably designed in Victorian styles.|$|R
50|$|Pakenham Mill is a five storey tower mill. It has a domed {{cap with}} a gallery and is winded by a fantail.
