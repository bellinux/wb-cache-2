5|$|The Miracles {{recorded}} the song first and included their version on their 1968 album, Special Occasion. The Marvin Gaye version {{was placed on}} his 1968 album In the Groove, where it gained the attention of radio disc jockeys, and Motown founder Berry Gordy finally agreed to its release as a single in October 1968, when <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the top of the}} Billboard Pop Singles chart for seven weeks from December 1968 to January 1969 and became for a time the biggest hit single on the Motown label (Tamla).|$|E
5|$|Al-Talaba {{returned}} to winning ways under {{the management of}} Jamal Ali in the 1988–89 season, which was played in a different format to previous seasons. They finished fourth in the Baghdad Group, just ahead of Al-Shorta, {{to qualify for the}} final tournament, where they finished second in Group 1, behind Al-Zawraa, to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, Al-Talaba defeated Al-Tayaran 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. In the final, Al-Talaba faced their rivals, Al-Rasheed, at the Al-Shaab Stadium. The match ended 1–1 at full time with their goal scored by Ali Hussein. <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> penalties where Hussein Saeed missed his penalty and enabled Al-Rasheed to win 5–4. That season, Al-Talaba also finished as runners-up in the Al-Intisar Cup, behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya.|$|E
5|$|Based on an {{expected}} audience {{of up to}} 13million, ITV raised the prices of their 30-second advertising slots during the final from between £100,000 and £150,000 {{to as much as}} £250,000. It was estimated that ITV would stand to make £9million in advertising revenue during the final, rising to £10million if <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> extra time and penalties; this compared with amounts of £2–3million normally received for its Wednesday night schedule and £3–4million for a Champions League final with no British teams involved. Among the confirmed advertisers on ITV were Ford, Cadbury, Nike, Heineken, Audi and BlackBerry. Sky's advertising prices were not reported, but among their scheduled advertisers were Audi, Ford, Nike, Samsung and Pepsi.|$|E

5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> war with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|Glee: The Music, Volume1 is {{the debut}} soundtrack album by {{the cast of}} the musical {{television}} series Glee, which aired on Fox in the United States. It features cover versions from the first nine episodes of the first season and was released on November2, 2009 by Columbia Records and 20th Century Fox Television Records. The album received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising large ensemble numbers, but comparing it to karaoke tracks. <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> number one on album charts in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and peaked at number three in Australia and number four in both Canada and the United States. Volume1 has been certified platinum in these five countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1878 Long unsuccessfully {{challenged}} the incumbent Rice for the gubernatorial nomination. When Rice {{announced his retirement}} the following year, Long again sought the nomination. <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> former Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot, but Long won the lieutenant governor nomination by acclamation. The Democratic opposition was divided by Benjamin Butler's return to that party, and the Republican ticket won the general election. Long capitalized on Talbot's avoidance of public ceremonies to maintain a high profile despite his post's relative unimportance. He was easily nominated for governor when Talbot announced he would not run for reelection, {{despite a lack of}} support from the party leadership. The election was highly divisive, pitting Long against Butler and the divided Democrats. Long was criticized for his lack of Civil War service and attacked for his diversions from the party line, but won a comfortable victory. He was reelected by comfortable margins the two following years.|$|E

5|$|In the 1999–2000 season, Arsenal {{participated in}} the Premier League. Despite the loss of striker Nicolas Anelka to Real Madrid, the club {{significantly}} strengthened in the summer, signing defenders Oleg Luzhny and Sylvinho as well as forwards Davor Šuker and Thierry Henry. Inconsistent performances in the league against lowly opposition meant Arsenal never posed a serious title challenge, ending the campaign as runners-up, 18 points behind Manchester United. The club had another poor season in the Champions League, finishing third in their group; this won them a consolation place in the UEFA Cup and Arsenal managed {{to go all the}} way to the final, where they faced Galatasaray in Copenhagen. The match ended in a 0–0 draw with few chances for either side to score; <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> penalties and Arsenal lost after Šuker and Patrick Vieira missed their spot-kicks.|$|E

The third recording was in 1967 with Gladys Knight and the Pips in a new, faster arrangement. Gordy accepted the new arrangement and the Gladys Knight version was released as a single in September 1967, reaching number 2 in the charts. When Gaye's album with his version of Grapevine was released in August 1968, radio disc jockeys were playing the song, so Gordy had it released as a single in October, and <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> number one in December.|$|E
5|$|P. S. Raman, {{who went}} to Chennai in 1963 to join a medical college, was asked to see Sridhar, who was auditioning {{newcomers}} for the film. Raman was renamed Ravichandran and introduced in this film, as the character Ashok. Sivakumar had auditioned for the role before <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Ravichandran. During a flight, Sridhar met an air-hostess named Vasundhara Devi and approached her to play one of the female leads. Because she shared her name with Vasundhara Devi, the mother of actress Vyjayanthimala, Sridhar renamed her Kanchana to avoid confusion. Telugu actor Krishna has stated that he was offered {{a role in the}} film by Sridhar, but he could not accept it due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written {{to be in her}} late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, she did not think that she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was created {{at the end}} of August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War as the 2nd East Lancashire Division, a second-line formation of the East Lancashire Division, composed primarily of soldiers from eastern Lancashire and the industrial towns around Manchester. After training and home service, <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the Western Front in early 1917 and on 9 October, fought at the Battle of Poelcappelle. In March 1918, it suffered extremely heavy losses during Operation Michael the German Spring Offensive and was withdrawn from the line and reduced to a cadre to be rebuilt. It returned to the front in time for the Battle of Cambrai, part of the Hundred Days Offensive and the Battle of the Selle. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918, it was stationed in Belgium, where it was demobilised in March 1919.|$|E

It {{was also the first}} album to chart on the Billboard 200 due to vinyl sales alone since the CD had become the dominant format at that time. When Vitalogy {{was released}} on CD and cassette on December 6, 1994, <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling more than 877,000 copies in its first week.

5|$|After {{a year in}} London, Kempelen and the Turk {{travelled}} to Leipzig, {{stopping in}} various European cities along the way. From Leipzig, <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Dresden, where Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Racknitz viewed the Turk and published his findings in Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung, along with illustrations showing his beliefs about how the machine operated. It then moved to Amsterdam, after which Kempelen {{is said to have}} accepted an invitation to the Sanssouci palace in Potsdam of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. The story goes that Frederick enjoyed the Turk so much that he paid a large sum of money to Kempelen in exchange for the Turk's secrets. Frederick never gave the secret away, but was reportedly disappointed to learn how the machine worked. (This story is almost certainly apocryphal; {{there is no evidence of}} the Turk's encounter with Frederick, the first mention of which comes in the early 19th century, by which time the Turk was also incorrectly said to have played against George III of England.) It seems most likely that the machine stayed dormant at Schönbrunn Palace for over two decades, although Kempelen attempted unsuccessfully to sell it in his final years. Kempelen died at the age of 70 on 26 March 1804.|$|E
5|$|Argento {{reportedly}} {{offered the}} lead role of Peter Neal to Christopher Walken, but eventually <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Anthony Franciosa. Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as {{he was capable of}} bringing more to the role than the script asked of him. He also believed that if Walken had been cast, it would have been more obvious that he was the killer. According to Jones and Daria Nicolodi, the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one. In addition, Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time, but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during the filming of Suspiria. Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a brief appearance in Tenebrae. By her own account, she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrowwhich ultimately went to Veronica Lario. Nicolodi was, according to Alan Jones, cast as the woman on the beach in Neal's flashback. Conversely, Thomas Rostock opines that Nicolodi was never intended for that role, only that of Jane. Transgender actress Eva Robin's was later hired to play the woman on the beach.|$|E
5|$|Before the Tests, Fingleton {{expected}} the English batsmen to struggle against Miller and Lindwall; he believed that, accustomed to prolific scoring against low-quality bowling in county cricket, these batsmen {{would be unable}} to adapt to the demands of facing world-class opposition. England won the toss and batted first on the opening morning of the First Test at Trent Bridge. There had been overnight rain, which meant that the pitch would initially be favourable towards fast bowlers. Opening the bowling with Lindwall, Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> ground. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton with a faster ball, leaving England at 1/9. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad, but praised Miller for his ability to make occasional deliveries skid on faster, surprising the batsman.|$|E

5|$|Following Shooting Accuracy, {{both teams}} {{participated in the}} Skills Challenge Relay. Each team broke into two groups and went {{through a series of}} drills {{designed}} to showcase players' skills. It started with one timers, then proceeded to passing, where a single player had to complete a pass into six small nets. From there <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the Puck Control Relay, having a participant skate through a series of cones with a puck. Another player then took on the Stick Handling drill, controlling a puck through a series of stationary pucks. The relay ended when a final player completed the Shooting Accuracy, again hitting all four targets. The two groups from Team Lidstrom finished first and third in the competition, gaining their team a total of five points. During the Hardest Shot competition reigning champion Zdeno Chara was defeated in his preliminary round match up by Shea Weber. In the final round, Chara again matched up with Weber. Chara successfully defended his title by defeating Weber with a shot registering 105.9mph. The speed set a new SuperSkills record surpassing his own record and marking the fourth time he has won the event. Despite being down by a large margin prior to the Elimination Shootout, Team Lidstrom still had an opportunity to win the contest. Players continued to shoot provided they scored – scoring one point per goal, until only one player remained. However, the shoot-out was won by Team Staal's Corey Perry as he was the only player to score in all three of his attempts. The full results are listed below.|$|E
