50|$|Whereas <b>Jew's</b> <b>harp</b> {{music is}} {{predominantly}} {{played with a}} drone, i.e., the one fundamental note is sounding throughout the playing, the tradition in Austrian folk music since about the 18th century has been to use multiple <b>Jew's</b> <b>harps</b> tuned to the main degree of a diatonic scale that are used according to the chords of the music. Thus, Austrian <b>Jew's</b> <b>harp</b> music uses typical Western harmony. In recognition of this special development, the UNESCO has included Austrian <b>Jew's</b> <b>harp</b> playing in its Intangible Cultural Heritage list.|$|R
