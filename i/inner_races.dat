40|$|Bearing {{damage in}} modern inverter-fed AC drive systems {{is more common}} than in motors working with 50 or 60 Hz power supply. Fast {{switching}} transients and common mode voltage generated by a PWM inverter cause unwanted shaft voltage and resultant bearing currents. Parasitic capacitive coupling creates a path to discharge current in rotors and bearings. In order to analyze bearing current discharges and their effect on bearing damage under different conditions, calculation of the capacitive coupling between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>races</b> is needed. During motor operation, the distances between the balls and races may change the capacitance values. Due to changing of the thickness and spatial distribution of the lubricating grease, this capacitance {{does not have a}} constant value and is known to change with speed and load. Thus, the resultant electric field between the races and balls varies with motor speed. The lubricating grease in the ball bearing cannot withstand high voltages and a short circuit through the lubricated grease can occur. At low speeds, because of gravity, balls and shaft voltage may shift down and the system (ball positions and shaft) will be asymmetric. In this study, two different asymmetric cases (asymmetric ball position, asymmetric shaft position) are analyzed and the results are compared with the symmetric case. The objective {{of this paper is to}} calculate the capacitive coupling and electric fields between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>races</b> and the balls at different motor speeds in symmetrical and asymmetrical shaft and balls positions. The analysis is carried out using finite element simulations to determine the conditions which will increase the probability of high rates of bearing failure due to current discharges through the balls and races. ...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method to}} solve the {{rotating}} machinery fault diagnosis problem is proposed, {{which is based on}} principal components analysis (PCA) to extract the characteristic features and the Morlet kernel support vector machine (MSVM) to achieve the fault classification. Firstly, the gathered vibration signals were decomposed by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to obtain the corresponding intrinsic mode function (IMF). The EMD energy entropy that includes dominant fault information is defined as the characteristic features. However, the extracted features remained high-dimensional, and excessive redundant information still existed. So, the PCA is introduced to extract the characteristic features and reduce the dimension. The characteristic features are input into the MSVM to train and construct the running state identification model; the rotating machinery running state identification is realized.

A disadvantage of such proposals is that during startup, acceleration, and shutdown high pressure fluids are not available for hydrostatic bearings.

40|$|The {{development}} of a tool called the Service Load Factor (SLF) for railway tapered roller bearings using residual stress and retained austenite data is presented. Case-carburized tapered roller bearings used in the railroad industry are manufactured with a dual-phase microstructure that consists primarily of tempered martensite and retained austenite. The retained austenite phase is metastable, and will transform to martensite with sufficient thermal or mechanical energy during service. The increase in surface volume because of transformation, and the subsequent increase in compressive residual stress could indicate the onset of certain failure modes, including fatigue spalling.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to design and construct a high speed turbocharger test rig (TTR) to measure dynamics of differing turbocharger rotor bearing systems {{and to develop a}} coupled rotor-cartridge model for the ball bearing rotor system to corroborate the experimental and analytical results. The ball bearing rotor is supported by an angular contact ball bearing cartridge. In order to achieve the {{objectives of}} the experimental aspect of this study, a TTR was designed and developed with the capability of reaching speeds in excess of 100, 000 rpm driven by compressed air. The TTR was used to compare and contrast the whirl and friction characteristics of two identical turbochargers differing only by the support structure of the rotor system; one containing a floating ring bearing turbocharger (FRBT) and the other a ball bearing turbocharger (BBT). A pair of displacement sensors was installed to measure the whirl of the rotor {{near the end of the}} compressor. The BBT was shown to be significantly more rigid and stable as compared to the FRBT with an average reduction in radial rotor motion of 47 %. The motion of the BBT consisted of mainly synchronous motion whereas the FRBT was dominated by subsynchronous motion throughout the entire range of speeds. The TTR was also used to compare frictional losses within the bearings. A study of run-down times after the pressurized air supply was removed indicated that the BBT has significantly lower frictional losses under all operating conditions tested with an average increase in run-down time of 14. 1 %. ^ A wireless telemetry based temperature sensor was designed specifically for the turbocharger ball bearing system to monitor the internal bearing temperature located on the cage during operation. It was shown to be able to withstand the harsh environments of turbocharger fnapplications operating at high speeds. The sensor accurately monitored transient bearing cage temperature due to changes in operating speed. ^ Custom sensors were developed in order to measure the axial forces acting on the rotor due to aerodynamic effects. The sensors utilized cantilever beams outfitted with strain gages to measure the applied load from the bearing cartridge. Results of dynamic testing indicated the magnitude and direction of the axial force is dependent on the operating conditions of the turbine and compressor. ^ To achieve the objectives of the analytical investigation, the explicit finite element method (EFEM) and the discrete element method (DEM) were coupled to investigate dynamics of flexible rotor systems supported by deep groove ball bearings. DEM was used to develop the dynamic bearing model (DBM) in which all of the components of the bearing (i. e. races, balls, and cage) have six degrees-of-freedom. The flexible shaft was modeled with a full 3 D elastic formulation using the EFEM. Rotor and <b>inner</b> <b>races</b> of the bearings were fully coupled such that both translation and rotation of the flexible rotor are transmitted to the bearings. The resulting reaction forces and moments calculated in DBM were in turn applied to the nodes of the shaft. The combined rotor-bearing model was used to investigate the motions of the <b>inner</b> <b>races</b> at low speeds and the resulting reaction forces and moments from the supporting bearings due to a large applied load on the shaft. In the current coupled modeling approach, the deformation of the shaft affected the internal components of the bearing by altering the orientation of the inner race which results in ball spin and slip. The preceding rotor-bearing model was extended to represent the turbocharger rotor-cartridge system that is under consideration. A DEM angular contact ball bearing cartridge model was coupled with an EFEM shaft to simulate the dynamics of the turbocharger test rig. The bearing cartridge consists of a common outer ring, a pair of split <b>inner</b> <b>races,</b> and a row of balls on each end of the cartridge. The coupled rotor-cartridge model was used to investigate the shaft motion and bearing dynamics as the system traverses critical speeds. The analytical and experimental shaft motion results were in close agreement. The cartridge model allowed for thorough investigation of bearing component dynamics. Effects of ball material properties were found to have a significant impact on turbocharger rotor and bearing dynamics. ...|$|E

This analysis examined the microstructural changes produced in these layers by examining the retained austenite content, residual stress, texture, diffracting particle size, microhardness, cone bore, and metallographic structure. A postproduction cryogenic thermal treatment was used to alter the retained austenite profile on selected cones. ^ The results of this research have shown that postproduction cryogenic thermal treatment results in a reduction of the as-produced retained austenite profile due to its transformation to martensite, a reduction in the surface compressive residual stress in the martensite, an increase in the surface tensile residual stress in the austenite, and an increase in cone bore diameter. In addition, the diffracting particle size of the austenite was also reduced. ^ Assessment of as-produced and cryogenically treated test cones as a function of simulated service mileage indicated that cryogenically treated cones experienced less transformation of retained austenite during rolling contact loading but developed compressive surface residual stresses of similar magnitude as the as-produced cones. Subsurface residual compressive stresses were significantly less in the cryogenically treated cones, but cone bore growth was reduced. ...|$|E

Meanwhile, {{the application}} of mahalanobis distance was found to be suitable for clustering the results from principle component analysis. Uniquely, it was discovered that the spectrums from healthy and <b>inner</b> <b>race</b> defect bearing can be clearly distinguished from each other even though the change in amplitude pattern for <b>inner</b> <b>race</b> defect frequency spectrum was too small compared to the healthy one. In this work, it was demonstrated that the use of principle component analysis could sensitively detect the change in the pattern of the frequency spectrums. Likewise, the implementation of mahalanobis distance model for clustering purpose was found to be significant for bearing defect identification...|$|R
