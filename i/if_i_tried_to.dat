5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E

I'm selling my wheat at 25 cents a bushel. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sell a steer tomorrow I'd probably hardly get enough to pay the freight. I get three cents a dozen for eggs.

500|$|Michael Stipe {{sings in}} what R.E.M. biographer David Buckley {{described}} as [...] "wailing, keening, arching vocal figures". Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs; {{in the chorus}} for [...] "Stand", Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue. Early articles about the band focused on Stipe's singing style (described as [...] "mumbling" [...] by The Washington Post), which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable. Creem writer John Morthland wrote in his review of Murmur, [...] "I still {{have no idea what}} these songs are about, because neither me nor anyone else I know has ever been able to discern R.E.M.'s lyrics." [...] Stipe commented in 1984, [...] "It's just the way I sing. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> control it, it would be pretty false." [...] Producer Joe Boyd convinced Stipe to begin singing more clearly during the recording of Fables of the Reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|David Renwick found {{writing the}} fifth series and the 1997 Christmas special [...] "Endgame" [...] difficult, {{and he was}} {{becoming}} increasingly busy with his detective series Jonathan Creek. In early 1998, his concerns appeared in the national press. The Evening Standard quoted him: [...] "I have no new ideas for Victor Meldrew ... I know that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> write another series it would be even harder than the Christmas one. I don't want the standard to drop [...] {{there would be no}} point in doing something I didn't believe in." [...] A year later, Renwick agreed to write a final series of One Foot, having found the four-year break after writing the fifth series fruitful. Renwick decided that Victor should die in the final episode because {{he did not want to}} be persuaded to write another series. He cites the final episode of the Only Fools and Horses 1996 Christmas specials [...] "where the fantastic closing scenes of the Trilogy saw the Trotters walking up the Yellow Brick Road, only for them to return a couple of years later". He did not want to be constantly asked by journalists and fans when Victor was coming back to their screens.|$|E
2500|$|These {{ancillary}} fees {{include those}} for checking luggage, carrying on luggage (other {{than a small}} personal item), buying food and drinks on board, obtaining advance seat assignments, and more. Allegiant CEO Maurice Gallagher said in 2009, [...] "We collect $110 from you {{at the end of}} your trip. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> charge you $110 up front, you wouldn't pay it. But if I sell you a $75 ticket and you self-select the rest, you will." ...|$|E

And if anybody wants to read it, let him. But why anybody should read one single word if he doesn't want to, I don't see. Unless of course he is a critic who needs to scribble a dollar's worth of words, no matter how.|$|R

2500|$|Later in the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama cited his {{crafting}} of {{this speech}} {{as an example}} of a [...] "gut decision". Speaking to journalist Joe Klein in October 2008, Obama said that he decided to make his response to Rev. Wright's comments [...] "big as opposed to make it small", and added: [...] "My gut was telling me that this was a teachable moment and that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do the usual political damage control instead of talking to the American people like ... they were adults and could understand the complexities of race, I would be not only doing damage to the campaign but missing an important opportunity for leadership." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout her career, Vélez's onscreen {{persona of}} a hot tempered, lusty [...] "wild" [...] woman was closely tied to her off screen personality. The press often {{referred}} to her by such names as [...] "The Mexican Spitfire", [...] "The Mexican It girl" [...] and [...] "The Mexican Kitten". Vélez consciously chose to promote her [...] "Whoopee Lupe" [...] persona but dismissed {{the idea that she}} was wild. In an interview she said: [...] "What I attribute my success?, I think, simply, because I'm different. I'm not beautiful, but I have beautiful eyes and know exactly what to do with them. Although the public thinks that I'm a very wild girl. Actually I'm not. I'm just me, Lupe Vélez, simple and natural Lupe. If I'm happy, I dance and sing and acted like a child. And if something irritates me, I cry and sob. Someone called that 'personality.' The Personality is nothing more than behave with others as you really are. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> look and act like Norma Talmadge, the great dramatic actress, or like Corinne Griffith, the aristocrat of the movies, or like Mary Pickford, the sweet and gentle Mary, I would be nothing more than an imitation. I just want to be myself: Lupe Velez." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jobs {{went there}} for the birth after he was {{contacted}} by Robert Friedland, their mutual friend and the farm owner. While distant, Jobs worked with her on {{a name for the}} baby, which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. Brennan suggested the name [...] "Lisa" [...] which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name [...] "Lisa" [...] while he [...] "was also publicly denying paternity." [...] She would discover later that during this time, Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name (his first choice was [...] "Claire" [...] after St. Clare). She also stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby's name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs also worked with his team {{to come up with the}} phrase, [...] "Local Integrated Software Architecture" [...] as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa (decades later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that [...] "obviously, it was named for my daughter"). Brennan would come under intense criticism from Jobs, who claimed that [...] "she doesn't want money, she just wants me." [...] According to Brennan, Apple's Mike Scott wanted Jobs to give her money, while other Apple executives [...] "advised him to ignore me or fight <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> go after a paternity settlement." ...|$|E
