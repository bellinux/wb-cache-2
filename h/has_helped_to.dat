Command is to be handed over to Colonel Breen and Quatermass senses that he is being forced out: however, after the events of the serial, Breen is dead, Quatermass <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> save the world and London is recovering from chaos.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to have been formed from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the mission <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting that it is no more than about 4.25 billion years old.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984 stopped any further geothermal prospecting. Mono Basin {{was the first}} National Scenic Area in the United States. It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater {{and much of the}} northern half of the Mono Craters. Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.|$|E
5|$|There is a shop/post office {{located in}} Inverarish. Accommodation is {{available}} in the old manor of Raasay House, and at various B. There are significant numbers of incomers and holiday homes especially in the south of the island. This <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> arrest the population decline from over 900 in 1803 to 194 in 2001. Some inhabitants belong to the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which strictly observes the Sabbath. On Sundays there are no public services, the playground is closed and, until 2004, the ferry did not run.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury's built {{environment}} has developed around {{the areas of}} East Didsbury, West Didsbury, and Didsbury Village, which separates the two. The Albert Park conservation area, covering much of West Didsbury, places planning restrictions on development, alterations to buildings, and pruning of trees. The areas adjacent to the Mersey lie within the river's flood plain, and so have historically been prone to flooding after heavy rainfall. The last major flooding was in the late 1960s. In the 1970s extensive flood mitigation work carried out along the Mersey Valley through Manchester <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> speed up the passage of floodwater. Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden also acts as an emergency flood basin, storing floodwater until it can be safely released back into the river.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Strickland {{garnered}} positive critical {{comment for}} the romantic comedy Fever Pitch, and in 2007, {{she was a}} cast regular in the television show The Wedding Bells and subsequently {{was added to the}} cast of Private Practice. Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community, in which she says her Southern U.S. background <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> distinguish herself from other blonde-haired actors. She has spoken of an affinity for her strong female characters and a desire to avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman. She also has worked closely with the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) after participating in a storyline in which her Private Practice character Charlotte King was raped.|$|E
5|$|One of the Millennium Projects in the UK was the Scottish Seabird Centre, {{near the}} {{important}} bird sanctuaries on Bass Rock, Fidra {{and the surrounding}} islands. The area is home to huge colonies of gannets, puffins, skuas and other seabirds. The centre allows visitors to watch live video from the islands as well as learn about the threats the birds face {{and how we can}} protect them, and <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> significantly raise the profile of seabird conservation in the UK. Seabird tourism can provide income for coastal communities as well as raise the profile of seabird conservation. For example, the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand attracts 40,000 visitors a year.|$|E
5|$|The VE Commodore {{was well}} {{received}} in the Australian market, where it has consistently outsold rivals in the large car segment. Sales at one point were nearly double that of its closest segment competitor, the Ford Falcon. However, this gap has narrowed since {{the release of a}} new Falcon FG model. VE's position as Australia's outright best selling car was challenged in 2007 and overtaken during some months in 2008 by the Toyota Corolla in the face of increasing petrol prices. However, the release of the Sportwagon in mid-2008 <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> re-establish its number one sales position by accounting for more than 30percent of total Commodore sales. In 2007 the VE Commodore became the fifth Commodore model to receive the Wheels Car of the Year award.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of technology {{by the human}} race has allowed the greater exploitation {{of natural resources and}} <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood. Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{classical}} music grew gradually more experimental and progressive into the mid-20th century, while popular tastes {{have tended to}} stick with well established composers and compositions of the past. The 2004-2005 program at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples is typical of modern Italy: of the eight operas represented, the most recent was Puccini. In symphonic music, of the 26 composers whose music was played, 21 of them were from the 19th century or earlier, composers who use the melodies and harmonies typical of the Romantic era. This focus is common to other European traditions, and is known as postmodernism, a school of thought that draws on earlier harmonic and melodic concepts that pre-date the conceptions of atonality and dissonance. This focus on popular historical composers <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> maintain a continued presence of {{classical music}} across {{a broad spectrum of}} Italian society. When music is part of a public display or gathering, it is often chosen from a very eclectic repertoire that is as likely to include well-known classical music as popular music.|$|E

5|$|The {{craft of}} making reborn dolls {{began in the}} United States in the late 1990s. Reborning follows a long {{tradition}} of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing dolls in order to portray more realism. The internet has allowed doll artists and collectors to create an online society focused on reborn dolls. In 2002, the first reborn was offered on eBay. This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as nurseries. The niche market for the dolls began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who wanted to use the doll as an emotional outlet, either to mother or for therapeutic purposes. Mass media coverage <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> develop the phenomenon in other countries. Reborning enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage of the trend and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers. This has allowed reborners to invent new techniques causing the dolls to become increasingly realistic over time. Magazines, books, organizations, and conventions dedicated to reborn dolls have been started {{as a result of this}} popularity.|$|E
