50|$|In the April 7, 2014 meeting, Maliki {{claims that}} the Americans “lied” about their {{armament}} commitments. A letter addressed to Maliki, dated April 15, 2014, from the overseer of the US weapons delivery program to Iraq {{seems to be a}} direct response to Maliki’s claim. It began with “We have provided you with all that you have asked for.” The significance of this letter is in the clarity that was available to the US administration as to the actual conditions on the <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> at the time. President Obama had made the jayvee analogy to David Remnick a few months earlier. Clearly, there was far more direct engagement by the US in Iraq and the consequent ability to judge the potential for a wider conflict should have been better than the public statements of the Obama administration would indicate.|$|E
50|$|Some {{predicted}} {{that if there}} wasn't a balance of representation between Sunnis and Shias, {{that the country was}} at risk of increased insurgency and perhaps civil war. The current insurgency, lacking the command and control infrastructure needed for large scale military operations, is not equipped to stage more than a haphazard guerrilla campaign. The withdrawal of 150,000 U.S. and British troops on the <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> as desired by about 82 percent of Iraqis, is likely to remove motivation for internal Iraqi conflict, since only about one percent of Iraqis believe that the coalition troops are responsible for any improvements in security in Iraq. According to an interview with Rajaa al-Bhayesh, a political scientist at Baghdad's Mustansiriya University, fear of wider civil conflict—beyond the likely continuation of violence by fringe groups like al Qaeda—is likely to promote the spirit of compromise.|$|E

50|$|After annihilating another {{army of the}} Sassanid Persians {{and their}} Christian Arab allies at the final Battle of Ullais, the Muslims conquered Hira, {{the capital city of}} Mesopotamia in late May 633.

With the fall of the main cities the whole of Southern and Central Iraq, with the exception of Ctesiphon, came under Muslim control. In 634, Abu Bakr ordered Khalid ibn Walid to proceed to Syria with half of his army to command the invasion of the Byzantine Empire. Al-Muthanna bin Harith Al-Shaibani was left as the successor of Khalid. The Sassanids, under their new emperor Yazdgerd III, raised new armies and defeated the Muslims in the Battle of the Bridge, regaining some lost <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The second invasion of Iraq was undertaken under Sa`d ibn Abī Waqqās who, after defeating the Sassanid army at the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah in 636, captured Ctesiphon.
