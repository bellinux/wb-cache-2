40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} {{combined with}} the liberalisation of the energy markets {{has led to the}} emergence of small to medium-scale <b>decentralised</b> <b>generation</b> equipment embedded within transmission and distribution networks. Commonly, such plant is operated by small to medium private enterprises and dispatched independently from centralised resources. The liberalisation of energy markets has also brought about the rise of variable wholesale electricity markets, {{in the form of the}} spot (day-ahead) market and the balancing (intra-day) markets across the EU and beyond. As such, there is much interest in how <b>decentralised</b> <b>generation</b> equipment can be most profitably operated in this context. This paper focuses on short-term forecasting of both heat and electrical loads, along with unit commitment scheduling and economic dispatch optimisation, for a small/medium scale decentralised combined heat and power (CHP) plant. In the work presented the plant is assumed to be equipped with local heat and electricity storage and operating in the presence of fluctuating wholesale energy prices and local loads. The approach adopted builds on recent research employing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models and non-linear boiler efficiency curves, and extends this work into a rolling horizon context. Results are presented which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and investigate the sensitivity of the results with respect to CHP model accuracy and load prediction accuracy. The results indicated that profit is much more sensitive to the accuracy of load predictions than indicated by previous work in the area. The findings also challenge those of recent work in the field, which suggest that a strategy of interacting with the spot (day-ahead) market only is the most profitable for small/medium scale decentralised energy producers. The results presented in this paper indicate that when load prediction inaccuracies are also considered in the CHP optimisation framework, a strategy interacting with both the spot (day-ahead) market and the balancing (intra-day) market is significantly more profitable than a strategy interacting with the spot market only...|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} inverter-interfaced, <b>decentralised</b> <b>generation</b> has incited a {{paradigm}} shift in distribution network design philosophy. Accordingly, the effects of decentralised gener- ation on distribution network power quality, stability and protection have become impor- tant topics within research. Whilst {{the focus of this}} Thesis is protection design philosophy amidst increasing <b>decentralised</b> <b>generation,</b> protection efficacy is indelibly linked to power quality and stability. Ergo, it is prudent that all three areas of research interest are examined. The motivation for this Thesis is to overcome some of the technical constraints that pre- vent the continued proliferation of decentralised energy resources. Further, this Thesis provides simulation tools that will aid in understanding the effects of decentralised gen- eration on the protection adequacy of distribution networks. Generally speaking, there exists no consensus on how much embedded generation is permissible before traditional distribution network design philosophy becomes ineffective in maintaining protection, sta- bility and power quality adequacy. Hence, the work conducted in this Thesis will provide utilities with the knowledge and tools required to cope with the continued proliferation of <b>decentralised</b> <b>generation.</b> Currently, the embedded generation penetration levels in Australia reportedly cause in- stances of over voltage compromising the power quality in distribution networks. This Thesis proposes an over voltage mitigation scheme, which utilises a controller capable of indirectly regulating the voltage magnitude at the terminals of an embedded generator through reactive power absorption and apparent power curtailment. The scheme max- imises the remuneration received by the embedded generator proprietor whilst adhering to voltage standards and does not require an off-line sensitivity analysis or communications infrastructure. The results indicate a proof of concept; however, there exists many con- cerns regarding how such a scheme could be incentivised { or, if necessary, enforced. The scheme operates best when all decentralised generators employ the proposed controller. Instances of protection failure due to <b>decentralised</b> <b>generation</b> are non-existent in Aus- tralian distribution networks and requires a much more significant penetration of embed- ded generation than present. A small-signal analysis tool is required to determine whether the connection of an embedded generator will cause fault discrimination issues. Small- signal analysis is time-intensive and requires a large amount of information to accurately model the fault response of an embedded generator. This Thesis provides an alternative to small-signal analysis via an iterative solver that predicts the prefault, fault-instant and steady-state fault data. Utilisation of the proposed solver allows a thorough protection analysis study of a distribution network for every fault type and location. A report is then generated containing the specific information relevant to a protection engineer. The strengths and limitations of the proposed solver are detailed and compared with small- signal analysis. The proposed solver is capable of greatly improving the productivity of protection engineers when dealing with large penetrations of embedded generation. This Thesis extends into the natural evolution of embedded generation proliferation, namely, the microgrid concept. Some alterations to contemporaneous microgrid design philosophies are proffered with the intention of improving the ability of islanded embed- ded generation protection devices to discern the presence of high impedance single-phase to earth fault. An iterative solver is also developed to calculate the fault response of islanded embedded generation when employing conventional droop control developed for microgrid applications. The solver is capable of identifying the prefault, fault-instant and steady-state fault data including the island frequency. A key contribution of this Thesis is the introduction of a voltage sequence protection scheme. Results indicate that the voltage sequence protection scheme possesses excellent fault discrimination capabilities for islanded networks rich in inverter-interfaced generators. The findings of this Thesis contain conceptual significance with numerous possible ap- plications in future networks should the proliferation of inverter-interfaced generation be sustained. The ability to easily discern the impacts of increased decentralised genera- tion on protection adequacy is a major strength of this Thesis. Furthermore, the over voltage mitigation scheme and microgrid design philosophy, including voltage sequence protection, represent new techniques that address obstacles in perpetual energy resource decentralisation: over voltage in grid-connected applications and protection discrimination in intentional islanding applications. All contributions within this Thesis have been simulated within the MATLAB environ- ment using an innovative simulation platform. Verification of simulation results are pre- sented where validation against other published results has been possible. However, in order to fully examine the performance of the contributions developed in this Thesis, fur- ther research is required to prototype and rigorously test the concepts that have been developed using real-world networks...|$|E

Using the mathematical method of symbolic model reduction, the model of a low voltage grid will be analysed. Depending on the load and generation within the grid, the reduced model will reproduce the behaviour of the voltages and currents at the points of connection in comparison to the original detailed model.

This is particularly true in electrical distribution systems, where the increased penetration of renewable and <b>decentralised</b> <b>generation</b> is forcing the network to be highly interconnected {{in order to allow}} for higher integration capacity and reliable operation. Consequently, the short-circuit currents in distribution systems have increased significantly.

40|$|Walking in {{insects and}} most six-legged robots {{requires}} simultaneous control {{of up to}} 18 joints. Moreover, the number of joints that are mechanically coupled via body and ground varies from one moment to the next, and external conditions such as friction, compliance and slope of the substrate are often unpredictable. Thus, walking behaviour requires adaptive, context-dependent control of many degrees of freedom. As a consequence, modelling legged locomotion addresses many aspects of any motor behaviour in general. Based on results from behavioural experiments on arthropods, we describe a kinematic model of hexapod walking: the distributed artificial neural network controller WALKNET. Conceptually, the model addresses three basic problems in legged locomotion. (I) First, coordination of several legs requires coupling between the step cycles of adjacent legs, optimising synergistic propulsion, but ensuring stability through flexible adjustment to external disturbances. A set of behaviourally derived leg coordination rules can account for <b>decentralised</b> <b>generation</b> of different gaits, and allows stable walking of the insect model {{as well as of}} a number of legged robots. (II) Second, a wide range of different leg movements must be possible, e. g. to search for foothold, grasp for objects or groom the body surface. We present a simple neural network controller that can simulate targeted swing trajectories, obstacle avoidance reflexes and cyclic searching-movements. (III) Third, control of mechanically coupled joints of the legs in stance is achieved by exploiting the physical interactions between body, legs and substrate. A local positive displacement feedback, acting on individual leg joints, transforms passive displacement of a joint into active movement, generating synergistic assistance reflexes in all mechanically coupled joints...|$|E

40|$|Waste heat {{valorisation}} {{in process}} {{industry is a}} common strategy today. The residual heat is converted to electricity by using steam turbines or organic Rankine cycles. As this energy conversion is likely constructed as an integral cooling capacity for the primary process, loss of electricity production will result in reduced process cooling and hence production capacity loss. This restriction prevents these generators to deliver supporting services to the electrical grid. In this paper, it is proven that coupling waste heat recovery with a district heating network provides flexibility to the electricity generation while ensuring cooling capacity to the process. This flexibility can be utilised by a Virtual Power Plant (VPP), e. g., {{to compensate for the}} variable output of renewable energy sources. Today, the power fluctuations are only compensated by traditional power plants (gas, coal) due to the scale and flexibility of these power plants. In this paper, a strategy is defined to balance variable (renewable) production with industrial waste heat. As such, some grid support tasks can be transferred from the central power plants to <b>decentralised</b> <b>generation</b> units. The backup of the variable sources is provided by utilising the local available capacity, while maintaining or improving energy efficiency of exothermal industrial processes.

Small {{wind turbines}} {{are defined by}} IEC 61400. 2, as having a rotor swept area less than 200 m 2, which corresponds to a power output typically less than 50 kW. Wind turbines of this class often rely on a tail fin for yaw control, and operate at much higher rotor speeds than large turbines to ensure optimal aerodynamic efficiency. Additionally, {{they are subject to}} low Reynolds number aerofoil operation, and often use control systems with minimal inputs to regulate generator output. As a consequence, they are not simply ‘scaled-down’ large wind turbines. Due to commercial interests, significant research and development effort has gone into large wind turbine technology, with little flowing into small turbine technology. This work has focused on developing a detailed aeroelastic model of a small, 5 kW horizontal-axis wind turbine. Experimental validation has been undertaken using operational measurements, revealing a good level of accuracy. Site wind measurements have highlighted differences in open-terrain wind turbulence models specified in the IEC standard to those measured at built environment sites. It has been shown that increasing turbulence levels have a detrimental effect on structural loadings and fatigue life, whereby fatigue loads in the standard are highly conservative and not indicative of operational loading. Results and conclusions will facilitate the development of lightweight, cost-effective, and structurally sound blades for small wind turbines. Wind conditions, turbine performance, and structural loading at turbulent built environment locations are not well understood. IEC 61400. 2 has proposed a simplified load model (SLM) for predicting load magnitudes, at the ‘cost’ of marked design conservatism. Few studies have undertaken detailed experimental measurements to record operational loading for predicting component fatigue life. To date, no studies have quantitatively compared fatigue life predicted by the SLM to aeroelastic simulations and measured operational loads. Work in this thesis focuses on bridging this knowledge gap by assessing the SLM with detailed aeroelastic simulations and experimental measurements of a 5 kW horizontal-axis Aerogenesis wind turbine installed at the University of Newcastle, Australia. A secondary aim is to measure and assess wind conditions and turbulence levels of built environment wind regimes. To measure the turbine performance, a simple, cost-effective data acquisition system was developed utilising Arduino-based microcontrollers. Turbine generator power, rotor speed, blade response, and tower accelerations were recorded using this system across a wide range of measured wind conditions. A detailed analysis of the site wind resource revealed that for all wind speeds, the ten-minute turbulence level was higher than that specified by the IEC standard normal turbulence model. The IEC turbulence model is therefore under-conservative for this complex terrain site, and may under-predict fluctuations in wind velocity, power generation, and structural loading. An aeroelastic model was developed within FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) software, and included all necessary structural, inertial, aerodynamic, and controller parameters. Very good agreement was found between experimental measurements and predicted azimuthal blade structural response and aerodynamic loading at design conditions, where the blade root flapwise moment was predicted to within 8 %, and corresponding structural deflections within 10 %. The predicted dynamic response of the blades and tower was reasonably well captured in the low-frequency range, with a reduction in accuracy for the higher frequency response. This may be due to FAST’s limited ability to capture both higher-order aerodynamic and structural behaviour. When comparing the simulated and measured control system, the simulated controller tended to act more aggressively during highly unsteady conditions. To date this is the most comprehensive aeroelastic model of a turbine of this class reported in the literature. Using both measured wind from the Newcastle site, and simulated wind as per the Kaimal model detailed in the IEC standard, FAST simulations were undertaken {{to assess the impact of}} turbulence on: turbine electrical power output, tip speed ratio, rotor thrust and torque, blade loads, drive shaft loads, and tower base bending moment. An increase in turbulence levels generally resulted in an increase in mean performance and loading. Across the turbulence range investigated, the maximum rotor thrust load increased from 846 N to 2, 041 N, the maximum flapwise blade loading increased from 629 Nm to 1, 103 Nm, and tower base load was found to increase from 17 kNm to 41 kNm. This is a significant increase in structural loading and is not predicted by the IEC wind model for design conditions. Damage equivalent loads (DEL’s) at the blade root were produced from the SLM and measured operational data at 603 Nm and 70 Nm respectively, representing a significant over-prediction. Current blade fatigue life was estimated via the Palmgren-Miner linear damage model, with a life of 0. 09 years calculated when using the SLM. A fatigue life of 9. 18 years was calculated for the measured fatigue spectra, and is equal to 102 times that predicted by the SLM. The constant blade fatigue damage amplitude and cycle ratio predicted by the standard was well in excess of measurements and simulations, indicating that the SLM is over-conservative and not representative of the variable physical damage spectra that is experienced by the blade particularly during unsteady operation...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of forest}} {{materials}} {{for the production of}} electricity has entered the media and public spotlights and has raised concerns about the suitability and sustainability of large-scale biomass facilities in Nova Scotia. This report examines how a <b>decentralised</b> power <b>generation</b> model could help meet Nova Scotia’s renewable energy strategy, and provide a range of social and economic benefits in rural areas of the province. A range of small-scale biomass facilities from around the world are reviewed, ranging from 7 kWe to 14. 7 MWe. Recommendations to promote a small-scale and decentralized power generation model in Nova Scotia are as follows: 1. Establish a province-wide feed-in-tariff to help promote investment; 2. Encourage community investment funds to help overcome initial start-up costs of biomass facilities; and 3. Ensure combined (electrical and thermal) efficiencies of utilised energy be greater than 80 %. Energy production from forest biomass presents a developmental opportunity for rural Nov...|$|R
40|$|Utilisation of {{renewable}} energy {{is an important factor}} in search for effective way to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and to improve the security of energy supply. So far the <b>decentralised</b> power <b>generation</b> in Latvia has dominently been used on fossil fuel - natural gas, whereas wood fuel plays a minor role. The paper describes a method for evaluation of the competitivness of small-scale wood fuel combined heat and power plants (CHPs). For simulation, a model for cost estimation including economic and social criteria is applied. One more method is proposed for evaluation of the wood fuel marginal price. In the model, the feed-in tariff is considered as the instrument strongly affecting the competitivness of small scale CHPs. The result demonstrate that, despite the competitivness of the wood fuel price, the formula applied for factual feed-in tariff calculation does not give advantages in the case of utilising wood fuel for development of CHP technologies compared with natural gas...|$|R
40|$|<b>Decentralised</b> power <b>generation</b> {{may lead}} to an inverse power flow {{compared}} to a centralised power supply system. Thus, voltage rises have to be limited at customer level with minimum extra costs during high PV power injection. Therefore, active and reactive power control of PV inverter will {{become more and more}} important because the additional grid operator’s and end customers’ investments could be nearly neglected. The decentralised control has to be triggered directly by the line voltage at the PV inverter ensuring an efficient use based on static characteristics, which are defined by the grid operator without the need of additional investment in IT infrastructure. The voltage dependent control of decentralised power generators is not implemented in the open source load flow calculation software Matpower. An elegant solution was found by integrating the dynamic change in active and reactive power directly into the load flow equations. This provides the basis for the techno-economic assessments which will be performed for different low-voltage distribution grid classes in Switzerland, Germany and Austria...|$|R
