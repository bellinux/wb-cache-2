50|$|The Atlantic {{sailfish}} (<b>Istiophorus</b> <b>albicans)</b> is {{a species}} of marine fish in the family Istiophoridae of the order Perciformes. It {{is found in the}} Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean Sea, except for large areas of the central North Atlantic and the central South Atlantic, from the surface to depths of 200 m. The Atlantic sailfish is related to the marlin.|$|E
50|$|Bony fish, Marlins, sea birds, sharks, and rays prey on {{the little}} tunny. Other tunas, {{including}} conspecifics and yellowfin tuna (Thynnus albacares) are predators of the little tunny. Fish such as the dolphin fish (Coryphaena hippurus), wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), Atlantic sailfish (<b>Istiophorus</b> <b>albicans),</b> swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and various sharks {{as well as other}} large marine carnivores all prey {{on the little}} tunny. Among those sharks is the whale shark, who feeds on the little tunny's recently spawned eggs. Seabirds prey on small little tunny.|$|E
40|$|Standardized {{catch rates}} of the {{sailfish}} (<b>Istiophorus</b> <b>albicans)</b> were obtained from 10615 trip observations of surface longline fishing targeting swordfish during the period 2001 - 2014. In roughly 28 % of these trips at least one individual belonging to this species was found. Because of the low prevalence of this species in this fishery, the standardized CPUE was developed using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model assuming a delta-lognormal error distribution. The results obtained indicate that the overall trend of the standardized CPUE was similar for the total Atlantic areas and for the East and West stocks. An overall increasing trend was identified for the total Atlantic areas and for the East and West stock for the whole 2001 - 2014 period with some fluctuations {{in the most recent}} years...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The dynamics of the exploited population of <b>Istiophorus</b> <b>albicans</b> (Atlantic sailfish) from artisanal gillnet fishery was investigated based on length frequency data, using FiSAT software. Specimens were sampled from the artisanal fishery captures in the coastal waters near Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire), from October 2009 to October 2010. Growth parameters of I. albicans were estimated using ELEFAN I method. The asymptotic length (L∞), the growth rate constant (K) and the theoretical age at length zero (t 0) were estimated to be 231. 6 cm fork length, 0. 48 yr − 1 and 0. 49 yrs, respectively. The estimated growth performance index (Ф’) of I. albicans was 4. 41. Instantaneous of total mortality coefficient estimated by non seasonalized length converted catch curves (Z) was 1. 56 yr − 1. Natural mortality (M) estimated by Pauly’s empirical equation was 0. 63 yr − 1 and the estimated fishing mortality (F) was 0. 93 y...|$|E
40|$|Se presenta información acerca de dieciseis especies de peces de interés económico provenientes del Parque Nacional Natural Gorgona (Pacífico colombiano). Se registran por primera vez para Colombia Pontinus dubius, Ponfinus sp. (Scorpaenidae), Eucinosfomus currani (Gerreidae) y Sphyraena sp. (Sphyraenidae); además, se presentan por primera vez datos de especímenes colombianos de Hemiramphus saltafor (Hemiramphidae). Cynoponficus coniceps (Muraenesocidae), Ablennes hians (Belonidae), Pontinus clemensi (Scorpaenidae), PrionOfUS sfephanophrys (Triglidae) y Calamus brachysomus (Sparidae) son citados de Isla Gorgona, de donde no eran conocidos. Se presentan datos de valor biológico y pesquero de Caulolafilus affinis (Malacanthidae) y Secfafor ocyurus (Kyphosidae), y se discute el estatus de Scorpaena mysfes, Scorpaenodes xyris (Scorpaenidae), Kypho. ¡us elegans (Kyphosidae), Sphyraena idiastes (Sphyraenidae) e <b>Istiophorus</b> <b>albicans</b> (Istiophoridae) en la Isla. Information about sixteen {{species of}} fishes of {{economical}} value from the Parque Nacional Natural Gorgona (Colombian Pacific) is presented. The {{reports of the}} doubtful scorpionfish, Pontinus dubius, the speckled scorpionfish, Pontinus sp., the Pacific fIagfin mojarra, Eucinostomus currani, and the Gorgona barracuda, Sphyraena sp., are remarkable, since they are recorded {{for the first time}} from Colombia; data on Colombian specimens of the longfin halfbeak, Hemiramphus saltator, are presented for the first time. The Pacific pikeconger, Cynoponticus coniceps, the fIat needlefish, Ablennes hians, the southero scorpionfish, Pontinus clemensi, the lumptail searobin, and the Pacific porgy, Calamus brachysomus, are new reports from Isla de Gorgona. Biological and fishery data are given about the goldeneye tilefish, Caulolatilus affinis, and the bluestriped chub, Sectator ocyurus; the status in Gorgona of the stone scorpionfish, Scorpaena mystes, the rainbow scorpionfish, Scorpaenodes xyris, the Cortez chub, Kyphosus elegans, the Galápagos barracuda, S. idiastes, and the Indo-Pacific sailfish, [stiophorus albicans, is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Trophic {{relations}} of cephalopods in southern Brazil were investigated from predation on cephalopods by 71 species of potential predators, including two squids, 47 fishes, seven seabirds and 15 marine mammals from shelf, upper slope and oceanic adjacent waters. In all, 27 families and 41 species of cephalopods were identified from stomach contents. The {{number of families}} ranged from six, in the diet of shelf predators, to 27 families in those from upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters. The most frequent cephalopod prey on the shelf was Loligo sanpaulensis, particularly important in the diet of Franciscana dolphin Pontoporia blainvillei, occurring also in the diet of the penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, the fur seals Arctocephalus australis, A. gazella, A. tropicalis, and several benthic and demersal fishes. Ommastrephidae, mainly Illex argentinus and Ornithoteuthis antillarum, was the most frequent family in the diet of predators from upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters. Illex argentinus was an important prey for the wreckfish Polyprion americanus, the bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus, the swordfish Xiphias gladius and some marine mammals, especially in their winter and spring northward reproductive migration. Ornithoteuthis antillarum was frequent in the diet of the skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis, the albacore Thunnus alalunga, the yellowfin tuna T. albacares, the Atlantic sailfish <b>Istiophorus</b> <b>albicans</b> and the white marlin Tetrapturus albidus. Ammoniacal squids, such as Ancistrocheirus lesueurii, Histioteuthis spp, Chiroteuthis veranii and Octopoteuthis sp, were mainly found in stomach contents of the blue shark, Prionace glauca, the pygmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps, the dwarf sperm whale K. sima, the long-finned pilot whale, Globicephala melas and oceanic seabirds. The relative importance, based on frequency of occurrence, of cephalopods as food resources seems to be higher in the food chains of the upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters, {{when compared to the}} continental shelf...|$|E
