As an LDA tries to insert separating hyperplanes in a dimensional space that is defined by the number of given variables, linear classifications often fail.

In particular, we demonstrate that a simple head detector em-bedded in an off-the-shelf recognition pipeline can improve recognition accuracy quite significantly, highlighting the importance of part features for fine-grained recognition tasks.

The algorithm assumes that the image contains two classes of pixels following bi-modal histogram (foreground pixels and background pixels), it then calculates the optimum threshold separating the two classes so that their combined spread (<b>intra-class</b> <b>variance)</b> is minimal, or equivalently (because the sum of pairwise squared distances is constant), so that their inter-class variance is maximal.Consequently, Otsu's method is roughly a one-dimensional, discrete analog of Fisher's Discriminant Analysis.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to annotating weakly labelled data. In contrast to many existing approaches that perform annotation by seeking clusters of self-similar exemplars (minimising <b>intra-class</b> <b>variance),</b> we perform image annotation by selecting exemplars that have never occurred before in the much larger, and strongly annotated, negative training set (maximising inter-class variance). Compared to existing methods, our approach is fast, robust, and obtains {{state of the art}} results on two challenging data-sets – voc 2007 (all poses), and the msr 2 action data-set, where we obtain a 10 % increase.

40|$|There {{has been}} a great effort to {{transfer}} linear discriminant techniques that operate on vector data to high-order data, generally referred to as Multilinear Discriminant Analysis (MDA) techniques. Many existing works focus on maximizing the inter-class <b>variances</b> to <b>intra-class</b> <b>variances</b> defined on tensor data representations. However, there has not been any attempt to employ class-specific discrimination criteria for the tensor data. In this paper, we propose a multilinear subspace learning technique suitable for applications requiring class-specific tensor models. The method maximizes the discrimination of each individual class in the feature space while retains the spatial structure of the input.

40|$|Abstract—The goal {{of image}} {{classification}} is to classify {{a collection of}} unlabeled images into a set of semantic classes. Many methods have been proposed to approach this goal by leveraging visual appearances of local patches in images. However, the spatial context between these local patches also provides significant information to improve the classification accuracy. Traditional spatial contextual models, such as two-dimensional hidden Markov model, attempt to construct one common model for each image category to depict the spatial structures of the images in this class. However due to large <b>intra-class</b> <b>variances</b> in an image category, one single model has difficulties in representing various spatial contexts in different images. In contrast, we propose to construct a prototype set of spatial contextual models by leveraging the kernel methods rather than only one model. Such an algorithm combines the advantages of rich representation ability of spatial contextual models {{as well as the}} powerful classification ability of kernel method. In particular, we propose a new distance measure between different spatial contextual models by integrating joint appearance-spatial image features. Such a distance measure can be efficiently computed in a recursive formulation that scales well to image size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

The state-of-the-art research work has significantly improved the fine-grained recognition performance by deep metric learning using triplet network. However, {{the impact of}} intra-category variance {{on the performance of}} recognition and robust feature representation has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose to leverage <b>intra-class</b> <b>variance</b> in metric learning of triplet network to improve the performance of fine-grained recognition. Through partitioning training images within each category into a few groups, we form the triplet samples across different categories as well as different groups, which is called Group Sensitive TRiplet Sampling (GS-TRS).

40|$|Existing {{fine-grained}} visual categorization methods often {{suffer from}} three challenges: {{lack of training}} data, large number of fine-grained categories, and high intraclass vs. low inter-class variance. In this work we propose a generic iterative framework for fine-grained categorization and dataset bootstrapping that handles these three challenges. Using deep metric learning with humans in the loop, we learn a low dimensional feature embedding with anchor points on manifolds for each category. These anchor points capture <b>intra-class</b> <b>variances</b> and remain discriminative between classes. In each round, images with high confidence scores from our model are sent to humans for labeling. By comparing with exemplar images, labelers mark each candidate image as either a "true positive" or a "false positive". True positives are added into our current dataset and false positives are regarded as "hard negatives" for our metric learning model. Then the model is retrained with an expanded dataset and hard negatives for the next round. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed framework, we bootstrap a fine-grained flower dataset with 620 categories from Instagram images. The proposed deep metric learning scheme is evaluated on both our dataset and the CUB- 200 - 2001 Birds dataset.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to improve performance in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC). In particular, {{we are interested in}} the large-scale classification between hundreds of different flower, bird, dog species. FGVC is challenging due to high <b>intra-class</b> <b>variances</b> caused by deformation, view angle, illumination and occlusion, and low inter-class variance since some categories only differ in detail that only experts notice. Applications include field guides, automatic image annotation, one-click shopping app and 3 D reconstruction. At the start, we discuss the importance of foreground segmentation in FGVC, where we focus on the unsupervised segmentation of image training sets into fore- ground and background in order to improve image classification performance. To this end, we introduce a new scalable, alternation-based algorithm for co-segmentation, Bi-CoS, which is simpler than many of its predecessors, and yet has superior performance on standard benchmark image datasets. Next, we extend BiCos to a new model, Tri- CoS, that adds a class-discriminitiveness term directly into the segmentation objective. The new term aims at removing image regions that, although appearing as foreground, do not contribute to the discrimination between classes. We also propose a model that combines parts alignment and foreground segmentation into a unified convex framework. The model is called Symbiotic in that part discovery/localization is helped by segmentation and, conversely, the segmentation is helped by the detection (e. g. part layout). The joined system improves over what can be achieved with an analogous system that runs segmentation and part-localization independently. Finally, we built a new flower dataset consisting of 26, 798 high quality images collected by ourselves and 187, 559 images gathered from existing datasets. The construction of this dataset follows a strict biological taxonomy. We also evaluate the impact of using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) service for filtering fine-grained data.

40|$|Person re-identification task {{has been}} greatly boosted by deep {{convolutional}} neural networks (CNNs) in recent years. The core {{of which is to}} enlarge the inter-class distinction as well as reduce the <b>intra-class</b> <b>variance.</b> However, to achieve this, existing deep models prefer to adopt image pairs or triplets to form verification loss, which is inefficient and unstable since the number of training pairs or triplets grows rapidly as the number of training data grows. Moreover, their performance is limited since they ignore the fact that different dimension of embedding may play different importance. In this paper, we propose to employ identification loss with center loss to train a deep model for person re-identification. The training process is efficient since it does not require image pairs or triplets for training while the inter-class distinction and <b>intra-class</b> <b>variance</b> are well handled. To boost the performance, a new feature reweighting (FRW) layer is designed to explicitly emphasize the importance of each embedding dimension, thus leading to an improved embedding.

40|$|Action {{recognition}} {{is an important}} problem in multimedia understanding. This paper addresses this problem by building an expressive compositional action model. We model one action instance in the video with an ensemble of spatio-temporal compositions: a number of discrete temporal anchor frames, {{each of which is}} further decomposed to a layout of deformable parts. In this way, our model can identify a Spatio-Temporal And-Or Graph (STAOG) to represent the latent structure of actions e. g. triple jumping, swinging and high jumping. The STAOG model comprises four layers: (i) a batch of leaf-nodes in bottom for detecting various action parts within video patches; (ii) the or-nodes over bottom, i. e. switch variables to activate their children leaf-nodes for structural variability; (iii) the and-nodes within an anchor frame for verifying spatial composition; and (iv) the root-node at top for aggregating scores over temporal anchor frames. Moreover, the contextual interactions are defined between leaf-nodes in both spatial and temporal domains. For model training, we develop a novel weakly supervised learning algorithm which iteratively determines the structural configuration (e. g. the production of leaf-nodes associated with the or-nodes) along with the optimization of multi-layer parameters. By fully exploiting spatio-temporal compositions and interactions, our approach handles well large <b>intra-class</b> action <b>variance</b> (e. g. different views, individual appearances, spatio-temporal structures). The experimental results on the challenging databases demonstrate superior performance of our approach over other competing methods.

40|$|From {{the files}} of the Beef Cattle Weight Gain Performance Recording Scheme of the New Zealand Meat Producers Board and the New Zealand Wool Board, the weaning weights of 7771 Hereford calves born in 18 herds, and 16666 Angus calves born in 37 herds, from 1964 to 1972, were analysed. Objectives of the study {{involved}} estimation {{of the effects of}} age and sex of calf, and age of dam, in order that methods of adjustment currently used in the National Beef Recording Service for these environmental influences could be evaluated. Each calf was classified according to herd, year of birth, age-of-dam group, and sex, with age at weaning as a covariate. The data were analysed within breeds by least squares to investigate the main effects of these five factors and the first-order interactions among herd, year, age-of-dam group, and sex effects. The importance of each interaction was examined by comparing the proportionate reduction in intra-class residual variation after all main effects had been fitted. The results of the analyses of main effects indicated that for each breed, all effects contributed to more than a 2 percent reduction in <b>intra-class</b> residual <b>variance.</b> The results of the interaction analyses showed that only the herd x year interaction for Hereford calves, and the herd x year and herd x sex interactions for Angus calves, contributed to at least a 2 percent reduction in residual variance after all main effects had been fitted. Within-subclass linear regression coefficients of weight on age at weaning for Hereford and Angus calves, were 0. 70 ± 0. 01 and 0. 62 ± 0. 01 kg/day, respectively. Least-squares estimates for sex indicated that the weaning weights of Hereford and Angus males were heavier than those of females by 29. 8 and 25. 6 kg, respectively. Estimates for age of dam indicated that the weights of Hereford calves out of dams of 2, 3, 4, 5 and, 10 years of age and older, deviated from the weights of Hereford calves out of mature dams (6 to 9 years-old) by 33. 3, 17. 6, 8. 7, 3. 8 and 2. 2 kg, respectively. The corresponding deviations for Angus calves were 22. 7, 15. 2, 7. 9, 5. 4 and 1. 4 kg. Estimates for age-of-dam effects were also obtained by best linear unbiased estimation procedures from the records of 7698 Hereford calves out of 2901 dams, and 14198 Angus calves out of 5086 dams. Differences in the estimates of deviations of non-mature from mature dam age groups derived by least squares and by best linear unbiased estimation, were in general relatively small. In relation to the procedure currently used in the National Beef Recording Service, alternative adjustment procedures derived for age at weaning involved additive and multiplicative applications of linear regression of weight on age for each breed. The current procedure, for both breeds, was the least effective in reducing the dependence of adjusted weight on age, whilst the procedure additively applying linear regression of weight on age was the least effective in reducing <b>intra-class</b> residual <b>variance.</b> Adjustments determined for age-of-dam effects by least squares and by best linear unbiased estimation, were considered to differ only slightly from current industry adjustment factors, with the exception of factors applicable to Angus calves out of 3 -year-old dams. Examination of the variances within age-of-dam groups, and of the reductions in residual variances within herd-year-sex subclasses, indicated the applicability of additive, rather than multiplicative, adjustment factors for each breed. Comparisons of additive and multiplicative adjustment factors for sex effects were varied. Multiplicative adjustments were more appropriate in equalizing variances within sex groups, whilst additive adjustments were more appropriate in reducing residual variance within herd-year subclasses...|$|R

The method has been validated on computer-synthetic volumetric images and in X-ray CTscanned datasets of plexiglas tubes of known sizes.

The achieved results were highly accurate with mean signed surface positioning errors of the inner and outer walls of the tubes of + 0. 013 mm and 0. 012 mm, respectively, given a voxel size of 0. 39 × 0. 39 × 0. 6 mm 3.

Design: Using the Swedish Medical Birth Register we identified all 428, 314 adolescents born between 1987 and 1990 and who were residing in Sweden in the year they turned 18. We applied multilevel logistic regression analysis with adolescents (level 1) nested within MCOBs (level 2). Measures of association (odds ratio) and measures of <b>variance</b> (<b>intra-class</b> correlation (ICC)) were calculated, {{as well as the}} discriminatory accuracy by calculating the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (AU-ROC) curve. Results: In comparison with adolescents with Swedish-born mothers, adolescents with mothers born in upper-middle, lower-middle and low-income countries were less likely to use psychotropic medication. However, the variance between MCOBs was small (ICC = 2. 5 in the final model) relative to the variation within MCOBs. This was confirmed by an AU-ROC value of 0. 598.

When present, tVEMP latencies and amplitudes exhibited fair to good repeatability. Repeatability of tVEMP latencies and amplitudes measured using Bland-Altman methods was poorer with eyes closed. Conclusions: Sound-evoked tVEMP response rates are too low to support their clinical utility at the moment. tVEMP response rate may be improved by refining the balance task to include a force related target. Better tVEMP repeatability with eyes open supports the hypothesis that the response is modulated by visual feedback, and is consistent with studies reporting triceps responses to galvanic stimulation...|$|R

Public attitudes, such as victim-blaming, are important for our understanding of differences in the occurrence of IPVAW, as they contribute to its justification. In this paper, we focus on victim-blaming attitudes regarding IPVAW within the EU and we apply multilevel analyses to identify contextual determinants of victim-blaming attitudes. We investigate both the general contextual effect {{of the country and}} the specific association between country level of gender equality and individual victim-blaming attitudes, as well as to what extend a possible general contextual effect was explained by county level gender equality. Methods: We analyzed data from 26 800 respondents from 27 member states of the European Union who responded to a survey on public perceptions of domestic violence. We applied multilevel logistic regression analysis and measures of <b>variance</b> (<b>intra-class</b> correlation (ICC)) were calculated, as well as the discriminatory accuracy by calculating the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. Results: Over and above individual characteristics, about 15 % of the individual variance in the propensity for having victim-blaming attitudes was found at the country level, and country level of gender equality did not affect the general contextual effect (i. e.

We applied a two-level multilevel logistic regression analysis with 62 MCOBs at the second and 755, 894 children at the first level. Adjusting for socioeconomic and medical factors using a risk score, and including the socioeconomic characteristics of the MCOBs, we obtained both measures of association (odds ratio (OR)) and measures of <b>variance</b> (<b>Intra-class</b> correlation (ICC)).

Methods. We studied 30 clinically stable patients (15 men/ 15 women) undergoing haemodialysis at the Dialysis Unit of the Federal University of São Paulo. Body fat assessment was performed by the SKF, BIA and DEXA methods after a haemodialysis session. Analysis of <b>variance,</b> <b>intra-class</b> correlation coefficient and Bland and Altman plot analysis were used for comparative analysis among the methods. Results. Body fat estimates by SKF (17. 7 +/- 7. 8 kg) and BIA (18. 6 +/- 9. 2 kg) were not significantly different from those obtained by DEXA (18. 2 +/- 7. 9 kg) considering the whole population. However, the BIA technique worked differently from DEXA when analysed by gender, measuring less fat content in men and higher fat content in women (P < 0. 01). No differences were observed for SKF. Strong intra-class correlation coefficients (r) were found between DEXA with SKF (r = 0. 94) and BIA (r = 0. 91). DEXA showed a relatively good agreement with both SKF [0. 47 +/- 2. 8 (- 5. 0 to 6. 0) kg] and BIA [- 0. 39 +/- 3. 3 (- 6. 9 to 6. 1) kg] in all patients according to the Bland and Altman plot analysis. However, considering gender, BIA showed greater mean prediction error of 1. 93 +/- 2. 5 (- 3. 0 to 6. 8) kg for men and - 2. 71 +/- 2. 3 (- 7. 2 to 1. 8) kg for women. Conclusions. the simple and long established method of SKF was preferable over BIA, which showed gender-specific variability in the assessment of body fat in patients undergoing haemodialysis. However, more comparative and longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the applicability of these practical methods for monitoring body composition in the routine care of patients with chronic renal failure.

40|$|The task of {{understanding}} video content has seen great interest from computer vision community {{with the increase}} in camera based surveillance at grocery stores, airports, train stations, etc. What makes up a scene (objects) and what happens in the scene (actions) are two important di-mensions of video understanding. In this work, we aim to identify both actions and objects in the video, however, we focus only on the objects with which human interacts. We use videos which may have multiple actions taking place during possibly overlapping intervals. Our system can rec-ognize actions having high <b>intra-class</b> <b>variance</b> performed in complex environments using objects of different types, sizes and shapes. We produce structured descriptions for the videos as output. The descriptions identify the subject, the object, the verb and the interval of each activity recog-nized. 1...|$|E
