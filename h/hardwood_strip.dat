50|$|Windeward Bound is a two masted brigantine-rigged vessel {{based in}} Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. The vessel {{is named after}} Lewis Winde, the builder of an 1848 Boston {{schooner}} on which Windeward Bound was modelled. It is constructed almost entirely of Tasmanian eucalypt, huon pine and Oregon pine, recycled from old boats and buildings. The hull is constructed of 5 cm <b>hardwood</b> <b>strip</b> planks, over epoxy-laminated douglas fir frames, spaced 38 cm (15 inches) apart. The stem, sternpost and keel are of epoxy-laminated Tasmanian blue gum and the decks are of huon and New Zealand kauri pines.|$|E
50|$|Wooden {{laminated}} longbows {{can be made}} by gluing {{together two}} or more different pieces of wood. Usually this is done {{to take advantage of the}} inherent properties of different woods: some woods can better withstand compression while others are better at withstanding tension. Examples include hickory and lemonwood, or bamboo and yew longbows: hickory or bamboo is used on the back of the bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting) and so is in tension, while the belly (the part facing the archer when shooting) is made of lemonwood or yew and undergoes compression (see bending for a further explanation of stresses in a bending beam). Traditionally made Japanese yumi are also laminated longbows, made from strips of wood: the core of the bow is bamboo, the back and belly are bamboo or <b>hardwood,</b> and <b>hardwood</b> <b>strips</b> are laminated to the bow's sides to prevent twisting. Ready-made laminated longbows are available for purchase.|$|R
50|$|The {{interiors}} {{of both the}} office tower and the courthouse contain high-quality materials that evoke the Modern spirit of the complex. Glazed, polished bricks cover portions of the floors and interior walls. Concrete coffered ceilings create pattern and texture in the public spaces. Squares and cubes are used as a design element throughout both buildings; granite cubes form the informational directories, water fountains, seating areas, and stairwells. These components {{are found in the}} office tower lobby, along with colossal concrete columns that provide monumentality to the interior. Within the courthouse, the four courtrooms are dignified spaces. Wall paneling consists of thin vertical <b>hardwood</b> <b>strips,</b> while jury boxes and judges' benches are built from thin horizontal strips. The plaza of the complex is particularly emblematic of Breuer's work. He understood the importance of creating formal yet inviting outdoor spaces executed at a human scale. The primary materials that Breuer used are warm gray granite and tan concrete, which is typical in Brutalist architecture. He designed a reflecting pool in the sunken courtyard, with grass panels, shrubs, and trees added to soften hardscape features.|$|R
50|$|The {{house has}} pine floors throughout, nailed to joists on doubled bearers and {{supported}} on adzed round <b>hardwood</b> stumps; cover <b>strips</b> conceal the central cut along the passageway that {{is evidence of}} the house having been moved onto the site.|$|R
30|$|Timber {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{materials}} used in traditional buildings worldwide. Our previous research has suggested that timber shear walls play an important role in resisting external loadings, such as earthquakes. Thus, improving the structural performance of in-filled shear walls can also improve that of the entire structure. In the traditional Taiwanese timber shear wall system, the embedment strength of beams and friction between wooden planks and beams significantly affect the strength of the shear wall. This article proposes a new method of reinforcing traditional timber shear walls in Taiwan by inserting teak and padauk strips into the grooves between wooden planks and beams to increase the embedment strength of beams and the friction between wooden planks and the <b>hardwood</b> <b>strips.</b> A total of 18 full-scale specimens were tested under reversed cyclic loading. The results revealed that the strength and energy dissipation capacities of a wooden shear wall can be significantly increased by inserting teak and padauk strips into the grooves between planks and beams. Furthermore, the simplified calculation method proposed in this study can be used to calculate the strength of both reinforced and unreinforced wooden shear walls with satisfactory agreement.|$|R
5000|$|Philip and his wife, Sarah Thompson, of Whitchurch Township, moved {{originally}} {{into the}} old Cummer farmhouse, a -storey brick Georgian style dwelling. This house, built about 1840, was located between Parkview and Norton Avenues and faced west to Yonge Street. When Philip McKenzie died, John ran the farm and specialized in Holstein cattle until the local economy for farmers began to deteriorate. John then decided to subdivide the farm, and in 1912, registered the [...] "Empress Subdivision" [...] that was to become the heart of modern east Willowdale as the area was transformed from a rural village to a suburban community.In 1913, John and his wife, Eva, chose a large lot on the rise of land just east of Yonge Street on Parkview Avenue as the site for their new home. Built in a style which {{has been described as}} Queen Anne Revival, Arts and Crafts, and Edwardian, this red brick house contains 12 rooms and 3 bathrooms. The front of the house is profiled by a grand L-shaped, wrap-around verandah with stylized Doric columns. A large attached coach house was converted to accommodate automobiles and has a recreation room above. Significant interior features include the centre hall plan, a vestibule door and sidelights with bevelled leaded glass, a large leaded art glass window which lights the landing of the main staircase, two sunrooms, panelled doors and wainscotting, <b>strip</b> <b>hardwood</b> flooring and radiators. From their farm, the McKenzies retained the 1907 brick milk house, and built a stable in 1915 and a coach house in 1918.|$|R
