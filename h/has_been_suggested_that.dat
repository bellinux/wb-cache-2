5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Kettle Creek {{is named}} for kettles used by the Native Americans on the West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Schongauer's pupil Urbain Huter (1471–1501) {{may have}} been one of the authors but without any solid evidence.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{brachytherapy}} {{may become}} a standard of treatment for skin cancer in the near future.|$|E
5000|$|Such {{behaviour}} is {{also related}} to alloparenting, cross-fostering and brood adoption. Several situations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> lead to this including: ...|$|R
25|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the man {{reported}} by eyewitnesses as jumping over the barrier may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{one of the}} police officers in pursuit.|$|R
50|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Ardzinba may <b>have</b> also favoured Gagulia {{to replace}} him as President, but Ardzinba instead decided to back then-Prime Minister Raul Khajimba.|$|R
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the data}} leak could cost {{the law firm}} up to £500,000 in fines for {{breaching}} British Data Protection Laws.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the giant}} or {{waterfall}} swiftlet, Hydrochous gigas, which cannot echolocate, may be descended from an echolocating ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{refers to a}} womanizing man. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the lyrics address Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline.|$|E
50|$|Proposals {{made by the}} Home Secretary on 20 March 2006 saw Kent Police stay as a {{standalone}} strategic {{force for}} Kent and Medway; it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Kent should merge with another police force.|$|R
2500|$|Various {{theories}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{attempt to}} <b>suggest</b> evolutionary {{benefits to the}} human species stemming from the cessation of women's reproductive capability {{before the end of}} their natural lifespan. Explanations can be categorized as adaptive and non-adaptive: ...|$|R
50|$|A {{large family}} was {{reported}} with a phenotype indistinguishable from FSHD {{in which no}} pathological changes at the 4q site or translocation of 4q-10q <b>are</b> found. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> this may <b>be</b> due to limitations in the available tests.|$|R
5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{has been}} preferred over open court trials, as it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the criminal trial}} {{could be used as}} a platform for radicals to publicize their views, and that it might confer the honour of martyrdom on accused persons. However, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> an open trial which details the evils of terrorism and the indiscriminate destruction that it causes could educate the public and potentially unite the various communities in the country.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{regarded}} {{by many as}} highly prestigious, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> having an album nominated for or winning the Mercury Prize could be a curse on a career in music.|$|E
5|$|Due to the English Water Spaniel's colours {{of liver}} (tan) and white, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the breed {{may have been}} the source of the colours now found in the modern English Springer Spaniel and Welsh Springer Spaniel breeds.|$|E
60|$|He {{struggled}} with his indignation. Sylvia hated poverty, and it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> he should turn the fact to his advantage. The {{idea that she}} might be more willing to marry him if she were poor was most unpleasant.|$|R
50|$|The pyramid's {{purpose and}} exact origins are unknown. Though it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{constructed}} by Roman legionaries involved in Egyptian cult practices, more recent research {{indicated that it}} was actually built between 1803 and 1812, i.e. during the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|R
60|$|For {{several years}} {{my friends in}} London <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> I visit them and I had a longing to do so. I wanted to see Barrie, Shaw, Hardy, Besant, and other of my kindly correspondents and this seemed my best {{time to make the}} journey.|$|R
5|$|Female Carolina wrens possess song control {{regions that}} {{would appear to}} make them capable of singing with {{repertoires}} like the male. Due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with the male, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Channel 4's Time Team {{undertook}} excavations on the Eastern Terrace. Their investigations revealed {{evidence of}} a medieval hall {{to the east of}} the castle; it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the hall was used as a dining area.|$|E
5|$|In astrobiology, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{discrete}} vanadium accumulations on Mars {{could be}} a potential microbial biosignature, when {{used in conjunction with}} Raman spectroscopy and morphology.|$|E
25|$|It <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> erlotinib {{can cause}} hearing loss.|$|R
50|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{while the}} Raiders may <b>have</b> {{appeared}} to <b>be</b> {{the most likely}} candidate due to their lack of prospects in comparison with teams like the Chargers, their need for a solution may <b>have</b> actually <b>been</b> too urgent {{to be a viable}} option for London.|$|R
50|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the target}} of the murders may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Sylvain Mollier, instead of the al-Hilli family. Later reports state that Mollier worked as a welder, without {{confidential}} nuclear information (security clearance is unclear), so he was not suspected as a likely target of such a murder.|$|R
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Ottawa {{speakers}} {{were among}} the groups that used the Great Lakes Algonquian syllabary, a syllabic writing system derived from a European-based alphabetic orthography, but supporting evidence is weak.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> a {{proportionality}} analysis better safeguards equality {{compared to}} the American three-tiered scrutiny approach. The third limb of the proportionality test may also serve to strike down over-inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational nexus test.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{life could}} {{exist in the}} lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water. Such organisms would inhale H2 in place of O2, metabolize it with {{acetylene}} instead of glucose, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|After much {{development}} {{had taken}} place in the Arncliffe and Bardwell Park areas during the early 1900s, Bardwell Valley was the last remaining area with any significant cover of natural vegetation. As early as 1945, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the area would be the ideal location for a golf course.|$|R
5000|$|Bematists {{accompanied}} Alexander the Great on {{his campaign}} in Asia. Their measurements of the distances traveled by Alexanders army show {{a high degree of}} precision to the point <b>that</b> it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> they must <b>have</b> used an odometer, although there is no direct mentioning of such a device: ...|$|R
5000|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> carbanion-sulfone double bonds {{will not}} show {{aromatic}} character-primarily {{as a result}} of the nodes present in d-orbitals. Straight chain analogs were chosen based on the comparable acidity, combined with previous studies indicating that steric effects are largely negligible. The straight chain analogs are shown below.|$|R
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> on some lines {{variable}} gauge axles would achieve significant time savings {{in comparison to}} bogie exchange. Their implementation however would involve a much higher capital cost, requiring either retrofitting or replacement of existing bogies.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the {{original}} function of lactation (milk production) {{was to keep}} eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes, the egg-laying mammals.|$|E
5|$|No {{land mammals}} {{are known to}} be native to North Island, but the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) {{occasionally}} hauls out on the island's beaches, and it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the island once had a native population of tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii).|$|E
25|$|It <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> mercury {{exposure}} {{may contribute}} to lichen planus.|$|R
25|$|It <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the Time Traveller {{was based}} on Thomas Edison.|$|R
50|$|It <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> it may {{increase}} the risk of pancreatic cancer.|$|R
