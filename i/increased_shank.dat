40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} deter-mine the effect of range and confinement rearing on behavior and tonic immobility of four genetic lines of turkeys. Lines of turkeys utilized were selected for increased body weight, or <b>increased</b> <b>shank</b> diameter, or were randombred control lines developed in 1966 and 1986. Birds from the four lines were brooded lines and sexes intermingled to 8 wk of age in confinement. At that time, half the birds from each full-sib family were moved to a large range pen and the remaining birds were moved to a large confinement pen. Selection fo...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{of early}} changes in neural {{plasticity}} may aid {{the prediction of}} rapid-onset antidepressant drugs. Here we compared the dual α₂-adrenoceptor antagonist/ 5 -HT-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), S 35966, to the SNRI, venlafaxine, with regards to their effect on rat brain expression of a panel of neural plasticity-related genes: Arc, BDNF, and VGLUT 1, as well as Homer 1 a and Shank 1 B (not studied previously). Abundance of mRNA was determined by in-situ hybridization in cortical and hippocampal regions 2 h and 16 h following drug administration for 14, 7 and 1 d. After 14 d, both S 35966 and venlafaxine increased mRNA of all genes, including Homer 1 a and Shank 1 B, and effects were similarly time- and region-dependent. After 7 d, S 35966 elevated Arc, Shank 1 B and BDNF mRNA, whereas venlafaxine <b>increased</b> <b>Shank</b> 1 B mRNA only. Finally, after 1 d (acute administration), S 35966 increased Arc and Homer 1 a mRNA whereas venlafaxine {{had no effect on}} any gene examined. In summary, a 14 -d course of treatment with S 35966 or venlafaxine induced similar region- and time-dependent increases in expression of neural plasticity-related genes including Shank 1 B and Homer 1 a. Some genes responded earlier to S 35966, suggesting that drugs with combined α₂-adrenoceptor antagonist/SNRI properties may elicit more rapid changes in markers of neural plasticity than a SNRI alone...|$|E
40|$|Aquatic {{exercises}} {{can be used}} {{in clinical}} and sporting disciplines for both rehabilitation and sports training. However, there is limited knowledge on the influence of water immersion on the kinematics of exercises commonly used in rehabilitation and fitness programs. The aim {{of this study was to}} use inertial sensors to quantify differences in kinematics and movement variability of bodyweight squats, split squats, and single-leg squats performed on dry land and whilst immersed to the level of the greater trochanter. During two separate testing sessions, 25 active healthy university students (22. 3 ± 2. 9 yr.) performed ten repetitions of each exercise, whilst tri-axial inertial sensors (100 Hz) recorded their trunk and lower body kinematics. Repeated-measures statistics tested for differences in segment orientation and speed, movement variability, and waveform patterns between environments, while coefficient of variance was used to assess differences in movement variability. Between-environment differences in segment orientation and speed were portrayed by plotting the mean difference ± 95 % confidence intervals (CI) throughout the tasks. The results showed that the depth of the squat and split squat were unaffected by the changed environment while water immersion allowed for a deeper single leg squat. The different environments had significant effects on the sagittal plane orientations and speeds for all segments. Water immersion increased the degree of movement variability of the segments in all exercises, except for the shank in the frontal plane, which showed more variability on land. Without compromising movement depth, the aquatic environment induces more upright trunk and shank postures during squats and split squats. The aquatic environment allows for increased squat depth during the single-leg squat, and <b>increased</b> <b>shank</b> motions in the frontal plane. Our observations therefore support the use of water-based squat tasks for rehabilitation as they appear to improve the technique without compromising movement depth...|$|E

40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorders affect {{millions of}} individuals worldwide, but their heterogeneity complicates therapeutic intervention that is essentially symptomatic. A versatile yet relevant model to rationally screen among hundreds of therapeutic options would help improving clinical practice. Here we investigated whether neurons differentiated from {{pluripotent stem cells}} can provide such a tool using SHANK 3 haploinsufficiency as a proof of principle. A library of compounds was screened for potential to <b>increase</b> <b>SHANK</b> 3 mRNA content in neurons differentiated from control human embryonic stem cells. Using induced pluripotent stem cell technology, active compounds were then evaluated for efficacy in correcting dysfunctional networks of neurons differentiated from individuals with deleterious point mutations of SHANK 3. Among 202 compounds tested, lithium and valproic acid showed the best efficacy at corrected SHANK 3 haploinsufficiency associated phenotypes in cellulo. Lithium pharmacotherapy was subsequently provided to one patient and, after one year, an encouraging decrease in autism severity was observed. This demonstrated that pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons provide a novel cellular paradigm exploitable {{in the search for}} specific disease-modifying treatments...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Chinese paratroopers have {{traditionally}} performed the half-squat parachute landing (HSPL), which {{was different from}} the wellknown parachute landing fall. During HSPL, ankle biomechanics have been shown to vary greatly between genders. Therefore, it is necessary to consider gender with regard to the design of ankle stabilizers for paratroopers. Methods: Eight male and eight female healthy participants landed from platforms under three ankle conditions based on different stabilizer rigidity levels (barefoot control, elastic tape, and semi-rigid brace). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyze the effects and interactions of ankle stabilizer, gender, and dropping height on the ground reaction forces (GRF), ankle kinematics, and the shank surface electromyogram (EMG). Results: Compared to men, women had signifi -cantly higher peak medial-lateral GRF when they were equipped with stabilizers (tape: men 0. 521 vs. women 0. 856 bodyweight; brace: men 0. 531 vs. 0. 935 bodyweight), except when barefoot. Both stabilizers signifi cantly decreased all peak angular displacements, but no signifi cant interaction was detected between gender and stabilizer rigidity in ankle kinematics. Compared to barefoot, the semi-rigid brace signifi cantly increased male pre-landing EMG amplitude of the tibialis anterior from 218 to 525 m V and post-landing EMG amplitude of the lateral gastrocnemius from 323 to 910 m V, but no corresponding change took place in women. Discussion: The semi-rigid stabilizer was helpful for men in <b>increasing</b> <b>shank</b> muscle activities. <b>Increased</b> stabilizer rigidity had little infl uence on the muscle activities of women and this could contribute to greater injury risk in women during HSPL.

40|$|The {{records for}} body mass at one day, one, four, twelve, sixteen, twenty, twenty {{four weeks of}} age and {{conformation}} traits (Shank length, shank diameter, keel length, breast angle) at four, twelve, sixteen, twenty, and twenty four weeks of age were collected from 114 guinea fowl. There were highly significant differences in body mass between breeds and {{a significant difference between}} sexes from 4 weeks of age up to 20 weeks of age. At 24 weeks of age the difference in body mass was significant for breeds but not significant for sex. All the conformation trait measurements were higher for males than for females.

5000|$|The {{relative}} ratio {{between the}} length of the purchase and the lever arm also affects the amount and type of leverage that is applied to the chin and poll of the horse (producing 1:3 ratio of rein to chin+poll forces in case of the typical curb bit). A long lower shank (lever arm) in relation to the upper <b>shank</b> (purchase) <b>increases</b> the leverage, and thus the pressure, on the curb groove and the bars of the mouth. This design is best suited for a longer-necked horse, as it encourages the horse to both drop its head down and bring its nose in. A somewhat long upper shank in relation to the lower <b>shank</b> <b>increases</b> the pressure on the poll, but does not apply as much pressure on the bars of the mouth. This design is often more helpful on a horse with a short and thick neck, as it encourages the horse to drop its head, but with less pressure to flex the nose in, an act that is physically more difficult for a horse with a thick neck.|$|R
40|$|In {{a variety}} of applications, {{inertial}} sensors are used to estimate spatial parameters by double integrating over time their coordinate acceleration components. In human movement applications, the drift inherent to the accelerometer signals is often reduced by exploiting the cyclical nature of gait and under {{the hypothesis that the}} velocity of the sensor is zero at some point in stance. In this study, the validity of the latter hypothesis was investigated by determining the minimum velocity of progression of selected points of the foot and shank during the stance phase of the gait cycle while walking at three different speeds on level ground. The errors affecting the accuracy of the stride length estimation resulting from assuming a zero velocity {{at the beginning of the}} integration interval were evaluated on twenty healthy subjects. Results showed that the minimum velocity of the selected points on the foot and <b>shank</b> <b>increased</b> as gait speed increased. Whereas the average minimum velocity of the foot locations was lower than 0. 011 m/s, the velocity of the shank locations were up to 0. 049 m/s corresponding to a percent error of the stride length equal to 3. 3 %. The preferable foot locations for an inertial sensor resulted to be the calcaneus and the lateral aspect of the rearfoot. In estimating the stride length, the hypothesis that the velocity of the sensor can be set to zero sometimes during stance is acceptable only if the sensor is attached to the foot...|$|R
