50|$|The New York and Brooklyn Union <b>Ferry</b> Company was {{organized}} in 1839, and leased the Fulton <b>Ferry</b> Company and South <b>Ferry</b> Company. It was reorganized in 1844 as the Brooklyn Union <b>Ferry</b> Company, and leased the Hamilton Avenue <b>Ferry</b> in 1851. The {{creation of the}} Union <b>Ferry</b> Company of Brooklyn was authorized by the New York State Legislature on April 9, 1853, and on November 10, 1854 it was formed to replace the Brooklyn Union. It consolidated with the operating companies of four other ferries: the Roosevelt Street <b>Ferry</b> from the Roosevelt <b>Ferry</b> Company, the Gouverneur Street <b>Ferry</b> and Catherine <b>Ferry</b> from Smith & Bulkley, and the Wall Street <b>Ferry</b> from J. Sharp & Co.|$|R
5|$|Ferry {{services}} link Orkney and Shetland to {{the rest}} of Scotland, the main routes being Scrabster harbour, Thurso to Stromness and Aberdeen to Lerwick, both operated by NorthLink <b>Ferries.</b> Inter-island ferry services are operated by Orkney <b>Ferries</b> and SIC <b>Ferries,</b> which are operated by the respective local authorities and Northlink also run a Lerwick to Kirkwall service. The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide, and there are numerous sites of wrecked ships. Lighthouses are sited as an aid to navigation at various locations.|$|E
5|$|Operating {{funds for}} the ferry system, reliant on gas taxes raised by the state, were {{left out of the}} 1989 budget because of a dispute in the state government. As a result, the MV Tyee and two {{additional}} passenger-only <b>ferries</b> intended to serve Vashon Island were pulled from service in June 1989. The three <b>ferries</b> were loaned to the San Francisco Bay Area after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake left the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge closed for repairs. In January 1990, the <b>ferries</b> returned to the Seattle area, and began regular passenger service on April 23, 1990.|$|E

50|$|The Shanghai <b>Ferry</b> (Chinese: 上海市轮渡, abbr. 市轮渡) is {{a system}} of <b>ferry</b> routes across the Huangpu River in Shanghai. The <b>ferry</b> service started on January 5, 1911 by the {{municipal}} authorities in Pudong. Before the 1970s, the <b>ferry</b> service {{was the only way}} to cross the Huangpu River. In the 1980s, the Shanghai <b>Ferry</b> became one of the busiest <b>ferry</b> services in the world. In the 1990s, as bridges and tunnels across the Huangpu river were built, the <b>ferry</b> service saw a sharp drop in ridership. The Shanghai <b>Ferry</b> currently consists of 18 <b>ferry</b> lines and is operated by the state-owned Shanghai <b>Ferry</b> Company.|$|R
5|$|Prior to NYC Ferry, {{there had}} been many <b>ferries</b> that traversed the East River and Hudson River, {{although}} by the 1960s, almost all ferry services citywide had been discontinued due to the popularity of road and rail transit across the rivers. <b>Ferries</b> in New York City saw a revival in the 1980s and 1990s. As a result of two studies in 2011 and 2013 that showed the impacts of these recent <b>ferries,</b> the city officially proposed its own ferry service in 2013, separate from existing New York City ferry systems such as NY Waterway, New York Water Taxi, and the Staten Island Ferry.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{cessation}} of passenger-only service in 2003, the state legislature passed a bill allowing non-state entities to operate their own public or private <b>ferries</b> near Washington State <b>Ferries</b> routes. Kitsap Transit, a public transit agency serving Kitsap County with bus service, decided to place a 0.3 percent sales tax increase and motor vehicle excise tax on the November 2003 ballot to fund a passenger-only ferry service to replace the state-run <b>ferries.</b> The ballot measure was rejected by 61 percent of voters, with support mostly coming from Bainbridge Island, downtown Bremerton, and Kingston.|$|E

The Cremyll Ferry is a passenger ferry between Stonehouse and the Cornish hamlet of Cremyll, which {{is believed to have}} operated continuously since 1204. There is also a pedestrian ferry from the Mayflower Steps to Mount Batten, and an alternative to using the Tamar Bridge via the Torpoint Ferry (vehicle and pedestrian) across the River Tamar.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Sag Harbor, NY114 {{encounters}} a modern roundabout {{at the intersection}} of Short Beach Road (County Route60 or CR60) and Tyndall Road. NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two <b>ferries</b> along its route. Shelter Island's two <b>ferries,</b> both of which technically carry NY114, are operated by two different companies. The South Ferry (between North Haven and Shelter Island) is operated by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is operated by the North Ferry Company. Since the two entities are separate, there is no incentive to use both <b>ferries,</b> although both companies offer discounts for round trip fares and for Shelter Island residents.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{announced}} {{they would be}} working to preserve the railways and <b>ferries,</b> and in 2008 {{it became clear that}} the directorate was working with an application for the Rjukan Line, the Tinnoset Line and the <b>ferries</b> to be included in a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the closed plants in Rjukan and Odda.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} side of Manhattan, there were a myriad of Hudson River <b>ferries</b> at one point, with boat routes running from New Jersey to twenty {{passenger}} docks in Manhattan. However, the construction of the Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, and George Washington Bridge between Manhattan and New Jersey, as well as the growth of car ownership in the United States, meant that these <b>ferries</b> were no longer needed by the mid-20th century. As a result, in 1967, the last cross-Hudson ferry (between Hoboken and Battery Park City) ceased operations.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{passages}} were cleared, engineers had to construct ten heavy bridges (using MTU bridgelayers, TMM bridgelayers and pontoon bridges), five light bridges, ten pontoon bridges and 35 <b>ferries.</b> The passages {{had to be}} opened in five to seven hours, immediately followed by the <b>ferries,</b> then the bridges two hours later, all the while under enemy fire. Of the heavy bridges, the Egyptians had only two Soviet-made PMP heavy folding bridges, which could be erected in a shorter time than most other bridges in their inventory, saving a few critical hours. These bridges were also much easier to repair. The speed with which the engineers cleared {{the passages}} and laid the bridges and <b>ferries</b> would affect {{the course of the}} entire operation. Engineers also had to man the boats that would cross the assault infantry initially. Finally, they had to breach the minefields around Israeli defenses for the assault infantry.|$|E
50|$|Until 1885 a rowing <b>ferry</b> {{was used}} when a {{floating}} bridge chain <b>ferry</b> was started, initially hand-cranked <b>ferry</b> later {{being replaced by}} a steam <b>ferry</b> which ran until 1942 after improvements to the harbour made operation of the <b>ferry</b> too difficult. Frank Palmer then restarted the old rowing <b>ferry</b> and was succeeded by Bob Cross and David Church.|$|R
50|$|Isom's <b>Ferry</b> was {{operated}} in the 1860s by James Isom. The <b>ferry</b> went by many names, include Isham's <b>Ferry,</b> Isham's Ford, Phillip's Ford, and Cavalry Ford. John Heard took over Isom's <b>Ferry</b> in 1868 and operated it until 1890 as Heard's <b>Ferry.</b>|$|R

5|$|Surrounded by hills, Lam Tin {{does not}} have {{direct access to the}} Victoria Harbour. However, {{merchant}} ships and <b>ferries</b> dock at Kwun Tong Pier and Lei Yue Mun Pier, which are both within 15 minutes' walk from Lam Tin, and provide surface transport for Lam Tin residents. Another reason for Lam Tin's absence of an outlet to the Harbour is the presence of an Eastern Harbour Crossing entrance inside the district, whose buses and MTR overtook <b>ferries</b> for cross-harbour transport.|$|E
5000|$|The Outer Harbour <b>Ferry</b> Terminal (Terminal Marítimo de Passageiros do Porto Exterior; [...] ), {{also known}} as the Macau Maritime <b>Ferry</b> Terminal, Macau <b>Ferry</b> Terminal or Hong Kong-Macau <b>Ferry</b> Pier in Chinese (...) , is a <b>ferry</b> {{terminal}} located at Porto Exterior, Sé, Macau, China.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ferry</b> crosses a {{distance}} of about 125 m, taking about 5 minutes. Technically, the <b>ferry</b> is a reaction <b>ferry,</b> which is propelled by the current of the water. The <b>ferry</b> is attached to a floating cable which is anchored firmly in the riverbed upstream of the <b>ferry.</b> To operate the <b>ferry,</b> it is angled into the current, causing the force of the current to swing the <b>ferry</b> across the river on the cable.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>ferry</b> service {{began in}} 1930s when a man-powered <b>ferry</b> {{was taken in}} service, {{and there has been}} a <b>ferry</b> at the very same {{location}} every year since. The man-powered <b>ferry</b> was replaced with a <b>ferry</b> equipped a boat engine. The current <b>ferry</b> was taken in service in 1992. Originally the current <b>ferry</b> served as a [...] "Sanki Ferry" [...] only a few miles downstream, but it was discontinued when the Sanki Bridge was built.|$|R
