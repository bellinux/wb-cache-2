40|$|<b>Increased</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> {{also called}} hyperacusis, is a {{pervasive}} complaint {{of people with}} tinnitus. The high prevalence of hyper-acusis in tinnitus subjects suggests that both symptoms have a common origin. It {{has been suggested that}} they may result from a maladjusted increaseof central gainattributable to sensorydeafferentation. More specifically, tinnitus andhyperacusis could result from an increase of spontaneous and stimulus-induced activity, respectively. One prediction of this hypothesis is that auditory sensitivity should be increased in tinnitus compared with non-tinnitus subjects. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test this prediction by examining the loudness functions in tinnitus ears (n 124) compared with non-tinnitus human ears (n 106). Because tinnitus is often accom-panied by hearing loss and that hearing loss makes it difficult to disentangle hypersensitivity (hyperacusis) to loudness recruitment, tinnitus and non-tinnitus ears were carefullymatched for hearing loss. Our results show that auditory sensitivity is enhanced in tinnitus subjects compared with non-tinnitus subjects, including subjects with normal audiograms. We interpreted these findings as compatible with a maladaptive central gain in tinnitus...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hearing {{problems}} {{is one of}} the top ten public health disorders in the general population and there is a well-established relationship between stress and hearing problems. The aim of the present study was to explore if an acute stress will <b>increase</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (hyperacusis) in individuals with high levels of emotional exhaustion (EE). Methods: Hyperacusis was assessed using uncomfortable loudness levels (ULL) in 348 individuals (140 men; 208 women; age 23 - 71 years). Multivariate analyses (ordered logistic regression), were used to calculate odds ratios, including interacting or confounding effects of age, gender, ear wax and hearing loss (PTA). Two-way ANCOVAs were used to assess possible differences in mean ULLs between EE groups pre- and post-acute stress task (a combination of cold pressor, emotional Stroop and Social stress/video recording). Results: There were no baseline differences in mean ULLs between the three EE groups (one-way ANOVA). However, after the acute stress exposure there were significant differences in ULL means between the EE-groups in women. Post-hoc analyses showed that the differences in mean ULLs were between those with high vs. low EE (range 5. 5 - 6. 5 dB). Similar results were found for frequencies 0. 5 and 1 kHz. The results demonstrate that women with high EE-levels display hyperacusis after an acute stress task. The odds of having hyperacusis were 2. 5 (2 kHz, right ear; left ns) and 2. 2 (4 kHz, right ear; left ns) times higher among those with high EE compared to those with low levels. All these results are adjusted for age, hearing loss and ear wax. Conclusion: Women with high levels of emotional exhaustion become more sensitive to sound after an acute stress task. This novel finding highlights the importance of including emotional exhaustion in the diagnosis and treatment of hearing problems...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Weberian {{apparatus}} of otophysine fishes facilitates sound transmission from the swimbladder {{to the inner}} ear to increase hearing sensitivity. It has been {{of great interest to}} biologists since the 19 (th) century. No studies, however, are available {{on the development of the}} Weberian ossicles and its effect on the development of hearing in catfishes. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the development of the Weberian apparatus and <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in the catfish Lophiobagrus cyclurus. Specimens from 11. 3 mm to 85. 5 mm in standard length were studied. Morphology was assessed using sectioning, histology, and X-ray computed tomography, along with 3 D reconstruction. Hearing thresholds were measured utilizing the auditory evoked potentials recording technique. Weberian ossicles and interossicular ligaments were fully developed in all stages investigated except in the smallest size group. In the smallest catfish, the intercalarium and the interossicular ligaments were still missing and the tripus was not yet fully developed. Smallest juveniles revealed lowest <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and were unable to detect frequencies higher than 2 or 3 kHz; sensitivity increased in larger specimens by up to 40 dB, and frequency detection up to 6 kHz. In the size groups capable of perceiving frequencies up to 6 kHz, larger individuals had better hearing abilities at low frequencies (0. 05 - 2 kHz), whereas smaller individuals showed better hearing at the highest frequencies (4 - 6 kHz). Conclusions/Significance: Our data indicate that the ability of otophysine fish to detect sounds at low levels and high frequencies largely depends on the development of the Weberian apparatus. A significant <b>increase</b> in <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was observed as soon as all Weberian ossicles and interossicular ligaments are present and the chain for transmitting sounds from the swimbladder to the inner ear is complete. This contrasts with findings in another otophysine, the zebrafish, where no threshold changes have been observed...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether previously observed {{inhibition of}} pericranial electromyographic (EMG) activity, respiration, {{and heart rate}} during sensory intake processes improves <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Participants had to detect weak auditory stimuli. We found that EMG activity in masticatory and lower facial muscles, respiration, and heart rate were more strongly inhibited when stimulus intensity was gradually lowered to threshold level whereas EMG of upper facial muscles progressively increased. Detection of near-threshold stimuli was inversely related to prestimulus EMG levels in masticatory and lower facial muscles. In two additional experiments, it was investigated whether steady, voluntary contractions negatively influence <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> As expected, contraction of zygomaticus produced an <b>increase</b> in <b>auditory</b> threshold in comparison with contraction of corrugator or first dorsal interosseus. It is concluded that attention to external stimuli is accompanied by quieting of those somatic activities that produce internal noise or are accompanied by impaired middle ear transmission of auditory stimuli. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{abnormal}} <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is {{the most}} common sensory impairment associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the neurophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. In previous studies, we reported that this abnormal sensitivity in patients with ASD is associated with delayed and prolonged responses in the auditory cortex. In the present study, we investigated alterations in residual M 100 and MMFs in children with ASD who experience abnormal <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure MMF elicited by an auditory oddball paradigm (standard tones: 300 Hz, deviant tones: 700 Hz) in 20 boys with ASD (11 with abnormal auditory sensitivity: mean age, 9. 62 ± 1. 82 years, 9 without: mean age, 9. 07 ± 1. 31 years) and 13 typically developing boys (mean age, 9. 45 ± 1. 51 years). We found that temporal and frontal residual M 100 /MMF latencies were significantly longer only in children with ASD who have abnormal <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> In addition, prolonged residual M 100 /MMF latencies were correlated with the severity of abnormal <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in temporal and frontal areas of both hemispheres. Therefore, our findings suggest that children with ASD and abnormal <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> may have atypical neural networks in the primary auditory area, as well as in brain areas associated with attention switching and inhibitory control processing. This is the first report of an MEG study demonstrating altered MMFs to an auditory oddball paradigm in patients with ASD and abnormal <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> These findings contribute to knowledge of the mechanisms for abnormal <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in ASD, and may therefore facilitate development of novel clinical interventions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract While the {{importance}} of phonological sensitivity for understanding reading acquisition and impairment across orthographies is well documented, what underlies deficits in phonological sensitivity is not well understood. Some researchers have argued that speech perception underlies variability in phonological representations. Others have investigated the role of more general <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for reading development and reading difficulties, arguing that poor phonological representations may actually be due to broad underlying auditory deficits, which are not restricted to speech stimuli. We argue that these hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In this review, we demonstrate that <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and speech perception can be integrated into a single developmental model, in which <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> may have an indirect impact on reading; this impact is mediated by speech perception. In the model, we distinguish general <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> as falling into at least two general categories: rhythmic and temporal. Correspondingly, speech perception itself can be distinguished as suprasegmental and segmental. Theoretically, the proposed model integrates {{a broad range of}} studies on general auditory and speech perception to suggest a developmental trajectory for reading acquisition that can b...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 <b>Auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and {{perception}} can {{be influenced by}} extrinsic factors, such as environmental noise, and intrinsic factors, such as genes and arousal. How do these factors interact and influence auditory-related behaviors? I addressed this question in the larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish have been a powerful genetic model species {{used in the study}} of development of auditory structures and exhibit a well-studied and robust escape response when presented with a loud acoustic stimulus. I used psychophysical methods to measure <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{and perception}} by observing changes in this behavioral response. In chapter 2, I describe a novel paradigm using prepulse inhibition as a tool to measure <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in larval zebrafish. I show that this paradigm is more sensitive than other behavioral measures used in zebrafish research. Next, in chapter 3, I demonstrate that loud noise exposure leads to a temporary hypersensitivity toward startle-inducing stimuli, whereas <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> as measured using the prepulse inhibition paradigm, is unchanged. I use pharmacological and physiological measures to explore potential mechanisms of this hypersensitization effect. Finally, in chapter 4, I investigate effects of genetic background on <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and susceptibility to noise exposure between closely related individuals and across multiple zebrafish lines. The results of these experiments show large-scale differences in startle sensitivity between wild-type zebrafish lines. I discuss the implications of this data, summarize these findings in a larger context, and discuss future studies in chapter 5...|$|R
40|$|Williams {{syndrome}} (WS), a genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder, is of {{keen interest}} to music cognition researchers {{because of its}} characteristic <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivities</b> and emotional responsiveness to music. However, actual musical perception and production abilities are more variable. We examined musicality in WS {{through the lens of}} amusia and explored how their musical perception abilities related to their <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> musical production skills, and emotional responsiveness to music. In our sample of 73 adolescents and adults with WS, 11 % met criteria for amusia, which is higher than the 4 % prevalence rate reported in the typically developing population. Amusia was not related to <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivities</b> but was related to musical training. Performance on the amusia measure strongly predicted musical skill but not emotional responsiveness to music, which was better predicted by general <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> This study represents the first time amusia has been examined in a population with a known neurodevelopmental genetic disorder with a range of cognitive abilities.

40|$|International audienceThe {{subjective}} experience conferred by auditory perception {{has rarely}} been addressed outside of the studies of auditory hallucinations. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the phenomenology of auditory experiences in individuals who endorse magical beliefs, but do not report hallucinations. We examined the relationship between subjective <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and a 'psychotic-like' thinking style. Hyperacusis questionnaire scores were compared between 25 high scoring participants on Chapman's magical ideation (MI) scale, 25 high scoring participants on Chapman's physical anhedonia scale and 25 control participants, pre-selected from a large student pool (n= 1289). The participants who obtained high scores on the MI scale rated their <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> higher than the two other groups. Our results indicate that, in healthy subjects, subjective <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is associated with MI without the mediation by anxiety commonly observed in pathological cases. We propose that hyperacusis associated to high scores of MI may be a predispositional factor to deviant auditory experiences. The relative uncoupling of perception from auditory sensory input may result in a central hypersensitivity, which could play a role in triggering off the experience of auditory hallucinations...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several teleost {{species have}} evolved {{anterior}} {{extensions of the}} swim bladder which come close to or directly contact the inner ears. A few comparative {{studies have shown that}} these morphological specializations may enhance hearing abilities. This study investigates the diversity of swim bladder morphology in four Asian and African cichlid species and analyzes how this diversity affects their hearing sensitivity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied swim bladder morphology by dissections and by making 3 D reconstructions from high-resolution microCT scans. The <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was determined in terms of sound pressure levels (SPL) and particle acceleration levels (PAL) using the auditory evoked potential (AEP) recording technique. The swim bladders in Hemichromis guttatus and Steatocranus tinanti lacked anterior extensions and the swim bladder was considerably small in the latter species. In contrast, Paratilapia polleni and especially Etroplus maculatus possessed anterior extensions bringing the swim bladder close to the inner ears. All species were able to detect frequencies up to 3 kHz (SPL) except S. tinanti which only responded to frequencies up to 0. 7 kHz. P. polleni and E. maculatus showed significantly higher <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivities</b> at 0. 5 and 1 kHz than the two species lacking anterior swim bladder extensions. The highest <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivities</b> were found in E. maculatus, which possessed the most intimate swim bladder-inner ear relationship (maximum sensitivity 66 dB re 1 µPa at 0. 5 kHz). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that anterior swim bladder extensions seem to improve mean absolute <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivities</b> by 21 - 42 dB (SPLs) and 21 - 36 dB (PALs) between 0. 5 and 1 kHz. Besides anterior extensions, the size of the swim bladder appears to be an important factor for extending the detectable frequency range (up to 3 kHz) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Although age-related {{declines in}} perceiving spoken {{language}} are well established, {{the primary focus}} of research has been on perception of phonemes, words, and sentences. In contrast, relatively few investigations have been directed at establishing the effects of age on the comprehension of extended spoken passages. Moreover, most previous work has used extreme-group designs in which the performance of a group of young adults is contrasted with that of a group of older adults and little if any information is available regarding changes in listening comprehension across the adult lifespan. Accordingly, the goals of the current investigation were to determine whether there are age differences in listening comprehension across the adult lifespan and, if so, whether similar trajectories are observed for age-related changes in <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and listening comprehension. Design: This study used a cross-sectional lifespan design in which approximately 60 individuals in each of 7 decades, from age 20 to 89 yr (a total of 433 participants), were tested on three different measures of listening comprehension. In addition, we obtained measures of <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> from all participants. Results: Changes in <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> across the adult lifespan exhibited the progressive high-frequency loss typical of age-related hearing impairment. Performance on the listening comprehension measures, however, demonstrated a very different pattern, with scores on all measures remaining relatively stable until age 65 to 70 yr, after which significant declines were observed. Follow-up analyses indicated that this same general pattern was observed across three different types of passages (lectures, interviews, and narratives) and three different question types (information, integration, and inference). Multiple regression analyses indicated that low-frequency pure-tone average was the single largest contributor to age-related variance in listening comprehension for individuals older than 65 yr, but that age accounted for significant variance even after controlling for <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Conclusions: Results suggest that age-related reductions in <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> account for a sizable portion of individual variance in listening comprehension that was observed across the adult lifespan. Other potential contributors including a possible role for age-related declines in perceptual and cognitive abilities are discussed. Clinically, the results suggest that amplification is likely to improve listening comprehension but that increased audibility alone may not be sufficient to maintain listening comprehension beyond age 65 and 70 yr. Additional research will be needed to identify potential target abilities for training or other rehabilitation procedures that could supplement sensory aids to provide additional improvements in listening comprehension...|$|R
40|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was {{associated}} with speech perception which influenced Chinese word reading mainly through morphological awareness and rapid automatized naming. In contrast, for English word reading, the best model required an additional direct path from suprasegmental sensitivity (in Chinese) to English word reading {{on the basis of}} the proposed model. To be specific, <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was fully mediated by segmental and suprasegmental speech perception which further impacted English word reading mainly through phonological awareness; in addition, suprasegmental perception or speech prosody (in Chinese) was directly associated with word reading. Third, stress sensitivity in English was highly associated with speech prosodic sensitivity in Chinese. Hierarchical regressions also showed that suprasegmental speech perception failed to account unique variance for English word reading beyond phonological awareness when stress sensitivity was further controlled, suggesting that Chinese suprasegmental speech sensitivity may influence English word reading at least partly through its overlap with stress sensitivity. This study investigated the associations of <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> speech perception, Chinese reading as a first language (L 1) and English reading as a second language (L 2) in Hong Kong Chinese children. Participants were 180 second and third graders (98 boys and 82 girls, mean age= 98. 6 months). Apart from <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (both temporal and rhythmic processing measures), English stress sensitivity and English word reading, children were also tested on Chinese tasks of speech perception (both segmental and suprasegmental tasks), phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming (digit), verbal short-term memory, morphological awareness and Chinese word reading. I proposed a four-stage model, in which <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is fully mediated by speech perception at both the segmental and suprasegmental levels. These further impact word reading through phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, verbal short-term memory and morphological awareness. A series of nested model comparisons were conducted to test this model for both Chinese and English word reading using structural equation modeling. For Chinese word reading, the proposed four-stage model was demonstrated to be the best model. Zhang, Juan. Advisers: Catherine A. McBride-Chang; Him Cheung.

Here, we characterize auditory-evoked potentials recorded from hair {{cells in the}} saccule of reproductive and non-reproductive “sneaker” type II male midshipman to determine whether this sexual phenotype exhibits seasonal, reproductive state-dependent changes in <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and frequency response to behaviorally relevant auditory stimuli. Saccular potentials were recorded from the middle and caudal region of the saccule while sound was presented via an underwater speaker. Our results indicate saccular hair cells from reproductive type II males had thresholds based on measures of sound pressure and acceleration (re. 1 μPa and 1 ms− 2, respectively) that were ~ 8 – 21 dB lower than non-reproductive type II males across {{a broad range of}} frequencies, which include the dominant higher frequencies in type I male vocalizations. This increase in type II <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> may potentially facilitate eavesdropping by sneaker males and their assessment of vocal type I males for the selection of cuckoldry sites during the breeding season.

40|$|Cave {{fish have}} rarely been {{investigated}} {{with regard to}} their inner ear morphology, hearing abilities, and acoustic communication. Based on a previous study that revealed morphological differences in the saccular otolith between a cave and two surface populations of Poecilia mexicana, we checked for additional differences in utricular and lagenar otoliths and tested whether different populations have similar hearing sensitivities. We found pronounced differences in the shape of all three otoliths. Otoliths of the saccule and lagena from cave fish differed from those of surface fish in the features of the face oriented towards the sensory epithelium. In addition, otoliths of the utricle and lagena were significantly heavier in cave fish. <b>Auditory</b> <b>sensitivities</b> were measured between 100 and 1500  Hz, utilizing the auditory evoked potential recording technique. We found similar hearing abilities in cave and surface fish, with greatest sensitivity between 200 and 300  Hz. An acoustic survey revealed that neither ecotype produced species-specific sounds. Our data indicate that cave dwelling altered the otolith morphology in Atlantic mollies, probably due to metabolic differences. Different otolith morphology, however, did not affect general <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> or acoustic behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the type of {{reinforcer}} on <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and equal-loudness data were determined in the squirrel monkey. The monkeys, restrained and provided with earphones, were conditioned to depress and hold a bar down {{in the presence of a}} stimulus light and then to terminate the holding response after onset of a tone. In Experiment 1, the specified behavior sequence postponed electric shock; in Experiment 2, a food reinforcer was dependent on bar release during the tone. The shape of the <b>auditory</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function and the acuity level at each frequency were the same for the two procedures. The audible frequency range extended from below 0. 125 kHz (lowest frequency used) to 46 kHz. Sensitivity was maximum at 8 kHz. Latency of bar release following tone onset served as the basic data for constructing a family of equal-loudness contours. The type of reinforcer appeared not to be a determinant of either the shape of individual loudness contours or the pattern of family of equal-loudness functions. At the lower sound-pressure levels, the equal-loudness contours closely paralleled the threshold curves. At more-intense levels, the contours tended to flatten and depend less on frequency...|$|R
