The explored plasma parameters are 13. 56 MHz RF power, 100 KHz wafer electrode power, pressure, process gas flow rate, and etch time. The experiments are conducted in a modified Tegal MCR- 1 single wafer reactor operated in the triode mode. In both chemistries, particle contamination is a predictable function of the externally controlled plasma parameters. Particle deposition and <b>etch</b> <b>depth</b> have a linear dependence on 13. 56 MHz RF power, 100 KHz power, and etch time.

Lateral interference due to patterning is the mechanism by which this optical technique can determine <b>etch</b> <b>depth</b> into bulk material. Scalar analysis permitted fast data fitting and real time control. Si substrates were patterned with photoresist into line or square patterns with periods of 10, 20, or 40 μm, and reactive ion etched using a CF 4 /O 2 plasma. RTSE data were collected and simultaneously analyzed for <b>etch</b> <b>depth.</b> When the fitted <b>etch</b> <b>depth</b> reached a target value (500 nm) the etch was stopped. SEM and ex-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) analysis of the etched Si, with the photoresist removed, both agreed well with the RTSE results. It was also demonstrated that the Si etch rate {{as a function of}} experimental variable can be rapidly determined using RTSE without interrupting the etching. Bulk GaAs wafers patterned with the same patterns were etched in a citric acid solution while RTSE data were simultaneously analyzed for <b>etch</b> <b>depth.</b> Final <b>etch</b> <b>depth</b> measured by SEM was always within 5 % of the target depth (1 μm or 1. 6 μm) and ex-situ SE analysis of the etched GaAs agreed well with the RTSE results.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of real time fitting of optical reflection data for control during etching of patterned substrates, and the first application to monitor etching into bulk material. ^ RTSE measurements were made during the oxidation of bulk GaAs in deionized water (DI H 2 O) and in hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Despite limitations on the RTSE analysis due to UV absorption by the ambient liquids and bubble formation in H 2 O 2, it was demonstrated that in DI H 2 O the initial oxide layer growth was nearly linear in time while in H 2 O 2 it tended to saturate. In both cases the grown oxides were porous. ...|$|E
