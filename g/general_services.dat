40|$|The {{purpose of}} this System Design Description (SDD) is to {{describe}} {{the characteristics of the}} Cold Vacuum Drying (CVD) Facility <b>general</b> <b>service</b> helium system. The <b>general</b> <b>service</b> helium system is a <b>general</b> <b>service</b> facility process support system, but does include safety-class structures, systems and components (SSCs) providing protection to the offsite public. The <b>general</b> <b>service</b> helium system also performs safety-significant functions that provide protection to onsite workers. The general helium system essential function is to provide helium (He) to support process functions during all phases of facility operations. <b>General</b> <b>service</b> helium is used to purge the cask and the MCO in order to maintain their internal atmospheres below hydrogen flammability concentrations. The <b>general</b> <b>service</b> helium system also supplies helium to purge the process water conditioning (PWC) lines and components and the vacuum purge system (VPS) vacuum pump. The <b>general</b> <b>service</b> helium system, if available following an Safety Class Instrument and Control System (SCIC) Isolation and Purge (IS 0 and PURGE) Trip, can provide an alternate <b>general</b> <b>service</b> helium system source to supply the Safety-Class Helium (SCHe) System...|$|R

According to Mark Potok, director of Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, his organization tracked another 60domestic smaller-scale terrorism plots from 1995 to 2005. Several of the plots were uncovered and prevented while others caused various infrastructure damage, deaths, or other destruction. Potok revealed that in 1996 there were approximately 858domestic militias and other antigovernment groups but the number had dropped to 152 by 2004.

5|$|East of MD43 and the {{adjacent}} <b>General</b> <b>Services</b> Administration facility, MD150 becomes a five-lane road with center turn lane east to Carroll Island Road. East of that county highway, {{which leads to}} the community of Bowleys Quarters, the state highway reduces to two lanes. MD150 passes under a Norfolk Southern Railway spur from the Amtrak Northeast Corridor to the Charles P. Crane Generating Station and intersects Marshy Point Road, which leads into Dundee Natural Environment Area. The route ends at its intersection with Ebenezer Road and Graces Quarter Road in the community of Chase. Graces Quarter Road serves as a connector to the main section of the county highway, which heads east into a unit of Gunpowder Falls State Park. The county highway also heads west as Ebenezer Road, which passes over Eastern Avenue and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor immediately to the northeast on Eastern Avenue. Eastern Avenue itself continues northeast as a county highway to its end at Greenbank Road on the Gunpowder River.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the <b>General</b> <b>Services</b> Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was constructed pursuant {{to an agreement}} between the <b>General</b> <b>Services</b> Administration (GSA) and Boston developer David Nassif, Sr. In July 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson began planning to unite various disparate transportation agencies into a new United States Department of Transportation. GSA (the property owner and manager for the U.S. federal government) began seeking to lease or build a structure to house the new agency in late 1965. Donald T. Kirwan, chief of GSA's leasing division, knew Nassif from a previous lease negotiation, and discussed with him the siting of a building and its size. Nassif approached the RLA on April 21, 1966, and asked to buy the newly razed block of land bounded by 6th, 7th, D, and E Streets SW. In May 1967, GSA {{sent a letter to}} Nassif advising him that it was likely to lease the entire structure he intended to build. The $5.9 million land purchase was finalized on October 30, 1967. The cost of the structure is unclear. On November 15, 1967, Nassif had secured a $39 million construction loan. But The Washington Post pegged the cost of the building at $27 million in July 1968. The newspaper said in August 1970 that the cost of the structure was $26.5 million. The {{building was}} designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone, who also designed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. On April 11, 1968, GSA leased the entire building from Nassif for 20 years for $98 million. John A. Volpe Construction was the chief contractor.|$|E
