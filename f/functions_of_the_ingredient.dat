40|$|A {{solution}} {{has been}} formulated to preserve deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) in specimens of blood, saliva, and other bodily fluids. Specimens {{of this type}} are collected for diagnostic molecular pathology, which is becoming <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> choice for diagnosis <b>of</b> many diseases. <b>The</b> solution {{makes it possible to}} store such specimens at room temperature, without risk of decomposition, for subsequent analysis in a laboratory that could be remote from the sampling location. Thus, the solution could be a means to bring <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> diagnostic molecular pathology to geographic regions where refrigeration equipment and diagnostic laboratories are not available. The table lists <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution. <b>The</b> <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> are <b>the</b> following: EDTA chelates divalent cations that are necessary cofactors for nuclease activity. In so doing, it functionally removes these cations and thereby retards <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> nucleases. EDTA also stabilizes the DNA helix. Tris serves as a buffering agent, which is needed because minor contaminants in an unbuffered solution can exert pronounced effects on pH and thereby cause spontaneous degradation of DNA. SDS is an ionic detergent that inhibits ribonuclease activity. SDS has been used in some lysis buffers and as a storage buffer for RNA after purification. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution is straightforward. For example, a sample of saliva is collected by placing a cotton roll around in the subject's mouth until it becomes saturated, then the cotton is placed in a collection tube. Next, 1. 5 mL <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution are injected directly into the cotton and the tube is capped for storage at room temperature. <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution has been demonstrated in tests on specimens of saliva containing herpes simplex virus. In the tests, the viral DNA, as amplified by polymerase chain reaction, was detected even after storage for 120 days...|$|R
40|$|Dihydrodiol {{dehydrogenase}} (DDH) {{is frequently}} detected in cancer cells, and its overexpression correlates with drug resistance, <b>the</b> downregulation <b>of</b> DNA repair mechanisms, increased frequency of tumor recurrence, cancer cell metastasis and poor prognosis. <b>The</b> silencing <b>of</b> DDH expression using siRNA, {{on the other}} hand, reduces drug resistance and cancer cell mobility. These data suggest that DDH may be an oncogene-related protein. However, no specific DDH inhibitor has been identified to date. Thus, in this study, we used DDH as a target enzyme in a live-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to screen Chinese medicinal herb extracts (CMHEs) with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> identifying a DDH inhibitor. Using this method, we found 49 among 796 CMHEs that inhibited DDH expression.

This kernel is independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying kinematics {{and it is also}} spin-independent. Those features hold, in impact parameter space, to all values <b>of</b> b_T. <b>The</b> evolution kernel presented has all of its large logarithms resummed up next-to-next-to leading logarithmic accuracy, which is the highest possible accuracy given existing perturbative calculations. As a study case we apply this kernel to investigate <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> Collins <b>function,</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> that have attracted recently much attention within <b>the</b> phenomenological studies <b>of</b> spin asymmetries.

40|$|Pollination is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} ecosystem services in agroecosystems and supports food production.

Este trabalho teve como objetivo estudar a função dos ingredientes na consistência da massa e nas características dos pães de queijo produzidos. As massas foram obtidas de 100 % polvilho azedo (PA), 100 % polvilho doce (PD), 70 % polvilho azedo + 30 % polvilho doce (PS) e 50 % polvilho azedo + 50 % polvilho doce (PC), combinados com formulações: completa, com todos os ingredientes (FC), sem leite, mas com água (SL), sem ovo (SO) e sem queijo. As massas foram desenvolvidas no Farinógrafo Brabender, o qual teve deste modo sua forma de utilização ampliada, e a evolução da consistência destas massas foi acompanhada por meio dos gráficos gerados. As massas foram moldadas e assadas e as características dos pães analisadas. Durante o escaldamento e mistura houve elevação dos valores de consistência, o ovo causou queda drástica desta consistência e o queijo provocou nova elevação, tornando a massa moldável. A consistência das massas foi mais afetada pelas formulações sendo que, as sem leite (SL) apresentaram os maiores registros; as sem queijo (SQ) as menos consistentes. As massas sem ovo (SO) apresentaram-se secas, duras, despedaçando-se quando manuseadas. Pães de queijo FC e SQ apresentaram maior volume específico e maior diâmetro. Pães de queijo SO apresentaram menor índice de expansão.

40|$|Surfactant (surface active agent) covers <b>the</b> alveoli <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{lung and}} lowers the surface {{tension on the}} air-water-interface. Surfactant is a complex mixture and {{contains}} about 90 % of lipid and 10 % of surfactant associated proteins. Specialized lung epithelial cells, the alveolar type II cells, produce surfactant. The cells do secretion and uptake by processes called exo- and endocytosis. For decades native and synthetic preparations of surfactant have been an effective medicine in IRDS (infant respiratory distress syndrome). Encouraging results prove <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> surfactant in adults with severe respiratory failure ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome). However, for best quality of surfactant preparations, details about <b>the</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> as well as regulating mechanism are essential. In following study we examined <b>the</b> endocytosis <b>of</b> lipid in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-A in freshly prepared alveolar type II cells. Previous studies have demonstrated, that SP-A and aggregated lipid are internalized via coated pits and coated vesicles. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} analyze <b>the</b> endocytotic way <b>of</b> SP-B and associated lipid in comparison to lipid without surfactant proteins and lipid in association with SP-A. Does it use the way via coated pits and vesicles? Does the uptake with SP-B depend on tubuline, a certain cytosceletal protein? Several signal transduction mechanisms have been published to be involved in <b>the</b> secretion <b>of</b> surfactant. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great variety <b>of</b> signaling mechanisms we focused our investigation on already described pathways playing a role in exocytosis. For best possible imitation of physiological principles we used freshly isolated alveolar type II cells. The used liposomes did mimic natural surfactant in their lipid composition and protein- lipid-ratio (1 : 75). The surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-B were extracted in complex procedures and were tested for purity as well as for contamination. <b>The</b> uptake <b>of</b> lipid is expressed as <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> counted radioactivity (dpm) and <b>the</b> protein content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cells (µg). The results show that <b>the</b> incorporation <b>of</b> SP-B does reduce <b>the</b> uptake <b>of</b> lipid (surfactant like liposomes). Both proteins SP-B and SP-C have been demonstrated to enhance lipid uptake in vitro (Horowitz et al.). But on the other hand SP-B was able to reduce lipid uptake produced by SP-C (Horowitz et al.). The contradictory results according to SP-B {{can be explained by the}} diverse methods and techniques used (freshly prepared versus cultured cells, isolation and purity of SP-B, liposome preparation with significant variating protein-lipid- ratios, incubation time). Thus leads to a great variability of results related to SP-B. <b>The</b> uptake <b>of</b> lipid associated with SP-B (SP-B containing liposomes) does not involve clathrin or tubuline. We find the AC with the second messenger cAMP to be involved in endocytosis with SP-B. The following investigated signal transduction pathways seem not to play a role in uptake of SP-B and associated lipid: PLC with the second messenger IP 3, PKC and G-proteins. The AC with cAMP is not involved in <b>the</b> endocytosis <b>of</b> lipid associated with SP-A. The same applies for lipid without surfactant proteins. Conclusions: SP-B does influence <b>the</b> uptake <b>of</b> lipids in vitro. Clathrin or tubuline are not responsible for endocytosis of SP-B and associated lipid. Furthermore the signal transduction system using AC and cAMP seems to be involved in <b>the</b> endocytosis <b>of</b> lipid with SP-B, but not in <b>the</b> endocytosis <b>of</b> lipid without surfactant proteins as well as of lipid and SP-A. From these results it can be concluded that <b>the</b> uptake <b>of</b> lipid associated with SP-B differs from <b>the</b> endocytosis <b>of</b> lipid alone and from lipid with SP-A. This uptake pathway is possible to correspond to the actin dependent endocytosis involving lamellar body membrane like postulated by Shuman et al...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{requirements}} <b>of</b> {{good quality}} and appetizing fast food increases continuously {{as a consequence}} of a community where food is always available. <b>The</b> crispiness <b>of</b> French fries is an issue that must be considered in this context, since it tends to decrease and give the fries a soft surface not appreciated by the consumer. To prolong the crispiness, the fries can be coated by a batter, a mix <b>of</b> starches. <b>The</b> batters used often consists of modified starches, e. g. cross-linked, acetylated and dextrinizated to increase and prolong crispiness, flour to stabilize the batter and sodium bicarbonate to make the batter “rise”. The cross-linked starch keeps the granules in a swelled state and prevents them from breaking when exposed to heat or processing: therefore, it delays the gelatinization and decreases <b>the</b> stickiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batter. The acetylated starch delays the retrogradation since it prevents amylose from packing when retrograded. It also stabilizes the batter. The dextrin added consists of heat and acid processed starch and decreases <b>the</b> gelatinization temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batter. It also gives an appetizing color to the French fries. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this project is to give further understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ingredients´ <b>functions,</b> and to find alternative ingredients in a recipe already used, since <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> some <b>ingredients</b> has increased rapidly during the last few years. By studying an existing recipe and by doing a literary research some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideas were applied in the laboratory, followed by sensory and technical evaluations where color, appearance, crispiness, hardness and, to some degree, taste were evaluated. <b>The</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> starch solutions was measured since it indicates the pick-up (<b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> batter attached to the French fries). Pick-up and texture were also analyzed. Experiments confirmed the hypothesis that the acetylated starch was unnecessary and could be replaced by cross-linked starch. A high degree of cross-linking seemed to decrease the crispiness, which may depend on the prevented granule swelling. Replacing the cross-linked starch with native potato starch did not work since the batter became way too sticky. The flour could, to some degree, be replaced by native potato starch since the crispiness was very distinct. Too high concentrations of native starch made all batters very sticky, though, probably because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early granule “explosion” caused by processing and high frying temperatures. Maize flour was an alternative to the flour currently used, since the color, appearance and crispiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French fries were very good according to the sensory evaluations. Although the difference between the batters seemed evident when evaluated sensory, statistics made sure that it was not significant. More research and tests {{needs to be done to}} assure <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> this project. It is also necessary to verify that the laboratory results are identical to those in industry. However, the study gave further understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> and confirmed that there are several ways of improving an already good concept. I takt med att allt större krav ställs på snabbmatsrestauranger och - producenter ökar också pressen att hitta livsmedel som lever upp till dessa. Stärkelsecoating av pommes frites används idag i många industrier i syfte att attrahera konsumenten genom en ökad krispighet och ett mer aptitligt utseende. Som namnet Clear-coat batter anger, ska battern inte synas utan används enbart i syfte att ge en förbättrad struktur. Syftet med det här examensarbetet är att hitta billigare ersättningar till de stärkelsevarianter som i dagsläget används i ett fungerande koncept, samt att öka förståelsen för de ingående komponenternas påverkan på slutresultatet. Arbetet tar sin början med en litteratursökning för att sedan fortsätta med appliceringsförsök och påföljande sensorisk och teknisk analys. De sensoriska analyserna, baserade på färg, utseende, krispighet och hårdhet hos pommes frites coatade med batter, stärkelseblandning, låg till grund för vidare försök och avgjorde vilka receptmodifieringar som skulle granskas ytterligare genom viskositets - pick-up - och texturmätningar. Den acetylerade stärkelse som används i referensreceptet hade inte någon tydlig påverkan på slutresultatet, utan kunde ersättas med tvärbunden stärkelse. Det framgick även att det rismjöl som används till viss del kunde ersättas med nativ potatisstärkelse, samt att majsmjöl gav ett mycket tillfredsställande resultat. Testerna visade att den tvärbundna stärkelsen var oumbärlig då klistrigheten blev för hög utan denna ingrediens. Det förelåg ingen signifikant skillnad mellan de olika recepten vid texturmätning, men fler försök behövs för att säkerställa denna slutsats...|$|R

40|$|On {{the road}} towards silicon {{thin-film}} photovoltaic modules with a conversion efficiency <b>of</b> 10 %, <b>the</b> micromorph tandem solar cell is a promising candidate. Two ingredients {{are commonly used}} for light-management within the micromorph solar cell: (1) nano-textured interfaces and (2) insertion of an intermediate reflector in-between the two component cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tandem. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nano-textures is to promote light scattering at the optical interfaces and therefore to increase <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> absorption of red light in the amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) absorber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top cell and of infrared light in the microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H) absorber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottom cell. For micromorph devices deposited on glass plates, these nano-textures are obtained by <b>the</b> deposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar cell on a surface-textured transparent conductive front electrode. <b>The</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>ingredient,</b> <b>the</b> intermediate reflector, {{is to increase the}} photo-current density within the a-Si:H top cell, thanks to reflections produced at the additional optical interface. This document study the interplay between those two <b>ingredients</b> within <b>the</b> optoelectronic system formed by the micromorph solar cell. In particular, <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front contact on the growth and performances of µc-Si:H solar cells is described. A study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electronic transport within µc-Si:H cells is carried out using Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy and two original methods based on conductive atomic force microscopy. Also, <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angular distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light scattered by nano-textured front electrodes is demonstrated. Angular distributions for light scattered in-air and in a-Si:H are calculated from atomic force microscopy pictures of different front electrodes. The calculations are performed using phase screens and the scalar scattering theory. Theoretical results obtained with this approach are successfully confronted with experimental data obtained in-air. Besides, a quantitative comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative importance <b>of</b> a reduced free carrier absorption (FCA) in the front electrode and of an improvement of its light-trapping capability is presented. For <b>the</b> different types <b>of</b> front contacts used in this work, this comparison shows that <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> FCA produces more than 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gains in photo-current density. Regarding <b>the</b> direct effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermediate reflector, this work experimentally demonstrates that the gain obtained in <b>the</b> current density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top cell is larger with nano-textured interfaces than with flat interfaces.

Therefore an approach to strengthen the inherent satiety for fat can be used to prevent overconsumption. Thylakoid membranes isolated from <b>the</b> chloroplast <b>of</b> green leaves have been found to reduce <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> lipolysis by inhibiting lipase/co-lipase. Administration of thylakoids to animals and humans reduced food intake and body weight as well as affected appetite-regulation hormones. When a product for consumers shall be formulated based on a plant extract with appetite suppressing abilities, the material must maintain the functionality during industrial processing and storage. Heat treatment is often applied to assure <b>the</b> microbiological safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product, and to dry the plant extract into powder form increases the shelf life and flexibility in applications {{while at the same time}} also reduces transport and handling costs. The present thesis aims to investigate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> processing on thylakoids’ physicochemical properties and subsequent physiological <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appetite-suppressing <b>ingredient.</b> Heat treatment reduced the ability to inhibit lipase/co-lipase in vitro. Heat treatment also affected chlorophyll content and the thylakoids’ ability to stabilize the oil-water interface in oil-in-water emulsions. Drum drying, spray drying and freeze drying were investigated. Drying at higher temperatures decreased <b>the</b> emulsifying capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thylakoids as well as reducing lipase-inhibiting effect. Deterioration processes was initiated during dehydration and continued during storage. Moisture in surrounding air had a definite effect on chlorophyll degradation with highest degradation rate in high relative humidity. Emulsifying capacity of thylakoid powders was impaired after storage and the reduction was accelerated at higher relative humidities. Spray-dried thylakoid powder had the highest chlorophyll content and the highest emulsifying capacity of all powders investigated. The mild heat treatment during dehydration preserved the chlorophyll content but was severe enough to partly inactivate degradation enzymes. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> studied techniques, spray drying was concluded to be the most suitable drying technique with respect to functionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting powder after processing and storage. A correlation between characteristics and functionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thylakoids was established both in aqueous solution and in powder formula. Chlorophyll content, green colour and lightness of powders and ability to stabilize the oil-water interface were correlated to lipase-inhibiting capacity. This opens possibilities to partly replace the enzymatic activity measurement method with the less time consuming and more cost efficient spectrophotometric method and emulsion-based model in screening processes, for example during process optimization. In conclusion, the thesis contributes with knowledge about <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> processing and storage on thylakoid products’ functionality. Thus the results can be applied in production of a more standardised functional food ingredient with optimized and predicted appetite reducing properties...|$|R
