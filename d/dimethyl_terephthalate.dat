5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes.

40|$|The Ames assay {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the mutagenicity of several phthalate esters as an approximation of their carcinogenic potential. The ortho diesters, dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) produced a positive dose-related mutagenic response with Salmonella TA 100, {{but only in the}} absence of S- 9 liver enzymes. Dibutyl, di(2 -ethylhexyl), mono(2 ethylhexyl), and butyl benzyl phthalate as well as the <b>dimethyl</b> isophthalate and <b>terephthalates</b> and the trimethyl ester, trimellitate, were not mutagenic with TA 100 or TA 98 in {{the presence or absence of}} S- 9. In a host-mediated assay, extracts of 24 -hr urines of rats injected IP with DMP (2 g/kg) were not mutagenic to TA 100 at levels up to 8 equivalent-ml of urine/plate (representing 30 % of their daily urinary output). In vitro studies revealed that S- 9 associated esterase hydrolyzed DMP to the monoester and methanol and eliminated its mutagenicity. Whole rat skin was shown to have about 1. 5 % of the DMP-esterase activity of liver, when compared on a wet weight basis. An in vitro binding study indicated that epidermal macromolecules bound DMP at a severalfold greater rate than hepatic macromolecules. Thus, both the mutagenicity and binding of DMP are inversely related to the metabolism of this compound. These results suggest that skin could be at high risk for a mutagenic/carcinogenic insult...|$|R
