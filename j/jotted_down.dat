5|$|Elgar began {{composing}} when still a child, and all {{his life}} he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes <b>jotted</b> <b>down</b> randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which {{he and his brother}} played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the repertory.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his career}} Monkhouse had <b>jotted</b> <b>down</b> jokes, odd facts, one-liners, {{sketches}} and ideas {{in a series}} of leather bound books, which he took with him to every television, radio, stage and nightclub performance he made. In July 1995, two were stolen and Monkhouse offered a £15,000 reward. They were returned after 18 months, but the thief, although arrested, was never charged. On Monkhouse's death, the books were bequeathed to Colin Edmonds.|$|E

25|$|Although Williams {{attracted}} the attention and admiration {{of some of the}} most notable writers of his day, including T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden, his greatest admirer was probably C. S. Lewis, whose novel That Hideous Strength (1945) has been regarded as partially inspired by his acquaintance with both the man and his novels and poems. Williams came to know Lewis after reading Lewis's then-recently published study The Allegory of Love; he was so impressed he <b>jotted</b> <b>down</b> a letter of congratulation and dropped it in the mail. Coincidentally, Lewis had just finished reading Williams's novel The Place of the Lion and had written a similar note of congratulation. The letters crossed in the mail and led to an enduring and fruitful friendship.|$|E

500|$|According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel {{conceived}} {{the core of}} Mulberry Street {{in the summer of}} 1936 aboard the MS Kungsholm, a Swedish American luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, Helen Palmer. As the Kungsholm endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he <b>jotted</b> <b>down</b> a rambling plot that started with [...] "a stupid horse and wagon". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, [...] "And that is a story that no one can beat, and to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street." [...] For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.|$|E

500|$|In the seventh-season episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] (1995), Lisa {{permanently}} {{becomes a}} vegetarian, distinguishing her {{as one of}} the first primetime television characters to make such a choice. The episode was written by David S. Cohen (in his first solo writing credit) who <b>jotted</b> <b>down</b> the idea one day while eating lunch. Then-executive producer David Mirkin, who had recently become a vegetarian, quickly approved the idea. Several of Lisa's experiences in the episode are based on Mirkin's own experiences. The episode guest stars musician Paul McCartney, a committed vegetarian and animal rights activist. McCartney's condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series and would not revert the next week (as is common on situation comedies). The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show. In the season 13 episode [...] "She of Little Faith" [...] (2001), Lisa underwent another permanent character change when she converted to Buddhism.|$|E
500|$|On Monday morning, Nixon flew to Los Angeles, making {{notes for}} his speech aboard the plane. He <b>jotted</b> <b>down</b> the line {{he had said}} in Eugene {{regarding}} his wife's coat. He made notes concerning the family finances, upsetting Pat Nixon, who asked why people had to know their financial details. The senator responded that people in politics live in a fishbowl. He recalled the Fala speech, in which Franklin Roosevelt had sarcastically responded to Republican claims he had sent a destroyer to fetch his dog, Fala, and remembered the dog his children had recently received: A Texas traveling salesman named Lou Carrol had read a report that Pat Nixon said her children Tricia and Julie [...] "longed" [...] for a dog, and his own dog, an American Cocker Spaniel, had just had a litter. After a telegram exchange, he crated the puppy and shipped it by rail to the Nixons, and six-year-old Tricia Nixon named the dog [...] "Checkers". Nixon decided that including the anecdote evoking FDR would needle his enemies and delight his friends.|$|E
500|$|Determined to {{make her}} novels as {{accurate}} as possible, Heyer collected reference works and research materials to use while writing. At {{the time of her}} death she owned over 1,000 historical reference books, including Debrett's and an 1808 dictionary of the House of Lords. In addition to the standard historical works about the medieval and eighteenth-century periods, her library included histories of snuff boxes, sign posts, and costumes. She often clipped illustrations from magazine articles and <b>jotted</b> <b>down</b> interesting vocabulary or facts onto note cards, but rarely recorded where she found the information. Her notes were sorted into categories, such as Beauty, Colours, Dress, Hats, Household, Prices, and Shops; and even included details such as the cost of candles in a particular year. Other notebooks contained lists of phrases, covering such topics as [...] "Food and Crockery", [...] "Endearments", and [...] "Forms of Address." [...] One of her publishers, Max Reinhardt, once attempted to offer editorial suggestions about the language in one of her books but was promptly informed by a member of his staff that no one in England knew more about Regency language than Heyer.|$|E

500|$|After {{producing}} {{the music for}} Oni, O'Donnell was tasked with composing the music for Bungie's next project, which would be unveiled at E3 2000. After talking with Joseph Staten, O'Donnell decided the music needed to be [...] "big, exciting, and unusual with a classical orchestra touch to give it some weight and stature. We also wanted it {{to have some sort}} of 'ancient' feel to it." [...] O'Donnell came up with the idea of opening the piece with gregorian chant and <b>jotted</b> <b>down</b> the melody in his car. Because he did not know how long the presentation would be, O'Donnell created [...] "smushy" [...] opening and closing sections that could be expanded or cut as time required to back up a rhythmic middle section. The music was recorded and sent to New York the same night the piece was finished; the resulting music became the basis for the Halo series' [...] "highly recognizable" [...] signature sound, and what has been called one of the best-known video game themes. The use of the chant in the main theme has been credited with contributing to popular interest in the genre. Halos music used an interactive engine to change music in response to player's actions; this non-linear method has since become widespread. The scores for Halo and its sequel Halo 2 garnered awards such as The Game Developer's Choice Award and Best Original Video Game Soundtrack from Rolling Stone.|$|E

These points convinced Darwin that transmutation of species must be occurring, and in his Red Notebook he <b>jotted</b> <b>down</b> his first evolutionary ideas. He began specific transmutation notebooks with speculations on variation in offspring [...] "to adapt & alter the race to changing world", and sketched an [...] "irregularly branched" [...] genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree.|$|E
