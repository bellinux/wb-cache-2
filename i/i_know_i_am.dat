With the cabal breathing even more murderously down our backs it is time. And you are still doing it. You are still murdering each other.|$|E
500|$|On July 17, 2016, Colbert hijacked the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, while {{dressed as}} Caesar Flickerman from The Hunger Games series. After {{he was taken}} down from the stage, he commented, [...] "Look, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not {{supposed}} to be up here but let's be honest, neither is Donald Trump." [...] Colbert also dressed as Flickerman on his show, prior to the stunt, to announce the candidates who had ended their runs in the 2016 election.|$|E
500|$|On 4 January 2013, it was {{announced}} that Chamakh had been loaned to West Ham United {{until the end of the}} 2012–13 season. The loan deal was confirmed on West Ham's official site with the striker saying, [...] "I didn't have opportunities to play recently, but I did well before and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a very good striker. We played only one striker at Arsenal, so I didn't play a lot, so I hope to do so more with West Ham." [...] He played only three games for West Ham without scoring.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had my happy days--my days of care-free youth," [...] the unquiet man was saying. [...] "But my time {{of innocence}} was short. Evil companions came early and {{reckless}} deeds followed.... <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> losing something, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being drawn downward, but I could not escape.

500|$|Armstrong's {{colleague}} on the Apollo 11 mission, Buzz Aldrin, {{said that}} he was [...] "deeply saddened by the passing. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> joined by millions of others in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew. I had truly hoped that on July 20th, 2019, Neil, Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing... Regrettably, this is not to be." [...] Apollo 11 Command Module pilot Michael Collins said, of Armstrong, [...] "He was the best, and I will miss him terribly." [...] NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said that: [...] "As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own".|$|E
500|$|For the 1969 season, Rindt {{signed for}} the 1968 World Constructors' Champion Lotus, where {{he joined the}} {{defending}} Drivers' Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: [...] "Every time I am being overtaken by my own wheel, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in a Lotus." [...] When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and de facto manager Bernie Ecclestone, who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham {{may have been a}} better choice of team but the speed of the Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship. Rindt commented: [...] "At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die." [...] Because of his uncertainty about the wisdom of joining the team, Rindt did not sign the Lotus contract until shortly before the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix.|$|E
