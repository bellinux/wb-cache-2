40|$|This paper {{formulated}} a short-run model, with {{an explicit}} role for monetary policy, for analyzing world oil and <b>gas</b> markets. The model described carefully {{the parameters of}} these markets and their vulnerability to business cycles. Estimates showed that short-run demand for oil and <b>gas</b> was price- inelastic, relatively income-elastic, and was influenced by interest and exchange rates; short-run supply was price-inelastic. Short-run price inelasticity could be a source for high volatility in oil and <b>gas</b> prices, and could confer to producers a temporary market power. Being simultaneous and incorporating interest and exchange rates, the model could be useful in short-term forecasting of oil and <b>gas</b> outputs and prices under policy scenarios.

40|$|Technical BriefTechnical Brief 1 : This {{paper will}} discuss the {{challenges}} with contamination of <b>gas</b> seals. The reliability of <b>gas</b> seals is largely dependent on having a continuous supply of clean and dry seal <b>gas.</b> In dynamic mode, <b>gas</b> supply systems take product <b>gas</b> from a higher pressure level in the compressor, filter it {{and use it to}} create the ideal environment for the <b>gas</b> seal. This typically ensures that the <b>gas</b> seal is provided with effective protection against contaminated process <b>gas.</b> Compressor <b>gas</b> seals are very robust sealing devices, but need to be operated in a dry and clean environment. The leading root cause of <b>gas</b> seal failures is contamination. One of the most common sources of contamination is during compressor start up, slow-roll, standstill, or shutdown modes or because the conditioning skid is not sufficient. In these modes {{there is a lack of}} seal <b>gas</b> flow, which suggests no means to produce seal <b>gas</b> flow is available, such as a high pressure <b>gas</b> source or booster for the seal <b>gas</b> supply. This is where it pays to have a reliable, clean <b>gas</b> supply. Without seal <b>gas</b> flow, sufficient seal <b>gas</b> cannot be provided to the <b>gas</b> seal and results in the <b>gas</b> seal being contaminated. This paper will describe contamination to the <b>gas</b> seal by process <b>gas,</b> during commissioning, by particle and by liquids, which are caused by inadequate seal <b>gas</b> supply.
