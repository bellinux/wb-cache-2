Part I of this thesis focuses on the calibration of the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), {{one of the two}} primary focal plane instruments on the Chandra X-ray Observatory. I begin by presenting a series of measurements made using undispersed synchrotron radiation. I analyzed the results of these experiments to extract parameters necessary to model the absolute detection efficiency of CCDs used as reference standards for ACIS characterization. I also discuss a novel "mesh" technique I pioneered to non-destructively measure the sub-pixel structure of CCDs, including the channel stops and <b>gates.</b> <b>Guided</b> by the results of the mesh experiments, I performed additional measurements to constrain recombination effects in the channel stops. Part II of this thesis concerns the X-ray properties of rotation- powered (radio) pulsars. High energy observations serve as a powerful diagnostic of the energetics and emission mechanisms of neutron stars. I analyze ASCA and ROSAT observations of three young pulsars which are particularly well-suited for addressing these issues. I also present observations of the rotation-powered pulsar with the highest known magnetic field, and describe how the results relate to anomalous X-ray pulsars, another type of neutron star. Finally, I analyze Chandra observations of the supernova remnant Cas A. These data fully demonstrate the capabilities of ACIS and reveal a previously unknown point source {{at the center of the}} remnant. Comment: PhD Thesis, MIT, 2000.

A {{woman who had been}} lying in wait for tourists at the <b>gate,</b> <b>guided</b> them to the bend of the glen, where they were to climb up to pay their respects to the waterfall. The ascent was not far from perpendicular, only rendered accessible by the slope of fallen debris at the base, and a few steps cut out from one projecting rock to another, up to a narrow shelf, whence the cascade was to be looked down on. The more adventurous spirits went on to a rock overhanging the fall, and with a curious chink or cranny, forming a window with a seat, and called King O'Toole's chair. Each girl perched herself there, and was complimented on her strong head and active limbs, and all their powers were needed in the long breathless pull up craggy stepping-stones, then over steep slippery turf, ere they gained the summit of the bank. Spent, though still gasping out, 'such fun!' they threw themselves on their backs upon the thymy grass, and lay still for several seconds ere they sat up to look back at the thickly-wooded ravine, winding crevice-like in and out between the overlapping skirts of the hills, whose rugged heads cut off the horizon. Then merrily sharing the first instalment of luncheon with their barefooted guide, they turned their faces onwards, where all their way seemed one bare gray moor, rising far off into the outline of Luggela, a peak overhanging the semblance of a crater.|$|R

In this report we were interested in determining whether this approach can be used to deliver retroviral vectors specifically to cells that express heregulin receptors. Heregulin receptors are attractive targets for retroviral vector-based gene delivery protocols since they are often overexpressed on the surfaces of cancer cells. To explore this possibility, the TVA–herβ 1 protein was generated, consisting of the extracellular domain of the TVA receptor for ASLV-A fused to the EGF-like region of heregulin β 1. TVA–herβ 1 bound specifically to cells that express heregulin receptors, rendering them susceptible to efficient and specific infection by subgroup A ASLV vectors. In addition, these activities of TVA–herβ 1 were abrogated specifically in the presence of another bridge protein that contained the same ligand domain. These data confirm that the GATE protein TVA–herβ 1 mediates targeted retroviral infection via cell surface heregulin receptors...|$|R

The pulsar capabilities of DiFX include binary gating, binning, and matched-filter <b>gating.</b> This <b>guide</b> does not attempt to teach fundamentals of pulsar timing or document standard pulsar software. This guide is written for DiFX version 2. 0. 0, however, most of the document applies without change to 1. 5. x series versions as well. 1 Pulsar capabilities within DiFX The periodic nature of pulsar emission, usually with very deep, relatively long periods of no emission, offers the opportunity for increase in mean sensitivity of pulsar observations by weighting accumulations on a very short timescale (given by a single FFT of the FX correlator, or ∼ 1 µs). Alternately, the option exists to generate phase-resolved integrations, generating multiple output visibility databases, each representing a distinct pulse longitude (or phase) range. These two capabilities are called gating and binning, respectively and are described below. A final pulsar capability of DiFX is called profile mode. In this mode, the correlator is configured to only generate binned auto-correlations, in a manner analogous to the online folding performed by typical pulsa...|$|R

Four accidents occurred in 2011 that involved the toppling of sliding gates at entrances to buildings. One worker was killed while four others were injured in the accidents.

Gate toppling accidents could have been easily prevented if safety considerations had been made and implemented at the gate design, installation, operation and maintenance stages. (I) Design Phase 4. All gates should be designed such that their installation, maintenance and operation can be carried out safely. The following should be considered when designing the gate: A. Gate structures should be structurally stable and designed in accordance to prevailing structural codes (eg. BS 5950, EC 3). B. Manually operated gates should be designed such that the force, to open or close it, is restricted to 150 N for residential property gates and 260 N per person for commercial/ industrial property <b>gates.</b> C. <b>Guides</b> and stoppers should be adequately designed and sized to ensure that the gate will not over-travel nor will it topple in the event of derailment during operation. D. Housings for motors of electrical gates should be standalone elements and not have dual usage as stoppers or <b>guides</b> for the <b>gates.</b> This is to ensure that the gates remain safe for use in the event the motors and housings are removed for maintenance.

50|$|Ship {{caissons}} {{are slow}} to operate and so, during the Victorian period, the more efficient 'sliding caission' (also 'floating-' or 'rolling caisson') was developed. This is a permanent fixture within the dock, like a hinged dock gate, and moves upon a fixed track. The sides of the caisson are vertical, making a narrow rectangular box. Water ballast is used to control its buoyancy, as for the ship caisson, but the floating caisson is then hauled sideways into a recess built {{into the side of}} the dock wall. Rolling caissons are a development of sliding caissons fitted with rollers beneath. These do not rely solely on buoyancy to make them portable and so are easier to operate. The caisson may only need to be lifted a few inches to make it movable on its track, which significantly reduces the ballast pumping time compared to a ship caisson. When closing the <b>gate,</b> the track <b>guides</b> it automatically back into place, avoiding the slow manoeuvering with tugs or winches necessary to align a ship caisson. Electrically-operated sliding caissons, installed around 1900, on the entrance of the Zeebrugge Canal to the North Sea could operate within two minutes.|$|R

Many of researches have focused on motivation of gated community, the developing process of gated community, the main features of gated community, and usage condition of gated community.
