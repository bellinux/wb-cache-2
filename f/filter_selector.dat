40|$|Feature {{selection}} {{is an important}} technique in dealing with application problems with large number of variables and limited training samples, such as image processing, combinatorial chemistry, and microarray analysis. Commonly employed feature selection strategies {{can be divided into}} filter and wrapper. In this study, we propose an embedded two-layer feature selection approach to combining the advantages of filter and wrapper algorithms while avoiding their drawbacks. The hybrid algorithm, called GAEF (Genetic Algorithm with embedded filter), divides the feature selection process into two stages. In the first stage, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to pre-select features while in the second stage a <b>filter</b> <b>selector</b> is used to further identify a small feature subset for accurate sample classification. Three benchmark microarray datasets are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The experimental results suggest that this embedded two-layer feature selection strategy is able to improve the stability of the selection results as well as the sample classification accuracy. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{singular}} {{properties of}} hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) thin filmsdeposited by pulsed DC plasma enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} (PECVD), such as hardness and wear resistance, make it suitable as protective coating with low surface energy for self-assembly applications. In this paper, we designed fluorine-containing a-C:H (a-C:H:F) nanostructured surfaces and we characterized them for self-assembly applications. Sub-micron patterns were generated on silicon through laser lithography while contact angle measurements, nanotribometer, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the surface. a-C:H:F properties on lithographied surfaces such as hydrophobicity and friction were improved with the proper relative quantity of CH 4 and CHF 3 during deposition, resulting in ultrahydrophobic samples and low friction coefficients. Furthermore, these properties were enhanced along {{the direction of the}} lithographypatterns (in-plane anisotropy). Finally, self-assembly properties were tested with silicananoparticles, which were successfully assembled in linear arrays following the generated patterns. Among the main applications, these surfaces could be suitable as particle <b>filter</b> <b>selector</b> and cell colony substrate...|$|E

In this final project, designed three type of frequency <b>selector</b> <b>filter</b> : Low Pass Filter (LPF), High Pass Filter (HPF), and Band Pass Filter (BPF) with filter length (N) and cut-off frequency (Fc) variation. Filter coefficient is the final product of design stage. FDATool Matlab is used to help filter design and filter coefficient calculation. Then, this filter coefficient is implemented as digital filter in DSK TMS 320 C 6713 using CCS (Code Composer Studio) v. 3. 1. In CCS, it is also arranged some source code to initialize internal peripheral device on DSK TMS 320 C 6713 (Codec, McBSP, etc), initialize interrupt mode, and initialize memory mapping.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the issues of {{modeling}} economic time series and identifying the underlying latent components from both a time and a frequency domain standpoint. Thus, the crucial problem of component estimation is tackled by filter theory arguments. &# 13; &# 13; On the one hand, the band-limited frequency property of the trend-cycle, which ensues from the time domain component characterisation, leads {{to look at the}} relevant estimation issue as a low-pass filtering problem. On the other hand, the interpretation of the evolutive mechanism of seasonality as an amplitude modulation process, due to longer period components, suggests the adoption of a detection algorithm for estimation purposes. Moreover, the genuine seasonal pattern is obtained by passing the unmodulated seasonal component through a properly designed wave <b>selector</b> <b>filter</b> and the associated nuisance component enables to estimate the error term as well.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect on}} triple-quadrupole {{performance}} of applying an axial field, in an rf-only quadrupole collision cell operated at pressures sufficiently high that collisional focusing is operating, has been investigated. The advantages of such cells {{have been shown}} previously to include increased transmission and much improved resolution in fragment ion spectra relative {{to the performance of}} collision cells operating at lower gas pressures. The disadvantages of high-pressure collision cells all derive from the relatively long transit times for the ions, which can be long relative to characteristic times for scanning the first mass <b>filter</b> (precursor ion <b>selector)</b> or for switching its setting in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) cycles. The present work describes experiments on a high-pressure cell in which an axial field is created through use of conical rather than cylindrical or hyperbolic rods. In addition, results of computations of the electric fields within such a cell, and of ion trajectories through it, are presented. It is shown that application of axial fields of the order of 0. 1 V/cm can remove all hysteresis effects associated with the long ion transit times, and thus provide excellent performance in quantitation work using MRM, as well as in other scan modes. Furthermore, the advantages of collisional focusing in quadrupole collision cells are shown to be unimpaired by these low axial fields...|$|R
40|$|Detection in {{microfluidic}} systems requires {{highly sensitive}} analytical methods, {{because of the}} very short optical interaction length, which is usually {{in the range of}} 100 μm or shorter. Furthermore, the amounts of analytes in detection volumes are extremely small (femto- or attomoles). Thermal lens spectrometry and particularly thermal lens microscopy (TLM) appear as techniques of choice for detection in microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip systems, since they enable measurements of absorbance’s or absorbance changes as low as 10 - 7. In addition to ultra-high sensitivity, TLM offers high spatial resolution (≈ 1 μm) and sufficient temporal resolution (ms range), which is required for studies of processes in microfluidic systems. Recent development of TLM theory and instrumentation lead to experimental confirmations of the effects of microfluidic flows on the TLM signal, which affects the sensitivity. On the other hand, these observations have enabled optimization of TLM instruments [1]. As a result of these advancements, applications of TLM were extended from simple laminar flows [2], to highly complex systems such as Tylor-type flows, where TLM detection provided data for description of diffusion processes in n-octane/methanol binary liquid systems [3]. The major streamline of TLM applications was however focused on the development of vanguard analytical systems [4], which are needed in various fields of chemical analysis, including food safety and quality control, environmental monitoring as well as biomedical research and diagnostics. Such systems are used as sample screening systems (sample <b>filters</b> or <b>selectors)</b> when the information is needed quickly to make immediate decisions in relation to the analytical problem. They provide simplicity (e. g. little or no sample pre-treatment), low cost, rapid and reliable response, and frequently give just binary responses. However, their major weakness is low metrological quality of results. Therefore, uncertainties of up to 5 – 15 % are usually accepted as a toll for rapidity and simplicity, which are essential even though in contradiction with conventional analytical concepts. With the objective of developing new vanguard analytical systems, a relevant goal is to exploit the advantages offered by microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems on one hand, and TLM detection on the other. In such combinations, the FIA approach simplifies sample handling (e. g. volume measurements) and transport to the detector, while microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technology can facilitate and speed up processes including colorimetric reactions, antigen–antibody or enzyme–substrate interactions in bioanalytical systems, and even extraction and preconcentration steps by introducing continuous flow processing and micro unit operations in chemical analysis [2]. High sensitivity of TLM in such systems offers low limits of detection, which also contribute to low uncertainties that are typically below 10 %. An important advantage of microfluidic systems {{lies in the fact that}} small dimensions of such systems, which consist of capillaries and micro reactors with dimensions about 10 to 100 μm, significantly reduce the molecular diffusion time, which is inversely proportional to the second power of distance. For example, the time required for completion of an ELISA immunoassay for NGAL a biomarker of acute kidney failure was reduced from four hours to only 30 mins. [5, 6] when transferring the assay into a microfluidic system, while maintaining or even improving the sensitivity. Even more evident improvement in sample throughput (reduction of analysis time from 10 hours to 30 minutes) was achieved for determination of antibodies for human papilloma virus (anti L 1 HPV 16) in blood plasma, after immobilizing adequate pseudovirions as antigens on magnetic nanobeads [6]. Other health-related applications include detection of toxins, such as microcystin, or carcinogenic substances such as Cr(VI), which offers improved limits of detection as compared to spectrophotometry as well as sample throughput, which can reach 20 samples/min.
