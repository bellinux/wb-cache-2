While most of related experiments focus {{on the level of}} individuals, the elementary entities of the following analysis are dyads. The authors study behavioral motifs that are possible to observe at the dyadic level. The study shows significant differences between dyads that are more vs less engaged in the diffusion process.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the prevalence of <b>information</b> <b>epidemics</b> in the physics literature. The primary interest was {{to find out whether}} outliers observed on time series charts of literatures are due to <b>information</b> <b>epidemics,</b> whether these epidemics are widespread occurrences in physics, whether literatures showing such rapid growth arise mainly due to the influence of an important work and, if so, what characterizes these literatures. <b>Information</b> <b>epidemics</b> were defined as spurts of growth in the literature of a field that reflect a sudden excitement and increase in activity. It was hypothesized that <b>information</b> <b>epidemics</b> are common occurrences in the growth of the physics literature and that outliers observed during the growth of a field are caused by influential works that attract new workers into it and cause them to publish extensively. Growth spurts where <b>information</b> <b>epidemics</b> lead to a permanent change and {{the emergence of a new}} subspecialty are termed knowledge epidemics. The monthly number of abstracts indexed by each chapter of Physics Abstracts between 1977 and 1987 was plotted on a time series chart and an envelope of +/- 3 standard deviations was fitted around the regression line. All spikes that crossed the envelope were considered to be outliers and thus potential <b>information</b> <b>epidemics.</b> The abstracts contained in each outlier were identified in the Science Citation Index and analyzed for spread (corporate sources of authors) and impact (citations). Results show that <b>information</b> <b>epidemics</b> exist, but they are not widespread. Only four <b>information</b> <b>epidemics</b> were identified in the data. They are in chapters 2 (mathematical methods), 36 (clusters), 73 (heterostructures) and 74 (superconductivity). Only the growth in superconductivity can be considered to be a knowledge epidemic. All four arose due to new instrumentation and/or cheaper materials and are examples of puzzle-generating and enabling science. A second major result was that <b>information</b> <b>epidemics</b> are caused by as well as carried forward by groups of influential works. Third, increased activity in a given field is accompanied by an increase in conference papers. On the other hand, the journal literature of a given field is sufficient to represent the direction of literature, growth accurately. This work confirms and extends the epidemic model for the growth of literatures by demonstrating that not only does the contagion effect exist in physics but that there is also a catalyst effect present.

Specifically, we consider the following set-up: There is a physical information network where information spreads amongst people through conventional communication media (e. g., face-to-face communication, phone calls), and conjoint to this physical network, there are online social networks where information spreads via web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed, YouTube, etc. We quantify the size and the critical threshold of <b>information</b> <b>epidemics</b> in this conjoint social-physical network by assuming that information diffuses according to the SIR epidemic model. One interesting finding is that {{even if there is}} no percolation in the individual networks, percolation (i. e., <b>information</b> <b>epidemics)</b> can take place in the conjoint social-physical network. We also show, both analytically and experimentally, that the fraction of individuals who receive an item of information (started from an arbitrary node) is significantly larger in the conjoint social-physical network case, as compared to the case where the networks are disjoint. These findings reveal that conjoining the physical network with online social networks can have a dramatic impact on the speed and scale of information diffusion. Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Data {{delivery}} in opportunistic networks requires robustness and resiliency {{due to the}} mobility and probabilistic propagation channels caused by fading. Besides the 100 % data delivery, delivery with minimum delay, overhead, buffer consumption, and controlling unnecessary transmissions/replications are equally important. In this paper, we propose a data delivery solution for opportunistic networks. The solution comprises two main algorithms: store-carry-cooperative forward routing and <b>information</b> <b>epidemic</b> control. In the data forwarding, nodes proactively monitor and exploit the direct/two-hop cooperative forwarding opportunities and adaptively switch between the cooperative forwarding and reactive store-carry-forward routing. An information epidemics control algorithm, which provides earlier control signal distribution time and faster recovery rate, is also proposed. The susceptible-infected-recovered model is used to study {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed mechanism. Extensive network performance evaluation is conducted under a wide range of scenarios, which include fading environments, obstacle-constrained environments, and mobile social network environments. We show that: 1) the information epidemics control mechanism provides higher vaccination rate and recovery rate; 2) proactive replication incurs a number of unnecessary transmissions; 3) monitoring the vicinity and exploiting the opportunity shorten the data delivery delay; and 4) with the integrated solution, a robust data delivery is achieved and a substantial amount of unnecessary transmissions are well deterred.

40|$|We {{study the}} optimal control problem of maximizing {{the spread of}} an <b>information</b> <b>epidemic</b> on a social network. Information {{propagation}} is modeled as a susceptible-infected (SI) process, and the campaign budget is fixed. Direct recruitment and word-of-mouth incentives are the two strategies to accelerate information spreading (controls). We allow for multiple controls depending {{on the degree of}} the nodes/individuals. The solution optimally allocates the scarce resource over the campaign duration and the degree class groups. We study the impact of the degree distribution of the network on the controls and present results for Erdos-Renyi and scale-free networks. Results show that more resource is allocated to high-degree nodes in the case of scale-free networks, but medium-degree nodes in the case of Erdos-Renyi networks. We study the effects of various model parameters on the optimal strategy and quantify the improvement offered by the optimal strategy over the static and bang-bang control strategies. The effect of the time-varying spreading rate on the controls is explored as the interest level of the population in the subject of the campaign may change over time. We show the existence of a solution to the formulated optimal control problem, which has nonlinear isoperimetric constraints, using novel techniques that is general and can be used in other similar optimal control problems.

40|$|We {{model the}} spread of {{information}} in a homogeneously mixed population using the Maki Thompson rumor model. We formulate an optimal control problem, {{from the perspective of}} single campaigner, to maximize {{the spread of}} information when the campaign budget is fixed. Control signals, such as advertising in the mass media, attempt to convert ignorants and stiflers into spreaders. We show the existence of a solution to the optimal control problem when the campaigning incurs non-linear costs under the isoperimetric budget constraint. The solution employs Pontryagin's Minimum Principle and a modified version of forward backward sweep technique for numerical computation to accommodate the isoperimetric budget constraint. The techniques developed in this paper are general and can be applied to similar optimal control problems in other areas. We have allowed the spreading rate of the <b>information</b> <b>epidemic</b> to vary over the campaign duration to model practical situations when the interest level of the population in the subject of the campaign changes with time. The shape of the optimal control signal is studied for different model parameters and spreading rate profiles. We have also studied the variation of the optimal campaigning costs with respect to various model parameters. Results indicate that, for some model parameters, significant improvements can be achieved by the optimal strategy compared to the static control strategy. The static strategy respects the same budget constraint as the optimal strategy and has a constant value throughout the campaign horizon. This work finds application in election and social awareness campaigns, product advertising, movie promotion and crowdfunding campaigns. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|A major {{difference}} between an <b>information</b> <b>epidemic</b> and a biological epidemic {{is that in the}} case of a biological epidemic, the infection rate, and recovery rate are constant throughout the season. The interest level of the population during the emergency period changes as we approach the deadline (poll date or movie release date). We have modeled this by making the effective information spreading rate a time-varying quantity. Previous studies have ignored this characteristic of information epidemics. Another difference between epidemiological models and rumor spreading models is the removal mechanism. The spread of a rumor, unlike a disease, is usually an intentional act on the part of the transmitter and/or the adopter. A core element associated with a rumor is lack of verification, and some rumors that take time to identify, such as those involving consideration or confirmation, require active effort to discern between true and false and one needs to determine whether there is propagation or not. Because network information has always suffered from a lack of credibility, people cannot believe it immediately but are able to believe news from their friends and relatives more easily. Especially, rumors mostly come from a network and then spread in real life mouth to mouth. Many rumors come from a network and are hidden in the depths of one’s heart for a period of time before he/she becomes a spreader or stifler in real life. Being a model that is more general than the classical D-K model, the XYZ type needs to be studied to investigate the role of a latent period in rumor propagation. Using a compartmental approach based on a disease infection, we assume that an ignorant individual first goes through a latent period (and is said to become exposed or in the class W) after infection before becoming a spreader or stifler.|$|E

Here we describe a mathematical framework that allows us to calculate centrality in such networks and rank nodes accordingly, finding the ones that play the most central roles in the cohesion of the whole structure, bridging together different types of relations. These nodes are the most versatile in the multilayer network. We investigate empirical interconnected multilayer networks and show that the approaches based on aggregating—or neglecting—the multilayer structure lead to a wrong identification of the most versatile nodes, overestimating the importance of more marginal agents and demonstrating the power of versatility in predicting their role in diffusive and congestion processes...|$|R

We introduce and analyze new link-formation rules, called Social Climber (SC) attachment, that may be combined with arbitrary percolation models to produce a previously unstudied phase transition using the largest eigenvalue of the network adjacency matrix as the order parameter. This eigenvalue is significant in the analyses of many network-coupled dynamical systems in which it measures the quality of global coupling and is hence a natural measure of connectivity. We highlight the important self-organized properties of SC attachment and discuss implications for controlling dynamics on networks. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

The goal of this work is to present the new knowledge obtained from studying two artificial (experimental) and one natural (where people act emotionally) viral spread {{that took place in}} a closed virtual world. We propose an approach to modeling the behavior of online community exposed on external impulses as an epidemic process. The presented results base on online multilayer system observation, and show characteristic difference between setups, moreover, some important aspects of branching processes are presented. We run experiments, where we introduced viral to system and agents were able to propagate it. There were two modes of experiment: with or without award. Dynamic of spreading both of virals were described by epidemiological model and diffusion. Results of experiments were compared with real propagation process - spontaneous organization against ACTA. During general-national protest against new antypiracy multinational agreement - ACTA, criticized for its adverse effect on e. g. freedom of expression and privacy of communication, members of chosen community could send a viral such as Stop-ACTA transparent. In this scenario, we are able to capture behavior of society, when real emotions play a role, and compare results with artificiality conditioned experiments. Moreover, we could measure effect of emotions in viral propagation.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{diffusion}} behavior of real-time information. Typically, real-time information is valuable {{only for a}} limited time duration, and hence needs to be delivered before its "deadline.

With this insight, we consider a social network which consists of many cliques and information can spread quickly within a clique. Furthermore, information can also be shared through online social networks, such as Facebook, twitter, Youtube, etc. We characterize the diffusion of real-time information by studying the phase transition behaviors. Capitalizing on the theory of inhomogeneous random networks, we show that the social network has a critical threshold above which <b>information</b> <b>epidemics</b> are very likely to happen.

In this work, we initiate a study of information diffusion in a clustered multi-layer network model, where all constituent layers are random networks with high clustering.

In this paper, we aim to prevent the rumor diffusion which uses science education and official media coverage as control strategies. The publicity of science education and the advance of people’s cultural qualities encourage lurkers to protect themselves from the rumor and attempt to convert lurkers into stiflers. In an emergency situation, the authority plays the role of the manager, putting an announcement in the authoritative media to address rumors, inducting public opinions, and putting emergency under control, reducing the potential for secondary damage.
