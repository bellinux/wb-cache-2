Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact.

Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure.

This is a frigorific mixture which stabilizes its temperature automatically: that stable temperature was defined as 0 °F (−17.78 °C).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{historical}} {{case study}} of Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit’s creation of the first mercury thermometer with reliable scales is {{used as the basis}} for a lesson that is designed to provide students with a richer insight into the arbitrary nature of thermometer scales. The lesson attempts to move students beyond a level of understanding that is based simply on knowing how to read and use a thermometer, to a level of understanding that is based on knowing the very procedures and principles used to create thermometric scales. By studying the criteria that Fahrenheit used to create his scale, students should begin to obtain a richer insight into the arbitrary nature of thermometer scales in general. It is argued that it is insufficient to teach students how to read and use thermometers without giving them some notion of how a scale came into existence because no real insight is being provided into the nature of science. Students must be introduced to the actual procedures used by scientists if they are to understand how scientists have obtained their knowledge. The use of the historical example moves the teaching of science beyond the "cold " facts of science to the dynamic processes that are behind the facts. The extreme of teaching science as infallible is avoided by focusing on the idea that science is a human product that is subject to change. This paper does not advocate teaching science as a historical discipline, but rather argues that part of the science curriculum should include historical cases, such as the creation of the <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale,</b> in order to bring out the specific characteristics of science...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{requirements}} {{for taking a}} measurement of something. The first is a tool for taking a measurement. The second is scale for {{making sense of the}} numbers of the measurement. For example, a ruler is often used to measure short lengths. It is the tool for measurement. On the ruler are one or more number scales with equally spaced numbers. These numbers can be compared with numbers from any other ruler that is accurately set to the same scale. Measuring length is far simpler than measuring temperature. While there is evidence of tools for measuring length at various times in human history, tools and scales for measuring temperature do not appear until more recent human history. Early thermometers, called thermoscopes, first appear in the 1500 's. They were crude instruments that were not at all accurate. Most did not even have a number scale associated with them. This made them useless for most practical purposes. Gabriel Fahrenheit created the first accurate thermometer in 1714, and the <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> followed it in 1724. The thermometer s accuracy was based on its use of mercury, a silver colored substance that remains liquid over a wide range of temperatures but expands or contracts in a standard, predictable way with changes in temperature. To set the scale, Fahrenheit created the coldest temperature that he could. He mixed equal parts of ice, water, and salt, and then used this as the zero point, 0 degrees, of his scale. He intended to make 30 degrees the freezing point of water and 90 degrees the temperature of the human body, but he had to later revise these temperatures to be 32 degrees and 96 degrees. In {{the final version of the}} scale, the temperature of the human body became 98. 6 degrees. 19 th century thermoscop...|$|E
