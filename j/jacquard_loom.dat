5|$|The silk industry, however, did {{not gain}} any benefit from {{innovations}} in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades {{is a very}} delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress began {{to be made in}} the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's punched card loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph-Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary <b>Jacquard</b> <b>loom,</b> which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence. The punched cards of the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>loom</b> were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>loom.</b> The mechanism behind the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>loom</b> even allowed complex designs to be mass-produced.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Jacquard</b> <b>loom</b> was {{immediately}} denounced by workers, who accused it of causing unemployment, but soon {{it had become}} vital to the industry. The loom was declared public property in 1806, and Jacquard was rewarded with a pension and a royalty on each machine. In 1834 there were a total of 2885 Jacquard looms in Lyon alone. The Canut revolt in 1831 foreshadowed many of the larger worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution. The canuts occupied the city of Lyon, and would not relinquish it until a bloody repression by the army, led by Marshal Soult. A second revolt, similar to the first, took place in 1834.|$|E
5|$|The Industrial Revolution {{changed much}} of Europe’s silk industry. Due to {{innovations}} on spinning cotton, cotton became much cheaper to manufacture and therefore caused more expensive silk production to become less mainstream. New weaving technologies, however, increased {{the efficiency of}} production. Among these was the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>loom,</b> developed for silk embroidery. An epidemic of several silkworm diseases caused production to fall, especially in France, where the industry never recovered. In the 20th century Japan and China regained their earlier role in silk production, and China is now once again the world’s largest producer of silk. The rise of new fabrics such as nylon reduced the prevalence of silk throughout the world, and silk is now once again a rare luxury good, much less important than in its heyday.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jacquard</b> <b>looms,</b> {{although}} relatively {{common in}} the textile industry, are not as ubiquitous as dobby looms which are usually faster and much cheaper to operate. However, unlike <b>jacquard</b> <b>looms,</b> they are not capable of producing so many different weaves from one warp. Modern <b>jacquard</b> <b>looms</b> are controlled by computers {{in place of the}} original punched cards, and can have thousands of hooks.|$|R
50|$|The {{potential}} of <b>Jacquard’s</b> <b>loom</b> was immediately recognized. On April 12, 1805, Emperor Napoleon and Empress Josephine visited Lyon and viewed <b>Jacquard’s</b> new <b>loom.</b> On April 15, 1805, the emperor granted the patent for <b>Jacquard’s</b> <b>loom</b> {{to the city}} of Lyon. In return, Jacquard received a lifelong pension of 3,000 francs; furthermore, he received a royalty of 50 francs for each loom that was bought and used during the period from 1805 to 1811.|$|R

After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>loom.</b> For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. It employed ordinary base-10 fixed-point arithmetic.|$|E

The <b>Jacquard</b> <b>loom,</b> invented in 1801, was the most complex mechanical device of the early 19th century. It was controlled by a punch card system that was a forerunner of the system used in computers until the 1970s. With as many as thousands of independently movable shuttles, a <b>Jacquard</b> <b>loom</b> in operation must have appeared very impressive. If Sherrington had written a decade later, however, he might perhaps have chosen the flashing lights on the front panel of a computer as his metaphor instead.|$|E

50|$|By raising {{different}} (not just alternate) {{warp threads}} and using colored threads in the weft, the texture, color, design, and pattern can be varied to create varied and highly desirable fabrics.

50|$|In 1801, Jacquard {{exhibited}} {{his invention}} at the industrial exhibition in Paris; and in 1803 he {{was summoned to}} Paris and attached to the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers. A loom by Jacques de Vaucanson on display there suggested various improvements in his own, which he gradually perfected to its final state. Although his invention was fiercely opposed by the silk-weavers, who feared that its introduction, owing to the saving of labour, would deprive them of their livelihood, its advantages secured its general adoption, and by 1812 there were 11,000 <b>Jacquard</b> <b>looms</b> in use in France. This claim has been challenged: Initially few <b>Jacquard</b> <b>looms</b> were sold because of problems with the punched card mechanism.
