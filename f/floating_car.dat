25|$|An {{intelligent}} {{transportation system}} (ITS) {{is a system}} of hardware, software, and operators that allow better monitoring and control of traffic in order to optimize traffic flow. As the number of vehicle lane miles traveled per year continues to increase dramatically, and {{as the number of}} vehicle lane miles constructed per year has not been keeping pace, this has led to ever-increasing traffic congestion. As a cost-effective solution toward optimizing traffic, ITS presents a number of technologies to reduce congestion by monitoring traffic flows through the use of sensors and live cameras or analysing cellular phone data travelling in cars (<b>floating</b> <b>car</b> data) and in turn rerouting traffic as needed through the use of variable message boards (VMS), highway advisory radio, on board or off board navigation devices and other systems through integration of traffic data with navigation systems. Additionally, the roadway network has been increasingly fitted with additional communications and control infrastructure to allow traffic operations personnel to monitor weather conditions, for dispatching maintenance crews to perform snow or ice removal, as well as intelligent systems such as automated bridge de-icing systems which help to prevent accidents.|$|E
500|$|On 20 July 1973, the Australian {{government}} decided that Sydney {{was to be}} decommissioned. A refit planned to start {{late in the year}} was cancelled, and on 12 November 1973, Sydney was paid off and marked for disposal. The ship had sailed [...] since she was first commissioned: [...] as an aircraft carrier, and [...] as a fast troop transport. Several suggestions for disposal were made by various companies and agencies. The Geelong Regional Tourist Authority wanted the ship moored in Corio Bay for use as a maritime museum, convention centre, and floating casino. The Naval History Society of Australia suggested that the island superstructure be removed and located in The Rocks as a maritime museum, while the owners of the Sydney Opera House planned to use the ship as a <b>floating</b> <b>car</b> park. Tenders closed on 7 October 1975, and the ship was sold on 30 October for breaking up as scrap metal to the Dongkuk Steel Mill in Seoul, South Korea for A$673,516. Sydney was towed from her namesake city by a Japanese tugboat on 23 December 1975, leaving at 1300 hours.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Map {{matching}} is {{the most}} basic problem of integrating GPS with GIS. The efficiency and accuracy of matching algorithm directly influence the application of <b>float</b> <b>cars.</b> Regressive equation is established by the factors, such as perpendicular distance between the GPS point and the road segments, drive’s angle of <b>float</b> <b>car,</b> angles constructed by the post two points and the front two points. The probe-vehicle points are located one by one through the algorithm. The matching method can resolve both the flutter in parallel segment and the mistake match in intersections. The method also considers the disadvantage of the point to line and {{the advantage of the}} line to line, and it can guarantee the speed and accuracy...|$|R

30|$|Second, {{several studies}} [16, 17, 40] {{prove that the}} traffic flow {{condition}} can affect the traffic incident duration time; thus, how to integrate the increasing data on traffic flow condition is also a critical topic in future studies on traffic incident duration analysis and prediction.
