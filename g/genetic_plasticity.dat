40|$|Habitat {{fragment}}ation, i. e., fragment {{size and}} isolation, can differentially alter patterns of neutral and quantitative genetic variation, fitness and phenotypic plasticity of plant populations, but their effects have rarely been tested simultaneously. We assessed the combined effects of size and connectivity on {{these aspects of}} genetic and phenotypic variation in populations of Centaurea hyssopifolia, a narrow endemic gypsophile that previously showed performance differences associated with fragmentation. We grew 111 maternal families sampled from 10 populations that differed in their fragment size and connectivity in a common garden, and characterized quantitative <b>genetic</b> variation, phenotypic <b>plasticity</b> to drought for key functional traits, and plant survival, {{as a measure of}} population fitness. We also assessed neutral genetic variation within and among populations using eight microsatellite markers. Although C. hyssopifolia is a narrow endemic gypsophile, we found substantial neutral genetic variation and quantitative variation for key functional traits. The partition of genetic variance indicated that a higher proportion of variation was found within populations, which is also consistent with low population differentiation in molecular markers, functional traits and their plasticity. This, combined with the generally small effect of habitat fragmentation suggests that gene flow among populations is not restricted, despite large differences in fragment size and isolation. Importantly, population’s similarities in <b>genetic</b> variation and <b>plasticity</b> did not reflect the lower survival observed in isolated populations. Overall, our results indicate that, although the species consists of genetically variable populations able to express functional plasticity, such aspects of adaptive potential may not always reflect populations’ survival. Given the differential effects of habitat connectivity on functional traits, genetic variation and fitness, our study highlights the need to shift the focus of fragmentation studies to the mechanisms that regulate connectivity effects, and call for caution on the use of <b>genetic</b> variation and <b>plasticity</b> to forecast population performance...|$|R

5000|$|Exon {{shuffling}} {{was first}} introduced in 1978 when Walter Gilbert discovered {{that the existence of}} introns could {{play a major role in}} the evolution of proteins. It was noted that recombination within introns could help assort exons independently and that repetitive segments in the middle of introns could create hotspots for recombination to shuffle the exonic sequences. However, the presence of these introns in eukaryotes and absence in prokaryotes created a debate about the time in which these introns appeared. Two theories arose: the [...] "introns early" [...] theory and the [...] "introns late" [...] theory. Supporters of the [...] "introns early theory" [...] believed that introns and RNA splicing were the relics of the RNA world and therefore both prokaryotes and eukaryotes had introns in the beginning. However, prokaryotes eliminated their introns in order to obtain a higher efficiency, while eukaryotes retained the introns and the <b>genetic</b> <b>plasticity</b> of the ancestors. On the other hand, supporters of the [...] "introns late" [...] theory believe that prokaryotic genes resemble the ancestral genes and introns were inserted later in the genes of eukaryotes. What is clear now is that the eukaryotic exon-intron structure is not static, introns are continually inserted and removed from genes and the evolution of introns evolves parallel to exon shuffling. In order for exon shuffling to start to play a major role in protein evolution the appearance of spliceosomal introns had to take place. This was due to the fact that the self-splicing introns of the RNA world were unsuitable for exon-shuffling by intronic recombination. These introns had an essential function and therefore could not be recombined. Additionally there is strong evidence that spliceosomal introns evolved fairly recently and are restricted in their evolutionary distribution. Therefore, exon shuffling became a major role in the construction of younger proteins. Moreover, to define more precisely the time when exon shuffling became significant in eukaryotes, the evolutionary distribution of modular proteins that evolved through this mechanism were examined in different organisms (i.e., Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, etc.) These studies suggested that there was an inverse relationship between the genome compactness and the proportion of intronic and repetitive sequences. As well as the fact that exon shuffling became significant after metazoan radiation.|$|E

Here, we assessed {{the relative importance of}} additive genetic, environmental, and neutral genetic effects on latitudinal variation of thermal reaction norms of growth rate for populations of the damselfly, Ischnura elegans. At the interpopulation level, reaction norms differed primarily in elevation, suggesting that shorter growth seasons in both high latitude and bivoltine populations select for faster growth rates regardless of environmental temperature. Within populations, heritable variation for growth rate, as well as broad sense (family) <b>genetic</b> variance for <b>plasticity</b> suggests that reaction norms are not constrained. However, partitioning of genetic variance into additive (VA) and non-additive effects revealed no significant additive (sire) <b>genetic</b> variance for <b>plasticity,</b> indicating that reaction norms are not free to evolve.

40|$|Background: Evolutionary {{theory has}} contributed with physiological, {{psychological}} and behavioral explanations to the comprehension {{and treatment of}} eating disorders (ED). The aim of this review is to analyze the relationship between ED and the attachment theory and natural selection based hypotheses (famine flight, reproductive suppression and intrasexual competition). Insecure attachment is characteristic of ED and significantly interferes in the individuation developmental process. Maternal attachment is usually ambivalent; mainly avoidant in anorexics and anxious in bulimics. Anorexic syndrome evokes ancestral adaptive mechanisms to face food scarcity, status achievement and threat of group exclusion. Suppression of reproductive capacity in anorexics, favored by family dynamics, represents a self-sacrifice to obtain the benefit of its members through genetic altruism. Feminine intrasexual competence is related to nubile features {{in order to attract}} and retain high quality and long-term partners.

A study in Madagascar showed that recombinant cVDPVs had been co-circulating in a small population of children with many different HEV-C types.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Ectothermic animals exhibit two {{distinct}} kinds of plasticity {{in response to}} temperature: Thermal performance curves (TPCs), in which an individual’s performance (e. g., growth rate) varies in response to current temperature; and developmental reaction norms (DRNs), in which the trait value (e. g., adult body size or development time) of a genotype varies in response to developmental temperatures experienced over some time period during development. Here we explore patterns of genetic variation and selection on TPCs and DRNs for insects in fluctuating thermal environments. First, we describe two statistical methods for partitioning total genetic variation into variation for overall size or performance and variation in plasticity, and apply these methods to available datasets on DRNs and TPCs for insect growth and size. Our results indicate that for the datasets we considered, <b>genetic</b> variation in <b>plasticity</b> represents {{a larger proportion of}} the total genetic variation in TPCs compared to DRNs, for the available datasets.

40|$|The {{ability of}} populations {{to adapt to}} {{environmental}} change and the spatial scale at which this adaptation occurs are fundamentally important issues in evolutionary biology, and ones that may benefit greatly {{from the study of}} genetic variability in reaction norms, which represent the plasticity of phenotypic traits across an environmental gradient. Therefore variable reaction norms can reflect genetic differences in the ability of individuals, families, populations, and species to respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental change. Fishes are ideal organisms in which to study plasticity because of their remarkable intraspecific morphological, physiological, behavioural, and life history variation. Here, we review studies demonstrating genetic variability in reaction norms in fishes. <b>Genetic</b> variability in <b>plasticity</b> among full- and half-sib families suggests potential for some populations to develop an adaptive norm of reaction (recalling that plasticity need not be adaptive). Reaction norm variability among populations suggests that adaptive genetic divergence can occur rapidly when selection pressures are strong and that the spatial scale of adaptation is much smaller than previously believed for some species with high dispersal capabilities. These studies demonstrate the potential of using reaction norms to study the evolution of novel phenotypes and the influence of temporal environmental variability and gene flow on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, which can then be used to predict how populations will respond to directional environmental change.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Genetic</b> <b>plasticity</b> may be {{understood}} as {{the ability of a}} functional gene network to tolerate alterations in its components or structure. Usually, the studies involving gene modifications {{in the course of the}} evolution are concerned to nucleotide sequence alterations in closely related species. However, the analysis of large scale data about the distribution of gene families in non-exclusively closely related species can provide insights on how plastic or how conserved a given gene family is. Here, we analyze the abundance and diversity of all Eukaryotic Clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG) present in STRING database, resulting in a total of 4, 850 KOGs. This dataset comprises 481, 421 proteins distributed among 55 eukaryotes. Results We propose an index to evaluate the evolutionary plasticity and conservation of an orthologous group based on its abundance and diversity across eukaryotes. To further KOG plasticity analysis, we estimate the evolutionary distance average among all proteins which take part in the same orthologous group. As a result, we found a strong correlation between the evolutionary distance average and the proposed evolutionary plasticity index. Additionally, we found low evolutionary plasticity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes associated with inviability and Mus musculus genes associated with early lethality. At last, we plot the evolutionary plasticity value in different gene networks from yeast and humans. As a result, it was possible to discriminate among higher and lower plastic areas of the gene networks analyzed. Conclusions The distribution of gene families brings valuable information on evolutionary plasticity which might be related with <b>genetic</b> <b>plasticity.</b> Accordingly, it is possible to discriminate among conserved and plastic orthologous groups by evaluating their abundance and diversity across eukaryotes.

Important findings: In our study, the investment in reproduction increased with plant size. Plant growth and the relative importance of reproductive investment decreased in populations originating from higher altitudes compared to populations originating from lower altitudes. The changes in reproductive investment were mainly explained by differences in plant size.
