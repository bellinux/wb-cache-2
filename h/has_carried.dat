5|$|Bus. M-28 was {{originally}} {{a section of}} M-28 before the latter was realigned in the late 1930s. The highway carried the M-28A designation before it was redesignated as Bus. M-28 in 1950. The trunkline was partially turned back to local control in 1953, and the business loop designation was removed at that time. The section of the roadway in downtown Newberry <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> several different designations {{in addition to the}} original M-28.|$|E
5|$|Mahoning Creek has a {{watershed}} association, {{which is known}} as the Mahoning Creek Watershed Association. It is one of two active watershed associations in Montour County.

5|$|NY185 was {{assigned}} on April4, 2008, as a signed replacement for New York State Route910L, an unsigned reference route. It {{is the third}} signed designation that Bridge Road <b>has</b> <b>carried,</b> preceded by New York State Route347 (during the early 1930s) and NY8 (1930s to the 1960s). NY185 originally connected to the Champlain Bridge on its east end; however, that structure was closed and demolished in late 2009. Its replacement opened to traffic in November 2011.|$|E

5|$|A {{project to}} convert the former southbound-only Richards Boulevard access {{just south of the}} American River to a {{standard}} signalized intersection was completed in August 2007; this improves access to existing and future development in the area, including redevelopment of a former rail yard, while slowing northbound traffic heading for the bridge and freeway. Another project converting Freeport Boulevard and 21st Street south of Broadway into two-way streets was also completed. 21st Street <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> northbound traffic since 1974, when Caltrans took it over. This will calm traffic while improving the intersection {{at the south end of}} the former one-way pair, which the RT Light Rail now crosses 21st Street just to the north of. In addition, the three blocks of F Street that carried southbound SR 160 from 12th Street to 15th Street have been calmed by the addition of a roundabout at 13th Street.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Imagery {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs. This <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films. Paterson cites Godfrey Reggio's and Philip Glass's film Koyaanisqatsi as a primary influence to their concert imagery.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, the {{trunkline}} {{running through}} Boyne City was originally labeled M-57. In 1927, the entire highway was renumbered, and since this change, the trunkline <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> the M-75 moniker. The M-75 designation was left unaltered when US27 between Gaylord and Indian River was {{converted to a}} freeway; this freeway was redesignated as I-75 in 1962. Some states, such as California, do not allow two highways in their state to carry the same highway number, {{which is not the}} case in Michigan. A reconstruction project in 1966 bypassed some sharp curves in the roadway and straightened sections between Boyne City and Walloon Lake. As of 2008, the highway remains unaltered since the reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|The Commission has, and {{continues}} to, also {{provide support for}} war graves outside its traditional mandate. In 1982, the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission's assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the Falkland Islands for those killed during the Falklands War. Although these cemeteries are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries, the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities for them. Since 2005, the Commission <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> out similar management duties {{on behalf of the}} British Ministry of Defence for cemeteries and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the Second Boer War. In 2003, Veterans Affairs Canada employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility. As of 2011, the Commission conducts a twelve-year cyclical inspection programme of Canadian veterans' markers installed {{at the expense of the}} Government of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The M-64 {{designation}} {{was used}} on two other separate highways {{before it was}} used for the current highway. The first was {{at the other end of}} the state near the Ohio state line, and the second was on the Keweenaw Peninsula near Eagle Harbor. The current highway <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> the M-64 moniker since 1930, when it was assigned along two disconnected highways. These two parts were joined into a single corridor soon after. M-64 was one of the last highways in the state of Michigan to be paved in 1961. In the early part of the 21st century, the state replaced the bridge over the Ontonagon River and shifted the highway's northern terminus.|$|E

5|$|The highway was {{constructed}} from1926to1935. Route31 <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> two different {{numbers in the}} past. It was known as Route30 between1927and1953, when it was renumbered to Route69 to avoid conflicting with US30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number69. There were plans made in the late1960s and early1970s to build a freeway in the Route31 corridor that would begin in the Trenton area and extend {{as far north as}} Interstate84 (I-84) in Port Jervis, New York; however, it was canceled in the mid-1970s due to opposition from area residents and environmental and financial constraints. In recent years, the portion of Route31 between Flemington and Clinton has been widened to four lanes. In addition, there was a failed project to build a bypass of Flemington that would have also eliminated the Flemington Circle.|$|E
5|$|The manga series Hibiki's Magic {{is written}} by Jun Maeda and {{illustrated}} by Rei Izumi. As stated {{at the back of}} the first volume, Maeda first conceived Hibiki's Magic as a short story he wrote as a student, and the story contains an unspecified theme that he <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> through a lot of stories since. In 2003, he wanted to collaborate with Izumi, one of his favorite artists, and remembered his earlier concept that would become Hibiki's Magic. After Izumi drew some early character designs for Hibiki, Maeda wanted to continue the story and start a manga with Izumi as the artist.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{have studied the}} {{surviving}} Pipe rolls, using them {{as the basis for}} study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research. Historian David Carpenter <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|Abraham {{carried on}} the {{preservation}} effort begun by Elizabeth Moreton until he and his son transferred ownership to the National Trust in 1938. The Dale family continued to farm the estate until 1945, and acted as caretakers for the National Trust until 1955. The Trust <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> out extensive repair and restoration work, including re-roofing; restoration of elements of the hall's original appearance, and removal of some painted patterning added during earlier restoration work. The familiar black-and-white colour scheme is a fashion introduced by the Victorians; originally the oak beams would have been untreated and left to age naturally to a silver colour, and the rendered infill painted ochre. In 1977 {{it was discovered that}} the stone slabs {{on the roof of the}} south range had become insecure, and work began on a six-phase programme of structural repairs, the final phase of which was completed in 1992. Replacement timbers have been left in their natural state.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, BINA Istra (the {{operator}} of the motorway) collected €38million in revenues while its expenditure reached €230million. In {{the first half}} of 2011, however, BINA Istra reported 65.8millionkuna (€8.9million) of income in {{the first half of}} 2011, without VAT. This income represented a 30.8percent increase compared to the same period in the previous year. (The figure includes income from the entire Istrian Y system, i.e., both the A8 and A9 motorways.) Most of this increase is attributed to the introduction of a closed toll system along the routes, replacing an open toll system in which a toll was charged only at the Mirna Bridge (along the A9 motorway) and the Učka Tunnel. In 1999, the Croatian government negotiated amendments to the BINA Istra concession contract. These amendments allow the government to determine tolls along the A8 and A9 motorways, and the government decided to eliminate tolls on traffic flowing along the two-lane sections of the routes; to compensate for this loss of income, the government subsidizes BINA Istra– for instance, in 2012 it is expected to receive a 165millionkuna (million) subsidy. By the end of 2010, the subsidy paid to BINA Istra reached a total of 1.3billionkuna (million); at the time, it was estimated that a further sum of 1.9billionkuna (million) may be paid in annual subsidies between 2011 and 2027, when the concession contract expires. BINA Istra estimates the total investment value of the construction it <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> out or planned on the A8 and A9 routes at one billion euros.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle {{to save the}} planet, several Halos are able to escape, their own AIs {{enacting}} failsafe protocols. Bornstellar manages to escape {{with the help of}} a young council member and a guard. They escape through the same portal as the Halos but lose power and drift for an unknown amount of time before being recovered by Lifeworkers. The portal <b>has</b> <b>carried</b> them to the Ark, the massive structure that serves as a construction site for Halos and also a haven for the Librarian's work. The trio are healed, and Bornstellar meets the Librarian, which brings up conflicting thoughts and feelings, due to his imprint from the Didact. She informs him that the Master Builder executed the Didact soon after Bornstellar was sent back to his family. With the news that the Didact is gone, Bornstellar resolves to take his place. The book ends with a narration from the Didact/Bornstellar, revealing that the escaped prisoner was the last Precursor, known as Timeless One. Through a conversation the Didact had long ago, it is learned that the Precursors created the Forerunners, only for the Forerunners to rise up and eradicate the Precursors, except this one, who now seeks revenge.|$|E
